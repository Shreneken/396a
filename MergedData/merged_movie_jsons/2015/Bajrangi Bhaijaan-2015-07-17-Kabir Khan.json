            "content": "After seven years of Mehreen Jabbar's Pakistani film titled RAMCHAND PAKISTANI (2008), revolving around an 8 year old kid and his father unintentionally crossing the border into Indian Territory, we now have our own BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN made on a similar kind of subject having an adorable kid girl from Pakistan lost in India, to be rescued by arguably the most popular Khan icon in India, Salman Khan.As a preview article written a day before the release, I mentioned five potential USP's of BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN other than its plot or Salman Khan as: 1. The Director \u2013 Kabir Khan 2. Harshali Malhotra (the cute little girl) 3. Journey to Pakistan (reminding you of Tara Singh of 'Gadar: Ek Prem Katha') 4. Nawazuddin Siddiqui (repeating his solid support as seen in 'Kick') 5. And above all Lord Hanuman (as the divine saviour helping in the heartfelt task invisibly)Luckily as speculated, BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN intelligently exploits the above five points only as its major strength and delivers a largely entertaining film with a decent first and an electrifying second half ending on an exaggerated yet emotionally charged note leaving a positive impact on the viewers. And all this, without any typical item number, specially focused love affair, romantic songs or overdose of action quite surprisingly.To give you the details how the above mentioned USPs are well incorporated in the film, it begins with the first 10-12 minutes completely focusing on the adorable little girl, who straight away wins your heart with her innocent looks, smile and effortless expressions.With Salman Khan being introduced as a true Bajrang Bali devotee, the 'selfie song' raises the spirits superbly. And then the film keeps progressing till the next hour as a simple but sweetly executed social family drama with all clean entertainment focusing on the cute little girl and differently innocent, immensely likable Salman Khan that was missing in all his recent blockbusters since WANTED. So the only minus to be mentioned in the first half remains a couple of average songs, particularly the 'Chicken' track that surely could have been edited out to keep the pace going. Post interval, where the film offers much more entertainment though its various sequence in Pakistan, you lost the count of creative liberties taken right from the border crossing sequence to the 'larger-than-life' climax, portrayed with all good intentions. Nawazuddin once again makes his much awaited entry with a bang, enacting a lifted sequence from a real life viral-video of a Pakistani reporter (having a similar name). Nawazuddin simply takes over from here till the end, winning hearts with his fabulous act of a kind human helping Salman and the kid girl without any hidden motives.If watched with a realistic mindset, the film does have many 'impossible situations' depicting the relationship between the neighboring countries and the way Pakistan's police/military deals with the sensitive issue of catching a spy. But after few minutes of enjoying all the pleasant insertions post interval, one begins to think that 'to hell with whether this is possible or not, lets enjoy the proceedings on screen with the trio (Salman-the Girl & Nawazuddin). As a director Kabir Khan brilliantly rediscovers himself from being an experimental director of KABUL EXPRESS to an entertaining commercial film-maker following the Raj Kumar Hirani school of thought, wherein everyone in the script has a golden heart. He extracts an extremely lovable performance from the charming Harshali Malhotra and also thankfully presents Salman Khan as the same old, big hearted, honest, childlike person hugely loved by one and all for their various reasons. In other words Salman actually acts this time with an author backed role performed well, answering all questions raised upon his recent performances strongly. On the other hand, Harshali is a real delight to watch with all perfect emotions and her scenes together with Salman remain the highlight of the film throughout, right till the last frame.So here we have a film that can easily be called as the best among Salman Khan starrers in the last decade with an equally important message for the 'not so friendly' nations along with many well- written & brightly enacted supporting acts coming from Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Om Puri, Sharat Saxena, Rajesh Sharma and more. However as far as the leading heroine of the film is concerned, Kareena Kapoor needs to be applauded for accepting this kind of (unimportant) miniscule role and making the best of her limited scenes given like a true professional.Beautifully shot capturing the breathtaking locations of Kashmir, BB has an impressive background score by Julius Packiam and enjoyable dialogues written by Kabir Khan & Kausan Munir together, that stay away from any standard jingoism or clich\u00e9d preaching. Also as a surprising fact, the film's story has been written by V. Vijayendra Prasad, the story writer of BAHUBALI, setting Indian box office on fire since the last Friday. Among the downers, we have its lackluster music unexpectedly composed by Pritam returning from a long break. In fact even the hugely famous qawaali originally sung by Sabri Brothers doesn't turn out to be that impressive in Adnan Sami's voice who is known to sing in much lower scales.In all, BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN is a thoroughly entertaining film with its five USPs intact along with a clear message for the people of both India and Pakistan. Yes, it becomes too filmy with huge cinematic liberties taken in its border crossing sequences and the epic climax that is simply not possible in the actual scenario. But at times, such films seriously make you wish that may all the cinematic liberties taken on the screen somehow become true and we learn to forget our ugly past for the benefits of the generations to come at the earliest.",

            "content": "I went to see BB on the day of release with my wife and 17 year old son. I'm not Indian or Pakistani, but white British, so it was fun sat in a cinema full of Pakistanis, to watch a film that could have painted Pakistani in a negative light.Judging by the murmuring I could her there did seem to be some people during the interval that were not too impressed with the film - slow, boring, blah, blah - but by the end I think everyone left happy.From a white British guys perspective I thought it was a terrific film, and so did my wife and son. Great story, interesting characters, a ridiculously cute kid who stole the show without saying very much, excellent music, and some scenery that took your breath away.I thought Salman Kahn was great, much more three dimensional than I was expecting. Kareena Kapoor provided a massive dose of eye-candy and played her part well too, although it would have been nice for that part to have been developed more.But for me the star of the show - other than Harshaali Malthotra, the little girl - was definitely Nawazuddin Siddiqui. He is one of the most mesmerising actors I've ever seen. He could read the label of a sauce bottle and have everyone transfixed.In typical Bollywood style the first half was your typical setting-the-scene, which I thought was done very well, and it kept me interested throughout, but after the interval, as soon as Nawazuddin Siddiqui made his appearance, the film took off and didn't let-up until the end.All-in-all a thoroughly enjoyable film for all the family.",

            "content": "Kabir Khan triumphs with a yet another winner with 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan'. Khan delivers a film thats heartwarming, emotional & extremely entertaining. And Salman is exceptional, delivering his finest performance to date in the title role. 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' Synopsis: A young mute girl from Pakistan loses herself in India with no way to head back. A devoted man with a magnanimous spirit undertakes the task to get her back to her motherland and unite her with her family.'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is a heartwarming tale about love & unity. Though a subtle father-daughter story at heart, the film is also an effective commentary on the India-Pakistan conflict/relationship, that exists even today. The narrative beautifully makes space for humour, strong emotions & also poignant drama. While the first-hour, set in India warms up, with defining its characters & shifting between songs, its the second-hour that takes 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' to the epitome. The story shifts to Pakistan & the series of events that follow with its endearing protagonist & the child, are undeniably engaging & moving. And the climax, though slightly melodramatic, that too leaves an impact. Khan, V. Vijayendra Prasad, Parveez Shaikh & Asad Hussai's Screenplay is excellent. It very believably blends many emotions & also courageously comments on the long-lasting topic of India-Pakistan. But its done effectively. Barring the slightly under-whelming climax, the Writing is consistently engaging otherwise. Khan's Direction is top-notch. He has handled the film with skill. Aseem Mishra's Cinematography captures the Stunning Locales of Kashmir, superbly. Editing is mostly crisp, although the film runs for over a 155-minutes. Music by Various Artists is lovely. Art & Costume Design are satisfactory. Performance-Wise: Salman is at his best here. As Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi aka Bajrangi Bhaijaan, the Superstar enacts the god-loving, clean-hearted soul, with excellence. He's restrained, affecting & absolutely lovable, proving once again that he's much more than a box-offer thunder. He's the soul of 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan'. Child Artiste Harshaali Malhotra is adorable. Her on-screen chemistry with Salman, melts your heart. Kareena Kapoor Khan is charming in a brief, yet substantial role. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is top-notch, yet again! He brings the house down with his brilliant comic-timing & walks away with some of the film's best moments, as well. Om Puri shines in a cameo. Sharat Saxena is good. Others lend fair support.On the whole, 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' has its heart & soul at the right place. It wins you over completely, with its heart touching story. Strongly Recommended!",

Spirituality always tries to preach to unconditional love is the only solution for happiness. This movie is a social movie showing such love between people who do not share anything common instead their belief systems, customs are quite opposite.This is a latest example of how people get united and support the human values. News Reporters, Police, Army, public every one believes in a man who talks unbelievable truth but due to his honesty is shown via his face.Salman Khan lived his character along with the kiddo. Fantastic acting by all actors.",

            "content": "Every now and then comes a film that defines a decade. In the Hindi film industry such films as Munna Bhai, 3 Idiots, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,ZNMD are such films that define this decade as outstanding path breaking cinema that will be remembered forever. Now its time to add Bajrangi Bhaijaan to that list.Yes the film is that amazing. Its Kabir Khan's best and one of Salman Khan's best films ever. The film stuns you with its positive message of peace between Indo- Pak, but the film isn't preachy or in your face at all. It actual tugs at your heart strings. BB is a film in the Raj Kumar Hirani Mould, a film with a heart, a message, a great script and a film that you wont forget once you leave the cinema halls.And to answer another question, no this is not a regular masala potboiler from SK,its way beyond that, its a game changer, its 2015's best film to date.The films story is a simplistic tale of a mute 6 year old girl who accidentally jumped of a train that had her mother on board which was going back to Pakistan, therefore leaving her lost in India .She then finds a man named Pawan, who is a noble hearted Bajrangi devotee. He after many difficulties swears to take this girl back to Pak. Does the girl get back to Pak to her family,and if so how is what forms the crux of the film.Acting wise Salman Khan is a revelation, after many years SK has stepped out of the Mass acting mold and played a different role which required expert acting. His simplicity and honesty in the character of Pawan wins you over. He rules the film start to finish, and don't be surprised if sweeps the award shows this season he deserves all the awards and accolades for his role. The little girl in the film Harshali Malhotra is the most cutest,adorable girl i have ever seen in any film, she is the heart of film. Nawaz again steals the show, he has an amazing comic act. Kareena Kapoor is beautiful, and first rate in her limited role.Overall this SK film is path breaking, its film where the story and script came first. A story of patriotism,of true emotions, of love, and ...Peace.This is a must watch for all Indians and Pakistans, because a film like this can end, a border war almost lasting 100 years. Yes BB is that powerful but simple that every Indo- Pak can understand the message.Kabir Khan who must have been inspired by Raju Hirani's style of movie making, deserves a standing ovation, get ready for the award shows sir because you will be seeing many trophies soon.Finally the films climax is such that if you don't cry, then you must not be human.5/5* or 10/10",

(I am talking about the tears of joy). I have enjoyed previous Salman Khan movies because of their raw entertainment factor but that's just it. In more simple words they were mostly 'time pass' flicks to take your head off things. Bajrangi Bhaijaan on the other hand highlights a scenario where you just want to give most characters a tight hug as it make them seem so real! Salman Khan deserves much more attention for this film than what he has received. A splendid performance by him unlike any other movie he has done. The real winner her is Harshaali Malhotra with an impressive work. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as always was extremely natural. A righteously made movie with an important moral message for both countries and their rivalry. All in all, Kabir Khan have made up for past presentations with Bajrangi Bhaijan and it is a must watch! Salman Khan's journey to get Munni home will create wonders in your heart. It is one of those movies which I would buy on bluray and add it to my collection.I give it a 10/10 not because of any biases but because it literally gave me shivers and touched my heart.",

She is so cite, so expressive. her eyes n actions speak a lot in d movie. Navazuddin Siddiqui is as wonderful as usual . . he is d soul of the second half. kareena Kapoor have no scope which is understandable in a Salman han movie . but whatever role she have, she has given her 100 percent. and Now to the main Man. .

This could be a new beginning for a successful director to becoming a good director. He has been helped a great deal by Vijayendra Prasad's story and a capable production design team of Rajnish Hedao. Vijayendra' a household name in South market, has brought an original story with a lot of room to attract cine- goers. Rajnish's team, well known for PK, Rockstar and Three Idiots, already has vast experience of multi- location shoots.

How mistaken I was.Bajrangi Bhaijaan is a serious story, depicted in a very touching way. Everything about it is fantastic from the sets, the acting, cinematography, dialogues, you name it.Salman infuses healthy doses of subtle humour throughout. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is class as the small time news reporter and Harshali is the sweetest little girl one could ever imagine.At the end of the movie, one gets the overwhelming feeling that yes indeed the people of India and the people of Pakistan do have the power to overcome all the hurdles and obstacles created by our respective governments and politicians.Movie making is a business at the end of the day and the primary objective of the producers was to make a film that would generate profits. This movie in fact conveyed a great message and is deservedly an absolute must watch. I go so far to suggest that it be compulsory viewing for all youngsters in India and in Pakistan.

But to you dear reader I'll say GO WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS! It will not disappoint! And more importantly go with your heart - that is all you need for this 2.5 hours long film to become one of the best you've seen in years. It's just one of those movies with such heart-tugging moments and the highlight - the bond between Pawan (Salman) and Shahida (Harshali) - which is such a delight to see that you forget all about plot, logic, direction - not to say that the movie lacks that. The perfection in execution is definitely there, especially in the second-half. I watched it in the AVX theatre with at least 500 others and from the sound of it at least 75% of them regardless of age or gender were crying from the intermission onwards - sometimes because it was sad and other times because the screenplay was just so pure and unfiltered that it just made these happy tears bubble up inside of you.There is a certain level of comedy throughout and definitely some deep witty one-liners. My favourite was from Nawazuddin Sidduiqi (who played his role to perfection) who pointing at the current state of the media and their polarization of India and Pakistan proclaimed that \"Hatred sells. Mohabbat doesn't.\" The movie has depth, a message, and the cuteness overload that is Harshali Malhotra. It also has a relationship and emotions so simple yet so extraordinary that they make a hero out of a common man. :)",

Salman Khan, aka Bajrangi will blow you away in this smoothly paced and highly entertaining + engaging drama - with Shahida by his side.

            "content": "I have to admit, I went to watch Bajrangi Bhaijan (BB) with a lot of prejudice. I am not a big fan of Kabir Khan, have not liked Kareena Kapoor other than Jab We Met. I am not a Salman Fan either nd despite that I watch all his Eid releases on first day. I had four hypotheses before going to the theater and I had made an outline of the review I was going to write. Generally it's a set template for a Kabir Khan Salman Khan film. Nonetheless, my predetermined conclusion of BB being a mediocre film was proved wrong.1. Kareena Kapoor will be unnecessary in the film \u2013 Proved True. Not just Kareena, the entire subplot of Salman's love interest was completely unnecessary. In the first half, a good twenty minutes were spent on establishing the love story between Salman and Kareena. As the film lasted 163 minutes, cutting fifteen of those minutes and a song could have made the edit sharper and more gripping. The role could have been played by any actress. Salman could have been a married or single man in the film. It would not have had any impact on the final outcome.2. Nawazuddin Siddiui will be brilliant \u2013 Proved True. And boy he was fantastic. His intro sequence is a straight lift from Pakistan's very own Chaand Nawab and as it turns out, his character is actually called Chaand Nawab. Nawaz comes on screen only in the second half of BB and took the burden of carrying the film on his gifted shoulders. His chemistry with Salman is something seen very rarely between male leads of a film. Immaculate comic timing, perfect body language and expressive eyes. I am not gonna say more but if someone is selling T-shirts saying \"I heart Nawazudding Siddiqui\", let me know.3. Salman Khan will not be able to emote as per the requirements of the role \u2013 50/50. Salman as an actor has limitations, we all know that. Have those precincts ever made any difference? No. Salman is not a method actor. He will never be Naseer or Aamir. I watch Salman Khan films to see whether he is better than his other films or not. In BB, the actor has put in a genuine effort to emote and get into the skin of the role. This is one of the best performances of bhai's career, if not the best. His demeanor as a simple villager is to the point, his performance towards the latter half of the film is strong. He has a very powerful scene in the first half at a brothel, where he struggled to convince on the emotions, but still did better than his other films. BB has no over the top action, or dances, or shirtless sequences or romantic songs. It is heavily dependent on the lead actor. Funnily, despite all the limitations Salman Khan has, I was unable to picture any other actor playing Bajrangi. BB did not need an actor. BB needed Salman Khan the star to deliver and he has delivered. The good thing is that Salman is not the only super star in the film. The other one is Harshaali Malhotra, the child actor playing Shahida. Super cute, super charming and super convincing. It was a challenging role with no dialogs and the kid really showed her competence despite presence of some big names in the film. Darsheel Safari level stuff.Kabir Khan is just a glorified, slightly more intelligent Farah Khan \u2013 Proved Wrong. This is where I was completely wrong. The problem I have had with other KK films is that they were on a pretense of being intelligent and logical social dramas, which in reality they were not be it New York or Ek Tha Tiger. They were more intelligent than Farah Khan, Prabhudeva and Rohit Shetty films, hence made the masses (read Salman Khan fans) feel that they are watching intellectual cinema. This strategy resulted in big commercial success for KK. That still does not mean that those films were good films. BB is different. KK has been vigilant about sense and aesthetics more than just looking into a mass appeal. This could be a new beginning for a successful director to becoming a good director. He has been helped a great deal by Vijayendra Prasad's story and a capable production design team of Rajnish Hedao. Vijayendra' a household name in South market, has brought an original story with a lot of room to attract cine- goers. Rajnish's team, well known for PK, Rockstar and Three Idiots, already has vast experience of multi- location shoots. BB spreads across various cities and weathers and production design and art direction is always tough for such films. Credit to KK for utilizing the resources at hand in the best possible way.Lastly, he has done remarkably well in treatment of the screenplay. He knew when to take creative liberty in best interest of the film (Armies of both countries being lenient on borders etc.) and knew when to make things look realistic (tunnels at the border, Samjhota express, Shahid Afridi etc.). He could have done better with the duration of the climax though by eliminating some unnecessary emotional manipulations.BB is not an Anti-Pakistan film. The filmmakers have tried being reasonable as much as they could without ruining the story requirements. They have shown good and bad on both the sides. The film also touched upon religious divide and there it has shown Muslims as the more accommodating of the two religions. What it does communicate strongly is the secular message of modern India.It's a possibility that it will be a lesser commercial success than Kick or Ek Tha Tiger. BB is not a typical Salman Khan film. BB is not a typical Kabir Khan film. BB is a good film.",

It is unique in nature from other Salman Khan Eid releases and is much more special in terms of storytelling and performances. Charisma is always there in Salman films due to his persona, however, this movie brings a lot more to the table, most notably the little girl Harshali, who has done a great job without uttering a single word. Barfi? Black? I have forgotten those with the performance this 6 year old has given, and I know she deserves a Best Actor award for this movie Filmfare/Oscar just name the award, she is worthy of it and so is the beautiful movie. Salman, Kareena, Nawazuddin, and all other supporting actors done a good job. Kabir Khan has done a marvelous job doing justice to the movie. Harshali is the star of the movie and that is not an easy thing to do when one shares screen space with someone of Salman Khan's stature.Watch it alone, or with your friends and family, you won't be disappointed. 10/10",

            "content": "Many naysayers believe that Salman Khan's films are illogical but with Bajrangi Bhaijaan, he has proved them all wrong. Yes, Bajrangi Bhaijaan does have a simple plot this time but well-executed differently in terms of direction, commendable performances and of course one and the only SALMAN KHAN's charisma.It is enthralling and has right entertainment potion from the beginning till the end.A Hanuman-god devotee and gem of a person, Pavan Kumar Chaturvedi ( Salman Khan) comes to rescue of an innocent six year old girl and swears to reunite to her parents in Pakistan.Directed by Kabir Khan ( Kabul Express , New-York, Ek Tha Tiger) Bajrangi Bhaijaan begins on a superb note capturing the exotic landscape of Kashmir and of course the grand entry of Salman ( always something to look forward to ) welcomed by whistle and clapping from the audience and what follows next is few comic scenes along with romantic track between Salman Khan and Kareena Kapoor. Kabir Khan manages to bring out humour with each scene and chemistry between Salman and the cute girl sparkles the silver screen. If the first half is good, the second half is even better thanks to an amazing performance by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. The supremely talented actor brings down the house with superb comic timings and you will love every moment of his acting. Hats off to Kabir Khan by keeping the movie entertaining with simple plot right from the beginning till the end. The film is thought-provoking and does not loose focus. Screenplay is crispy and will keep you engaged. Editing is loose and the film should be easily trimmed by 20 minutes. Cinematography is astounding. Art direction is convincing. Background score is amazing and gels well with the mood of the film. Music by Pritam is decent. Baring \"Selfie Le Re\", none of songs are chart bursting. Salman's fan will be surprised as the actor takes a different route to show his acting skills. The \"King Of Masses\" sheds his skin to get into the character of Pavan Kumar Chaturvedi. He is innocent, kind-hearted and yet powerful who beat up the bad guys when things go wrong. Harshaali Malhotra is an angel. The gorgeous child actor is superb with her expression. Who would have thought that this is her first film. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is incredible and gives his best even in a small role. Kareena Kapoor looks gorgeous in each frame and does well with her sparkling performances.Salman's super stardom and well-defined content will make it sustainable at the ticket window and has good legs to prolong its splendid run.

            "content": "Years ago, I had watched \"Henna\" in which the hero enters Pakistan by crossing Indian Border in an accident. The heroine helps him to return India through the border getting herself killed across the barbed fences. The film is still remembered for its sheer beauty and a symbolic gesture on India and Pakistan relationships concluding humanity isn't confined to any border.\"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" too plays with the similar theme in which Salman Khan enters the Pakistan Border illegally to take a six year old mute girl to her home who gets separated with her mother and reaches India. The Pakistani police suspects him of a detective and detains him. The rest of the story involves the attempt on crossing of the border to enter India and the support the hero receives from the Pakistanis. Just like \"Henna\" the film is a visual treat with an excellent views of Pakistani landscapes. The role of the child as a mute girl is brilliant and touches you deep. Her role far surpasses the roles of Salman Khan and Kareena Kapoor. Nawazzadin Siddhiqui in a brief role of a reporter sparkles and give the film a leverage.But in terms of script the film falls a bit short with much of the leverage given on different religions and the support given on the superstitions following the religions, which appears a bit misleading and preachy. Salman's role was pretty unbelievable, and his response to the situations seem pretty unnatural. Overall, the film is impressive in parts with mesmerizing moments created through the six year old child in the central role and the beautiful expanses and mountains of Pakistan captured in the screen.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",

A movie about an Indian who helps a Pakistani girl to go back to her country so she can be reunited with her parents. It teaches us that humanity is far above religion. In New Zealand this movie was a huge hit and after 5 weeks people are still talking about it. Brilliant performances, great script, excellent screenplay, crisp editing, great music and above average direction makes Bajrangi Bhaijaan the best movie of the year. It is sheer entertainment and I am yet to meet anyone who has disliked this movie. I am rating it 10/10 but honestly speaking this movie is beyond that. The true rating is reflected when a viewer leaves at the end of the movie with a smile and tears in their eyes. A very emotional movie.. It is one of the best movies to come out of Bollywood. Well done Salman Khan and thank you for entertaining us. Congratulations to Kabir Khan and the rest of the cast and crew.

Saw the Hindi dubbed version of Baahubali - The Beginning & Bajrangi Bhaijaan back to back and I am still not able to decide which one of these could I call the greatest creation of the box-office-centric Indian commercial cinema industry. Both the movies deliver on both aspects, quality and masaala. Both the filmmakers have proved that a movie can be a huge box-office success without senseless stunts and unnecessary romance.

This movie is not a typical Salman Khan masala movie but much more than that.I went with the expectation of watching my favorite hero Salman, but to my surprise. I found out that The lead hero of this movie is story. Then the captain of the ship Kabir Khan. Then that little angel harshali Malhotra. And after that Salman and Nawaz.The first half could have been edited little bit but you can't blame a guy like Kabir Khan who has shot documentary films all his career. The second half of this movie is simply amazing and you keep getting connected with this movie. The climax and the overall movie is a masterpiece.Nawaz was awesome as always. Harshali was treat to eyes and she expressed so many things without saying a single word. The surprise package was Salman Bhai's acting and the best thing about his acting was the honesty with which he lived the character of bajrangi. The concept of hindu-Muslim and Ind-Pak is essayed with purest of humanity without disrespecting anyone.Go and watch this film with your family. If you try to find mistakes, then not a single movie will come clean. But if you want to find out positives, then this movie is full of them.",

It's really hard to believe that Salman's movie will be based on content. Hence it takes time for a viewer and consistent effort from director to believe it. Fortunately, this movie does all. Kept its movie theme intact and didn't fall into the trap of silly commercialization. Although crowd still goes mad when Sallu enters or shows his style. The movie had its limitations such as over extension of the story towards the end of second half, despite it maintained a decent pace. Many scenes were over-engineered but the sentiments were always preserved in a correct way. It showed a good angle of Indo Pak love relationship without any foolish sentiments. Everyone delivered an average acting performance with Salman and Nawazuddin slightly above the rest. There were few good Pakistani scenes involving Nawaz in which he nailed most of it. Neither Salman showed his standard stupidity nor the movie tried to structure like that.Quite experienced with Hindu-Muslim and Indo-Pak relationships, Kabir Khan made a good use of it. Direction was consistently good and effort was noticeable. He made sure movie doesn't loose its plot and becomes lovable.Music was avoidable and anyways made no impact either ways.Overall, movie with good sentiments that never looses its plot.",

            "content": "I have never been a fan of Salman's Masala flicks of late but as and when I saw the trailer of Bajrangi Bhaijaan, I felt as if this was different and needed to be watched. The basic opinion for a Sallu movie is that it would be a no brainer, but this one needs brain and more so,a pure heart. The movie starts with a group of Pakistani people along with a pregnant woman in Sultanpur watching the India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2014 match & as a fan of Shahid Afridi, wants to name her child as Shahid. But the new born child is a girl and is named Shahida (Harshaali Malhotra).Unfortunately, she can't speak. One tragedy when Shahida is 6 years old disappoints family further and on advice of a senior family member, the Mother decides to take the daughter to a wish fulfilling Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah in Delhi. The train route from Wagah to Attari is shown in a decent manner. On the return journey, the train halts due to a technical problem, all fall asleep. This is when Shahida spots a small goat and goes to play with her. The train goes away before she could realize it. boards a goods train that follows and reaches Kurukshetra in Delhi where she meets the Bajrang Bali bhakt Pavan Kumar Chaturvedi (Salman Khan).With pure heart and an innocent intention to help the lost girl meet her Parents, Pavan takes care of Shahida and calls her Munni. No one supports him much apart from Rasika (Kareena Kapoor) who teaches children in school. They take names of different cities to know the exact place from where Munni has come from. Slowly, slowly, they come to know that she fancy's Chicken & that she is a Muslim and from Pakistan. Pavan knew how risky it was to make her reach safely to her Parents in Pakistan. He tried going to the Embassy but to no avail and had a bizarre and shocking incident with a travel agent. So he decided that somehow, he himself will take Munni to her Parents in Pakistan. The way he reaches Pakistan through the Indo-Pak border is a bit filmy after all, but still, the journey in Pakistan is sheer master class. The reason for it is the entry of Chaand Nawab (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) , who was a freelance news reporter. He realized through a few instances regarding the honesty of Pavan and helped him in his mission. Chaand makes videos regarding the story but nobody believes it, which makes it difficult to survive in Pakistan. Will Munni meet her Parents? Will Pavan be able to come back to India safely? What about the Pakistani cops? How the bhakt Bajrangi gets transformed in Bajrangi Bhaijaan? These are the questions that form the gripping last hour of this epic movie. Gone are the days when Salman's movies were just about smashing & fights, this is just about heart,emotions, love and a brilliant story. Uncontrollable tears will come out towards the closing moments; such is the level of attachment and connection this movie builds. Kabir Khan has come a long way in his journey and this movie is his best direction till date only for the reason that this one has almost everything in it which is commendable. Even the Dialogues by Kabir and Kausar Munir are awesome:- a perfect blend of comedy and seriousness as and when required. One of the best for me was when Chaand was himself shooting a video at the end of which he said \"Cameraman Chaand Nawaz ke saath, Chand Nawaz\" :- it just can't get better than this, can it? No.Other notable ones are \"Yahan Nafrat Bikti Hai, Mohabbat Nahi\". My best conversation was when Pavan said \"Bajrangi Hamari Madad Karenge\" to which Chand replied \"Yahan Pakistan Mein Bhi\" to which as expected,whole theatre clapped. Cinematography by one of my preferred ones Assem Mishra had to be good as it had to portray the sheer beauty of Kashmir and it indeed was. It was an absolute delight to watch the movie. But what won my heart was the simple, yet intriguing story by Vijayendra Prasad. I just loved the concept on the whole. Music by Pritam is a letdown but somewhat, goes with the flow of the movie , so cannot be much of an issue. Yet, Tu Jo Mila sung by K.K. and Zindagi sung by Zubin Nautiyal and written by Neelesh Misra are notable mentions. Coming to the performances , Salman Khan is in a totally different role and he does really well. Leaving aside his Masala roles, this might come up amongst his finest.Kareena Kapoor Khan does justice to whatever role she had. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is sheer class, the movie lifts in itself the moment he is on screen. Om puri in a small role as a Maulvi as well as rest of the support caste does a decent job. But what can I say about the young Champion Harshaali Malhotra, she is just amazing. Her innocent look, her expressions, her smile, the way she conveys it without uttering a word, I am speechless.She is a tremendous actress and is beyond excellence for a child actor.Well, if there is anyone, who would not like this movie, it might well just be RAVICHANDRAN ASHWIN as the same Asia Cup match is shown twice when Afridi hits him for those 2 sixes to win it for Pakistan.All in all, Bajrangi Bhaijaan is made with a pure heart and sends out a strong message of love, bond and togetherness. I never expected it to be so good, but because of the emotions attached and the tears that came out in my eyes, I will ignore the few filmy flaws that the movie has and rate it 4.5/5.",

            "content": "When it is a Salman Khan movie, generally people don't even wait for the review or even want to have a look at reviews. He is indeed a massive crowd puller. Bajrangi Bhaijaan, is definitely very nicely presented. I liked most parts of the movie. Indeed there are certain scenes, where one wonders, whether this is really believable. But overall, the movie has blend of so many wonderful emotions, dialogues, screenplay which makes the whole plot of Bajrangi Bhaijaan touch your hearts. With Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Kabir Khan has explored the hate story of India-Pakistan in a new manner. The name of the movie is also thoughtfully crafted where the message is to grow beyond the concept of borders, be secular, accept the diversity of religion / culture / habits. The whole story can be summed up in two lines, but the beauty of the movie is in its screenplay, how it is presented. Certain dialogues, moments are surely going to generate lot of emotions, sighs, good feelings, sense of loss, sense of wanting to be together, desire to get rid of the borders, break the barriers etc. There is so much innocence as well in the movie. Many hard core realities are conveyed in a very subtle manner. So many social issues are also addressed in this film in a subtle manner viz. child trafficking, religious barriers, patriotism (on either sides of the border), corruption etc. The need to transform one's own thoughts and to accept others without being judgmental is also beautifully projected. The showstopper scene is of course the climax scene. I am not revealing the same, I know, all of you are going to love the same.The film begins with credits shown in the backdrop of beautiful visuals of mountains. The opening scene is in Pakistan occupied Kashmir where people are sitting and watching a cricket match between India and Pakistan on TV. Of course there is jubilation when Pakistan wins. One of the spectator is a pregnant woman who is fond of cricketer Shahid and wants to name her yet to be born child after him. Then the frames move to 6 years later, where the lady is shown in her family with a pretty girl child named Shahida (Harshaali Malhotra). Shahida is a mute girl. Parents are advised to visit Hazarat Nizamuddin Dargah, Delhi, since the belief is that every prayer is answered over there and miracle can be expected for Shahida's case as well so that she starts speaking. Father being an ex-military person can't get visa to India and so mother determines to take Shahida to Delhi. India- Pakistan Samjhauta express takes them to Delhi and they visit the wish-fulfillment Dargah. But things go wrong on their return. Shahida just gets down when the train was stationery for a pretty long time and ends up missing her train. Unable to cry for help, she gets stranded and lost in Kurukshetra. Her family is troubled in Pakistan. This is where entry of Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi aka Bajrangi (Salman Khan) happens with 'selfie' song. Shahida is so expressive through her awestruck eyes and the way she follows Pawan. Pawan is a Hanuman devotee and that is how he proudly introduces himself as Bajrangi. He even bows in front of monkey since monkey is a form of Hanuman for him. It is really great to see Pawan and Shahida develop a great bond. Pawan develops a unique way to decode Shahida's response by her raising hand for every correct answer.Pawan is shown to be a person whose integrity lies in being true and honest to the core. He has come from his home town to Delhi to be with his late father's friend and family. Rasika (Kareena Kapoor) becomes his love interest. It is hilarious as well as very nice to see that a person who is a hardcore Hindu, a vegetarian when learns that Munni is a Muslim from Pakistan, a non-vegetarian, breaks all boundaries and crosses borders to make her reach safely at her place. Challenges were many on his path, since her whereabouts were not clear. No entry to the country officially. In spite of all odds, how Pawan makes Rasika reach her destination is awesome. Good Samaritans like Chand Nawab (Nawazuddin), a reporter, Maulana (Ompuri) and a Bus conductor definitely help him in his journey.Indeed there are certain unrealistic scenes in the film, but one tends to ignore the same since overall the film is well packaged, be it its theme of Indo-Pak enmity, the bond of love etc. The real star of the show is Harshaali Malhotra. Without uttering a word, she has expressed it so well through her eyes, body language, mannerisms. Simply superb! Her smile is going to win your hearts. Salman has underplayed himself, which would definitely make you fall in love with him. Kareena has a small role but very much likable. Another star is Nawazuddin who again wins hearts with his effortless and natural performance.Bajrangi Bhaijaan endorses the religion of Humanity, Love and Togetherness!!! A perfect Eidi from Salman Khan!!! It is an entertainer and inspires us to accept the diversity, culture and habits across the border and love them. Bajrangi Bhaijaan will definitely win your hearts.",

            "review_title": "an Offbeat Salman",
            "content": "What do you expect from a Salman Khan Movie? A movie with no script, the lead actor behaving as if he is doing us a favor by being in the movie, an item song which is modeled after every household item you could hold on to? Well! BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN will totally disappoint you if you are one of those hardcore bhai fans who walk into the auditorium screening this one, expecting to see all the above mentioned. This by far is the best movie Salman Khan has done in his entire career of 26 years and lets hope this is just the beginning.What works so well for the movie is that Salman Khan graciously sidesteps to give his little co-star Harshalli Malhotra center stage and lets her walk away with all the glory. He even steers clear of his regular heroism and lets himself get beaten up a couple of times in the movie which must have caused quite a fit among his fans.Coming to the story, it revolves around Shahida (Harshali Malhotra) who comes to visit Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah along with her mother from Pakistan, so that her mother could pray that her daughter becomes normal. Whats wrong with her? Well! Shahida cannot speak. On the way back to Pakistan, Shahida gets separated from her mother and ends up wandering in Kurukshetra, and latches on to simpleton loser Pavan Kumar Chaturvedi aka Bajrangi (Salman Khan). Pavan is in love with Rasika (Kareena Kapoor) whose father (Sharat Saxena) puts a condition that Pavan should first make something out of himself and also get a decent house and only than would he allow him to get married to his daughter.Things take a turn, when Pavan comes home with Shahida who he mistakes for a lost Brahmin girl. Rasika takes a liking to the girl and tries to support Pavan in getting her back to her parents. In a quick turn of events, The whole family discovers that Shahida is a Pakistani, and a Muslim and also a non-vegetarian, and Rasika's father orders Pavan to get the kid on the next train to Pakistan.With things getting worse at the embassy, Pavan enters Pakistan illegally and befriends Chand Nawab (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) a reporter who helps him in trying to get the girl back to her home. All the while the Pakistan army is looking for Pavan as they think he is a spy........Salman Khan gives his 100% to his role as simpleton Pavan, you immediately start liking him right from the moment he appears on screen. This is the first time you actually get to see a character and not Salman Khan on screen. Full marks for Director Kabir Khan for achieving the impossible.Harshali Malhotra is the real star of the movie and like Pavan takes over the audience with her innocent looks and cute smile. She really scores in scenes where she makes faces when ever Pavan lands both of them in trouble because of his truth addiction and she completely takes over an emotional scene as well. All the while, without even speaking a single syllable.Nawazuddin Siddiqui keeps you in splits with his role as Chand Nawab, the bumbling Pakistani Reporter with a heart of gold. Scenes where he and Salman Khan act as a couple (salman all decked in a burkha) are hilarious with Nawazuddin bagging the best one liners ever.Kareena Kapoor proves once again that she is a versatile actress, no matter what the screen time is, she does make her presence felt. She excels in two of the best scenes in the movie, one where she reprimands Pavan over his staunch Hindu Brahmin beliefs which prevent him from entering a mosque to look for Shahida and a scene where she takes on her father threatening to go to Pakistan to look for Pavan.The movie gets rid of traditional stereotypes and gives the audience a new perspective/vision of Pakistan, where we are shown people who are good, helpful and completely human. The scene where a Moulvi (Om Puri) who runs a Madrasa bids farewell to Pavan with Jai Shree Ram, as Pavan a Hindu Brahmin cannot bring himself to say Khuda Hafiz. And an exact opposite of the scene where in the climax Pavan turns and does a salaam to Pakistan would be taken as classic examples of bridging gaps between two countries/religions.Story by Vijendra Prasad gives enough scope for people to understand that people on either side of the border are human too and are no different from one another.Screenplay by Kabir Khan moves forward mostly in the lighter vein, scenes where Pavan and Rasika discover that Shahida is a non-vegetarian, scenes where Pavan calls Rasika as Behenji for first 30 minutes in the movie and Pavan's truth addiction all add up to a wholesome entertainment.Kabir Khan's direction is top notch and he does have a winner on his hands. Taking a very serious message and sugarcoating it for an orthodox audience is one hell of a feat.Yes, I would recommend this movie to everyone irrespective of whether you are a salman khan fan or not and yes I would give it 4.5 rating (the first for any Salman film)",

            "content": "Bajrangi Bhaijaan- Its too difficult for me to start this review without mentioning Harshaali Malhotra. She is a discovery. From the very start you easily connect with her character. Not a single word spoken by her , still you will laugh with her and cry with her. Whether its the scene where she get separated by her mother , or at a DHABAA she remembers her mother , or the climax scene and many more , she will make you cry even if you are made of stone. I have literally seen at least a dozen of people crying while watching this one. I my self was crying. So lets get our concentration on something else. Movie is about Pawan Chaturvedi aka Bajrangi who likes to help people before helping himself. He is basically a failure in every department his father wants him to succeed. But that doesn't make him a LOAFER. In fact he is very kind , gentle and calm , contrary to Salmaan's usual characters which is a delight to see. He gets a lost girl in KURUKHSHTRA , and when he get to know that she is from Pakistan,he decides to take her to Pakistan by himself after getting failed in other ways to send her to Pakistan. Like most of the Salmaan's movies this one also have 'its heart on a right place' but the good thing is that Kabir Khan has handled the melodramatic scenes very beautifully that those scenes don't make you bore rather you got involved with the emotions of the characters on the screen.Kabir Khan is actually a pretty nice director and the only one who is associated to Salmaan Khan and making good movies (apart from Sooraj Barjaatia who is making comeback with Prem Ratan Dhan Pao). Rest of the directors with whom Salmaan works including two of his own brother are bad. I liked Salmaan a lot in this one. He was emoting totally . I wouldn't say this as his comeback as KICK was his comeback , but this is better , a lot better. This is what Salmaan can do. This is Salmaan in his Full Form . Without unwanted jokes , without unwanted dance numbers , without showing his muscle power. This movie will make you remember The CALM Salmaan from Hum Saath Saath Hein and the Emoting Salmaam from Tere Naam. I really really thinks Salmaan must select his directors more intelligently. Apart from him Kareena was good in every scene she was before interval and his chemistry with Salmaan has always been good but when its get to the 2nd half Salmaan's chemistry with Nawazuddin even gets better. With this film also Nawazuddin continues to give great performance in big movies standing side by side with a big superstar. Some good cinematography has been done in the movie. Songs were given as per the situation and doesn't break the flow. Although some scenes drag a bit , still the length of the movie will not make you wait to finish it. Than again what Bajrangi Bhaijaan is , just because of Harshaali Malhotra. I have no more words to describe her. Just remember what i said earlier , this movies can even make a STONE cry.. Undoubtedly a BLOCKBUSTER. And please ignore the logical gaps , after all it a Salmaan Khan movie.8.2/10. By ANuP APu KuMaR.",

They all want to have 6 pack abs, luxurious cars, a big mansion, use-and-throw girlfriends like Aishwarya and Katrina, a huge fanbase and infinite power in the industry. All of this is usually apparent in all Salman Khan movies, but not this one. Here we have a pious, obedient and saint version of Salman Khan in the form of Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi.The story is actually pretty good, although has a couple of plot holes in the form of factually incorrect information (like Brahmins always being vegetarians, Pakistani police slapping a civilian for being a Hindu, the army letting someone cross the border just because they asked it, YouTube quickly spreading Pawan's story as if it's a normal thing etc). It's the acting that covers up the problems. However, the idea used in this story is very mediocre. It's not a kind of a movie you'd hear someone say that it's their favourite. Because it doesn't have anything new to offer. What it makes up with is the visual appeal and character driven story.I'm not a fan of Salman Khan. Rather I hate that person. But this movie is undoubtedly one of, if not the best Salman Khan movies ever made. And that's actually saying something since Andaz Apna Apna also exists. It absolutely deserves the box office collection it earned.",

The innocence of Pavan (Salman) makes you emotional. The girl (Harshali) plays her role very well. Kareena has a small role in the movie but looks good. Nawazuddin is as brilliant as always.

            "content": "Bollywood and Salman have mostly been associated with method films that guarantees success and fame almost always. But with Kabir Khan it is not same, even his perfect method films aren't really those typical ones you see every other day.\"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\", this year's big Eid release, is a perfect emotional movie and makes for a perfect viewing. A god-fearing, Hanuman worshiping earnest Bajrangi who thinks even eating meat is a sin and entering mosque is taboo. The child actor Harshali Malhotra plays a mute six-year-old Pakistani citizen who accidentally strays into India and it's her character that brings out the best from Salman Khan or Pavan as he is addressed in the movie. Lost, hungry and lonely, Munni aka Shahida sticks to Pavan and unable to shake her off, Pavan takes her home not knowing anything about her. The mute one communicates all her feelings through her poignant eyes.Their bond is charming and their chemistry is mind-blowing. The innocent face of Harshali and vibrant expressions while leading him to India are some of the best moments of the movie.As the movie progresses and Pavan starts looking for her parents and while he greets the crowd with Adaab instead of Jai Shri Rama while entering the Indian soil towards the end of movie, each of the moment are soul-touching. There are few moments where the peace angle is shown, the romance between Pavan and her school teacher Rasika. But the movie mostly focuses on the relationship between Pavan and the mute child Munni. You can sit back and let the plot take you for a ride into an area in world whose existence Indians don't even acknowledge, POK. As Om Puri, playing a wise 'maulana' in the film, tells the hero: 'thoda sa Kashmir hamaare paas bhi hai'.Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the Pakistani TV scribe nearly steals the show with his story on the little girl lost in border. Flashes of Gaddar shows when Bajrangi decides to unite Munni with her parents across the border. This was highlighted much before the release of the movie. There is nothing really in the first half, the film starts in the second half when the character enters across the border. At 2 hours and 20 odd minutes, the picture is cool and entertaining. Climax is a bit stretched but the reasoning is logical and go with the flow. The movie has heart, its winsome, the picturesque scene based on POK are way too good.",

The film shows the determination of a Pakistani woman Henna(Zeba Bakhtiar) to reunite an Indian, Chander Prakash(Rishi Kapoor) with his family back in India.In this film we see the reverse, a Hindu man Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi(Salman Khan) is helping a mute young Pakistani girl Shahida(Harshaali Malhotra) who has been separated from her mother accidentally and finds herself on the wrong side of the Pakistani border. A chance encounter brings Pawan and Shahida together. From then onwards Pawan's life takes on a whole knew meaning, as he overcomes all odds to reunite Shahida with her mother. The direction, acting and photography is superb. The background music and songs are enhance the film. Salman Khan gives a sincere performance as the title character of the film Bajrangi(meaning a devotee of Hanuman). Hanuman is a Hindu god and an ardent devotee of Rama. He is a central character in the Hindu epic Ramayana. Newcomer Harshaali Malhotra is adorable in her role as Munni. Actress Kareena Kapoor has a small supporting role in this film, but her acting as always is thoroughly professional. Sharat Saxena, who is now 65 years old, is holding up well for his age. Not to forget to mention the veteran actor Om Puri who is also 65 years old. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is superb as always. No matter whatever his role, Nawazuddin delivers an excellent performance. He is such a dynamic actor.Verdict: a superb film which the whole family can enjoy together. Salman Khan Selection: Maine Pyar Kiya(1989, film counted among the top 10 successful films of India), Love(1991), Saajan(highest grossing Bollywood film of 1991), Suryavanshi(1992 perhaps the only horror film he starred in), Veergati (1995 my favorite film), Majhdhaar(1996 a very underrated film), Khamoshi: The Musical(1996.

            "review_title": "Salman's Best Film Hitherto and Possibly a Career-Defining Venture for Director Kabir Khan",
            "content": "Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.8/5 stars\"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" gives us a Salman Khan very different from the one we're used to seeing on screen. There's no swagger in his step, no signature punchlines to deliver, and...gasp...he doesn't pummel baddies in one mindless fight scene after another. He doesn't even - surprise of all surprises - once rip his shirt of (it's only off in one interrogation scene relevant to the plot, and that too for a fleeting moment) or gyrate to pelvic-thrusting dance sequences. In what has to be - and thankfully it's finally been done - the most un-Salman Khan movie till date, the actor stars as a symbol of peace and love in this cross-border drama - a marked departure from his inexplicable image as a larger-than-life hero who lets his fists do all the talking without ever really looking threatening to begin with. The result, I'm happy to report, is that this may well be Salman Khan's best fill till date and certainly his most coherent film in the last ten years or so.In \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" he plays Pavan Kumar Chaturvedi, a devout Hanuman bhakt and small-town simpleton who resolves to reunite a mute six-year-old girl with her family in Pakistan after she accidentally lands up in India. The little girl in question, played by Harshaali Malhotra, is a scene-stealer from the get go. She has an angelic face and expressive eyes; good luck holding back your tears each time she sheds her own. Her gleaming eyes and heartwarming expressions smoothens over the film's roughest edges - like, for instance, an necessary but poorly choreographed fight scene in a brothel - just by looking at Salman in sheer awe.Director Kabir Khan (equally the star of the film, sensibly returns to his \"New York\" and \"Kabul Express\" days, leaving behind the ill- conceived tropes of his blockbuster hit, \"Ek Tha Tiger\") gives us some charming moments between Salman and her, starting with the bits when it dawns on him that she is neither brahmin nor kshatriya like he'd assumed. The film uses humor as a tool to address deep-set religious prejudices, like the one Pavan's landlord and future father-in-law harbors against his meat-eating Muslim neighbors, or even Pavan's own discomfort about stepping into a masjid. There's also, conveniently, a romantic track with Kareena Kapoor, who, in only a few well-scripted moments reminds us just how good an actress she is, but who sadly seems content playing largely decorative roles in male-driven, star vehicles.However, \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" really comes into its own post interval when the action shifts to Pakistan, where Pavan and the little girl encounter an assortment of locals - from kind-hearted, sympathetic men to suspicious cops. A terrific Nawazuddin Siddiqui, playing small- time TV reporter Chand Nawab, quickly becomes an ally, joining the duo on the long journey to the girl's home in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. The scenes between these three are some of the best in the film, and Siddiqui coolly walks away with all the good lines. He nails his part, and brings much credibility to the proceedings, excelling with his body language and mannerisms, like in scenes where he laughs uncontrollable and the naivet\u00e9 of Salman while lying on a bed of corn or when grabbing an old man's hand to get himself forcibly slapped. Sharat Saxena and Rajesh Sharma are routinely excellent in their gruff roles, and Om Puri has a warm little cameo. The film is also set up by the overwhelming earnestness of Meher Vij in the role of Shahida's mother, who wears her heartbreak very believably indeed. The filmmakers even throw in one of the old men from that misinformed Kashmir film, \"Haider\", in a bid for credibility, and having all these fine actors even in tiny parts helps things considerably.Also helping things along are a few deft writing touches about bigotry, religion, and neighborly love - like Pavan, the son of an RSS-man and being repulsed by the smell of meat in the morning, and him threatening to throw out a Pakistani Embassy official from India who turns out to be \"just another Indian.\" Or like the fact that Kashmir and Switzerland look pretty darned alike.Kabir Khan dials up the melodrama and delivers the most unabashedly manipulative climax that you can possibly think of. The film takes a simplistic view of the Indo-Pak problem and the Kashmir issue, and offers well-intentioned but frankly naive solutions. In the last ten minutes, the makers aren't merely content with drawing tears from your eyes, the film literally squeezes a lump out of your throat.Despite its plot holes and rudimentary politics of the region, the film doesn't derail because we're served up likable enough principal characters, and inspired actors in these parts. Salman Khan is genuinely endearing as the simple-minded Hanuman devotee who genuflects in reverence each time he spots a monkey. There's an unmistakable earnestness to his performance as a man who demonstrates the importance of humanity over religion and nationality. And he's well- complemented by Siddiqui and little Harshaali whose smile will melt your heart.\"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" is way too long at 2 hours and 35 minutes, and could have done with some serious pruning, especially in its first half. Nevertheless, it's miles ahead of all the typical Salman Khan blockbusters released in the last 8-10 years. It has a beautiful story, stirring scenes, its heart is definitely in the right place, and ultimately it wins you over completely.",

Bajrangi Bhaijaan is Salmans best film ever.... A treat for his fans.Me: Beta you said the same thing when his 'Kick' released last year. Sorry, but I found Bajrangi Bhaijaan no different from his recent films...Salman makes a dramatic entry, dances his own inimitable steps, convincingly beats villains to pulp and still looks innocently fresh romancing a much younger heroine. How is Bhaijaan any different? Is it because he didn't go shirtless in the climax this time?Son (irritated): Come on Baba! Didn't you find any novelty in the story where an Indian takes a lost girl back to Pakistan to reunite her with her family?Me: Sunny Deol went to Pakistan in Gadar (2001) and uprooted a handpump there. You weren't even born then. Also, I found director Kabir Khan's 'Kabul Express' (2006) far more convincing than this one. Bajrangi Bhaijaan was unrealistic, gimmicky and emotionally manipulative..Son (more irritated): Baba, stop being overcritical now. Didn't you like anything about the film? How could you miss the positive message of unity and religious harmony besides promoting cross border peace at the right time when our Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to build diplomatic relations with Pakistan?Me: Hmm. Agree with you on that. By the way, I am happy to know you read politics. As for the films positive aspect..well, Kashmir is beautifully captured on celluloid.. Nawazuddin Siddiqui impressed me in his short role. His introduction scene and the one where he calls Salman \"Begum\" is hilarious. I also liked the girls performance in the film. She was absolute natural.Son (cooling down): You mean Kareena aunty?Me: No I meant debutant child actor Harshaali Malhotra. Kareena should have been credited as a guest appearance. She was hardly there in the second half.Son: True. But anyway, heroines don't matter in a Salman Khan film....Me: Hmm, tell me is there anything you didn't like about the movie?Son (after a pause): To be honest, I found the music (Pritam) unsatisfactory and the songs too many. I also didnt quite understand why a Pakistani journo would go out of his way to help an Indian fugitive? But Salman more than made up for these flaws with his screen presence.....I know you will not give the film a complete favorable review but bhaijaan fans like me will award it a full 5 stars rating.Me: Ok beta, chill! Even I found Bajrangi Bhaijaan much better than Salman's previous outings like 'Bodyguard' and 'Kick' but its nothing to sing hossanas about... I wont tell you right now what my rating will be. You can read my review in a couple of hours and find out ur self.Son: Sorry baba, I don't have time for that. I am going back for a repeat viewing with my friends...hope I get the tickets though.Before I can react, my son is already out of earshot...Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

            "content": "This film couldn't have released at a better time than this. Saying this let me add that Salman has broken his typical zone of nonsense masala entertainers with this. Salman as Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi aka Bajrangi is the man with golden heart who takes the responsibility of returning a 6 year old dumb Pakistani girl to her home. He portrays the characters very well. Superstar Salman is missing along with his cheesy dialogues but well you can see Salman actually acting after years. He puts everything at stake and driven by his faith in Bajrangbali, he ensures that the lost girl makes it back home in one piece. Salman the one man army.Harshaali Malthotra with her winning smile, her large, playful eyes and a face that can melt the toughest heart is the soul of the movie. She portrays her character brilliantly. Her expressions will steal your heart. Even a die hard bhai fan will become her fan after watching the movie.Nawazuddin as Chand Nawab yet again gives his best. The chemistry between him and Salman and a few dialogues between them is clap- worthy. Kareena as Rasika do not have much important role but she did her part very well. Even the small role by Om Puri was impressive.Music is good. praises for Pritam. Except 'Selfie le le' and 'Aaj ki party' all the songs are good and they carry the story forward.Kabir Khan has presented the story efficiently. Backdrop of Kashmir added extra beauty to this film.Go on watch it. It will surely touch your heart.",

            "content": "Salman, i knew it, i knew you could pull through such a amazing movie as well, my only question why didn't you do this earlier? Iam pretty sure most of the reviewers who are used to watching Indian movies are probably going to say the same thing about this movie, but for others who watch occasional Indian movies and mostly Hollywood movies, don't say this movie defies logic, don't say the movie has plot holes and any other crap coz i can list 100 Hollywood movies which has bigger ill-logical plot points than this. Enjoy the movie for what it is and it sure has got lot of depth in the script to make sure you do that.Now, that we have taken that out of the equation, let's talk about the movie. This movie is really fun to watch. We all know what to expect in Salman Khan movies and i loved this movie because it did not have any of that. And still movie is one of the biggest bollywood blockbuster, so what does that tell you Mr. Salman? You have people who are willing to spend their time and money even if you don't rip your shirt and just have over-the-top action scenes.This movie has a lot of heart, yeah lot of scenes where you might tear up, but apart from that it spends quite a lot of time in getting the characters in your head. It was very easy to do that cos you only care about 3 characters in the whole movie. Hero, little girl and the tag-along friend, Siddiqui. Each of them have been given the right character development and a neat story to get you in grip with the movies wants to accomplish.So when they show salman khan's past, you surely wouldn't be surprised how the movie is going to pan out. No surprises anywhere in the movie, again with such a premise how would you engage the audiences? With acting of course. Everyone has given their best, Salman, Harshaali, Siddiqi and Kareena Kappoor. Given their best and have articulated the scenes so clearly that you really want to say \"Oh man, that really hit me\". I was hoping at some point you will really see Salman lose his cool and start bashing heads and am gonna hate the movie for it. But it did not happen, although there were a couple of mini-fights, they were needed, i mean anyone with such a heart as Bajarangi would have done the same thing, so totally justified.But remember it is movie of a actor who is used to staying in air longer than a commercial airline during stunts, so you can't completely show a docile and mellowed down character of such a shooting star. So in that sense, movie suffers a few flaws and i really don't want to get into everything but i would say some parts in the movie where people had said..Kareena Kapoor: Everyone i spoke to was just saying she was completely dispensable, waste of money, even if you remove her from the movie nothing will change, etc. so for all those people, Yes, you are partially true, but do you really expect every character in every movie to be completely in-sync with the screenplay and involved in every scene? NO, that hardly happens and if not for her Bajarangi's mind would have been really narrow and maybe he might have never even started on the mission.Harshaali: Again every soul said she had done exceptionally well, it is not true. We are all humans, we would have accepted the movie if the girl was just a picture and Salman went in search of her. We like such sentiments and happy endings. I am not saying she was bad, she was good, but over-hyped. If you really want to see a child actor perform there are many movies (Taare Zameen Par, Kannathil Mutamital (Tamil)) those performances are worthwhile mentioning.Movie could have been shorter, it made the journey perilous for the heck of it. There could have been some scenes which could have been completely avoided and i also believe the parents were utterly underplayed. Their daughter is missing, i would have expected a little bit more screen time of them rather than some convoluted plot points. But that's my point of view.Having spoken about these, the movie is worth watching and am sure i can watch this again and this will be in my list of top 10 best movies of Salman Kahan. Please continue making such movies at least once a while, i loved watching it and am sure you would not regret it a bit.Thank you for reading, Ciao",

This movie is totally fictitious 90% chances of this happening is really rare, but then movie hai yaaar no questions. First of all let me start by Saying this \"Sallu bhai you should select more movies like this because this is the only movie after several years I felt like you didn't overdo, you have talent bhai please use it to provide us with movies like these which are down to earth characters once in a year\", the first thing that made me hold onto my seats was Shadia's smile( she is so cute and innocent). I expected masala flick where Sallu bhai hits many people and goes on removing shirt and heroine goes behind him like a dog because of his innocence, but no nothing like that happened. The movie is funny when needed and sentimental at times required. The balance in these along with no hyper or super power for star makes it completely entertaining. Stellar performances by Sallu bhai, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Harshaali Malhotra, Om puri(even though small role) and Sharat Saxena (with his well built body even now). Music comes little too much sometimes but yes it provides ample space for the director,camera guys and crew to show the beauty of places. The camera work at the start showing the mountains was just stunning and not going much into details. For people who are going to watch, its worth watch and collecting blu ray. Hope Sallu bhai does more these sorts of movie. Great work by writer,director and whole crew",

Credit goes to of cource Salman Khan, the fantastic part of the movie the unique story, a common man - real human touch with Pakistan, and the cute pretty little innocent girl character Shahida. The film touches minute aspects of a hindu Brahmin family, the rituals, the belief, religion, food habits, persona, and yet modern thought process of humanity over and above everything. The existence of evil revealed with Girl child selling - smartly rising above all evil was one more great aspect of the movie. Kareena Kapoor's role Rasika could have been a master piece than just a brahmin family love affair story. Given that the actress is fantastic, the role was smaller. She can do much better than this for sure ! Nawazuddin is just fabulous, initially it gives a feeling of yet another role wasted, eventually makes a whole lot of sense and brings grace to the TV journalist role and its real impact. There is a little bit of melodrama for the likes of Indian cinema, but there is mass impacting message on humanity, India Pakistan relationship, common man and that its time to move on and see the world beyond partition and destruction.",

It is a very good effort by Indian artistes and film makers to provide an excellent platform of entertainment which binds the essence of platonic relationships of mankind. The people in general and the polity in particular may take cognizance of the fact that love and belonging are more powerful and enduring than hatred and bigotry.The simple story and crisp script coupled with fluid screenplay and evocative direction of Kabir Khan make it thrilling and engaging for the audience. The main theme of this film is a clear departure from other formulaic love stories and mafia baron movies, making it a strong case for cerebral depiction and brilliant portrayals based on moralistic purity of thought and action. The character of Shahida/ Munni played by a young Harshali lends innocence and injects pristine human values which cannot otherwise be expressed by an adult star.It is a must see movie, at least for the not so brotherly people of India and Pakistan.",

I am not a Salman Fan either nd despite that I watch all his Eid releases on first day. BB is different. KK has been vigilant about sense and aesthetics more than just looking into a mass appeal. This could be a new beginning for a successful director to becoming a good director. He has been helped a great deal by Vijayendra Prasad's story and a capable production design team of Rajnish Hedao. Vijayendra' a household name in South market, has brought an original story with a lot of room to attract cine- goers. Rajnish's team, well known for PK, Rockstar and Three Idiots, already has vast experience of multi- location shoots. BB spreads across various cities and weathers and production design and art direction is always tough for such films. Credit to KK for utilizing the resources at hand in the best possible way. This is probably Salman Khan's best movie, i went in the theater room with low expectation and when i came out, i was amazed!! They show so much positive stuff in this movie!! I guarantee that, when u leave, you will learn at least 10 new things about humanity. This movie is way too good! Nawazuddin was amazing in there as well who played a pakistani journalist, and we already know that salman is good, but in this movie he was good acting wise, but The little cute girl was toooooo good. I love this movie, i learned a lot more after watching this, and this is the kind of movie that you watch again and again, and you still love it each time.

With expectations from the script and of course, Salman, I went to watch the film.I had a pleasant time watching the film.

The few fights in the film are good as well. The humor of this film is another plus point. The emotional sequences keep everyone engaged and the film manages to entertain.Coming to performances, Salman has given his best one here. There's no doubt that he has acted very well in this film. He has proved that he's fit in all kinds of roles. Nawaz is once again great, who entertains with his performance and humor. The girl Harshaali also delivers a fine performance. Others do their respective parts well.Coming to soundtrack, the songs are quite pleasing and my favorite one is Selfie Le Le Re....On the whole, Bajrangi Bhaijaan is a film that deserves all the cheers, applauses and love from viewers.

            "content": "Celebrations among the Muslim community at this time of the year mark the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting. While several may join in the festivities at Mohammed Ali road, the rest look forward to a big weekend for Hindi cinema when almost every year, we are subjected to the abject mediocrity of several Salman Khan movies that make little sense but a whole lot of money. The trend continues in spite of his controversial hit and run case and what we have in Kabir Khan's ('New York', 'Kabul Express', 'Ek tha Tiger') 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is a slight departure from the excessive over-the-top action by another angry young man. Surprisingly, Bhaijaan is perhaps the most sensible, poignant and overall entertaining film from the Salman Khan camp in recent years. However, the intellect of mankind be warned, it still remains in the league of implausible, overlong, at times ridiculous cinema that the masses adore. Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi (Salman Khan) is a devout follower of Hanuman and with all his earnest mannerisms, is quite credible as the innocent, small town lad. However, with his academic failures and non-accomplishments, he is sent to Delhi to his father's friend Digambar (Sharat Saxena), who could possibly offer him a job. He of course, has a beautiful daughter Rasika (Kareena Kapoor) who develops a fondness for Pawan. Kabir Khan then reminds us of 'Maine pyar kiya', when the father of the girl demands that her suitor make something of himself and prove that he is worthy for her hand in marriage. It's Salman Khan, so challenge accepted. Meanwhile, during one of his celebrations, he is followed by a mute child, seemingly separated from her parents. She refuses to let go of his company, somehow trusting him for his personality. She's a child after all. Things get complicated when he has to bring her back home and provide shelter while he investigates her origins. After a lot of predictable scenes that reveal her religious background to the devout brahmins, Pawan is forced to take extreme measures to send her back. His decision to hand her over to a travel agent like a DHL parcel is not only questionable but simply ridiculous even for an imbecile that the director projects him to be. It only starts getting interesting when the hero decides to take things into his own hands and deliver Shahida (Harshaali Malhotra) to her family in Pakistan. The series of events that unfold in a Muslim country such as Pakistan for a devout brahmin makes things funny and awkward but Salman Khan is good at such situations. This was his strength much before he took on the action roles. For the audience, a huge relief arrives in the form of the reporter Chand Nawab (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), whose charming performance provides all the one-liners with exceptional timing and sincerity to Pawan's cause that adds gravity to the film's underlying story about a girl's separation from her parents. Nawab joins the duo in their attempt to avoid authorities and to find Shahida's lost paradise and in all the madness of the storyline, his respect for Pawan's sincerity and intentions is remarkably transposed in his performance. This has to be one of the most mellow, non-Salman performances by Salman Khan even though, he has attempted such characters before. Watching him not repeating the same punchlines throughout the movie that would have audiences whistling, is quite a relief this time. His rise to being a hero in the climax is the bane of this film. The exaggerated version of Bajrangi Bhaijaan being recognized for his efforts is overlong and frankly, facepalm worthy. Harshaali Malhotra has been much appreciated for her cuteness and innocence in the film. Much like any other child artist. However, her talent needs further testing in a movie where she gets to speak but at some points, her expressions of disapproval, grief, mischief are on point. Om Puri in his cameo is delightful and so is Sharat Saxena in all his seriousness. Kareena Kapoor was just there but that blame goes to the director for not giving her a character to work with. V Vijayendra Prasad is on a roll currently with 'Baahubali' and Bajrangi Bhaijaan's successes that owed a fair amount to his story writing. However, he is quite unimpressive here with a very predictable, slow paced story that couldn't offer any engagement were it not for a couple of solid performances. Factors that certainly raise the film above mediocrity are the locations of Rajasthan, Sonmarg and Zoji-La in Kashmir. Spectacularly shot by cinematographer Aseem Mishra, these scenes will be etched in memory for a long time. The music is definitely a burden of the film with not one song being a memorable tune. Bhardo jholi by Adnan Sami is an exceptional qawalli that was originally sung by the Sabri brothers. While Adnan does a good job with his own version, it's quite a blatant infringement. Tu jo mila by KK is a melodious tune, reflecting upon the poignant relationship between Pawan and Shahida. The rest of the songs are quite forgettable.The film's predictability, over-the-top climax and mediocre music maybe the shortfalls but performances by Salman, Nawazuddin and Harshaali are outstanding in their own right. Kabir Khan left the best parts in the second half when the 3 of them team up in Pakistan, searching for Shahida's home. Their journey is long and tedious but entertaining nevertheless. The first half was too great a burden on the film. Yet, it is Kabir Khan's best film so far, not that he has such an impressive list and it certainly is Nawazuddin's best role in a big budget film. Salman Khan proves that he can get away from stereotypical characters and almost make us believe in his earnest, religious Bajrangi Bhaijaan. 7.381 on a scale of 1-10.",

            "content": "Let me start that I was never a fan of Salman. I neither hated him nor liked him and thought most of his films are garbage but boy, Bajrangi Bhaijan (BB) just changed my mind. Everything about the movie works splendidly- even the formulaic over dramatic climax (probably the only negative point of the movie) works like a charm.Salman is simply superb as the innocent and happy go lucky pawan. His powerful performance in this movie is easily his best (or may be equals that of his performance in Tere Naam). He isn't the over the top action hero and that works like a charm. Kareena does justice to the part she was given. And do we need to say anything about Nawazuddin Siddiqui? The guy is a gem and his chemistry with Salman is superb- his impeccable comic timing just leaves you in stitches (especially the scenes with his 'begum'). But the star who steals the show is little Harshali.The angelic face, the emotive eyes- it's just cuteness overload. All in all a great job by the casting department. Coming to the movie itself, unlike Amir Khan's \"PK\", without being preachy, BB just breaks away multiple stereotypes- religion, caste and indo-pak relations. In a non-sermon way, the movie beautifully conveys a message of secularism through the character development of pawan from a RSS follower to an all-religion- embracing samaritan. Some might find the first half a tad slow but it nicely sets up the premise and characters and Kabir Khan just blows you away with the majestically made second half. The movie makes you laugh and weep at the same time and that's the beauty of it. No song seems forced and just go in flow with the movie. Even the humour is not forced and there aren't any 'comedians'. The one liners are witty and the humour is situational that is bound to at least make you chuckle if not leaving you in stitches. Background score by Julius Packiam is good and so are Pritam's tunes. Cinematography by Aseem Mishra is nothing short of phenomenal. Every frame reeks of richness and beauty.In all, BB is the definitive bollywood blockbuster. Salman proves his mettle as an actor and Kabir khan delivers a splendid film. If not for the over dramatic climax, it would have been 10/10. Salman gives his fans a magnificent Eid gift and for the casual viewer, this is a movie you shouldn't miss..",

            "content": "This is easily Salman Khan's best performance in the last decade. He plays Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi aka Bajrangi Bhaijaan who is a devout follower of BajrangBali(Lord Hanuman). Pawan is a very simple, honest, kind-hearted man. He was a terrible student and does not have a job. Nawazuddin Siddiqui plays the role of a reporter. Needless to say, Siddiqui gives a great performance. Harshaali Malhotra plays the role of the little girl and she did a wonderful job. Her plight will pull at your heartstrings. When she smiles you will also smile and when she cries it will bring tears to your eyes. Kareena Kapoor was also good as Salman's love interest but I felt her character was unnecessary.The storyline was simple and predictable. But it is not about the destination, it is how you get there. Although you can easily guess how the movie is going to end you cannot stop watching and that is where the success of director Kabir Khan lies. There are half-a-dozen songs in the movie. 'Bhar Do Jholi Meri', 'Tu Chahiye' and 'Zindagi' are good whereas the other songs are not worth mentioning.",

            "content": "Bajrangi Bhaijaan is a movie that is released for the masses. It is not meant to be an art film but an unabashed commercial movie with a singular motive to earn money. However, considering the mediocre quality of high-budget movies that have been released in recent years, this movie is a step in the right direction.The story revolves around Bajrangi played by Salman Khan who is a strict devotee of Bajrangbali and is unwilling to lie, cheat, or commit any sort of deceit. Even though some of his actions might seem silly or naive, Salman Khan pulls it off. The innocence of this character is charming. Shahida gets lost in India while returning to Pakistan. As she is just 6 and has an inability to speak, it is extremely unlikely for her to return to her home. However, on seeing the plight of this poor girl, the magnanimous Bajrangi takes it upon himself to return her safely.The supporting cast includes Kareena Kapoor and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. The latter plays a Pakistani Journalist who joins the quest to look for Shahida's home. It is yet another winning performance from this talented actor who manages to make every role seem effortless.There are a number of flaws in the movie. On a lot of occasions, creative liberties have been taken. Salman Khan manages to cross the border without a passport which is impossible. At one point in the movie, he even beats up multiple police officers who were starting to get rough towards Shahida.At the end of the day, if you are looking for a sentimental movie that touches the heart, then this is the right movie for you. It is far from perfect, but the filmmakers should be credited to make an effort in improving the current state of Hindi Cinema. Also, the innocent, wide-eyed performance by Harshali, who has no spoken lines in the movie is also good.",

            "content": "If one determines the entertainment quotient of a film from the number of times people clap while watching it then Salman Khan films will always rank higher. In the case of Kabir Khan's latest feature, the hall was deafening with rounds and rounds of sweeping applause, whistles, and general madness.Starting with reciting a warm story about a mute, Pakistani girl who gets lost on her ambitious visit to India, Bajrangi Bhaijaan focuses mainly on her adventurous trip back to her homeland that is piloted by a savagely honest young man named Bajrangi (Khan) who lives and dies by the name and values of Lord Hanuman. The narration is absolutely endearing as the protagonists take us on an emotional drive to the maximum effect that results in all of us shedding tears and creating an ocean.Somewhere in the film, a flaw or two with the plot does chafe the credibility from the setup, but it is all taken care with the introduction of a new character (Siddiqui) who is charmingly funny and really adds to the fun factor to the rest of the film. A tiny romance sub-story which reminds you of Khan's Pyar Kiya Toh Darna Kya (1991), Khan's religious innuendos which reminds you of a recent another Khan film (2014), and most of the songs picturized with ugly choreography are some elements that may force the viewer to turn his head.The humor is brilliant. Just brilliant. Because at times you will find yourself in stitches, and it all comes out as situational; nothing forced. The film also addresses the enmity between India and Pakistan and does it rather graciously. It tries to add sentimentality into the situation and highly succeeds in it, giving form to a drama that starts and ends like a tearjerker. The climax is pure melodrama and realists may want to debate on it, but that is why it is being termed a true Bollywood film, which is actually not a bad thing at all, given the list of mindless potboilers that we see every week. The little girl is just fantastic, and competes greatly with her senior co-actors. Khan's character and his portrayal are the best things that he has delivered in years, mostly because it suits him. Kicking goons high up in the air at the speed of light and asking people to form a chain of Good Samaritanship is not really enticing nor is it considered wow anymore. So when Khan dons the cap of a seemingly believable character, claps are sure to resonate.BOTTOM LINE: Bajrangi Bhaijaan is faithful to the idea of Bollywood, which means that it has emotions, it has colors, and it has drama all in the right proportions. Adding to that, when was the last time you watched a Salman Khan film and felt good about it?VERDICT: 7 stars out of 10. Sit back and shed a tear.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",

Similar is in the case of Bajrangi Bhaijaan, but the only difference, the film contains a beautiful storyline; which people usually don't find in any of his movies (last 5 years). This movie is an exception to typical Bhai movies in all departments. The film has got good direction, picturization, pleasant background score, very beautiful locations, good acting by all the Actors. This is a sheer masterpiece of Salman Khan or better say Kabir Khan. Kabir Khan, is the only director in the last 10 years who've made Salman \"act\" in a movie. Incredible job by the maestro. Little Harshaali deserves an applause for her beautiful performance as Shahida/Munni. She possibly is the cutest thing ever happened to Bollywood since a long time. Her chemistry with Salman is simply WOW. Nawaz does a decent job in the limited screenplay and has proved his excellence once again. Hats off to the Best actor of the generation. Kareena didn't get much screen presence, but the little she got; she utilized that fully with her beauty; not with acting. And finally, the Man, Salman, you'll get to see a different Salman in this movie, the one you've never expected of, the one who will make you cry, the one who will entertain you throughout, the best Salman in last 10 years. Finally, Go, Watch it for Kabir Khan and Harshaali, they are the HERO and HEROINE of the Film, Bajrangi Bhaijaan.",

He is known as the big tough hunk who just beats up people and takes off his shirt a lot to try and show off his muscle.Well, in this film, Salman Khan broke out of that. This film is not a mindless masala movie, this film was a movie in which the makers used their minds. This film was an exceptional work.First off, this film is one of the few films about Indian-Pakistani conflicts in which their is no bias towards a particular country, Second, both of the countries are shown as good and bad in ways. So, the film handled that subject from a good point of view.Second, the performances. Salman Khan, man, really showed me he can act if he wants. His performance as Bajrangi was natural, heartfelt, and simply great. You can tell he really enjoyed doing his role and gave his all into it. This I would consider to be his best performance right next to Radhe in Tere Naam. Kareena Kapoor was pretty good, even though she had a smaller role. Nawazuddin Siddiqui was hilarious, but at the same time, natural. He played the supporting role to Salman Khan really well. He did great and I think he has great future ahead of him since his last couple of films have had him giving very good performances. And who can forget the small girl (I don't know her name though). She stole the hearts of the audience and was adorable. She also acted pretty well and I think she handled herself very well.The direction and story were also very good, and the songs and music throughout the film really helped to add some emotion and some fun. All in all, this film was a very nice film that everyone should watch, People of all ages will love it.",

Though shown as someone who can't speak, the little girl steals the show with her expressions alone. The film has the great ability to touch you deep, in fact to a point that I was finding it hard to stay composed when Adnan Sami sang the Qawwaali - even though a lot of it can be put to the emotions a Muslim has for the Prophet, but it was still a good mixture of things given the situation they find themselves in.Two things that stood up for me was firstly the approach that they showed the hero takes: just simplicity and truthfulness, thus showing that he wins the people of Pakistan that he comes across not only for the great cause he undertakes but also for his truthful approach. This itself is an element that unites all religions, for every piece of religious scriptures preaches that, although full of hurdles and hardships, it is truth alone that prevails and a victory secured through it is most satisfying. Again, the approach is as great as the final goal.Secondly I would have to commend the men behind the scene for making the whole film in a manner full of little steps that entertain you throughout and despite quite a long length, the film never gets boring.The film has that touch of 'PK' (2014).",

In other hand inter-relation between two countries should be developed because it is shown that in Indian film the national flag of Pakistan is being kissed.",

            "content": "I appreciate the intention making behind this film but entertainment and intrigue value are less. Basically this film was not demanding such type of huge setup but due to star cast Director Mr. Kabeer Khan has to do it. There was just an idea in the name of story. Screenplay is very convenient but few scenes are undoubtly cute, realistic and fresh, like introduction scene of Kareena Kapoor. Dialogues by Kausar Munir, are OK. Film takes a cute start but that ended just 20 minutes, then it begins to stretch the scenes, which results slowdown of film. The baby girl is so endearing, cute and innocent that screenplay fails to convey that why any one will go up to the extent to go Pakistan just for reuniting her with family but her look convey and convince easily that any one can go. Credit goes to casting team. Flash back scenes bring smile on face. For showing main male protagonist innocent they made him stupid. Film has set in 2015 but he does not even know that going Pakistan is not a kid play, that means he never reads paper or watch TV, Which type of person he was? But he suggested good excuse in Dargah to misguide Police, this was his hidden expect, which was never even hinted before. It's hard to relate with him. Sometimes we feel pity for him and sometimes irritating too. This goes completely against Salman Khan image and personality. When makers found that film is slowing down, they suddenly made some Pakistani officer cruel otherwise they were like NGO people. Even being informed that an Indian spy is cut loose they try to make barricading with Police with stick then after some chasing they flashes gun too!? Second half is more slower than first half but pre climax takes a good start. Performance wise Salman Khan always suits more in action scenes rather than emotional but here he manages somehow to fit in emotional scenes too. Kareena Kapoor is in her comfort zone like bubbly girl. She is very good. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is a God gifted actor. He can make you laugh, emotional in just a fraction of second. Hats off to him. The baby girl #HarshaliMalhotra is amazing. If she had not been there, the emotional quotient of film shouldn't remain same. Music by Pritam is good but few tracks slows down film pace.",

            "content": "Kabir Khan, who's last film was Ek Tha Tiger with Salman Khan, was a huge disappointment according to me. I loved Kabul Express and New York. So because of those two, I went to watch Bajrangi Bhaijaan. This is the best film of Salman Khan in past 2-3 years which contains heart-touching storyline, good performances and great locations. A dumb girl of Pakistan (Harshali) missed her train from Atari to Lahore, and reached Kurukshetra where Pavan Kumar (Salman Khan) met her. He then helped her to find out her native. When he came to know that the girl was from Pakistan, then he tried his best, but, couldn't do anything. So, he himself took an oath to take that girl from India to Pakistan. Will he get success, that answer you will find out after watching the movie. Salman Khan has delivered a mature performance. Not a single frame is here where you can tell that he's doing over-acting. Kareena looks so beautiful in her tiny role. Nawazbhai is again giving a tough fight to Salman Khan. He is too good in his role, doing comedy as well as emotional scenes. Om Puri is also there in a cameo. Others are also good. But, the main hero or you can say heroine of BB is Harshali. She is damn cute. No one can control his or her emotions in the last scenes. She deserves a big round of applause. Music by Pritam is good. I don't know why Tu Chahiye and Chiken song have been put in he film. No need of them. Selfie Le Le Re song is good for Salman Khan fans as they have to shout on his entry. Bhar Do Jholi is my the most favorite from this album, sung by Adnan Sami & penned by Kausar Munir. But, the perfect suitable song of BB is Tu Jo Mila. This song is able to make tears in your eyes. Dialogues are good. Especially of Nawazuddin, they are witty and enjoyable. One plus point of the movie is that unnecessary fighting was prohibited. Cinematography is awesome. Kashmir looks like a heaven. Kabir Khan has made a heart-touchy beautiful movie, which can able to make the audience laugh as well as cry in the end. Apart from that two unnecessary songs, nothing is going to stand in the minus point's list. So, Kabir Khan has made a very good movie with Salman Khan that everyone has to watch. Bahubali is so strong movie, standing along with BB. But, I'm saying BB is better than Bhaubali for sure. Those, who are confuse between Bahubali & Bajrangi, just go for Bajrangi Bhaijaan. After watching this, you will fell so proud that you witnessed this in the theater. Meanwhile, the collection is crossed the 100cr mark!",

            "content": "Make way for a whole new Salman - Here's Bajrangi Bhaijaan,the best Salman movie to come out in recent years, where we get to see 'Actor Salman' overshadow his over-the-top \"Bhai\" persona,showcasing the lovable character Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi A.K.A Bajrangi and his effort to unite a speech- impaired child who gets lost in India,with her family in Pakistan.A light-hearted take on conquest of love and optimism over varied demarcations like religion and nationality,'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is a neatly packed entertainer that presents wholesome entertainment for all the sections of the audience ranging from the fans of Salman to the families.The film indirectly makes fun of various religious intolerances and differences,advocating the importance of brotherhood and love with an optimistic approach to the cross-border sentiments.K.V.Vijayendra Prasad's story embarks viewers on a journey with its lead characters right from the word go making use of sensible natural humor,raining emotions and innocence of the lead characters,making it difficult to take the eyes of the screen until the climax is reached.Kabir Khan has succeeded in giving full justice to the well-written screenplay with his focused narration and excellence in handling sentimental sequences in particular.The climax even though satisfactory was tad over the top and on weak side comparing with the brilliance of the rest of the story.Salman Khan & the little girl Harshaali Malhotra are a treat to watch on the screen and steals the show with their lovable performances.The innocence that both shower in their act is unmatchable and will make everyone fall in love with their characters in a flash.The transformation from an over-the-top hero to a ground-rooted man gives Salman the much needed break from his usual masala films where his characters looked repetitive on screen.Nawazuddin Siddiqui amazes yet again with his natural acting and ease in pulling out the character invested on him.The supporting cast too did their part well may it be Kareena Kapoor Khan or Mukhesh Khanna.Soulful music by Pritam and Background Score by Julius Packiam does their job well complimenting the narration with the songs \"Tu JoMila\" and \"Zindagi Kuch To Bata\" being my personal favorites.Editing by Rameshwar S. Bhagat and editing by Aseem Mishra were good.Overall,Bajrangi Bhaijaan is an engaging entertainer that blends innocence,emotions,humor,brotherhood and patriotism in right proportion.Verdict::Minor loopholes in the screenplay & the lengthy narration keeps this from being called a perfect entertainer,but nevertheless 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is an engaging affair worth watching from the cinemas for its hearty storyline & genuine performances form Salman Khan and Harshaali Malhotra.Go for it!!",

I just went expecting the typical Sallu Movie with unbelievable stunts and gimmicks which i dint like at all.. And this was the first time watching a Salman Khan movie in theater after a long time (after 1st part of Dabangg). Saw the little angel for the first time on screen.. she was totally adorable and then came the introduction of Salman Khan again gave me thoughts of the Masala movie. And I dint expect at all that this will turns out to be one of the best and lovely movie. The little Harshali Mehta outshines everyone in the movie and stole the heart of mine withe her brilliant acting without a single dialogue. Salman Khan did a wonderful job and he was pretty excellent in most of the emotional scenes and this would might turn out to be his lifetime best performance. Nawasuddeen Siddiqui was excellent in his role in the second part and totally he led the movie. A movie not to be missed.. Must Watch!!! This broke all my expectations, my initial thought was, this may fall down in the box office but it is turning out to be the India's biggest blockbuster",

No Item Number \u2013 yea- Salman Bhaijaan took a great risk in releasing such a simple film without a speck of dirt! Siddiqui Rocks as a simple small time reporter! The film shows how simplicity has become un-expectable...and even unacceptable in our world today. Nobody is ready to believe the words of a simple, truthful man. Maximum people pass him off as a mad cap or a 'mental' case! Also shows the 6th sense of children \u2013 of innocence. Out of so many people, the 6 years old girl clings to Salman because she feels or connects with his simplicity in a jiffy! The reporter proves that media is only interested in scandal and do not have the capacity to understand the importance of the really important things! Film also shows our ignorance and how we divide ourselves either on the basis of religion or man-made borders.Most amazing and shocking was the scene where the 6 years old girl reaches the sex-trade-market! Although with God's grace, she is saved instantly \u2013 but the fact that people sell and even buy such young children to sexually assault/ abuse & torture them is most shocking! How can such hotels/ brothels run in presence of police and administration is actually the question now! Although in this film the pimps don't take revenge from Salman for interrupting their business....like they did in 'Tere Naam' \u2013 by hitting him continuously against the iron tube...and making him lose all his senses! Overall \u2013 A must see- sweet film.",

Within the first ten minutes of the film, I had started crying. I never expected it to be so emotional. I wish I had gone to the cinemas to watch this. I have to say, Harshali (Munni) is the cutest girl ever. Even tough she didn't say a word, she won my heart. Her gestures and smiles are adorable. Bhaijaan, as usual, has delivered a great performance and has made us laugh along with Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who is also an important part of the film. The trio is irreplaceable and will always stay in my heart. Even though Kareena's role wasn't that big, she has done a good job keeping her place in the movie. In my opinion, this is definitely the best movie he has made to date. I love the message behind the movie because it is relevant to the current situation between India and Pakistan.

(How I wish this was true!)An implausible story made with so much conviction. love and heart that the audience wants to take it as it is served! I took it too and thoroughly enjoyed it!Performances by 'He-never-left-but-he-is-back-again' Salman Khan are totally-deliciously lovely and demands audience's belief! 'Munni' played by the most-cute-lovely Harshaali Malhotra is just super-cute-huggable- kissable-adorable character ever! I hope she grows up to a great actor and doesn't waste her life-career!Nawazuddin Siddiqui played 'Chand Nawab', a pakistani aspiring journalist who eventually becomes the 'catalyst' for the success of the story and its characters' motives, is just simply, awesomely, super-awesomely brilliant!Nawaz does NOT know how to act! He doesn't need to! He just becomes the character! I would here on this day dated July 28th, 2015 announce that I think he is the greatest Indian actor ever!I think Amitab Bachan sahab, Dilip Kumar Sahab and my favourite Late Dev Anand sahab are the gods of acting! But I would rate Nawaz sahab higher them all! For the latter just doesn't act! He just becomes the character! His \"acting\" is simply flawless! I hope I get to work with him some day!The gorgeous Kareena Kapoor didn't have much to do but what ever her character was, she did total justice to it! And she looked super-gorgeous! We all know she is a great actor but here she didn't have much to do! (BTW I love her in 'Omkara'. The cinematography by Mr. Aseem Mishra is just perfect! Perfect! Perfect! I don't think there is anything I can say which isn't obvious!The film is crisply cut and there is no lag of any sorts!The music of the film was however a big letdown! None of the songs except 'Zindagi' are memorable or has any repeat value! Super disappointed! About the direction by Kabir Khan is majorly brilliant! I have been his fan since 'kabul Express' and I have always liked his sensibilities! The same sensibilities were evidently visible here in 'BB' again. Except the climax which I feel is forced, way over-the-top melodramatic and to be honest, highly-implausible and bit cringe-worthy! But I guess he did it to serve the masses who probably all loved it!I too can appreciate the thought and the economics behind it but the logical chap inside me just won't understand it!Long story short- 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is a great, fun, family film which everyone should watch! The performances are awesome! The story is soft and gooey and delicious! The visuals are stunning, fresh and crisp! The film has a bit of 'epic' feel at times but mainly hovers over the main character 'Pavan Kumar Chaturvedi' who is just adorable, and the lovely 'Munni' is far-far more memorable and adorable then the other previous 'Munni\"!My rating: 7.5/10 (2.5 deducted for below average music and the last 10 minutes!)",

Bajrangi Bhaijaan showed me that Salman Khan movies can still be at a high level. It didn't show Salman in too much action and fights, which was good. The only gripes I have with the film are that some scenes in the 1st half is a bit slow and occasionally boring as compared to the fast paced and entertaining 2nd half.

The characters are chosen well. Hats off to the story writer. What a concept. Story is very grasping and you feel entertained throughout the movie. The movie shows you a very different side of \"Trust\". It fades away every boundary created by Man. I learnt that before anything else we are humans. Religion, Caste, Country, Food, Color everything comes nowhere. The little girl, \"Harshaali Malhotra\". has no doubt taken all the limelight just with her expressions. Kareena Kapoor was in a supporting role and has done well. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is another actor who is slowing gaining popularity in Bollywood. He seem to have very strong hold on emotions and adapts himself very well with every character that he plays. The locations are good and it shows clearly that if you have got a good story, it does not matter whether you are in India, America or a Jungle. Substance matters afterall. The best thing about the movie is that there are no items songs, no cheap comedy, perfect for Indian audiences who long for movies that can be watched with family.

Like the trailer says,Due to certain circumstances, a young mute Pakistani girl is lost in India with no way to head back to her country. Lost in India, she ends up meeting Bajrangi, kind-honest guy who makes his life's mission to help her get back to her parents. For starters, there is no super-human action sequences(except for one scene but such scenes are seen in most of the bollywood movies even if it doesn't comes under the genre of action)or any item songs which is mostly seen in movies with Salman Khan as protagonist. I'm not really a Salman Khan's fan and I really didn't like any of his recent movies but this one was bit better compared to those films. Salman Khan did a really great job and his acting was convincing enough to make you believe or see him as a simpleton with a honest\\naive heart. Kareena Kapoor character doesn't have much to offer other than as Bajrangi's love interest. Harshaali Mehta aka Munni (young Pakistani girl) makes you fall in love with her eventually as the movie goes on, with her cuteness. Nawazuddin Siddiqui was brilliant and his comic timing is really amazing. Unlike other bollywood movies where Pakistanis are shown as merciless people who hate Indians, these movie was lot reasonable in that matter. Even though i found the ending bit clich\u00e9d as I believe it could've been better, i would still say its a good-entertaining movie to watch along with your family, as it would beloved by all age group.

            "content": "A heart warming movie which I am lucky to watch after 6 months of long gap at satyam Cineplex at Nehru place, New Delhi, whatever reason of the delay may be. But then change is the only constant in life! Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi's simple, religious but stubborn and emotional character is depicted by Salman with ease, this movie will surely increase his fan followers many folds. Nawazuddin has taken himself to a different genre all together by now, he as the supportive and sensitive Pakistani reporter is simply awesome. But no words can explain the performance of the gifted child actress Harshali who has played the character of the mute and deaf girl from Pakistan lost in India. We have laughed with her, cried with her. The beauty of Kashmir and colour of Delhi have given another dimension to this movie by Kabir Khan. Karina also looks stunning, but unfortunately like any other Salman movie, actress here also has very little role to play. It also doesn't portray Pakistan as a completely evil nation, which is a good thing. The music by Pritam is descent even if not extraordinary. The best thing is you will never get bored during the entire length of the movie. However yes, there are few stereotype and melodramatic scenes - like Salman wants to cross the border without visa but with permission from Pakistani soldiers or the last scene, but when something wins your heart in straight sets you can overlook few unforced errors! 8/10 from me.",

Even if the content is not too great, his films still do well at the box office due to his huge fan following in India. I went to watch Bajrangi Bhaijaan not expecting too much in terms of cinematic value. But I was pleasantly surprised! This film was different from the films Salman usually does. The film has a great plot and all the characters were well conceived. Kabir Khan, the film's director, has done an excellent job of telling a plausible story in the format of a Bollywood film. The songs were blended very well into the narrative. Kudos to the music director, Pritam, for composing an unforgettable soundtrack. Kareena Kapoor Khan has acted well in her brief part. But the find of the film is the child artist Harshaali Malhotra, who has now become a heart-throb. All in all, the film is immensely entertaining. My rating is 9/10. You must watch it, if you haven't already. Cheers!",

A highest paid actor in business.Now narrowing the view to the movie itself. Bajrangi Bhaijaan was destined to be released on Eid. It supposed to be fun (checked), meaningful (checked) and touching (checked). BB has it all. Winner takes it all.To assess the movie, I'd like to divide it into some part, based on area that I know best.First. Actor or casts. BB has great casts. First its own producer, Salman Khan. A contemporary leading actress, Kareena Kapoor Khan. A never-fail-us- again promising actor, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, and veteran actor like Om Puri. Well, it should be blockbuster, na?Move aside to the story. Though it a bit irrelevant (in causal effect, of course) If Harshaali Malhotra (as Shahida or Munni) well- educated, it won't happen. And for Bajrangi devotee follower is no kidding. It implied that kid could see someone pure heart despite all the differences they had. I bet, as a kid, I won't even brave to follow some stranger with different religion. And BB brought it to the next level, two major clashes country, Indo-Pak. Since we know that BB has no focus on romance, we couldn't hope much, even Kareena in Gabbar is just a slight, not a good one. But in direction, it is just easy to follow. To sum up, the hero should be given to Nawazuddin instead Salman. But again, BB eagerly taught us that heart is an important thing than brain and desire.Bajrangi kasam se, mujhe kehna tha sacch hai. I'm writing in a good form, and no regret to put it as 8. It just deserve that way, even some illogical event happened.So that's it. sometime, you just be rewarded not because your bravery, simply because your pure heart. No kidding. We would live in that era rather than this. Who would do that in this era?That remain questioned.",

The movie has right amount of love, emotions, music etc. Salman's movies never looked so lovely like this. The reason that I really liked it so much is that because a little girl has overcome the stardom of Salman Khan in the film. It is not a masterpiece but surely it is one of the best of Salman. The soul of the movie is Harshali Malhotra. She looks so adorable on screen that you fell in love with her when she appears on screen.Nawazuddin nailed it by his sheer performance.He is brilliant in every frame of the movie. I watched this movie with very less expectation and that's become the main reason for liking it. The songs are placed beautifully (specially that \"chicken song\"). I will specially mention the editing aspect. The editing is perfect (crisp). Kabir khan's direction is really good. After this movie I have high expectation from his films now onwards.

            "content": "My take on Bajrangi Bhaijaan (BB) (2015) Salman Khan (SK) tries to be the peace correspondent between two countries which are politically conflicting and unsettling through his new flick. Looks like Bhai is now brand ambassador of being peace. Jokes apart let's see what Sallu has to offer us this time. Plot: The story is straight forward easy to guess emotional drama that one could understand from watching the trailers. It is the mission of an ordinary man to help a mute Pakistani girl join her parents who got lost all the way in India. So the crux is travelling to Pakistan with no clue about the lost girl's place and to add up fuel to fire is he is a Hindu, who is straight forward and speaks no lies and a vegetarian. Will he be able accomplish this mission forms the second half of the film where the real story begins. Now this is where I felt though the movie is a drama which overall seems to be realistic but I would it's just a sentimental camouflage. Each and every step that he takes to unite the girl is completely out of logic. But the director succeeds making the audience weep then and there in the movie. Also not to forget where the director has show values of both Hinduism and Islam throughout which spreads love and not war. Cast: Definitely this is going to be a special film in SK's career because he has refrained from his usual super hero image, macho man flaunting fighting all baddies. SK as Pawan Kumar Chautrvedi has succeeded in looking as an innocent fellow who is a strict Hanuman devotee. Kareena kapoor has given a decent performance as Rasika a School teacher with her convincing de glamorized looks wearing different salwars throughout. Strictly she was given good screen space in the first half. The real hero of the movie is the super cute Harshaali Malhotra who damn convinces the audience with her naive looks as a Pakistani mute girl. She never spoke a word but this mini katirna stole all the hearts. I would say the complete victory of this flick goes to this girl. Nawazudin convinces us as a small time Pakistani reporter. Good choice of support cast to portray people of Pakistan. On the down side apart from complete logic mishandling would be the songs which merely added length to the runtime. The melodramatic romance in the first half could have been cut short so we could have enjoyed a film of 120-130 mins. Verdict: Bajrangi Bhaijaan would be a full family entertainer which has emotional flavour throughout provided we leave all our logical and practical thinking in home. I would rate overall 6/10. But only for super cute Harshalli Malhotra it would be a special 10 on 10 I am sure she will grab lots of awards as the best child artist for the year. NB: Both BBs (Bahubali and Bajrangi bhaijaan) are doing great in box office the story and screenplay of both were penned by K. V. Vijayendra Prasad father of the Ace director SS Rajamouli.",

The movie benefits greatly from the 'superb' performance from the lead child artiste and an 'absolutely brilliant' performance from the ever-reliable Nawazzudin Sidiqqui who is the real 'scene- stealer' in the second half . Though we do have sequences where cinematic liberties are aplenty and logic takes a bit of a backseat, Kabir Khan deserves due credit for his presentation style which rarely goes 'overboard' or 'preachy' in-spite of the sensitive subject he had chosen. Pritam's music is another 'top-notch' factor in this movie which is 'sincere', has its 'heart at the right place' and deserves it's minor flaws to be ignored :)",

This is a kinda movie that we have all been wishing from Bollywood. The incredible performance of Navazudheen Siddiqui is another highlight of the movie. Though we know Navaz as good actor from his earlier movies this movie puts him into spotlight.He Even though, the movie is highly dramatic, we enjoy each and every moment in the movie. Salman did good in his role and this film never had a moment of unwanted heroism stuff, like we always see in his other movies. Kareena Kapoor doesn't have much role still she did good. Harshaali Malhotra, the little girl, Shahida, is one of the cutest kids ever. Everyone would instantly fall in love with cute little girl. If the movie is a box office hit, it is a well deserved one.This movie was released at a time when the tension between India and Pakistan began to rise again.

            "content": "So this has been for coming for a long time but I have to put this out in the open. Bajrangi Bhaijaan is one of the most dumb, unrealistic, over the top movie I have ever seen. I have seen most of Salman Khan's movies and I have LOVED it because Salman Khan's movies doesn't take itself so seriously. THIS movie on the other hand takes itself so seriously as if it has the most real situation in the world.The movie revolves around Munni, a girl from Pakistan who gets separated from his mother and ends up in the lap of Salman. Now it is the moral job of Salman to get her back to her mother.I can't even begin from where the movie starts to become wrong. There are songs. There you go. For a movie which looks like an emotional journey of a man who is an extremely religious person to get an innocent girl across the border shouldn't have songs. No movie producer has the balls to not commercialize the movie which is based on a serious topic. There are stupid jokes. More songs. They cross the border by making a \"promise\"? How much more stupid can it get? Then there is the usual melodrama of people getting to know about this man's journey via social media and smart phones for some product placement. People getting together across the border to get Bajrangi across the border. And just when I think the melodrama is about to end the girl talks. Oh did I forget to mention that the girl was a partial mute? Well there was that and she starts to talk again.Bollywood spent hundreds of years to come out of the stereotypical masala movie plots and here we are again. People are gobbling up this? I am amazed. If I talk about the acting. Salman is what he does. He plays Salman on the big screen. He never gets into character. He is just Salman, but there is his trick. He never takes himself so seriously that is why it doesn't seem to be a problem. But the premise of the movie makes it so obvious that Salman had to get in character to portray the role, to make it his own. Nawazudin Siddiqui continues to amaze me with his wide range of acting skills. Kareena Kapoor has reached a stagnancy. All she does looks forced and as if she IS acting. The girl who plays Munni has more acting chops than Kareena Kapoor, and that is saying something.If you are a fan of Salman, you won't be disappointed. If you are a fan of no-brainer, masala, Hindi movies, you won't be disappointed. If you are the mature audience then it is certainly not for you.",

            "content": "\"Bajrangi Bhaijan\" is a decent effort by Kabir Khan after pretentious \"Ek Tha Tiger\". However, it again has cross-border propaganda like his other movies. He has this keen eye for showing India & Pakistan liaison, which has been a fiery dispute since 1947, leaving many people dead probably every hour. People are susceptible and ferocious about this.Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi (Salman Khan) is a benevolent man with adoration for god Bajrangbali, meets Munni (Harshali Malhotra) who is lost in India when returning to Pakistan by Samjhauta Express. Now, Pawan has to take her home against all odds. The problem is that Munni is mute.The story is meek and totally depends upon suspension of disbelief. It has all the clich\u00e9d and used ingredients like to be part of crores club. On the other hand, it portrays the humane side of Pakistan, how people are helping a person who has crossed lengths and is hell-bent to take a mute girl to his parents. It touches your emotional chords at the perfect time.\"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" also refrains from touching any sensitive issues which can disrupt the communal harmony.Harshaali looks charming with speaking a single word and blooms with the subtle smile on her face. She and Salman have an impeccable chemistry.It also has Kareena Kapoor Khan (Rasika) who fills the gap of being love-interest of Pawan and gives usual expressions as we see in every other movie.The real scene stealer is Nawazuddin Siddiqui (Chand Nawab) a freelance reporter; he tickles your funny bones with perfect timing. Every time he appears on the screen, it looks that we are watching a different movie.The cinematography is vivid as it pacifies your eyes when we see the landscape of Kashmir in aerial and long shots. The background score also flows with the story but in many scenes, it goes pretty loud with some gratuitous slow-motion scenes. Songs do not add anything but are a hindrance to the story.However, unlike Salman's every movie, this does not go over the top because Salman does not punch goons and lets them fly in the sky, does not leave a bicycle a centimeter away from the running train or drive a London number plate bus in Poland. This time he is no \"Devil\" and he transpires into heart and mind at the same time. He plays this part with ease and charm.A perfect treat for Salman's fans which gets melodramatic at the right time.",

            "content": "Went to watch Bajrangi Bhaijaan yesterday in the noon show,occupancy was around 75% for my show.Let's begin: Bajrangi Bhaijaan is a story of an innocent naive UP guy settled in Delhi and his love for a little mute Pakistani girl which knows no limits.It is this love,his magnanimous spirit and some circumstances which leads Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi aka Bajrangi to take this girl to her parents in Pakistan.The film starts off well with the scenes of little girl Shahida(named after \"Shahid\" Afridi) and her parents.She's taken to India with her mom to seek blessings for her in a much revered Dargah.On their return to Pakistan,the little girl somehow manages to miss the train.And there she is all alone,with no voice of her,lost in an alien country.Arrives our Bhai,who is greeted with whistles and claps as usual.After clicking few selfies,Bajrangi meets the little girl Shahida who he now calls Munni(bhai still in Dabangg mode).He decides to take her home,on their way Bajrangi confronts some passengers in the bus who are greatly interested in knowing his back story,so bajrangi begins reciting his back story.This part really dragged on,full of forced comedy and irritated me after a point.The romantic part of salman and kareena(her cheeks appeared too pink) is a bit half baked one.There are funny scenes in this half though,like the one in which Munni is found grabbing a chicken leg or the one where she starts dancing seeing Pak win over India(quite goofy though,they shown the same match at the beginning of the film too).Then there are quite a few emotional ones too,Munni(played by Harshali Malhotra) and Bajrangi share a cracking chemistry.The little girl is sure to win hearts just by her cuteness.Music is strictly average and nowhere in comparison to salman's last few blockbusters.Tu chahiye,Chicken song(plain awful,was'nt required at all) does'nt work.First half was above average for me,though it ends quite well.Second half is all about Bajrangi's hardship,his journey to take Munni to Pakistan without passport,Visa crossing border beneath the boundary wires.Kabir Khan has enjoyed quite a few cinematic liberties but most of them can be overlooked.Second half is much better than the first.The pace improves which was a bit sluggish throughout the first half,Salman's looks' improves,he now dons a rugged look which suits him much more than the clean shave one and last but not the least,this half has Nawazuddin Siddique! Believe me,he got the similar applause as was received by Salman.And when he joins Bajrangi and munni,they create some of the most memorable moments of the film.Bhar do jholi song works well.Last 45 min. of the film are really high on emotional quotient.You feel for Bajrangi when he gets bashed by the police,in fact there was stun silence in the theatre which proves the audience were quite moved.The climax is one of the best I have witnessed in recent times,last few scenes were too poignant for me to handle.And yes Bajrangi Bhaijaan made me shed few tears.And I loved the song Tu Jo Mila sung by my fav. KK which plays at the end of the film.On the whole Bajrangi Bhaijaan is Salman's best film in years and it deserves to be lauded,audience were quite happy film which makes me to say without any doubt that at the box office Bajrangi Bhaijaan should cross Dhoom 3,though surpassing PK would prove difficult.And if it sustains well on the weekdays,then it could well be Salman's first 300crs grosser.Overall it's a 3.75/5 from my side!",

Acting: All four actors are really good in their roles. Nawazuddin outdoes himself - again. As Chand the reporter, he is terrific as a slightly-comic supporting character. As well as the little girl, she is adorable! Kareena Kapoor has a minimum role but does well. But finally, the real star...... Salman Khan! He produced this, so he knew this character, which help him perform a brilliant performance. The best thing about Bajrangi Bhaijaan is that every scene makes you want to watch more, like in the cinema, at the interval. Another thing to point about is that the film has a bit of all ; comedy, romance, drama, action. The most touching scene in the whole two and a half film is the last five minutes of the climax. Beautiful! Thirdly, the movie is very original, there is no movie like it in the Twenty-first century. Fourthly, this is a movie Salman has never done. He normally does the same action movie again and again. But , the choice to do this movie was his best in his career. Finally, songs like Bhar Do Jholi and Tu Jo Mila stays with you for the rest of the WEEK! But the film stays with you for the rest of the MONTH!Overall, all credit goes to Kabir Khan. Without him, the film would be AS good as it is. In basic words, let you and your family to watch this movie!",

            "content": "What comes to your mind when you hear Eid? Muslims, Festivity etc etc and if you luckily are a Bollywood fan then of course a Salman Khan movie which always gets hyped a lot but in the end turns out to be a film with catchy dialogues, a bit too much of the He-Man shows, a lossy plot line and few groovy songs. Butt! And this is a huge Butt, things turns out to be a different in the case of the newly out Bajrangi Bhaijaan. This movie is something that might ask you to love Salman Khan in his very own way no matter how anti-Salman you are. The movie provided the perfect platform for Salman to use his comedic instincts, his combat-by-hand moves and create love on the screen not with the heroine which ultimately did't had too much to offer but love with a sweet bubbly girl who eventually made the whole cinema blush. The movies actually starts to offer the real thing after the interval but isn't the worst of things to watch before the interval. It makes you smile with small acts, sometimes with a witty dialogue and sometimes through amusing actions. It's not Salman Khan or the cute girl all the way for the film. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as always did justice to his humongous talent. NS does not only makes you laugh at times but also portrays the sentiments in probably the best way possible. Your perceptions regarding Salman Khan movies will not only be rectified but also about Pakistan. Not showing the false- yet-mainstream terrorist idea about Pakistan, it shows the real-yet- hidden generosity of Pakistani People and the immense beauty. Bushes have thorns and bullocks have horns, the movies does have a few plot holes but the climax of the film will make you forget them all and in case you are a bit emotional it might also bring the tears of joy from your eyes. It's a must watch for all the anti-Salman peeps out there and in case you are not, I know you will watch this film anyways. You will not feel regret after watching it.",

As I am INDO-PAK relations move fan this one was a truly memorable one. The feeling I got after watching last years Haider was the same I got after watching Bajrangi Bhaijaan, and I wish this could be equally awarded at the film-fares as well. All the characters played their role very well , I know everyone is talking about Salman and Harshaali but the Cameo of Om Puri and role of Nawazuddin sidhiqui and Karina should also be appraised. Salman had done some intense roles like in Tere Naam and Bodygaurd but this one was different from those because as Bajrangi aka Pawan he looked very cute and innocent. The way he weeped and showed emotions was superb . I may wish that he would gain film-fares for his fantastic performance as well. Harshaali Malhotra is been applauded these days because she was really totally adjusted in the role of a mute girl seeking for help to get her home back. I am a bit of film critic and would have given the movie 9 points but for you Harshaali the extra point is rewarded to the movie by me. Not to forget the work of Kabir Khan who just like me loves IndoPak topic and makes the movies on them. The screenplay , direction , cinematography of the movie were just fabulous. The whole cast and crew had worked totally hard to bring down this movie and is congratulated by me for their work.

The wide photograph with back ground music at the start of the movie reminded me of Sound of Music. On the contrast it is still one of the best directed movies of Kabir Khan to fuse the tension between a two countries which is vital at this moment when USA as made a pact with Iran. Of course with the a child and a caring human being one can forgive all past follies and forget the tensions while we are enjoying this drama of human affection.Fulfilling a promise to one's higher power for a child is universally built in human beings across the globe and Salman khan has given his best ever in this role which surpasses all his past roles. His heart and his actions are very real and it is likely not just acting. Funny yet very emotional and the best . Must watch. The cinema hall was full with eclectic population of folks from different countries.",

From the very beginning we see how selfless Pawan is not being able to abandon Munni and making it his mission to bring her back to her parents. He won people over with his optimistic attitude and innocence in only doing the right thing. It's ending will have you in tears,guaranteed! I can't praise the acting enough, especially for the little star, Harshali. She has proved to have such a bright future ahead of her. Salman had already won me over with previous movies and this one had me to the point of no return. Kareena Kapoor was stunning in her role and Newazuddin was hilarious! I loved how although Pawan had a clear dislike toward Muslims in the beginning, he came to understand the religion and even embrace it. Though I believe more could have been done to unite these two religions...I laughed and wept and couldn't take my eyes off the screen. This is definitely one movie I will have no problem seeing again and again...and again.",

It's a movie which symbolizes togetherness between the two nation and religion, the story of the movies is predictable but still the director did a very great job of presenting a predictable plot in an unpredictable way.Talking about the actors all of them did a great job,each actor takes the movie to higher notch but in the end it's the trio of SALMAN ,NAWAZ and HARSHALI that stays with you after the movie, OM Puri was phenomenal in his short but meaningful appearance.The songs are good albeit few of them were unnecessary but the best ones were Zindagi Kuch Toh Bata and Bhar Do Jholi Meri , both of them were audio as well as visual treat.The climax of the movie is something which I can't define in mere words,it is an overwhelming and unforgettable experience which can only be witnessed once you see this movie in the theaters and I am sure you will come out with damp eyes and a huge smile on your face after watching this movie.Make your weekend count by rushing to the theaters near you to enjoy the beautiful journey of BAJRANGI and MUNNI and trust me this is a movie which cannot be missed even if an apocalypse strikes!!!!!!!",

            "content": "It has been a long time since I have enjoyed a movie so much, and this too a Salman Khan movie. I am not really a Salman Khan fan. I did not enjoy the Dabang movies, I thought Kick was a time-pass and generally I find his acting to be a bit OTT.So Bajrangi Bhaijan was not at the top of my list of movies to watch. However, as my family wanted to see it, I was dragged along. I had no idea I would fall in love with the characters of this movie, and that I would actually cry. I am a fully grown man and I almost never cry in a movie, and I was crying several times during this movie! That is almost like magic.Kabir Khan showed me he was a director to look out for in Kabul Express, which is quite an underrated movie. I could see his skill in pacing scenes, the comic timing and the interesting chemistry he could create between actors through snappy dialogue, humour and well edited scenes. This was not as well achieved in New York and in Ek Tha Tiger, but still I could see that he knows the pulse of a scene and how to create emotions. In Bhajrangi Bhaijan, which is definitely his best work so far, he gets the emotions, the timing and pulse of the scene just right. You laugh when you are suppose to laugh, you cry when you are suppose to cry, and you get angry when you are suppose to get angry. So few directors in Indian cinema have properly been able to manage the juggling act of Indian aesthetic of managing several emotional tones. Bhajrangi Bhaijan succeeds to a large extent creating a truly poignant and moving experience. And I would say the credit goes to Kabr Khan for making it work so well.The very first thing you notice about Bhagrangi Bhaijan is the scale of production as the credits open, with stunning helicopter shots of snow snapped mountains. The cinematography and editing are top grade . As Salman Khan's first production this is a class debut production. All technical credentials are top notch .The screenplay is the second thing that this movie gets very right. While the story is simple of taking a child back home to her mother, but what makes it interesting is the humorous situations and interesting characters. The characters are all lovable and humane people, Salman Khan as the innocent, kind-hearted and simple Bhajrangi Bhaijan is the most interesting character Salman Khan as played. You fall in love with the character. The situations and the dialogues are all funny and snappy, there are quite a few laugh out loud moments in the movie. The comedy is never forced or contrived, but works because of some genuinely hilarious situations and witty dialogue, supported by a director who knows the beats of his scenes.The chemistry between the three main characters is what makes this movie so lovable. Salman Khan is unusually restrained, and is able to convey the simplicity and innocence of Bhajrangi Bhaijan. Hashali is super cute as the mute girl, and her lack of expressions actually works in her favour. The real star of the show in acting is Nawazudin Siddiqui as the Pakistani reporter who is proving that he was one of the best actors in India today, his witty dialogue delivery can make the most banal of charters a riot. Kareena Kapoor as Bharang Bhaijan's girlfriend is competent in a minor role.Where Bajrangi Bhaijan loses a point is its lack of realism, which is a common problem in all of Kabir Khan's movies where he treats politically charged issues, particularly terrorism and India- Pakistan tensions in a light hearted comic manner. Bhajrangi Bhaijan takes place in a Bollywood fantasy world, where Border Security Forces and police officers are humane and friendly, where Imams in Mosques are religiously pluralistic, where Pakistani public are democratic and can overturn their governments decision, where Muslims do not hesitate to say \"Jai Shri Ram\" and prostate to the Hindu Monkey god Hanuman. Sweet, idealistic, and totally off the mark in reality. But when it is presented in such a heartfelt manner, with a sincere message of religious harmony and lovely humane characters, snappy dialogues and humour that you can't help but suspend disbelief. So I did. The other area where the movie loses a point is in the regularity of the songs, in the first half of the movie I felt there were too many songs, and a few could have easily been avoided because it felt like a musical, especially the Chicken Song. Fortunately, in the second half there are lesser songs. Otherwise the songs are melodious, hummable and well integrated, but none were memorable.I am definitely looking forward to Kabir Khan's next Phantom, and the initial teaser seems to show us we may have another winner on our hands, and this time I won't have to be dragged into the cinema.",

And he is refreshingly not the typical dude ready to throw punches in the air at any moment.He is the antithesis of a typical Salman Khan character; he is modest, peaceful and bows down even when he spots a monkey. Pawan meets Kareena Kapoor Khan when he comes to Delhi from UP to stay with his father's friend's family. The little girl in question, played by Harshaali Malhotra, is a scene-stealer from the very word go. She has an angelic face and expressive eyes, and good luck holding back your tears each time she sheds her own. Director Kabir Khan gives us some charming moments between Salman and her, starting with the bits when it dawns on him that she is neither brahmin nor kshatriya like he'd assumed. The film uses humor as a tool to address deep-set religious prejudices, like the one Pavan's landlord harbors against his meat-eating Muslim neighbors, or even Pavan's own discomfort about stepping into a masjid. There's also, conveniently, a romantic track with Kareena Kapoor, who, in only a few well-scripted moments reminds us just how good an actress she is, but who sadly seems content playing a largely decorative role.",

The two drives the film to win heart of the people with their chemistry. Nawazuddin has short though powerful as well as most important role in that film. He acts so naturally that even salman khan's magic fades beside him. Kabir khan uses kareena to support salman in the first half and her beauty at this age is still astonishing.

Salman Khan has proved once again, he is still capable of brilliant spot on acting. The chosen subject was a very delicate one. It is based on some harsh realities regarding IndoPak border and travel. It is truly unfortunate for the common folk who still have families and loved ones across these borders. One of the main reasons i voted this movie so high is cause of the cast. The little girl is so cute and sweet, you fall in love with her from the start right till the end. Even though she had no dialog in the movie, she did an unbelievable job of keeping you glued onto your seats for more of that cuteness. Costumes and sets were spot on, and did not feel misplaced for a moment. The director had a firm grip right till the end and knew his business.

But what I witnessed from frame one was entertainment with a lot of heart..It's been a very long time since I've seen Salman portrayed as someone from planet earth.. Here's why; he takes punches, he wears normal clothes, he rides normal vehicles, he genuinely jokes, he emotes and, he talks like a normal person. Above all, he genuinely acted! Kabir Khan deserves a standing ovation for this achievement.Nawazuddin, Kareena and Om Puri did their roles brilliantly.. But the real hero's were Harshaali and her mom (don't know her name and for some strange reason not listed any where).. Harshaali's mom did a brilliant job in every scene she had appeared. Although not a word spoken by Harshaali, her emotions were enough to keep the audience engaged for 2.45 hours.Overall, this movie is a must watch and I would say brilliant in every aspect (can't believe I said that for a Salman movie).. and above all, my dad kept awake all throughout the movie! :pOverall rating: 10/10",

I grew up a Salman khan fan, so I am naturally biased though his acting has not been great in his last few films. Salman Khan is a true entertainer, and is not necessarily a great actor. However, this movie just made me like Salman Bhai even more. His acting, expressions and emotions were a treat to watch. Salman gives his very best and excels in key areas such as Comedy, anger, drama, love, pain, action. Really proud of Salman Khan!!There are so many moments in this movie that will make you tear up, not just because of sad moments but also because of the heart warming scenes with the little girl on the screen.No words to describe the little girls's acting, brilliant talent for such young age, and this is where we must give big credit to Kabir khan too, for bringing out such beautiful expressions and acting from the child. Nawaz was used perfectly for the role! He never fails to deliver.I only wish this was a little tighter by cutting down on a song or two. This is now one of my favorites in Hindi Cinema.

Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Chand Nawab got a crucial role to play which he justified it at ease. Om Puri as Molana for a special appearance in the movie did really special in his short role. The songs are good, but the best ones were Zindagi Kuch Toh Bata and Bhar Do Jholi Meri. The captain of the ship, director Kabir Khan had drove the movie very smoothly with unforgotten humorous and emotional scenes. Nearing to the end of the movie had some scenes that cannot be described in any words, absolutely speechless, one need to witness and experience them.",

Nor am I into the fan club of movies which make 500 or 1000 cores just because of a Khan face, for obvious reasons. But as they say 'exceptions are always there'. And Bajrangi Bhaijan just nailed it big time.Starting from the big name Salman Khan, who is at his dumbest best in this movie. Right from Andes Anna Anna and bodyguard etc etc, I doubt if Bellwood could ever find any actor to play a dumb character this brilliantly as he does. He was so much into the character that his diesel's, bikers and even the exhibitionism of his so overrated physique, was not missed at anytime. I can safely assume and fear that he will readily be accepted and he will continue to look awesome playing a hero in the debut movie of Harshaali (lil girl in the movie) as a heroine after 10 years or so.I don't know how to put it but let's say that the fair of insanely cute smile and innocence of Harshaali (Munni/Shahida) will sweep you off your feet. She will catch your attention so deeply throughout that you will grin when she smiles and her tears will keep breaking your heart. You don't normally get to see this much adorable and sweet kids in a Bellwood movie. Even her acting was flawless for a 6 years old kid.I remember, when, quite a few years back, Chand Nawab's erred PTC went viral on internet and amused viewers to the core. And very rightly and genuinely, it was conceived by the director and tremendously impersonated by Nawaz Siddiqui. Who is seriously yet hilariously comical and highly subtle in a major character role. He, yet again, promises to go a long way in Bellwood.Like any other Kabeer Khan's directorial, the plot is very strong. Especially, the image of Pakistan, he portrayed in the movie is far from 'd\u00e9j\u00e0 VI'. However, there are some direction glitches while showing the areas of Pakistan, especially wall chalking and sign boards in Urdu were not up to the mark in terms of their font. But again, he took a very smart and courageous step to depict a positive and soft image of Pakistan and its people for which he should be credited to a fairly good extent.Aamir Khan was not modest but very factual while stating that this movie deserves breaking the record of PK, for me, PK was not even near to be compared with Bajrangi Bhaijan apart from the acting brilliance of Aamir Khan. And SRK can come this far in his dreams only. Rest, a humble suggestion, watch this movie on the big screen only or you will regret later like me !!",

Everybody should watch this movie to come out of normal masala love story trend.Salman is totally different in this movie. He will definitely gain a lot of new fans after this movie. He has changed his image through the \"Being Human\" character.Kabir has handled balance between 2 religions very well. While narrating a script where 2 religions and 2 countries are involved especially India and Pakistan, its definitely not easy.

            "review_title": "Bajrangi Bhaijaan: A surprisingly feel good movie",
            "content": "When a group of my friend insisted me to watch a Bollywood movie I had two choices. Salman Khan's seemingly mindless flick, \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" or an VFX intensive \"Bahubali\". For my geek oriented mind the later was an obvious choice. But as it turned out choice was a myth and I was dragged to the theaters for Bajrangi Bhaijaan.Now, I am not a Salman fan. I like him as a guy, but despise his movies a lot. At least which came out from past few years. So when I went to watch this movie I had totally zero expectations. The formulaic approach of releasing movie on festivals like Id, I totally thought this was also going to be a mindless no-brainer and an insult-to-Physics action movie.So believe me when I say that you have got to see this movie! It shattered most of my expectations and proved to be a game changer for his stereotypical role that had become of Salman in recent times. And I am not exaggerating.Bajrangi Bhaijaan is a story of a Pakistani girl who gets lost in India, and later meet Salman Khan, who after some incidents makes reuniting the girl with her family his mission.The little girl a child actress \"Harshaali Malhotra\" is one of the cutest I have ever seen. She is speech impaired in the story, but what she lacked makes up by her cuteness and expressions that won my heart many times over.I was hooked right with the opening scene of the movie itself which I found commendable. When Salman is introduced in typical hero fashion (with a song) all those apprehensions about his recent kind of movie started to appear in my mind. But as the movie progressed those slowly faded away and what shaped till the end of first half was a movie I appreciated with my hands open. The character of Salman is that of the guy in Aparichit. A guy who doesn't lie since he believes he is a true devotee of Hanuman. Little does it helps him achieving his mission.There are many good actors who are also introduced slowly, like Nawazuddin Siddiqui, whose presence provided big comic relief to the movie in later half. Om Puri also have a small guest role.What I loved about the movie is that there are situational comedy all over the film and yet it feels very serious. No character seems out of place or stretched. What I also loved about the film is that Salman isn't a larger than life character and story shows him as a common man. Well mostly. It was obvious that Salman would kick some behinds of people but it's only on one occasion in this film and if we spare some of the emotional drama that happens at the climax, this film was pure fun to watch.On musical side, leaving couple of songs, every other song was good to hear. Song from Adnan Sami was a delight. Most of the songs was in the shape of background score which you can't miss due to its tie up with the story. I only found one bad song about chicken but that was just an exception rather than the norm. And this is where you can take a break to have some air. But buckle up after that since rest of the movie will be some ride.This movie on some levels made be speechless. Probably because I had some other expectations. If anyone remember the film Lucky: No Time for Love, which came out exactly ten years ago. Lucky had Sneha Ullal in lead female role and was one of the rare Bollywood movies that I totally loved. Lucky had a similar theme to that of Bajrangi Bhaijaan. Salman met Sneha in a terrible scenario of war, and made reuniting Sneha to her family his mission. The film had a heart that touch on various emotional states of human mind on many levels. Bajrangi Bhaijaan greatly made me feel the same.But while Lucky had failed miserably, Bajrangi I feel have the potential of being a blockbuster. At least I hope so since the taste I have for movies doesn't always appear to be a mass favorite. Not a lot of Salman movies have impressed me, yet Bajrangi felt like a blow of fresh air. Something which I would have easily missed because of my presumptions. This movie is a must watch because of its story, its music and its characters. Also because of the glimpses of Pakistan that it shows in the second half. Its a must watch for its good intentions and because of the little girl that made me smile without even a single dialogue.Rated it so high since it's in Bollywood scale and for its intents.",

            "content": "What a masterpiece! It mesmerized me in the opening scene: shot of gorgeous Himalayas. And I'm still in trance. An excellent portrayal of co-existence of various beliefs and cultures in sub continent. Hero is a very simple, not-so-smart religious Hindu man in Delhi, who stumbled upon a lost 6yo Pakistani girl who is also mute, and out of sheer humanity took it upon himself to find her parents. Without any clue. In sub-continent that's his only option. No agency / institution can do anything because of the animosity between the two countries. If he dumps her, and he tried, she will fall into the wrong hands faster than he could cross the street. Now he has to somehow find her city, and then her parents, in an enemy country. This movie shows the triumph of humanity. There is far more love than hatred between the people of the two countries. Movie highlights things like differences over food (hindus are vegetarians and Pakistanis are meat lovers, mostly), praying (how uncomfortable and guilty one gets stepping in other religion's temple, even if it's to seek a temporary refuge) and ever present political unrest. It also shows the sub continent cultural gems. Sleeping under the sky burning mosquito repellent, old school wrestling in dirt rings, larger than life India-Pakistan cricket rivalry, cruel yet incompetent police on both sides, greedy media, religious festivals in streets, shrines, belief in prayers, sporting mustaches etc. Casting couldn't be better. 6yo girl looks like younger sister of Malala. Too cute. Salman khan as Bajrangi Bhaijan is too awesome to describe. Karina Kapur is brilliant as a next door Indian girl representing the non racist and educated younger generation. Generation that stands up for their and other's rights. Jokes are hilarious. Sound track is awesome.",

Mr Khan enthrals us with his performance as an actor . Somehow , he reminds us of another great actor Mr Sanjeev Kumar . The character is multi faceted Innocent , naive , strong yet stupid , loving but has his bigotry , committed but has flaws in his nature, simple but strong willed , sticks to his own rules but doesn't bend or break them , can fight but chooses not to fight !!! We can go on and do an In depth analysis of this complex character who appears simple , that's just due to mastery of the portrayal of this role ! Everybody seems to be going gaga over the other two main characters in this film , they fail to notice the understated yet powerful performance of Mr Khan. People need to stop bringing in and highlighting the personal lives of the star of this film . Instead if they focused on the performance they will realise that here is one guy who can do it all and do it all with his own trademark style. The Director should get a particular mention here as he knew what he was doing and at no point he let the audience down at the same time gave us what he wanted to serve rather than what we expected , true hall marks of a visionary story teller. Mr Kabir Khan thanks a million for this wonderful journey which people call as a film ! You've done justice to the lead character and to the supporting roles without undermining any of their presence. The film world will look back in time and wonder at this Marvellous jewel called Bajrangi Bhaijaan. It's a true landmark in history of movie making. I wish you more and more success . And Mr Salman Khan , we wish that you could provide us more than an occasional glimpse of your true acting talent . You've proved that you are on par or even better than your two fellow compatriots ( Khans as well ) Thanks again for entertaining us .

The Movie is high on emotion with story and a lot of good and honest performances from its lead and supporting casts.Salman is in rocking form with this movie and gives an honest and brilliant performance which is quite different from his usual movies(comedy and lots of action), he shines throughout the movie and in all scenes.The Other major character is played by the little cute girl Harshaali Malhotra, she is very good in her role and performs very well and lights up the screen each time she appears in a scene, everything from her expressions and acting.Nawazudding Siddiqui is another actor who is cast perfectly in his role and his chemistry with Salman Khan is magical and each of their scene together is great to watch and Nawaz has a pivotal role in this movie. His comic timing is also great, he should do a comedy film too.Kaeeena Kapoor is beautiful and as her previous films with Salman Khan shares great chemistry with him in this too.All the supporting casts Om Puri, Sharad Saxena and others have done a good job.Kabir Khan has a Gem of a movie this time and has done a great job behind the screen, his best till date, the amount of emotion this film has, he has handled it well.The Cinematography is brilliant and has captured the beautiful locations in the movie the way it should be and the background score along with the music is great and has all the songs which you will enjoy especially the initial selfie song, to the Qawwali as with all the other songs. The action is good and is at the right places in the film.Please note: I am giving a 10/10 review to this movie(instead of 8), as to average all the reviews, so that this Awesome Family movie is not missed by any one and watched by all because this movie should be considered on the lines of all Major Family Entertainers of Bollywood.Go get entertained with this Entertainer.",

Harshaali, the young girl who acted as Munni, has done a good job with her role; but the best actor of the movie was Nawazuddin Siddiqui - he played an excellent role in assisting Salman Khan and occasionally taking charge of situations. I was very impressed with his acting. Kareena Kapoor's role was too short to be of significance - I wish she could have been given a greater role to play.Overall, I would say it is an entertaining comedy-drama with you can watch with family, but don't go expecting it to be an adventure-thriller with a technically strong script, otherwise you'll be disappointed.",

            "content": "It takes great character to do something different. Firstly credit to Kabir Khan for a great film,the guy deserved a blockbuster 200cr+ movie in his CV.I was pretty impressed by the 'kabul express' movie made by the same director.Coming back to my first sentence of this review,it takes great character to do something different.The reason I say this is because definitely salman khan didn't need to give a performance like the one he has given in Bajrangi. The last 8 years are witness to his stardom and ability to attract the masses and set ringing the cash registers and most of the movies in this time period were well putting it mildly,short of any great story or exemplary acting still each of those movies were good enough to cross the 100cr mark. This is why I say that Salman Khan has great character,He didn't need to act or rather didn't even need to do this movie where there is just 1 action sequence but still the man has come forth and done an incredibly great movie where we see a salman khan before he became a superhero without a mask or an alter ego. This is the salman khan Bollywood needs but might not deserve.Recent years suggest High on content movies don't do much business as compared to the original 'BHAI' films.Great movie,great acting by the little girl,Harshali.I hope we see her in more movies. A must watch for people who haven't liked salman Khan for the past few years and to all the other movie goers too!!",

            "content": "This movie is warm, joyous, heroic, exciting, aesthetic and just plain fascinating. The cast is irresistible. Literally.Bajrangi Bhaijaan is one of the best films I've ever seen, and I'm an old-timer who's seen around 4000, including most of the top-rated films of the last century. My wife and I fell in love with it. Our daughter saw it later and said it was the BEST movie she'd ever seen.When we saw it at its first local release (with what seemed to be an all-Indian audience, apart from us), the movie had an IMDb rating of 8.5. Given that tastes differ, that's about what I would have predicted.To my surprise, the overall ratings dropped to 8.2 after U.S. voters started weighing in. I was shocked (and frankly, ashamed) that we as a viewing public were apparently not equipped to appreciate such a brilliant work.Today I went into the U.S. ratings and discovered (I think) what's been going on. The ratings from 2-10 show a usual sort of distribution, but OVER SIX HUNDRED VOTERS (more than half)rated it as a 1! Impossible! What that says to me is that some organized voting bloc deliberately tanked the U.S. ratings, probably for misguided religious, political or ethnic reasons. The result was that a pitifully small number of U.S. voters saw it at all.That's why I'm posting my first IMDb review.What that group did was a shameful act of vigilantism. If it isn't too late already, go see the movie for yourself. If you missed it on the big screen, catch it on Netflix. Unless your ideas are hopelessly fixed in some direction or another, you'll love it.",

            "content": "Before watching the Bajrangi Bhaijaan, I thought it is a typical Anti-Pakistan movie like Bollywood does make. Salman would enter Pakistan and fight with the whole Nation for just a single girl. But after watching the movie my Point of view has been completely changed by the idea of friendship between the two Rival and Neighbor Countries. The only scene i did not like from the movie was the fight of Bajrangi Bhaijaan with Pakistan Police. I thought of giving it a 9/10 Rating but after watching the whole movie I could not stop myself from giving it a 10/10 marks. The movie is a mixture of very emotional scenes and comedy scenes. The Brilliant acting by Salman Khan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui could make it a BlockBuster but the Emotions of the Little \"Munni\" made it a historical movie of Bollywood. I have no doubt in Saying that it is the Best move of the veteran actor Salman Khan. Even the Mr. Perfectionist Aamir Khan said that it is the movie which can defeat PK.The Film contains so many scenes which can make you its fan. For example, when Munni celebrated the win of Pakistan in front of a patriotic family like a boss. When Munni went into Masjid instead of going to Mandir. The way Salman entered the Madrassah and left it. The way Pakistan Army gave Permission to Salman Khan to enter the country.The movie is also historic as we get our very own \"Prem\" back at least for one movie. The cuteness of Salman Khan is having a very big role in the movie. The way he speaks Truth every where and even in Pakistan, continues to tell people that he is from India and has crossed the border Illegally by crawling through the wires and that he is the \"Bajrang Bali Bhagat\", has mesmerized the audience completely.The Film is completely perfect and a must watch movie for all Pakistanis and Indians. It is also worth mentioning that it is complete family movie and you can absolutely watch it even with your parents. The Film is Perfect. The acting, expressions, emotions, comedy, action, story, music, songs, dialogues, locations, i.e. everything is perfect. I would highly recommend everyone to watch the movie with full family and enjoy as it is literally a \"One in a Million\" movie",

Its not entirely far from truth. this story was always a one line plot stretched for over 2.5 hours and really gets on the nerves towards the end. a Pak girl Jaise Kumbh Ke Mele me Bache Gum Ho Jaate Hai Waise Ye Pak girl train me Se Bichad Gayi. she meets Salman who is a simpleton living in Kurukshetra bordering mental retard. has anyone ever seen a Hindu bowing to every monkey he sees and even random guys dressed as Hanuman? Kabir khan is some sadist. the pak girl artist is cute but her character is not very likable in first half at least. she is shown to excessively celebrate pak victory in a indo-pak match and loves chicken. there is one really retarded chicken song that comes out of nowhere. i don't get it. whats the point of it? i mean do 6 year olds even know how to wear Chaddis? but then kabir khan has his ideas. Salman is ready to arrange a sum of rs 1.5 lacs to send the girl he just met , to Pak. who does that? the Indian agent who promises to send her to pak takes her to a brothel and salman beats them up and comes back safely in second half, he is able to cross the border with the help of some angelic Pakistanis who are forever ready to help him. even the army are willing to give him time to do whatever he wants (instead of shooting him at sight) in the parallel world of kabir khan . Nawazuddin as the reporter provides some laughs but even he runs out of steam bcos the climax just refuses to finish. there are 80s style co-incidences of kid identifying her mother ina video taken by Nawaz. and then the grand climax - the ultimate wet dream of mr Kabir Mardood Malaoon khan where he shows the angelic secular Pak crowd breaking the barriers of the border and chanting Bajrangi Bhaijaan and how even the army and the officers are all for Aman Ki Aasha. it is just that Indians are big whiners. Salman khan is sincere. its commendable that he was ready to submit himself to the director and not bring his \"Bhaigiri\" in this at any point. Kabir ditched him. no fault of his. but Nawaz was the show stealer wherever he had the dialogues. i am not excited about phantom as much as i was earlier",

            "content": "I certainly expected more from this film, although it's enjoyable. The subject is very interesting, it's about humanity and about the common good that unites all people regardless of their religion and class. But the style is very masala-like, with simplistic comedy and above all and plenty of situations which hardly ring true. Salman Khan is both a strength and a weakness in this film. His familiar, starry presence is very good for the film, as leading a film is not new to him, but then his famous, well-known and quite unnatural acting style is hardly anything new and it even gets on the nerves. Above all, this isn't what they call an age-appropriate film for him as he is clearly much older than the part calls for and is therefore made to playact a lot like someone much younger, which I thought (or hoped) was over and done with in Hindi films.Where the film does score is in its wholesome style, positive energy and humanistic message, which does well. More than anything, the film is phenomenally well shot, and some of the music is very nice. Other familiar faces in this film include Kareena Kapoor, who one would expect much more from in view of today's standard for leading ladies and the exceptional parts women play in Hindi films. Om Puri and Nawazuddin Siddiqui do well. The little girl is pretty and just adorable and does well enough to give the film much of the grace and emotion it needs. But all of it is not enough to make the film more than a one-time watch for me. The bond between the leading man and the little girl is not very credible, and the entire move to Pakistan is watchable but not quite convincing and it is getting dragged to no end at some point. More could have been done.",

            "content": "Gone are the days when movies starring Salman Khan used to be script-less and only for the sake of \"masala\" entertainment. \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" is the best movie of his entire stay in Bollywood so far. At least among the movies I've seen.\"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" comprises all the elements that should be in a quality movie. A superb storyline finds the protagonist, Shahida (Harshaali Malhotra), mute, traveling to Delhi, India for her treatment, getting off the train when she's about to head back to her home, Pakistan, to help a sheep stuck somewhere beside the halted train she was on. As soon as she's helped the animal out, the train begins to whistle and start moving. A fragile little six-year- old child, she fails to get on the train on time. The absence of Shahida is brought to notice to her mother only when she wakes up when the train has already traveled quite some distance. By that time, it was already too late. Shahida was alone in the darkness and she couldn't even cry for help.The next morning she meets this man, Pawan Chaturvedi, a selfless follower of Lord Hanuman, who was fondly called \"Bajrangi\". Pawan interacts with this girl, gets emotionally attached to her, and is determined to get her back to home on all costs. But none of it would be easy. Travel to Pakistan was put a hold to for a month and the only way our \"Bajrangi\" could get our Pakistani friend back to her home was crossing the border illegally. What follows is a string of incidents that leaves the audience jaw- dropped. The pains Pawan had to bear just so he could get his dumb friend - he named her \"Munni\" as she could not say her actual name - is set to leave an impression on the viewers.Pawan meets Chand Nawab, a Pakistani reporter, played brilliantly by Nawazuddin Siddiqui, before attempting to cross border, who agrees to help them. Impeccable performances put forth by Nawazuddin and Salman was surprisingly easily overshadowed by the d\u00e9butante Harshali Malhotra, who, right from the beginning till the end, effortlessly managed to deliver all the expressions even the some of the A- listers of Bollywood fail to do - without nearly speaking a word! Kareena Kapoor was accurate in the otherwise limited screen space she got. Kabir Khan, the director, definitely managed to higher up his standard by a large margin since his lukewarm \"Ek Tha Tiger\".And the climax of the movie! Oh God, the climax! I do not want to spoil anything but it will certainly leave you speechless. For you won't have anything to say - you'll be busy taking care of something else with your face. You'll know what I mean when you watch the movie. Just an advice to the female audience - do not put a lot of makeup on your face before going to watch this film.

            "content": "Almost 3 decades ago, Hatya was released with Govinda and mute child who witnesses a murder. And recently, Bajrangi Bhaijaan released (Director: Kabir Khan) where a mute girl from Pakistan is lost in India. Is there any correlation between the two movies? Not really. Except the protective feeling of a good human being towards a helpless child. The similarity ends there.Kabir Khan has been on my top list of directors and given his background on documentary film-making (which was clearly evident in Kabul Express, his best work by far), makes the cinema more realistic towards how people approach in a system. Every movie of his has been directed at political relations between two countries as backdrop and another parallel process in the forefront. New York was about friendship with a political backdrop. Ek Tha Tiger was a love story with a political backdrop. Bajrangi Bhaijaan is the story of how an Indian helps a mute girl from Pakistan go back to her country and overcome the hassles that we have created because we don't get along with each other; we call them borders.The movie is made from Pakistan's perspective. That is the biggest highlight and breath of fresh air to see that there is no bad-mouthing for either country. We need more of that. Bajrangi's missions is accomplished because people on the other side of the border are also humans and they care. But what I didn't appreciate was the fact that they allow him to enter the country without a passport, without a visa and break all rules. Humanity is one thing, being stupid is another. The scene was outright stupid. But hey, Kabir Khan has gone commercial, I'm sure he might have laughed at himself creating that scene, but at the end, he knows that selling is important too. There was another scene in particular where the journalist says that hatred sells, but no one wants to talk about love. I guess Kabir Khan went into political mode and suddenly realized, wait it's a Hindi film, including a feel good factor quickly. Cut to another scene. Audience happy. Kya feel-good movie hai. No one wants to listen to the truth.The real problem with the movie was that everyone shown to be nice. I don't buy that. People are doing their jobs, there's lobbying all around us and I don't buy that everyone will go out of their way to help him across the border and risk themselves being thrown in jail. Also, everything came too easy for the protagonist. Crossing the border, staying illegally in another country, being risked thrown in jail, lot of things. Just very weird. There were some scenes that were really nice but ultimately it felt like most of the niceness in the movie was forced. The child actor did a really good job and she did it really well. The scene where the protagonist takes her away from the travel agent will nearly choke you. The world is a mean place and people are mean. Really mean. Once in a while, you find someone that has a good heart like the protagonist is shown.Honestly, not much to evaluate, except for a few scenes (described above), it's an OK time-pass movie, nothing extra-ordinary, very ordinary with a lot of extra slow motion effects. This movie was basically to pay for a second mortgage for Kabir Khan, he knew the only way to make money was to sell something larger than life, and that is what the audience wants. If you really want to see Kabir Khan's talent, watch Kabul Express. But I'm sure you won't like it because truth is something you run away from.Again, the intent of the movie is good, the execution could have been more well-planned. I won't say realistic because cinema is not supposed to be realistic. But if there was a plan in place, the movie becomes more engaging, more thrilling and entertaining. You can't just walk into another country without a passport/visa and expect things to workout. The plan was the missing piece in the puzzle.",

            "content": "Last week I watched a movie Starring Salman Khan and Nawazuddin Siddiqi in Lead roles with Om puri and Adnan Sami in special appearances. Before the movie ended, I had decided to write something about it. As compared to Hollywood stuff I have watched less Indian movies only because of the 'Masala' they add which irritates me a lot! However there are some really good movies like Kahani, Rung day Basanti, khosla ka ghosla, Piku, Haider and many more. Pre Bajrangi Bhaijaan I did not like the name. The concept was not appealing. The song 'Selfie Le Le' depicted a typical Indian Pooja ceremony. I usually don't watch Sallu Bhai's Movies. I feel like he is an expressionless guy and should prefer 'Dabang\" roles. But that's my own opinion. Nawazuddin (Gangs of Wassypur's Psycho) was acting in the film. Previously I really liked his impressive acting in the movie Kahaani. So this time I thought, well okay I'll watch the movie sometime soon. Then I saw Aamir khan crying. That was something. And then he praised the movie a lot. He really liked Salu and Harshali's Acting. My news feed was flooded with 'Watching Bajrangi Bhaijaan' Post Bajrangi Bhaijaan The name is alright. But let's not talk about the name ONLY. Certain elements of the movie were really good. The depiction of Pakistan's Madrassas, Pavan's Hesitation to enter the Masjids, Nawazuddin's powerful and funny Acting especially when he shouted \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan! Bajrangi Bhaijaan! Bajrangi Bhaijaan! When the little girl wanted to eat chicken and nobody panicked on hearing the name of \"gosht\" Harshali's acting was good. She did not ruin Shahida's character doing extra cheesy stuff. The story was appealing, yes! People actually go across borders for treatment, other visits and these incidents happen more often. I think Salman played Pavan's Character better than his previous roles which is a good sign. There was no item song in the movie. WIN-WIN!I don't want to conclude that it was a good movie or a master piece or deserves a five star rating. The movie was good enough and I am going to watch it again.",

            "content": "My friends took me to this movie stating that ratings are good, and after watching this movie I realized how marketing and hype is the backbone of a commercially successful movie. technically this movie is s**t! there is no proper storyline. everything is happening at random its like the universe has aligned itself to make the events in the movie happen by itself. Salman Khans acting was so pathetic that I literally cried watching him act. Even the 6 year old girl was far better actor than him. Songs and dance were just unnecessarily placed in the movie. There are so many open ends and illogical events happening for example: 1.) After the girl stall the jeep by sticking a banana in the silencer of the jeep, she removes it and eats the banana from the silencer! 2.) Salman Khan rescues the girl from brothel ( this scene was just strategically placed to garner more sentiments from the audience) he does not takes the 1.5 lacs just leaves it at that 3.) The exaggeration of his stupidity! field in 10th 10 times? failed in college 10 times? How stupid one can be? and presenting 'being idiot' as a virtue? 4.) The cops shoots Salman Khan and is seen falling in the river but later the bullet injury mysteriously vanishes! maybe Bajrang Bali did that trickand so on...Only thing worth commendable was Nawazuddin Siddiqui's acting that guy was awesome with his dialogs and wit.I am sure every review in IMDb is rigged and even the rating. This piece of c**p does not even deserve rating 1 out of 10. This movie is made for the mediocre crowd of India and shows how stupid movies can be successful by creating over hype and good marketing strategy",

            "content": "Watched 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' Yesterday\u0085 I have to clear first that I really cant recollect when was the last time I went to the theater to watch a Salman Khan film? I didn't even watch his last releases on TV or even on laptop. My predetermined conclusion of the film after watching the trailer was that, it will be mediocre one. Still I went to catch it because of 'Nawajuddin Siddiqui' and some positive reviews which I got from my friends. Despite that, I thought it will be a no brainier like other Salman khan flicks\u0085 which are high on entertainment value for the masses but is definitely not my cup of tea. After watching this film, I am delighted to say that this time I was proved totally wrong and it is a beautiful movie meant for everyone who has a heart.The film is engaging right from the beginning though the second-hour takes it to the epitome. And the climax, though slightly under- whelming because of the slight melodramatic factor, too leaves an impact keeping in mind the commercial appeal of the film. It is the story of a 6 yr old hearing-impaired girl from Pakistan who gets lost in India , and how a noble man who is an ardent devotee of Lord Hanuman decides to help the child, return to her family - in Pakistan. In Pakistan an equally noble & struggling journalist helps them both beyond measure to reach onto their destination against all odds. This beautiful story has been superbly transformed into a screenplay which everybody will love and can relate to. Kabir Khan's Direction is top-notch. He has handled the film with skill, making this film his best till now.kudos to him for making such a positive & heartwarming film about love & unity. The film has the right dose of humor, strong emotions & poignant drama. Cinematography is breathtaking \u0085it captured the Stunning Locales of Kashmir, superbly. Editing is mostly crisp & the music is apt.As far as the performances are concerned, Salman Khan, here did not flaunt his muscles or abs by ripping his shirt, nor did he say any cheap dialogs. Instead for a change he played a simple, innocent and honest man, and delivered an outstanding performance. This is indeed his best film & his career best performance . Kareena Kapoor looks gorgeous and acts well but has nothing much to do. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is outstanding as the unbelievably funny and endearing Pakistani journalist 'Chand Nawab'. He stands tall in every character, every film he does. This supremely talented actor surprises every-time & one actually can't believe that how can someone be so good! The surprise package of the movie was the child actor ' Harshaali Malhotra' , who is extremely cute and lovable. She looks too beautiful and innocent and will steal the audience's heart with her portrayal of a girl without a voice. Her acting will make even the hard hearted shed tears . The rest of the cast did justice to their part.On the whole, Bajrangi Bhaijaan is definitely a blockbuster written all over it. Watch the film to witness the beautiful camaraderie between Salman & the child actor and also for the crackling chemistry between Salman & Nawazuddin. This film will definitely win the audience's heart. This film is definitely not to be missed.",

            "content": "So here are some of the things I expect to see in a Salman Khan film \u2014 the superstar playing a charming, irreverent superhero; a largely incoherent script that exists only to showcase him as a superhero; a largely irrelevant heroine who needs rescuing from some foolish villains; low-IQ comedy punctuated by a few crackling one-liners.Here's what I don't expect to find \u2014 a coherent, emotionally satisfying script; Salman underplaying his super sized image; a heroine with spunk; drama that actually moves you; and tears! Yes, it happened. I have now cried while watching a Salman Khan film. Bajrangi Bhaijaan is simplistic, occasionally silly, and tiringly over-stretched. It's also unashamedly manipulative. But it works. Director and co-writer Kabir Khan preserves the larger-than-life Salman image but also allows it to evolve so that the star is not just a slick superman. Instead, he's a simpleton who teaches us that humanity stands above religion, borders and politics. Think of him as another PK, one that is human instead of alien.Bajrangi's real name is Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi. He is called Bajrangi because he's an ardent Hanuman bhakt. This is a man so child-like and morally upright that he says Jai Shree Ram to a prostitute and insists on entering Pakistan without a passport or visa but with the permission of the security officer who apprehends him at the border. Why is he so keen to go across? Because a lost, speech-impaired six-year-old girl from Pakistan needs to be reunited with her mother. When all other methods fail, Bajrangi decides he will do it himself.If you're reminded of Randhir Kapoor's 1991 film, Henna, yes the story is similar. But by making the displaced character a child, Kabir and his co-writer, V Vijayendra Prasad, have made the plot more potent.In fact the biggest weapon in Kabir's artillery is the angelic Harshali Malhotra. She's refreshingly unaffected. She seems unfaded by Salman. Harshali has a heart-breaking innocence. For the viewer, it's love at first sight. You invest in her instantly and her tears wring your heart. Salman gets the requisite thundering action sequence. And yes, he does a shirtless scene. But it doesn't showcase his towering masculinity. Actually, he's being beaten up. Bajrangi is interesting because he's not invincible. Of course you know that he will eventually make miracles happen, but he also bleeds and breaks.Salman plays Bajrangi with aplomb. He's endearingly na\u00efve and sweetly vulnerable. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, playing a small-time television reporter, comes into the film late but is worth the wait. Unlike the character he played in Kick, he gets no flashy moments here. But he has a few terrific lines and he flies with them.Kareena Kapoor Khan has the most under-written part, but even she gets one good scene. And as usual, her clothes make an impression; her dupattas are just gorgeous. Om Puri playing a maulana in Pakistan is also memorable.Where Bajrangi Bhaijaan trips is on length. The film is too long and the numerous songs don't do much for the narrative. The plot feels convenient and convoluted at the same time. There are scenes that make you groan. There is also an unapologetic lack of subtlety \u2014 Kabir goes full-throttle for your heartstrings, and once he's grabbed them, doesn't let go.This is an overblown, old-fashioned, feel good film. But I recommend that you surrender, and keep a hunky handy.",

The 2 hour 40 mins showcases love,friendship and peace in the most convincing way of two politically disturbed countries labeled as 'blood enemies' by the world.Kabir has chosen the biggest 'Superstar' of the country Salman Khan in the leading role and made his script the 'Hero' of the movie. Salman has delivered his career best performance as simpleton, truthful, God-fearing 'Pawan'. Harshali Malhotra and Nawazuddin have done complete justice to their roles. If this was a Hollywood movie, they wouldn't have cared about having a heroine/love songs, hence Kareena was wasted. Kashmir has been captured like never ever before. I personally feel, the most beautiful place on earth is Kashmir without any doubt and every Indian needs to visit our own paradise.The climax scene is the best scene of the movie which is sure to have majority of the people with moist eyes.Kabir Khan, you have made one of the epic movies with the Indo-Pak subject and Salman Khan thanks for the entertainment, you have been the true people's man who is being human!!",

Kabir Khan has succeeded in giving full justice to the well-written screenplay with his focused narration and excellence in handling sentimental sequences in particular.Now talk about performance of actor and actress first of all the performance of Salman.Salman is at his best here. As Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi (Bajrangi Bhaijaan),the Superstar enacts the god-loving, clean-hearted soul, with excellence.Child Artiste Harshaali Malhotra is adorable. Her on- screen chemistry with Salman, melts your heart. Kareena Kapoor Khan is charming in a brief, yet substantial role. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is top-notch, yet again! He brings the house down with his brilliant comic-timing & walks away with some of the film's best moments, as well. Om Puri shines in a cameo. And other are very good support in this movie .This movie shows the triumph of humanity. There is far more love than hatred between the people of the two countries. Movie highlights things like differences over food , praying and ever present political unrest. In this movie Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the Pakistani TV scribe nearly steals the show with his story on the little girl lost in border.Now talk about musics. The music of the movie are super .Three songs of this movie are best Tu Chahiye,Tu Jo Mila, and Bhar Do Jholi Meri . At the end of the movie Adnan Sami sing a Qawwali of this movie . Overall this movie is super .",

And it comes at a most important moment in history, when the likelihood of nuclear war in the world has its highest probability between these two neighbors. And the people who put this all together seemed to rise to the cosmic importance of the film. Certainly the chemistry between Salman Khan and the adorable Harshaali Malhotra, who plays the lost mute child, is something very special.

Harshali's performance will bring tears in your eyes.Screenplay and story line is also good. Kabir Khan has done excellent directing. Kareena's role is very short but interesting one. This is not a typical bollywood movie where hero can beat up 100 men and still doesn't get hurt. This movie is a pure reflection of reality. Bajrangi Bhaijaan is Salman's best performance after Jai Ho.

I almost hated the title, even the teaser and the selfie song. Watching movie on eid day is like a ritual among my siblings. After few scary thoughts i went to the theater and....... The rest is history.The last movie which i enjoyed so much was 3 idiots.unlike other salman khan movies where there is little scope of story and has only dialog's, macho-ism.this one has a beautiful story and vice versa. Salman has done utmost justice to his role of a hanuman devotee. The little girl is undoubtedly the \"find of the year\". With only gestures and emotions she has outperformed many a-list actresses. Nawazuddin in the role of news reporter was class apart. Surprisingly his entry scene got more claps and whistles than salman's. All the supporting cast have done their part efficiently. Kabir khan's direction is excellent. Songs are treat to both eyes and ears. No shame in admitting that i cried during the climax.. best movie of 2015. highly recommended.",

Though there are some funny errors which should definitely be noticed.

            "content": "'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is a landmark film for it tries to bridge gaps between people of India and Pakistan without being preachy or moralistic. It is an extremely entertaining film but entertainment need not always be song-n-dance and popcorn- cola-jokes that don't last long.Salman Khan delivered one of his finest performances in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Khamoshi'. After that film, 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is the film that taps the acting brilliance of Khan. Credit must go to Kabir Khan to have taken risks by not falling in the trap of what-the- distributors-want in a Salman Khan film. There are two brief action sequences, no item songs and a brief romance. In other words, Kabir completely breaks the formula that makes Salman such a safe blockbuster bet at the box office. Enough scope is given to Nawazuddin to display his magical brilliance and the kid Harshali Malhotra delivers a stunning performance (without delivering any dialogue). Om Puri shines in a cameo too. The presence of a strong support cast enhances Salman's performance greatly.Somehow one can Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is a must watch film that will stay in your mind long after its over. The egotistical politicians on both sides of the border will keep on stoking the fire of hatred. If you want genuine people-to-people contact and a chance to let Love do the talking, then this film will hold hands of peace in front of you. It is up to you if you wish to put your hand forward and feel the warmth of brotherhood. Take a call.",

I am a big fan of Salman Khan and love kareena kapoor. She is damn beautiful and amazing. For last couple of years she has proved her talent, her acting skills.Last but not least Nawazuddin Siddiqui. What an actor he is. extraordinary, fits in all kind a role and performs it beautifully.Now coming back to the movie Bajrangi Bhaijan. the script of the movie is very catchy, heart touching. beautifully written and crafted by Kabir Khan. Being as a Pakistani i totally agree with the last dialogues of Nawazuddin Siddiqui. We public of both nations Pakistan and India don't want war, we want peace and love among each other, there shouldn't be any boundary, any restriction and religious differences. Public of both nation agree on Jiyo aur jenay do, Aman ki Asha....Direction and cinematography is excellent. Salman Khan has given his best in this movie. No doubt he is a bajrangi bhaijan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui was marvelous, he played an important role. kareena kapoor beautiful as always. Last but not least the center force of the movie was Harshali (Shahida), the little kid. she was very adorable and cute. She played the difficult role, a role of a mute girl and played it brilliantly and touched the hearts of millions with her acting without saying a word, her emotions and innocence made it all.Conclusion: Bajrangi Bhaijan is the besssssssssstttttttt movie of year 2015. A noble story with balanced flavors of love, peace, emotions and humanity.",

Paid reviews usually last 2-3 days that is first weekend only.I feel especially sad for Islamic people who come out on the festival and spend lots of money to watch something good but they will get nothing good in this movie but heartbroken.

Despite my protestations and better sense, my better half forced me to somehow watch this one. It turned out to be one of my worst movie experience ever. It scarred me enough to avoid Salman Khan movies for another 20 years. Now on to the review(i.e.more rant): A movie cannot be more clich\u00e9d than this. It seems the director wanted to create some Indian street-food-mix instead of a movie: lets add India-Pakistan, then cricket, then some Hinduism-Islam, then some cute kids and hyper-perfect hero, add some more tired jokes, maybe some songs, and lo thats a movie. If a 15 year old writes a script he/she couldn't possibly do worse. And the so called actor Salman Khan is one of the most cringe-worthy thing to ever happen to silver screen. Salman even made some b-grade duplicate actor do the scenes where he is to be repeatedly slapped by his father. Oh yeah, no one slaps the mega-star yo! All the characters are unidimensional and clich\u00e9d. If your day is truly cursed and you must watch this movie like I had to without choice, then I can give you only 1 good reason to do so. This movie perfectly exhibits why the majority of Indian movie-going public is escapist baboons who will lap up any crap 'positive' story. And for this reason alone, a snake-oil salesman like Salman continue to mass-produce this crap. And sure enough the masses keep gobbling it up.",

            "content": "Bajrangi Bhaijaan helm-ed by Kabir Khan takes you on a journey to Pakistan, without Visa albeit with plethora of emotions, exhilarating drama, high octane action, transcendent performances, mesmeric visuals, adroit craftsmanship making it a top notch motion picture. The last flick in which Salman Khan was directed by Kabir Khan namely \"Ek Tha Tiger\" turned out to be a blockbuster. So, when both these names decided to team up together for Bajrangi Bhaijaan, expectations were bound to be high. Generally, when you go to watch a movie with high expectations in mind there are chances of you getting disappointed but on the contrary Bajrangi Bhaijaan supersedes those apprehensions and engulfs you unto the movie right from its first frame. Is Bajrangi Bhaijaan at par/better than previous Salman starers? The answer is affirmative for the sole reason that this movie has its heart and soul at the right place. So numbed we are by the the onslaught of mindless southern remakes heavy with punchlines and raucous slapstick that an action film where the leading man (Salman Khan) doesn't loose his shirt automatically feels special. In this new film, Salman Khan is seen in a new emotional avatar who on his own travels to Pakistan to reunite a mute girl with her parents. Clearly this is a departure. As a standalone film, Bajrangi Bhaijaan is enthralling and most significantly an entertaining motion picture. On the exterior, it is a compelling sentimental story/thriller. But beneath the entertainment it offers, it carries a message as well. Loud and Clear. If the audience can see through the coating, great. Even if they don't, they will yet go back in high spirits. There are two conflicting factors in Bajrangi Bhaijaan ; Salman Khan's overriding principle of portraying silly antics on-screen and Kabir Khan's intrinsic liking for seriousness. But so overwhelming is Bhai's past aura that serious keeps threatening to slide into silly, and the moment you give in to that in-between space, the film becomes something that you enjoy to the core.Most of the time. Though, its a formulaic film yet it is not a typical Salman Khan kind of cinema. It ably brings the message of humanity, peace and human bonding to the forefront. How a person rigid about his religion can happily, peacefully co-exist with the unique ways of other religions. In fact, Salman's character is closest to #Being human (his charitable foundation) in this movie when compared to all other characters that he has portrayed in past. I could see a lot of moist eyes at the end of this movie which is proof enough that the movie tugs on the heartstrings of the audience.",

When u start to watch this movie u may not see why its amazing in the first 10 to 20 minutes but once it got its pace it didn't see back.... its not a super salman khan type movie. Its rather some other side u haven't still seen of salman khan. his acting in this movie was really really great and i couldn't believe that this was the same guy that was in KICK. Honestly saying i couldn't stop crying after the interval and at the end i wasn't able to stop for 10 minutes. well the end isn't some kind of mystery to uncover or some great secret that u cant think of like that in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES or Hit-man . even though i imagined the ending in my mind and i was right about the ending... still i cried so much that i don't think another movie in the coming years will be this heart touching. it is the perfect movie for those studs who think that nothing can make them cry. And it sets another example of how much power love has.",

Salman Khan is phenomenal in this film. Salman has given us many wonderful performances, but this one is his best!From its musical score, directing, special effects, location shooting, and the impressive acting ability of Salman Khan to keep one mesmerized by his solo performance, This movie is a WINNER! And I must admit Salman Khan should definitely win National Award for best actor for the movie Bajrangi Bhaijaan. I love the little girl Shahida (Harshaali Malthotra), She's beyond beautiful and her acting ability is outstanding. And I believe she should also win National Award for best child actor for this epic Bajrangi Bhaijaan.",

Similar is in the case of Bajrangi Bhaijaan, but the only difference, the film contains a beautiful storyline; which people usually don't find in any of his movies (last 5 years). This movie is an exception to typical Bhai movies in all departments. The film has got good direction, picturization, pleasant background score, very beautiful locations, good acting by all the Actors. This is a sheer masterpiece of Salman Khan or better say Kabir Khan. Kabir Khan, is the only director in the last 10 years who've made Salman \"act\" in a movie. Incredible job by the maestro. Little Harshaali deserves an applause for her beautiful performance as Shahida/Munni. She possibly is the cutest thing ever happened to Bollywood since a long time. Her chemistry with Salman is simply WOW. Nawaz does a decent job in the limited screenplay and has proved his excellence once again. Hats off to the Best actor of the generation. Kareena didn't get much screen presence, but the little she got; she utilized that fully with her beauty; not with acting. And finally, the Man, Salman, you'll get to see a different Salman in this movie, the one you've never expected of, the one who will make you cry, the one who will entertain you throughout, the best Salman in last 10 years. Finally, Go, Watch it for Kabir Khan and Harshaali, they are the HERO and HEROINE of the Film, Bajrangi Bhaijaan.",

However I have not found a movie having no loop holes. 1.Pavan father should not have died like that. 2.Rasika role could be more meaningful. It seemed she was there just to make audience feel excited wanting some more. 3.The India Pakistan match showing the same match twice ;not worth it. 4.Pavan honesty and faith at the border could ruin the whole movie.Personally i don't like that height of faith at that situation.He must have been aware that the girl was more important than the truth.I wish the girl would be at last at Pavan's hand not in air.I felt it incomplete.",

Her innocence melt my heart every time tears rolls down her eyes and I smile every time she felt happy. The character of Pawan was so moving and his sacrifices gained his respect from both nations of different religions. The character of Chand had spiced up the journey of Pawan and Shahida. All the characters of this movie had done their best roles and reflected a lot of moral values. I may say it is one of the best bollywood movie I've seen. I like the balance of the cinematography. I did enjoy watching the musical part of both countries, India and Pakistan. This movie should be included for international film festival. This movies is a must to watch movie!!!",

            "content": "The movie 'Bajrangi Bhaijan' is a classic, if you're a Bhai fan and is something for the fans to gloat about. Personally, I think the movie has a basic storyline which intrigued me as most of the Salman Khan movies are deficient of a good plot. I would suggest you to watch it once mainly because of some really good acting skills displayed by the great Nawazuddin Siddique and the cute little debutant, Harshaali Malhotra. The angel won many hearts without even saying a word till the end of the movie. The movie starts off with with a little drama which is overshadowed by the cuteness and innocence of Harshaali. Salman's entry is pretty ordinary as he plunges into the movie with the popular song 'Selfie le le re'. Salman's character Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi aka Bajrangi is a big devotee of Lord Hanuman and is shown as an extremely virtuous and naive guy who never speaks a lie throughout the movie. I think the movie never takes off in the first half and just sets the base for the second half which attracts the attention of the viewer. If you ask me, I was disappointed with the first half but the second half makes up for it later. Kareena's role in the movie is quite minute and the movie would be the same without her. I personally believe the Bollywood diva was just casted in the movie to increase its popularity. Unlike Kareena, the movie would never be the same without The Gangs of Wasseypur Star, Nawazuddin Siddinqui. He single-handedly takes the movie to another level with his entrance at the beginning of the second half. He energizes the whole movie with his awesome acting and his perfect comic timing. Nawaz is an expert in swaying away the minds of the viewers. I appreciate Salman as he controlled his urge to involve useless and theatrical action in the movie. The end was a bit melodramatic and histrionic but after all, a Bollywood movie is never complete without histrionics. ;) The movie ends well with glee and contentment spread in all quarters. I would rate the movie 3/5 and as I recommended earlier, it is a one time watch specially because of the endearing cherub, Harshaali Mehrotra. :)",

A superb story line finds the protagonist, Shahida (Harshaali Malhotra), mute, traveling to Delhi, India for her treatment, getting off the train when she's about to head back to her home, Pakistan, to help a sheep stuck somewhere beside the halted train she was on. As soon as she's helped the animal out, the train begins to whistle and start moving. A fragile little six-year- old child, she fails to get on the train on time. The absence of Shahida is brought to notice to her mother only when she wakes up when the train has already traveled quite some distance. By that time, it was already too late. Shahida was alone in the darkness and she couldn't even cry for help.The next morning she meets this man, Pawan Chaturvedi, a selfless follower of Lord Hanuman, who was fondly called \"Bajrangi\". Pawan interacts with this girl, gets emotionally attached to her, and is determined to get her back to home on all costs. But none of it would be easy. Travel to Pakistan was put a hold to for a month and the only way our \"Bajrangi\" could get our Pakistani friend back to her home was crossing the border illegally. What follows is a string of incidents that leaves the audience jaw- dropped. The pains Pawan had to bear just so he could get his dumb friend - he named her \"Munni\" as she could not say her actual name - is set to leave an impression on the viewers.Pawan meets Chand Nawab, a Pakistani reporter, played brilliantly by Nawazuddin Siddiqui, before attempting to cross border, who agrees to help them. Impeccable performances put forth by Nawazuddin and Salman was surprisingly easily overshadowed by the d\u00e9butante Harshali Malhotra, who, right from the beginning till the end, effortlessly managed to deliver all the expressions even the some of the A- Lister's of Bollywood fail to do - without nearly speaking a word! Kareena Kapoor was accurate in the otherwise limited screen space she got. Kabir Khan, the director, definitely managed to higher up his standard by a large margin since his lukewarm \"Ek Tha Tiger\".And the climax of the movie! Oh God, the climax! I do not want to spoil anything but it will certainly leave you speechless. For you won't have anything to say - you'll be busy taking care of something else with your face. You'll know what I mean when you watch the movie. Just an advice to the female audience - do not put a lot of makeup on your face before going to watch this film. (I can already guess you can make out what I'm trying to say.)",

You know instantly that the plot is grand but when you see it you know that the whole thing is highly manipulated so that the plot can go thru with.One of the worst films in recent times.

But for a cine-goer like me who judges a film by its sheer content, it is the best Salman Khan movie till date n one of the best to have come in recent years,such is the effect that after the end credits, while walking out, couldn't utter a word. Just kept thinking to myself within and exclaiming,\"What a movie,uff!\". Now after having watched the movie when I get to hear similar words for the movie all around, I am assured that I have a great sense of taste regarding movies. What a weekend this has turned out to be..courtesy Kabir Khan, the ace writer-director. OMG! What a movie! Splendid..MUST WATCH..",

The plot was boring, the expected Bollywood musical breaks as welcome as a hedgehog in a preservatives factory, the cinematographer chose odd angles, and whoever edited this movie, should be forced to watch it at least once. OK, might be a harsh review and to be honest; I really didn't have the patience to complete viewing the movie, where I'm certain that in the end; the now none-mute girl will be, in slow motion, reunited with her family.

            "content": "The 140 minutes (China version) in the movie is rich and interesting. In the movie a 6 years old little Pakistan dumb girl was separated from her mother in India, Delhi. Fortunately, she met a kind, warm-heart and honest man named Pawan. After realizing she lost her parents, he then brought her to his house, and made a swear that he would help her find her home and mother. At first, he had no clues at all. He originally thought that the girl is an Indian and she believed in Hinduism. But after he was shocked that the girl likes eating chicken and could pray as a Muslim, he realized she was actually a Muslim. While he was struggling that his uncle might drive her out of the door because of her faith, a weirder thing happened. At the time when Pakistan beat India in a cricket game, she stood up and applauded happily to everyone's surprised. The man finally understood that she was a Pakistani. He had to send her to her Pakistani home, but he was India Hinduism, while Pakistanis believe in Islam, not to mention the bad relationship between Indians and Pakistanis. At first, he requested a travel agent to send the girl to Pakistan. But he found that the agent actually wanted to sell the girl as a prostitute. So furious was him that he gave everyone in the hotel a lesson full of blood. Realized that the girl can't be back home without him. He decided to send her home by himself. It's not an easy thing. Although Pawan and the girl got through the border between India and Pakistan with the help of an Indian local, Pawan's honesty as a Hinduism still brought him a lot of troubles. Luckily, he affected a Pakistani news reporter who originally wanted to tail him after he escaped from the police station, where the police regard him as an Indian spy, with the girl. The kind reporter decided to be with the man and the girl until they found out the girl's home. On the seeking travel, with the help of the reporter, the group overcame all the difficulties in the way, and finally found the girl's hometown. However, as they were in the bus to the girl's village, the police came. In such an emergent situation, Pawan came up with an idea-the reporter took the girl to the village, and Pawan was to lead the police away. Finally, the girl was back her home, but Pawan was shot and then prisoned. In order to save him out the reporter upload the video he had recorded in the way and appealed people in both country to help Pawan. They gathered to the border and broke locked gate to India, Pawan was finally able to return home. As Pawan almost got in the India, the girl, Shahida, rushed out of the crowd, with a strong desire, amazingly she broke out her first word----Bajrangi Bhaijaan. The surprised Pawan returned immediately and held up the girl to the sky. This is the end of the whole movie.\nThe varieties of scenarios made me fix my eyes on the screen during the entire movie time. Sometimes moved, sometimes laugh, sometimes happy, sometimes sad. I think the most shining actor is the girl. (The chief actor Salman Khan is also good.) Though she didn't say a single word during the movie except the end, her acting skills were really wonderful. Her facial expression was so vivid that especially when she raised her hand to express \"yes!\", it seemed that my world become brighter! The singing and dancing parts are always a shining feature in Indian movies and in this movie, I like them very much. They showed us the fascinating exotic customs and brought us joys. \nLove is beyond borders, races, faiths, and nationalities. This is what the movie wanted to tell us. Obviously, the ending of the movie is easy to be guessed. But it didn't prevent me from wetting my orbit. In fact, a girl behind me even sobbed aloud in the theater at the end. It was the pure and great love between them which moved me. I have to say that if a movie can affect you despite the fact that you know what the movie will do, it must be a marvelous movie. \nI appreciate it that the mainland can bring in Bajrangi Bhaijaan 3 years after the movie was firstly released in India, or I would not meet such an excellent movie.",

We can learn so many things from this picture. I think it is the best impressive movie till now. \"BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN\" is a movie full of positivity , humor and emotion. It's a movie which symbolizes togetherness between the two nation and religion.Talking about the cast, i am truly speaking that i am speechless. I have never see in my life this type of outstanding performances or acting of actors/actress. I want to thanks each and everyone. Especially Salman Khan (Sir), Nawazuddin Siddiqui (Sir), Kareena Kapoor (Mam). The movie climax is something which I can't define in mere words, it is an overwhelming and unforgettable experience which can only be witnessed once you see this movie in the theaters and I am sure you will come out with damp eyes and a huge smile on your face after watching this movie.So, I suggest everyone to see the movie and learn from it.",

            "content": "Bajrangi BhaijaanCast:Salman Khan, Harshali Malhotra, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Om Puri\nDirector: Kabir KhanBajrangi Bhaijaan is a simple movie. Director and co-writer Kabir Khan has preserved the larger-than-life Salman's image and also allowed it to evolve. Thus the star is presented not as a superman but a simple human being.Bajrangi's real name is Pawan Kuman chaturvedi. HE is called Bajrangi because he is a Hanuman devotee. He is a child-like and morally upright man who insists on entering Pakistan without a passport or visa but with the permission of a security officer who apprehends him at the border. He is keen to go across the border to reunite a six-year-old, speech-imparted girl from Pakistan with her family.The biggest surprise in the film is the child artist, Harshila Malhotra acting as Munni. She has a heart-breaking innocence. For the viewers,it is love at first sight. Salman Khan is interesting because he's not invincible. Of course the audience are aware that he will eventually make miracles happen, but he also bleeds and breaks.Salman Khan as Bajrangi is endearingly naive and sweetly vulnerable. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, playing a small-time television reporter, comes into the film late but is worth the wait. He has a few powerful lines to his credit. Kareena Kapoor has the most under-written part, but even she gets one good scene. And as usual, her looks make an impression. Om Puri playing a maulana is quite memorable.The only shortcoming of the film is that it is too long and the numerous songs don't do much for the narrative.Overall, it is an overblown, old-fashioned, feel-good film that teaches us that humanity stands above religion, borders and politics .",

The word is also commonly associated with Hindu. On mission story about a little girl from Pakistan lost in India and how she is reunited with her country and family with the help of bajarangi Bhaijaan.\nA 5years old girl Munni from Pakistan gets separated from her mother at an India railway station. Lost and hungry she finds shelter at the home of Pavan,an ardent devotee of Hanuman.\nBajarangi Bhaijaan is the moving story of pavan's quest to unite the child with her parents against all odds. Set against the backdrop of colourful Chandni Chowk,the film travel from the heartland Punja, through the deserts of Rajasthan,over the snowcapped mountains of Khasmir. For salman Khan's bajarangi Bhaijaa, parts of Mandewa Were used to give a look of Pakistan . The movie is about how a man discovers love during his journey from India to Pakistan. Bajarangi Bhaijaan tells that, who will move Heaven and earth to fulfil the promise he made to the from across the border. Salman Khan who enters with the popular selfie Le Le Re song.since she can't speak, Salman tries a number of ways to find out about her. Salman Khan really outdoes himself with this role of an innocent and simple man. Karena Kapoor manages to make her presence felt with a small but pivotal role.\n.. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as usual ends up doing a fab job, but the true star performer of this movie is Harshaali who makes you laugh and cry range of emotion. The chemistry Harshaali and salman share is truly heart touching and something that can tear you up as well. A good movie with a great story.the rights range of emotion and some amazing picturization. The only places that some might not like are the cheesy,over-the board scenes that all may not enjoy as much. Bajarangi Bhaijaan the outstanding Movie. This movie is a TRUE story based.\nSalman Khan all movie is amazing. Her all movie is Very emotional. Her movie song is Very popular. In this movie song aaj ki party, chicken song, selfie le le re, tu chahiye. Bajarangi Bhaijaan is salman Khan's most daring film where Salman presents a beautiful performance-but allows the strory to be real dabangg. It makes a beautiful, mubarak point one that's Very dabangg too. If movies are meant to inspir, then bajarangi Bhaijaan fulfils its purpose with resounding success. It will motivate you to get in touch with goodness. It will you nagatively and positively in life, all the time. This one is a Golden heart. Any movie salman Khan has ever featured in before. This is a story emotion. Bajarangi Bhaijaan earned 603 cores wolrdwide and is the highest grosser of salman's career.",

The story is based on the Indian narrative of \"Sem2Sem\" (i.e. \"We are all the same\") and \"Politicians Bad, People Good\" kind of vibes. Like the only thing the differentiates this film from the other Patriotic Anti-Pakistani films is that, 1. This has a bigger budget 2. This film somewhat does criticise Indian minds too otherwise this is pretty much a watered-down version of those kinds of films and the only reason reason why this film deserves 2 stars is the acting and the actors.Also to Indian directors out there: Urdu speakers don't just go around saying \"Janaab\".",

            "content": "The theme of the film is superb. The way the film is directed is not upto the mark, Salman is superb, I don't know why they offered a role for Kareena, she is one of the worst actress as of now in the industry, she proved again that she is not a good actress. Nawazuddin and the little girl were fantastic. Some good director would have been directed it, dialogues written are not effective. Completely a pro-pakistani movie, a dialogue says Kashmir also belongs to Pakistan. Somewhere it is hurting Hindu sentiments, director is trying to patch it up as well but he couldn't, we doubted Kareena is playing role of Muslim woman or Hindu woman. She didn't look like a girl who is from a Hindu Brahmin family. She would have played the role of the little girl's mother then. It would have been superb if Salmaan Khan (Bhajrangi) visited a Hindu temple in Pakistan. Director would have given equal importance to both Hindu's and Muslims in the movie. Any how overall very good story, but direction is not at all good for this kind of superb story.",

The seed that must be grown in every human heart is LOVE. Beliefs that break down the boundaries of religion, ethnicity, country and caste.It is really impressive the message that this film wants to convey and we must spread it to those around us, our closest family, neighbors and the general public.This film is also entertaining with the funny behavior of the players but not overly made to ensure that the message is conveyed properly. So watching it doesn't want to make your eyes blink. Tears will continue to flow from the middle of the film to the end for those of you whose hearts are full of love and compassion.",
