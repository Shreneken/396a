            "content": "Reid has always been obsessed with UFOs. While on a weekend trip to Vegas, he convinces two friends to join him on a mission to break into Area 51, where they find terrifying proof of alien presence......Found footage films, you either love them, or hate the socks off them. Unfortunately, every once in a while there is a really good movie released in this genre. Willow Creek, Exists, The Borderlands, and the V/H/S series are fine examples of how a found footage movie can work..........but there is a slew of rubbish that you have to trudge through to get to the impressive ones.This falls far into the latter category.So we have the usual gang of teens that we get in these films, one is always obsessed with the subject matter, and the others, dubious as they are, always go along for the ride, because it's a road trip isn't it?So we get the usual footage of people driving to desolate areas, where they are confronted by suspicious looking people, they talk to other people with whom are also obsessed with the subject matter, and this happens for the majority of the film, and the first two acts just drag and drag until we finally reach the titular place.By this time, you couldn't care less with what they discover, and even though the last ten minutes are impressive, both visually and atmospheric, it's too little too late, for the rest of the film is just so boring you lose any interest for the characters, and their quest.Copies are destined to be buried in the Nevada desert next to E.T.",

            "review_title": "Extremely Disappointing from the Start",
            "content": "I definitely had higher expectations for Area 51, especially given that Oren Peli had written and directed and reinvigorated the \"found footage\" genre with Paranormal Activity. I'm a fan of the genre, a fan of the Peli, but this was absolutely abysmal from the very start. The concept could have been extremely engaging and given a unique twist, but it performs and plays out as expected- completely typical and utterly predictable, very poorly acted and nonsensical most of the time. I would have been disappointed even if it were a Direct to DVD or On Demand release. I guess the merits of this film like wholly on \"From the writer and director of Paranormal Activity!\" However, don't expect the competency which the latter film was delivered. There is very little entertainment value, lines are cut off mid-sentence, and somehow, despite being allegedly filmed with one camera, it switches angles regularly without disrupting other dialog. It places it's weight on technical talk, the late night AM radio conspiracy chatter, but does nothing to actually give the viewer anything to grab on to and immerse themselves in the adventure of these three hormonal boys.If you'd like to reduce your IQ level or waste your time while sick and just need to say you've seen it, you're better served by searching online for conspiracy videos, which provide far more interesting concepts and, despite being rather extraordinary, manage to entertain, which Area 51 fail to do.",

My friends and I have been waiting for this movie to come out for a while after first seeing the trailer for it on Facebook, which mind you, was probably scarier than this entire movie. I am a huge fan of alien movies like dark skies, alien abduction etc, and if you share the same interest then I suggest you only watch this movie if you have absolutely nothing else to watch but if you can avoid it, do it. It had some semi scary scenes, maybe a whole 5 minutes of the movie was actually exciting but other than that it was a bunch of 20 something year old, who seemed to know way too much on how to break into various locations on government technology, running around with video cameras. A lot of the story wasn't explained properly, it left me feeling confused and unfulfilled.",

            "content": "Found footage genre hasn't found much success after the initial trend start with REC or Cloverfield. It attempts to create a more personal experience with first person view often falls flat with cumbersome shaky shots and unclear scenes. Area 51 suffers from the same exact problems and it stutters towards the end, but it also manages to set an occasionally interesting trip, especially in the first half.Story follows Reid and his friends as he tries to infiltrate the highly secured titular facility. To do so he must investigate the area and bypass many security measures. For most early parts, the film delivers quite the ride as audiences follow these guys on Vegas and its surrounding. Some investigations and interviews set the tone right, and not in overly silly way. Characters are also pretty decent and likable as though they are real life friends.Unfortunately, it soon arrives at familiar territory of hazy shots and mindless running. The scenes in the city or desert are identifiable, but when it is stranded in dark corners, the movie loses the momentum significantly. Script is also numbingly bland as characters would yell the same thing over and over again, this is especially true when they are repeatedly shouting, \"We gotta go\". With both visual and audio decrease in quality, it just turns into a confusing escapade.Cinematography is to be expected from this kind of found footage flick, it's rather elementary, but there are a few good shots with modified vision. At several scenes the film builds up the suspense pretty well, these are not all translated into thrilling moments. It almost seems like it has problems in latter half, resorting to cheap alien gimmick and nullifying its early decent production.Area 51 has a presentable start with more engaging use of the found footage, but it falls to the same issues and ends up like the rest without accomplishing much.",

            "content": "The first question needs to be, are we not getting tired of these camcorder lost footage movies? Ever since the overrated \"Blair Witch Project,\" we have been deluged with similar-themed films; most of which fall way, way short of being anything but tiresome. So enter Oren Peli with his own take on the concept, but in his favor we have the mysterious and always-intriguing Area 51 as the backdrop. That fact alone is precisely why I decided to give this film a look.At first it appeared that Peli might have done it right. Blending actors and sets with real people and locations associated with Area 51, the set-up is intriguing. Even the process in which these filmmakers attempt to foil some of the high-tech base security systems, seems plausible. So far so good.But it is when the title characters break into the house of an Area 51 / S4 worker and steal his 'card', eventually actually getting inside the top-secret facility, that the movie becomes completely unbelievable and downright ridiculous. Everything that follows is what we have come to know, and depending on how you feel about these shaky-cam movies, love or hate about the concept.It's not that \"Area 51\" is a bad movie: the performances and design is actually of high-caliber, but given the exciting story set-up, Peli really should have given us a whole lot more than just another camcorder film. In fairness, I think some people will enjoy this. I did not.",

This film isn't meant to be great, but made for those who like something a bit scary. It really isn't too bad of a film once it gets going.It starts out slow and stumbles a bit, that's true, but in the second half it picks up. It gets interesting once the characters are inside Area 51. From there, it's hard to look away, not knowing what to expect. It was definitely different, but not great and not terrible either.",

            "content": "I love scary movies, and I really love \"scary\" movies-- from Blair Witch to Paranormal Activity, I've always been a huge fan of shaky cameras and found footage. Ghosts and aliens scare me, and classic terror tropes work wonders on me! Things jumping out from behind other things and unexpected screams are my idea of a fun movie night.If you are looking for a scary movie with aliens as the focus, I would recommend picking up Dark Skies, or John Carpenter's The Thing... but not Area 51, because this is a terrible film. I put it on expecting to be shock-scared, or at least creeped out... but all I got was progressively more and more annoyed.The first half of the film does absolutely nothing but establish that the viewer should lack empathy for the main characters-- they are vapid young men who enjoy drinking, planning ineffectively, and disrespecting professional entertainers.The second half of the film is meant to heighten the viewer's anxiety and presumably scare us, but it falls disappointingly short in that respect. Instead it devolves into lots of running and flailing, lots of awful camera work, and terrible physical acting. When the end finally comes, it's more a relief than anything else.The only positive thing I have to say about this movie is that the main characters' treatment of their female colleague was basically respectful, which is more than what I can say for most movies that are structured in the \"x number of guys + 1 girl\" model. Nobody grabs her breasts or calls her disgusting names or belittles her intelligence based on her gender. That's awesome.The rest of the film? Really not so much.",

Again, similar to the first Paranormal Activity, there is a lack of story and realistic actions by characters in Peli's latest. Additionally, characters are weak, having little to no back-story and often times unlikable. Even with Peli's out used hand-held style of filmmaking, there is a particular originality to the film based on the alien side story. There are creative imaginary thoughts and well done shots of cinematography with this film. It almost seemed the film steadily managed to save itself as the film progressed. By no means would it be a film I recommend to people looking for the latest and greatest of 2015 but it's not a total waste, even when I wanted it and expected it to be.",

And I am not even a big fan of camcorder movies. In fact I don't really like that way of filming. I am sure it would have been even better if they would have filmed it normally. Nevertheless the whole movie is full of suspense. From the part where they prepare themselves to the part where they decide to execute their plan to enter Area 51 it's all suspense. The actors might not be well known but at least they put down a believable performance. I really don't get why so many people don't like this movie.

A bunch of young adults with a camera film their partying, going to strip clubs, basically doing a bunch of young adult stuff.But when they decide and plan to infiltrate Area 51, things get really interesting. Peli brings a lot of refreshing ideas to the table and in my opinion, totally delivers. The tension and suspense as these people infiltrate first the area, and then the actual facility is nailbiting. Once inside, we are treated to a non-stop ride of weirdness and all kinds of alien technology and other stuff I won't mention.Definitely a must-see for found footage nuts like me and fans of sci-fi horror in general.

It wasn't.From the first 10 minutes I knew i would hate this movie, the acting is laughable, absolutely laughably bad which completely put me off. The plot is completely ridiculous and stupid and all the way through you are thinking, sure, of course they would make these stupid decisions. Every UFO/Area 51 clich\u00e9 is in here which to any avid UFO fan who has a keen interest in the field it just makes you cringe. Its like they have read a few UFO stories on the net and put little bits of detail from each story in here. The most secure base on the planet and some young idiots manage to break in without being seen. You cant even get near the place because of the perimeter control yet they manage to get in easily.And finally the whole film being recorded through a camera has been done to death, its not fun or clever anymore, its a cheap way for a director to make a quick buck for little time and effort. This movie probably took around a week to film its that bad. Please, no more shaky camera films, they are boring and unoriginal, they have been done too many times.All in all, this movie was genuinely one of the worst films i've ever had the misfortune of seeing. People can make their own minds up but I cannot recommend avoiding this movie enough, its a terrible waste of time.",

There were actually a few throughout the film, but not many.They had an interesting storyline, because who doesn't want to know about Area 51? However, for such a top-secret, high-security military base, the security seemed rather lacking both before and after they entered the base. Through quite a lot of their time in the base, Reid, Derrin, and Jelena would talk with normal pitched voices and run down the stairs like a pack of elephants. No security was around. That's not how I'd envision any military base, let alone Area 51.The alien was interesting, in the very few frames they showed it. I guess the design wasn't considered serious enough, so they devoted as little footage as they could.The tenseness of the scenes was fun.

Why is it every single alien movie that is made anymore is always found footage? Have writers lost their creativity and can't actually write a good blockbuster alien movie? One last note.

Also there's drama about bringing the girl on the mission, but she doesn't add to the climax.Few sound effects - the editors very selective - and I don't think there was any music (apart from the party stuff).Overall, it sets up well but falls short on spooks in its descent into Hardy Boys yarniness.",

The suspense was surprisingly effective. I even found myself tensed up and gritting my teeth a few times. Special effects, although not plentiful, we effective as well. I agree with a previous reviewer that I felt dissatisfied with the end of the movie. I think that, maybe with a bigger budget and a well thought out ending, it could have been much better.

If you go into this movie hoping for action, I'm sorry. Though it isn't what many were expecting, it is still very interesting to see their plans unfold.The third act is where it really surprised me. Oren keeps with the golden rule of good horror: waiting for the unknown is a lot scarier than finding the unknown. You see very little of the aliens, which could be a let down to those looking for a monster movie. But watching the shadow of the aliens walking down the hall, or seeing an alien slowly slide from the darkness is truly creepy. There were many times I was very tense and on the edge of my seat.The ending isn't as bad as many people are saying, for I kind of liked it. With some slightly better writing/imagination towards the ending, it could've made this movie a true diamond-in-the-rough. The acting, despite what many say, is tolerable and, for the most part, believable. The main character does have these moments of awful, goosebumps- inducing acting, but the other elements of the movie made me forget about it.All in all, give it a shot. Its streaming on Netflix, and I'd say its well worth a shot. Worst scenario, you lose an hour and thirty minutes of your day. Or you could walk away with a pleasant experience. Just remember to keep your mind open to what the movie wants to be, not what you want it to be. Have fun!",

The constant suspense (after the introductions), no obvious scientific 'mistakes', some good jokes at the right times and zero jokes in serious/tense moments.

I was physically ill after watching Gravity. If you agree with me on that part, I think you'll be safe watching this movie! Also, If you enjoyed the movie \"as above, so below\", you're quite certain to enjoy this.",

I can not stand found footage movies. That shaky cam and trying to make things realistic to make people believe that what is happening is real really make me nauseous. I get severe motion sickness from watching this type of cinema. I decided to forgoe my distaste for found footage movies because I found the idea behind this movie to be interesting. Three friends decide to sneak into Area 51 and document what they find there. Every person who is interested in aliens and UFOs know all about Area 51 and everyone wants to know what is going on there. I'm no different. I went out there to Rachel, Nevada to visit it. I got a little giddy by watching these places on the screen again. I enjoy it and I'm intrigued by it. I still have this nagging feeling though that this movie had no need to be found footage. It could have been a standard narrative and achieved far more success. When they make it into the base and the camera is still going wild, I had a difficult time determining what was happening. I wanted to know some semblance of what was happening. I wanted those moments between the friends and the woman who helps them where we learn about who they were as people. I wanted to know why they were obsessed. We never really learn much about any of them. You also find yourself asking why are they still filming when things go insane. It's the same question people ask when they watch a found footage movie. Making this a standard narrative removes that problem from the story. The ending was also blah. It has that usual bad ending that a lot of these found footage movies have and it was kinda BS. The beginning spoils this ending as well. The performances are pretty meaningless and outside of the interest in UFOs and Area 51, there's nothing to do here. It's scattered and a wasted potential. I hate to see that.

It is clear from the get-go that the group are going to end up inside Area 51 so that is not a spoiler. How they do this is pretty clever in my opinion. The story is pretty interesting as it progresses. We have it all soldiers, men in black, scientists, aliens chases, the works.

It's totally unrealistic, but if u can suspend your disdain for that aspect and just sit back and enjoy the last 45 minutes, you might be Pleasantly surprised(again, given its rating). It was more fun(& actually rating a touch higher) , albeit not as well acted as \"child 44\"(its rental companion). I say watch it. Its not nearly as bad as the score. I think some of the younger crowd votes this low because they think this young group is stupid and silly, just like they are, but they don't want to admit it.Don't get me wrong. Concept wise its ridiculous. They're clumsy and loud while sneaking around. The ending could have had a twist of sorts but really doesn't.

            "content": "Apparently Oren Peli had been working on this project since 2009, and there was plenty of hype surrounding what it was going to be like after his success with the overrated but fun \"Paranormal activity\". After finally getting it out to us in a limited theater release and on demand, I must say I was a little skeptical due to that type of small scale release, and that it was another found footage film which we have been bombarded with in the horror genre of late. I went in with low expectations as with most horror and found footage type films. This film starts at an incredibly slow rate trying to show 3 friends in their preparations to break into the heavily guarded and controversial Area 51 base. It seems like for about an hour they wasted time with unnecessary scenes en route to their destination. Just absolutely unnecessary scenes that could've been cut down into about 30 min rather than 60, but I'm sure it was cheaper on the budget this way. When they FINALLY arrive things do actually start happening and getting somewhat interesting. They find some alien technology and a UFO which had some creative yet clich\u00e9 aspects. They then find some sort of secret chamber in which you definitely start thinking you'll see an alien pop out. After some tense suspense and claustrophobia you realize they aren't going to really show any aliens, but just rely on jump scares and loud bangs. At this point the movie is pretty much wrapping up and it does have a pretty cool unexpected ending which I won't get into detail with, but I still can't believe they barely showed the aliens at all. You get maybe one scene where you can get an outline of a gray, but other than that it's a tease. For what this was hyped up to be, it was a huge disappointment, but I wasn't surprised honestly. If you want to waste an hour watching the build up to a half hour of creative and decently ambitious and exciting found footage, then go ahead. Just know that it takes awhile for things to start. If you're looking for visual aliens, this really doesn't offer any probably so they could save on the budget which must have been pretty low. All in all an entertaining last half hour of found footage, yet overall a very boring mediocre film.",

According to documentaries I have watched you clearance card only grants you access to the specific area you will be working in, not every and any door in the base.I will not hate on this movie just because it is a 'found footage' movie with grainy and shaky imagery. Although I don't tend to like this specific genre of movie I watched it because it seemed like a sequel to 'Hangar 10', a movie about Britain's Roswell.It did annoy me that after they set the alarms off all they seemed to be doing mainly was running around panting \"Gotta get outta here...Gotta get the f outta here.\" A 12-year-old could've written a better script.The had every detail planned on how to get in to the base as well, but didn't seem to have a plan for getting back out again.

I do also like aliens though, and I am a sucker for alien Area 51 movies, even though I don't think our government is hiding some dead alien from the Roswell crash or reverse-engineering an alien spaceship.There are some decent and pretty good Area 51 alien movies and \"documentaries\" out there, but this one is just not one of them. It's just more of the same old, same old found footage where nothing worthwhile happens until the last 15 minutes or so and even when something does finally happen, it's a huge disappointment.If you want to watch good found footage films or POV films, in my opinion, there are some pretty cool ones...such as: REC & REC 2, CLOVERFIELD, TROLL HUNTER, V/H/S & V/H/S 2, GRAVE ENCOUNTERS & GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 2, THE TUNNEL MOVIE, THE LAST HORROR MOVIE and even THE BLACK WATER VAMPIRE.

This isn't a movie that reaches a conclusion - there isn't even a hint at a story arc. Instead there's a basic premise (that the main character was abducted by aliens and now feels compelled to break into Area 51) and a complete lack of any sort of resolution - why does he feel that way? what was his mission? Did he succeed? This film feels like a student art project with a special effects budget. Do yourself a favor and avoid!",

Area 51 is certainly more stylish and well thought out, but it is certainly not a horror film. The flow of the movie is smooth in what I call a nice to bad situation. For instance I call \"single white female\" and \"fatal attraction\", to be \"nice to bad\" films. You can feel the passion for the base, from the characters, who are likable, and come across as just a bunch of young friends on an adventure. There are no jump scares that might induce a heart attack, and the dialogue is clear and not drowned out by music or effects. You feel as if your on this adventure with them. If your a fan of sci-fi or conspiracies about area 51, I am sure you will be impressed by this solid effort. So turn off the lights, grab some popcorn and a beer, sit back and enjoy. This movie is unpretentious, and refreshingly does not take itself too seriously. However, if your looking for a horror gore fest, please look elsewhere...This is NOT a horror movie!",

You don't know who they are, what their skills are, why they suddenly decide to turn suicidal and break into a military facility.. nope, nothing. One guy at the start of the movie is supposed to be kidnapped by aliens (this isn't a spoiler, trust me), at least that's what I think happens since the movie is about aliens. For all we know, he got drunk and wandered around. But that STILL doesn't explain why his black friend is stupid enough to follow a nut-job trying to enter into an army base. Don't these people have jobs?So when three nobodies, manage to casually walk into a military facility, running around laughably in the open, with only ONE SECURITY CAMERA in the whole base (which they fail to avoid, of course)... you know you are in for a treat. Don't even get me started on the terrible acting, script, camera-work, lighting and CGI. The aliens especially are just hilariously bad and I burst out laughing the first time they showed one moving on-screen.Anyway, this movie lasts for 1hr 30mins. The alien bits happen after 1hr 13mins of watching them run around in an empty military facility with no security cameras (except THAT one which they fail to avoid).This is just torture.

I also felt like the movie was as believable as it could possibly be (considering 3 twenty somethings getting away with, what they got away with.

The actors in this film are what makes it. Some viewers thought the action before they get to Area 51 was the low-point of the film and that it picks up but I am of the opposite sentiment. I enjoyed the banter and the build-up. Once we get to Area 51 the film adequately changes pace and style and although it's low-budget is very telling at points (Area 51 is clearly some out-of-hours industrial estate) it is nevertheless effective at raising and sustaining suspense. Completed in 2011, I believe, this film did not get a release until 2015.",

            "content": "I read a lot of reviews about this movie and they were usually negative but I still decided to give it a go. The movie starts off slow but with the realistic aspect and everything is done very well. The actors make us believe that they are real people. It starts with bunch of people saying that the people (the main characters) are not crazy and that they were normal.Then we are off from there in the car where the main characters are recording and driving, they go to a party and have a good time but one of the main characters *Reid* goes missing and they drive off looking for him and accidentally stumble upon him on the middle of the road. He seems to be in a trance state and gives no explanation as to what happened to him but they don't think much of it. *Spoilers* But this is where I think everything begins. He was obviously kidnapped by aliens and they implanted something in his head that lead him to the area 51, this is referring to when he tells his friend that the place seems to be calling to him. Then they meet the locals and one of them seems to be a crazy guy, says they sent him out here and we just dismiss him as a crazy guy. But this movie requires a lot of brain-thinking from the viewers. As they infiltrate into the base and they go deeper and deeper, they stumble upon a UFO and when Reid touches it, it does something, but then the girl tries and nothing happens. This is where you have to start thinking that something is going on. They go into the lab and find an anti-gravity rock and some white liquid but it appears to be moving itself when the girl is close-by and it tries to throw itself at her *hints hints*!.They go to the caves/tunnels and they find human dresses and alien rubber suit explaining that they might be like space-suit but clearly Aliens are big and scary when we are being chased at some point. The girl claims that one of the dolls looks exactly like the one she had when she was a kid. Her father was also trying to get into this place but why? Maybe they're doing experiments and she's a hybrid alien/human.Then things go downhill very very fast and it just ends with everything thinking what the hell just happened? This is stupid. But what you actually have to do is broaden your mind and reverse the whole movie and think. You have to focus on very specific things to be able to understand this movie. It's very intelligently written. You have to be willing to think outside the box and look for the main points they're trying to throw at you. You have to remember what happened before and connect the dots, as to why Reid was gone missing? In the end you can see UFO flying away and then they take their friends.. I think it was an escape plan by the aliens who kidnapped Reid earlier in the movie.",

Also, chatter. Lots and lots of trivial chatter. Zzzzz.Even when we do reach the alleged extraterrestrial hotbed (which is FAR too easy to break into, btw) things proceed at a snail's pace, with only the last ten minutes providing anything by way of excitement. By then, it's already too late, and you'll probably wish to be sucked up into the sky like our unlucky protagonists long before the credits roll.No, for a movie with a meagre 5 million dollar budget, I don't expect perfection. What I do want however, is a few thrills, chills and the feeling this is all actually happening.When everything mostly feels dull and fake (climax aside) I think I'm entitled to feel a bit gipped.

This is competently made but bland in every way. Three friends, one very reluctantly, hatch and execute an elaborate plan to break into the secret facilities of Area 51, where our government supposedly experiments with aliens and/or alien technology. At one point the reluctant friend, Ben (the only character with a modicum of personality), refuses to go on until the ringleader, Reid, satisfactorily explains what is driving him forward in his plan. Viewers might well want to demand the same of Peli and co-writer Christopher Denham.

            "content": ". I watch the movies so you don't have to. And this week I watched \"Area 51\", which is available for free on Netflix. And it's overpriced. Area 51 was written and directed by Oren Peli. If you google \"Oren Peli\" you will instantly see a picture of a man who looks like he is named \"Oren\". He is worth fifty million dollars and nothing in this review will have any effect on him. He is the writer and director of \"Paranormal Activity\", which, for a found footage movie, did not suck. Area 51 sucked. But let's not focus on the negative. We have all eternity for that (Preview- You and Me minus Me watching \"You Me and Dupree\" for 100 years- with occasional breaks for forcible sodomy). Area 51 did some things right. It didn't overuse certain horror tropes. For example, at no point in this movie did Sean Bean die. He just wished he was dead, while watching it. I assume that this movie was footage found by Sean Bean. It just makes it more sense to imagine him watching it. So aside from that, it was all pretty much what you would expect minus anything remotely scary. There were teenagers with portable cameras who had a plan to break into Area 51. This was inspired by their friend (played by Reid Warner), who was clearly under Alien Control the entire movie. Through a series of time filling drivel compelling escapades the teen (or young adults-it doesn't matter) make it to Area 51 and the third act of the movie begins. This is the only portion of the film that has special effects. Nothing remotely scary here either, just a lot of alien technology. I kept thinking that at some point the teens would come across scientists dissecting an alien, a live alien, and that the film would end with the teens being captured by an alien that they set free and they would find themselves on a dissection table. Or whatever a table that dissections take place on is called. SPOILER- that doesn't happen.In fact, the ending is simply that, it's the end of ninety minutes of nothing. No big twist, scare, or fulfillment of any subtle promise made earlier in the film. In similar films, like the Blair Witch Project, the last thirty seconds of the film justify the first ninety minutes in a spectacular way. Not so much here. This movie would have been better if the first ninety minutes were the characters driving to area 51 while watching \"Paranormal Activity\" on an iPad. At least Sean Bean would have seen something entertaining. On a side note- there was one scene in the movie where a woman's breasts were thrust in front of a camera. It reminded me of the scene in \"Airplane\", where for no reason breasts filled the camera. I could not help but think that somewhere on the west coast, the day before this scene was shot (for Area 51), this woman had a conversation with a friend, perhaps a lover, where she said \"tomorrow I'm going to be shooting a scene for a major movie! It's being done by the director of Paranormal!\" Maybe she called her dad and told him. She was uncredited in this film. One Star. One Star for crushing the dreams of this uncredited actress, you sick bastards. That was the only angst this movie caused. And we don't even know her name. http://majorhorror.blogspot.com/2015/09/area-51-review-by- damien.html",

The most entertaining parts of the film take place at Area 51 itself, where the production values and the atmosphere are so convincing that one could think the real Area 51 could look like this. What they find there is something of a mixed-bag, since although we did not know for certain what they would find, we are not surprised.\n\nBut the biggest disappointment is the characters who, in spite of some fecklessly colorful dialogue and behavior, come off as generic frat-boy types. What's curious is that although the main characters spend most of the film planning or discussing how to break into Area 51, they do not seriously seem to consider the magnitude of what they're saying, even when one of them insists that the penalty for getting caught is 15 years in prison. I forget, also, if they ever mentioned an escape plan.\n\nThe pacing is another issue. Too much time is spent on the heroes planning and talking about motion sensors, and arguing about protagonist Reid's (Reid Warner), immovable determination to invade the base. After an hour, especially with such uninteresting characters, this feels like too much. There are a handful of moments pre-Area 51 that work. There's the scene in which the young heroes break into the home of a base employee and must sneak back out after the family comes home. But even then that's sort of minimal-level suspense. If we had cared more about the characters, or sympathized with their motives, scenes like this would be more.\n\nI admit to being confused by the camera footage perspective of the film, which at some point shows multiple people splitting in several directions, each with a camera recording for the audience's benefit. Since these cameras are likely destroyed or lost by the end of the film, how can anyone see it? Are we seeing what the cameras are seeing as they're happening?

It's filmed in the currently popular mock documentary style and opens with interviews of the 4 guys' friends by an unknown person. Then the movie cuts to the guys' home made camera footage. How this footage was obtained, in light of the concluding events, is unknown as well.\nThe advantage of the guys' jerky home made movies is that it covers up the movie's low quality special effects. The guys prepare for the mission but are curiously unprepared for what they are convinced that they will find at area 51.\nIt's pretty fun and fortunately short at 1:30 and has a mild political undertow to it.\nBesides the lack of cinematography, what really hampers the movie is the dialogue. There are enough f-bombs in it for WWIII. Typical dialogue is: \"(f-bpmb) we've got to get out of here. (f-bomb) did you see that ? (f-bomb) we've got to get out of here (f-bomb)....\" ad nauseum.

            "content": "The first thing I did after watching \"Area 51,\" directed by Oren Peli, was to check the picture's budget. I was horrified that five million dollars was put into the film but it looked like it had a budget of about five thousand dollars. It is very student film-by one who is meant to fail the class because he or she does not understand how to set up elementary elements, like how to create tension or suspense. This is key because the genre is sci-fi horror but the result is, for the most part, boredom.\n\nIt starts off on the wrong foot. People talk directly to camera about how three friends-Reid (Reid Warner), Darrin (Darrin Bragg), and Ben (Ben Rovner)-had gone missing ever since they decided to break into Area 51, a government facility that supposedly house extraterrestrial evidence. This is a mistake because it signals to us that it is one of those so-called found-footage pictures where it all goes terribly wrong in the end-meaning there is likely no survivor. Already we get the impression that it is a pessimistic film.\n\nOne might be tempted to compare this work to Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S\u00e1nchez' \"The Blair Witch Project.\" After all, they have more than a few similarities: three protagonists, characters going on a journey in search of proof, and they come to regret their decision to plunge carelessly into the unknown. But to make that comparison is an insult to the 1999 classic. That film has plenty of memorable scenes. It may frustrate many at times but one cannot stop looking at it because there is a quiet menace underneath the desperation of the characters.\n\nHere, just about everything comes across as forced and false. For instance, as the protagonists finally arrive at the facility, one can barely see anything. The break-in occurs at night so it is very dark. In addition, the hand-held camera shakes so relentlessly that it is dizzying and we are unable to appreciate the environment or marvel at the government's secret area. There is an exchange among the characters that the point of them going on this mission is to show the public what is hidden. I found it ironic that in the end it shows us nothing of substance.\n\nThe visual effects during the latter half are ugly and fake: floating meteorites, seemingly conscious liquid, spaceships-even invisible extraterrestrials (how convenient-it must have been so expensive creating invisible aliens on screen). One of the problems with these images is a complete lack of imagination. These are things that we have seen before in better television shows and movies. Peli's film does not bother to be creative or offer something new. It takes tired images and formulas, chews them up, and regurgitates them. Then the filmmakers, through our eyes and brain, expect us to digest these recycled trash. Don't you find that insulting?\n\nHalfway through the picture, something in me-one who knows better-wished that I were watching the Season One finale of Chris Carter's \"The X-Files.\" That one episode is everything this movie is not: sharply written, imaginative, envelope-pushing in terms of the medium, the performances are memorable, and the revelations stick with you like a sentient goo from outer space.\n\nFilm-Review.org",

The film itself follows many of your typical beats (it goes pretty much exactly where you think it would go. No real twists, turns, surprises, or even scares). You know your movie is in trouble when the douche-iest bro is the only one who starts talking sense. I wasn't crazy about Paranormal Activity, but at least it used it's minimalistic settings to its advantage (Here we get to explore your typical office, locker room, office staircase, and a few tunnels), was competently made, and actually had some scares. Not to mention the CGI and effects in Area 51  (when there are any) are super weak. There are a few pieces that could have come across as clever in better hands. In the end, Area 51 is just a bunch of stupid 20-somethings wandering around, doing nothing, with absolutely nothing happening until it's predictable and laughably bad ending finally comes around. A very unimpressive, boring, and dull film that travels in a straight line from beginning to end. Area 51 could have been a really cool film, and it's premise does hold potential (even if it has been done before). Unfortunately, this is just your dime-a-dozen, paint-by-numbers, lifeless and listless found-footage style movie. No wonder it never got a theatrical release.",

There's a party scene where it's implied the story's lead is abducted/probed by aliens, and they've told him to come to Area 51 or something. That would be interesting if it ever came up ever again. Getting the characters to Area 51 is the easy part when writing a movie like this. You have a trio of people going in, and the driver waiting outside who changed his mind about going in.\n\nOkay, so, why not just write it as a band of misfits who develop a strong fascination with Area 51 and decide that they want to see inside? It would lead to less wasted time, and more time for us to be scared while they're actually in Area 51.\n\nTruth be told, I have no real overall opinion on this movie. See it if you like or don't.

            "content": "I think I have gone on a rant on why I love found footage films many times before, so I am going to avoid that here. Despite, the failing hype around the genre due to some really terrible made movies, you may expect something else from this one as its a return to direction from writer/ producer of the Insidious series, the unfairly cancelled brilliant TV series The River - Oren Peli. The man behind the camera of the 1st Paranormal Activity, the film which arguably started this craze (yeah I know Blair Witch!). Of course for a fan like me, this film was awaited on completely different level as its combined two of my favorite genres (found footage & Aliens conspiracy). Ghosts and aliens scare me, and classic terror tropes work wonders on me! Ever since the overrated \"Blair Witch Project,\" we have been deluged with similar-themed films; most of which fall way, way short of being anything but tiresome. So enter Oren Peli with his own take on the concept, but in his favor we have the mysterious and always-intriguing Area 51 as the backdrop. That fact alone is precisely why I decided to give this film a look. But unfortunately, just like every poor film of the genre, the film lacks any depth & adding to the mix is the poor finale. It suffers from the same exact problems by stuttering towards the end! The story follows Reid (Reid Warner) who after a 'calling' during a pool part convinces his friends Darrin (Darrin Bragg) & Ben (Ben Rovner) to take him to Las Vegas & help him break into the mythical government facility Area 51 in order to expose the presence of Aliens on earth. Along with them on the ride is fellow conspiracy theorist Jelena (Jelena Nik), whose deceased father was an ex employee at the facility. So we get the usual footage of people driving to desolate areas, where they are confronted by suspicious looking people, they talk to other people with whom are also obsessed with the subject matter, and this happens for the majority of the film! For most early parts, the film delivers quite the ride as audiences follow these guys on Vegas and its surrounding. Some investigations and interviews set the tone right, and not in overly silly way. Characters are also pretty decent and likable as though they are real life friends. Unfortunately, it soon arrives at familiar territory of hazy shots and mindless running. The scenes in the city or desert are identifiable, but when it is stranded in dark corners, the movie loses the momentum significantly. Script is also numbingly bland as characters would yell the same thing over and over again, this is especially true when they are repeatedly shouting, \"We gotta go\". With both visual and audio decrease in quality, it just turns into a confusing escapade. At first it appeared that Peli might have done it right. Blending actors and sets with real people and locations associated with Area 51, the set-up is intriguing. Even the process in which these filmmakers attempt to foil some of the high-tech base security systems, seems plausible. So far so good. But it is when the title characters break into the house of an Area 51 / S4 worker and steal his 'card', eventually actually getting inside the top-secret facility, that the movie becomes completely unbelievable and downright ridiculous. Everything that follows is what we have come to know, and depending on how you feel about these shaky-cam movies, love or hate about the concept. Cinematography is to be expected from this kind of found footage flick, it's rather elementary, but there are a few good shots with modified vision. At several scenes the film builds up the suspense pretty well, these are not all translated into thrilling moments. It almost seems like it has problems in latter half, resorting to cheap alien gimmick and nullifying its early decent production. There are some decent and pretty good Area 51 alien movies and \"documentaries\" out there, but this one is just not one of them. It's just more of the same old, same old found footage where nothing worthwhile happens until the last 15 minutes or so and even when something does finally happen, it's a huge disappointment. For what this was hyped up to be, it was a huge disappointment, but I wasn't surprised honestly. If you want to waste an hour watching the build up to a half hour of creative and decently ambitious and exciting found footage, then go ahead. Just know that it takes awhile for things to start. If you're looking for visual aliens, this really doesn't offer any probably so they could save on the budget which must have been pretty low. On the whole, 'Area 51', has a presentable start with more engaging use of the found footage, but it falls to the same issues and ends up like the rest without accomplishing much, but given the exciting story set-up, Peli really should have given us a whole lot more than just another camcorder film. In fairness, I think some people will enjoy this. I did not! Trust me there are some good movies out there for example REC (Just 1 & 2) Cloverfield, V/H/S series, Grave Encounters (the original & the sequel), The Tunnel Movie, & of course the original Paranormal Activity trilogy (not the shameful sequels). Disappointing!",

To be fair, the slow burn does eventually catch fire and there's lots of screaming and heavy breathing and dark tunnels and running and what-not. The relatively tense final half-hour is clearly the reason that very smart producer Jason Blum thought this would be a solid follow-up to \"Paranormal Activity.\" It's that first hour that is the reason it took six years to (barely) get released.  There's no tension or action for the longest time and \"Area 51\" might have been better served as a short film or episode of an anthology series in that the entire first-hour of set-up could have been cut to five minutes. It makes sense for Area 51 to try and replicate the Paranormal Activity formula. Peli wanted another hit, so he repeats himself here, only instead of ghosts and darkness, there are aliens and darkness. Peli tacks an abrupt ending on the same film that caused over five years of grief and countless days of edits, re-edits, and obvious uncertainty. There's no creative leap to enjoy and little filmmaking finesse to study. Instead, it's more of the same, and in the five years \"Area 51\" has been sitting on the shelf, every studio and aspiring horror moviemaker has beaten Peli at his own game.\n\nVERDICT: \"Not So Hot\" - [Negative Reaction] These films are truly terrible films. They are not the worst things ever made, but they are definitely awful and should not be seen by anyone. (Films that are rated 1.5 or 2 stars)",

            "content": "In 2009, Oren Peli all but reinvented the indie/found footage horror film with his sequel-spawning Paranormal Activity.  I'll remember the experience of seeing that film for the first time for as long as I live; sans expectations, I sauntered into the screening happy as a bird...then wobbled out 90 minutes later on shaky knees.  Watching two people sleeping and an invisible demon on the market for a human body to call home was apparently enough to break me.  Peli had tapped into horror's golden mantra - that less is more - and executed it to perfection.  Nothing happens in Paranormal Activity, yet it's one of the most effective horror films in recent years; the sound of footsteps slowly ascending the stairs or the mere accentuation of a static buzz, alluding to the next 'scare', is enough to destroy at least your next three nights' sleep.\n\nNow we have Area 51, Peli's long-delayed and anticipated (in some corners, at least) follow-up about a group of kids planning to break into the eponymous base and discover some of the American government's most closely guarded secrets.  The film sets itself up in pretty much the same way every found-footage flick does nowadays: three guys, one of whom unrealistically films everything they do, and a pretty girl who enters the frame later on and clearly has a stronger connection with one of said guys than the other two.  Remember Earth To Echo, or Project Almanac?  Exactly the same formula.  But at least they were better films.\n\nEven in attempting to look at this from a stand-alone perspective, i.e. ignoring Paranormal Activity completely, it's a hugely underwhelming experience.  Whether it's nitpicking or fatal, there are simply too many problems breaking up whatever semblance of a structure it has.  For starters, the characters are idiots.  Case in point: they've just broken into someone's house - someone whom they know to have been tangibly responsible for an ex-Area 51 employee's death - so what do they do?  Continue filming, of course.  When you're hiding behind a shower curtain with the house's owner mere inches away, of course you keep your blinking camera on.  But do they at least wear gloves? I hear you ask.  Ha!  Of course they don't.  One would be right assume they're smart enough to have a little moment and decide it's at least best to roll their sleeves down, but no.  Not even when they're IN AREA 51!  I mean, blimey.  Seriously?\n\nMore problematically, though, it isn't scary or thrilling.  Even slightly.  Perhaps Peli's intentions this time are less geared towards getting under his audiences' skin, which certainly feels like the case throughout, but if so, what are his intentions?  What kind of response is he attempting to elicit?  What is he actually trying to do with this film?  It takes about 70 minutes for something to actually happen involving the mysteries of Area 51.  When it does, it's unclear how we're supposed to react.  It feels like, despite the delays in getting this thing made, they still weren't sure how they wanted the third act to play out; what they wanted the kids to find.  It's rushed and generic with nothing to evoke even a little excitement.  Essentially, the moment the kids get into Area 51 is the moment the film truly dies.  How's that for depressing?",

He wrote Chernobyl Diaries which was terrible, but it was also written by the Van Dyke brothers which one of them has written the Asylum DVDs, so I didn't blame entirely on Oren Peli. So when it didn't came out for years, I did start to forget about it, until I saw that it was on Netflix which I was very curious about Area 51. As it turns out, Area 51 is not as groan inducing as Chernobyl Diaries, but it might as well be forgotten. The acting is not nearly as good in this as in the director's previous film Paranormal Activity, and is just average. The characters are lacking any development that I didn't care about anyone or wanting them to survive. The first hour of it is so boring that I kept looking at how much progress I got into it many times. Most of the time I get why it's being filmed, but there's times that makes no sense about why it's being filmed, and that it could've made a bit better if it wasn't found footage. Things actually start to happen in the last 30 minutes which there are some cool effects in it, but even that was lacking in thrills. I like that there's no jump scares, but it doesn't do anything remotely scary that I start to wonder if it was even a horror film at all. It has an unnecessary ending that is just like any other horror film. For Chernobyl Diaries, there can be a good horror film from it which frustrated me that it was not good, but for Oren Peli's Area 51, I can't see how they can make a effective horror film and is just plain forgettable.",

Now, it's not terrible mind you, but average. It is not a horror movie; more like a fake documentary about people sneaking onto Area 51. There are some interesting visuals/ideas and the characters are very likeable for a found-footage affair, but is definitely not a must see. If you like found-footage movies, then give Area 51 a try. I don't hate myself for watching it.",
