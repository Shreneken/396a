            "review_title": "A pointless reboot which fails to improve on the original film in almost every manner possible",
            "content": "Based on a scientific project that Reed Richards (Miles Teller) has been developing (which can transfer matter from one dimension to another) the Fantastic Four use themselves as Guinea Pigs in order to transfer themselves to another dimension (in the belief that there is something in this other worldly dimension that will benefit their own planet). However, something goes wrong for our foursome during the transportation process and they end up with drastic physical transformations (some which are much more noticeable than others). Worse still, they tried and failed to save Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and leave him behind believing him to be dead. Later on, a team go back to the other dimension and discover that Victor is still alive and bring him back to Earth in order to assess his condition. But Victor has no intention of staying on Earth and is determined to create a new world in this other dimension and will stop at nothing to achieve his objective. Victor has also suffered a physical transformation, but he has become much stronger and more powerful than his former friends and the Fantastic Four find that they must work together to try to stop him from carrying out his evil plans.The film opens up with some promise whereby we're given an insight into how our illustrious foursome ended up becoming the formidable team that we saw in the earlier films. Despite a fairly promising beginning though this reboot completely fails to bring about a lot of the magic that we witnessed in the 2005 version of this film.A big problem for me lay with the tone of the film; firstly it takes itself WAY too seriously and as a result it made the film quite boring to watch. When watching this it felt like I was watching a science documentary (with all its wordy geeky exposition) rather than what should be a fun comic book type movie. This brings me on to my next point 'What fun'? In the 2005 film (and the 2007 film as well) there was much more in the way of camaraderie between the cast making the film much more fun to watch. As a villain Von Doom isn't particularly well-developed here and I felt his motivations for world-domination were a little sketchy here - I criticised Von Doom's motivations in the original film, but compared to his motivations here they now seem more plausible in retrospect.I appreciate that this is a reboot and therefore the filmmaker's are trying to put their own stamp on things (presumably that explains why Johnny Storm is black in this film and also explains why their powers have been attained in a different manner to the original film). The problem with this reboot is that they've failed to do anything to improve on the original film; the story isn't as interesting, the characters are much weaker and are poorly developed, there is no real exploration of their super powers (this was a big thing in the previous films and made sense as they were a big life-changing aspect for the foursome), but here they just kind of have the super powers and then that's it - off to destroy Victor Von Doom. The only real super power that is explored is that of The Thing and even that super power is exploited in a rather lame way.The cast are another big problem with this film as they totally failed to engage with me (as well as each other); Miles Teller is really bland as Reed Richards (even more bland than Ioan Gruffudd was in the original films) which is surprising as he put in a very good performance in Whiplash 2 years ago. Kate Mara is very pretty, but she's terrible in this film (again probably worse than Alba was in the original films). Michael B Jordan tries his best as Johnny Storm, but he lacks the charisma that Evans brought to the role in the original films and as a result suffers badly in comparison. The Thing for me is probably the best character in the film, but he lacks the touching back story that we lay witness to in the original film and again suffers from not being developed sufficiently enough to make me really care about him here.The ending is also poor and lacks any kind of intensity and tension and has the Fantastic Four doing 'the obvious' to wrap the film up.All in all it's a very disappointing film where the serious tone is perhaps a bigger enemy to the film than Doctor Doom. It's big and bloated, but it's also boring, and lacking in both fun and imagination. I'd recommend giving it a wide berth.",

The effort necessary to get everything wrong, to miss every beat, to offend every memory that someone might have that would inspire them to go risk *another* attempt at this franchise; that has to come from a place of real disgust, I think. What is amazing is how regularly that kind of pointed loathing seems to be given the reigns of properties that an audience really cares about. Aside from the deep spiritual mistreatment - which is difficult, given how weird and wobbly the Fantastic Four are, to begin with - the pacing is poisonous, with the bulk of the film dedicated to what feels like an attempt at an involved origin story, but where the characters aren't really given anything to do, or to care about. In an attempt to avoid being explicit with motivations, I think, the characters instead limp around under the shadow of intentions - maybe Johnny is upset with his dad? Maybe Ben is looking for purpose? It's possible Richards spent his time in exile trying to help his friends? It's hard to say - better filmmaking could have answered these questions subtly. It didn't happen here.This is a joyless, uninteresting movie, with a cast that looked like they were waiting for something else to start, and I don't understand how they could spend all that money on a movie that looks this bad - designs, to sets, special effects; it's all incredibly dated and generic. One of the worst movies I've ever watched.",

            "review_title": "An empty plot and nonexistent character development make this reboot of Marvel's iconic superhero quartet a pointless exercise in ignominy",
            "content": "Just because you can do it doesn't mean that you should \u2013 and this wholly unnecessary and woefully terrible reboot of Marvel's most famous superteam is proof of that axiom. Say what you may about Tim Story's earlier cinematic adaptations, but as generic and middling as they were, they were at the very least entertaining. Unfortunately, the same cannot even be said of Josh Trank's back-to- basics origin story, which plays like a humourless retread of his debut film 'Chronicle' but on a bigger budget \u2013 and lest there be any doubt, it is far, far from fantastic.Not that it doesn't demonstrate such promise; the first act which establishes the friendship between the visionary Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and his tough-guy longtime best pal Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) as well as the team dynamics between Reed and the other members of his research team \u2013 the equally brilliant Sue (Kate Mara), her hot- headed younger brother Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), and malcontent genius Victor Von Doom (Toby Kibbell) \u2013 capably lay the foundation for what could have been a character-driven drama based on their clashing personalities. Indeed, after the boys sans Sue decide on a whim following a night of intoxication to put their teleporting machine to the test, how they respond to their newfound super-powers individually and as a team should be an organic evolution from how they were before.Alas, Trank, who co-wrote the screenplay with 'X-Men' veteran Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, doesn't quite know where to go from there. Rather than setting them on a course that would follow the perennial 'X-Men' theme of inclusiveness versus insularity against the rest of society, our teenage super-heroes are pretty much seen only in an isolated military facility where they are trained and from which they are deployed on covert operations overseas. While Johnny relishes the opportunity to be different, powerful and useful for once in his life, Sue and Ben are not quite so sanguine and participate insofar as there remains a possibility that the Government's research on them would yield some way of reversing their abnormalities. In the meantime, Reed has vanished off the grid, while Victor is presumed dead on the planet they had landed up on in the other dimension.One senses a conscious decision on the part of Trank to eschew the usual superheroics seen in the recent profusion of Marvel and to a lesser extent DC comic book adaptations, but the middle act drags precisely because Trank never quite finds a compelling substitute. Johnny's potential conflict with Sue and Ben over the Government's exploitation of their super-powers never amounts to anything more than a playground squabble. The estrangement between Johnny and his father (Reg E. Cathey), whose Baxter Institute had overseen the ill- fated project, is under-cooked. And last but not least, Reed's guilt over his teammates' fates as well as his strained friendship with Ben seem to vanish as quickly as he is apprehended and brought back to the facility to aid them in version 2.0 of the same project.Trank's intention of emphasising the tension within the quartet is evident and admirable, but is ultimately undone by a script that doesn't develop it in any substantive manner. Worse still, it leaves an audience looking for visual spectacle severely wanting, that not even a very busy third act manages to salvage. Doom makes an unsurprising return here as their common enemy, driven by a fusion of body and alien matter to cause global destruction and around whose defeat to ensure the survival of planet Earth becomes a rallying call for the team to unite despite their differences. It is one of the dullest and most unexciting finales we've seen in a Marvel movie, not least for the fact that it doesn't know how to collectively bring together their superpowers except in a tag-team fashion to distract their opponent. It is also on the whole one of the ugliest comic book movies we've ever seen. The planet from which the quartet gain their powers is a barren rocky wasteland that has no character or distinction whatsoever, shrouded perpetually with thick grey clouds and given the even more nondescript name of 'Zero'. The energy that gives them their abilities appears as some slimy green goo that belongs entirely in a C-grade Syfy TV movie, while their powers \u2013 whether Reed's rubber limbs or Sue's telekinesis or Johnny's pyrotechnics or Ben's rock-covered body \u2013 look equally cheesy. It is no wonder too that the eventual showdown, which takes place almost entirely on the planet surface of 'Zero', doesn't play out any much better against such a bland setting, coming off even worse than any of the action scenes in its predecessors.And certainly, this reboot is in no way better than Tim Story's earlier adaptations, no matter of its ambition of being a darker and more character-driven superhero piece. 'Chronicle' may have been a perfect calling card for Trank, but 'Fantastic Four' shows a young, inexperienced director completely out of his depth, absolutely justifying the advance bad buzz it had spent months battling. It is utterly embarrassing that a film about Marvel's most enduring creations is no better than a live-action 'Power Rangers' movie, but that's exactly the ignominy that this misconceived and badly executed excuse of a superhero movie has wrought.As is typical with such origin stories, this one ends with the quartet 'stumbling' on their title as they admire their new home in Central City and reflecting on how far they have come. Ben aka the Thing describes their journey as \"fantastic\"; we're not entirely sure anyone of their audience shares the same sentiment.",

            "content": "Over the last decade, we have seen a number of superhero movies get a much needed reboot. After the atrocious Batman & Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. Eight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice?Reed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to to finish what he started in his younger years.When they finally crack inter-dimensional travel, Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to travel to another world along with him and his team. An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth.The one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start.When a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.I had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy.The story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best. It all culminates in one of the most boring finales you will ever witness in a superhero movie. Compared to what else you see happen in other superhero movies these days, it all looks and feels amateur.Then there are the performances. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell are all young actors who have the world at their feet. They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot.Fantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.",

            "content": "Despite being somebody who enjoys superhero films as much as the next person, this 'Fantastic Four' reboot has to be down there with one of the worst.The 2005 film and its sequel, both directed by Tim Story, were not great films (the former was somewhat mediocre, though the sequel was an improvement) but even with their faults they were much better than the reboot. Although it is often considered one of the worst superhero/comic book films ever made, this reviewer has yet to properly see the 1990s incarnation, but it does have to be irredeemably bad to be worse than this.Oddly enough, 'Fantastic Four' is not completely irredeemable. Michael B. Jordan is a cool, commanding and likable Johnny/Torch, and the only one in the cast who tries and succeeds to do something with the way the characters are written. It is ironic that the best thing about the film was the thing that was attracting the most negative publicity before release due to his race. Some of the film does look quite good, with slick photography, darkly atmospheric lighting and audacious production design.Not all of it comes off though. The editing is both sloppy and choppy, not only looking cheap but in particular severely affecting the storytelling. The special effects are at best perfunctory and some of them look pretty bad actually, much prefer the look of The Thing in the Tim Story-directed films here The Thing looks too much like a rock monster. Josh Trank clearly wasn't the right director for this, directing with little flair or involvement with the story. Then again he doesn't deserve all of the blame as most of the film's failures falls at the door of producer/studio interference. The music has some haunting parts but at best generic and not much stands out.'Fantastic Four' has only one good performance, the rest are poor. Miles Teller and especially Kate Mara make Ioan Gruffodd and Jessica Alba look like Oscar-winners, Teller looks far too wooden and out of his depth as a leader and Mara is incredibly mechanical. Jamie Bell does try to stay true to Ben/The Thing's character, but the character is written far too one-dimensionally so Bell despite some glimpses as a whole fails to inject much tragedy or depth to him. The chemistry between them is almost non-existent and they just don't feel like a team. Toby Kebbell is an insipid and very non-threatening Victor Von Doom, here a villain practically shoe-horned into the story and basically a villain for the sake of being a villain with no obvious motivation or personality to speak of.In all fairness they do have a very clunky and by-the-numbers script, with some cheesy lines and too many stupid moments, to work with that has some neat ideas but barely does anything with them. There is too little action, and what there is of it is hugely underwhelming, very uninterestingly choreographed and no fun or tension, everything just feels indifferent. The biggest let down here in 'Fantastic Four' is the story which is a mess. Scenes that go on for too long, due to poorly written exposition that is barely elaborated upon (the father-son relationship could have injected some much needed heart to the film but goes nowhere), drag endlessly, and when something does happen if not by much the film rushes through it with some incompleteness here and there. The too short running time is to blame, the film should have been twenty minutes to half-an-hour longer.Particularly suffering is the far too busy third act and a very rushed (in length and to a lesser extent pace) and dramatically limp final battle, which doesn't really feel like much of a battle.All in all, fantastic is the last word to describe a very disappointing reboot. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

Cathey, Chet Hanks, and Tim Heidecker Directed By: Josh Trank Review CHANGE IS COMING. When I was a little boy around the time when I saw Spider- Man the movie from 2002 I also watched the 90s cartoon of Spider-Man on Jetex. Along with two other Marvel properties The Incredible Hulk cartoon and Fantastic Four. I was a big fan of that show I haven't seen it in a long time. But when they made the 2005 movie and I saw the trailer on the official website of the movie I got excited, saw the movie and I loved it as a kid and I still do. The sequel however the only good thing I could say for it at the time was Laurence Fishburne. I mean I know it was kind of hard to make a fantastic four movie with Galactus but ugh I just couldn't fathom what they did to him. Comic book movies are booming these days and it's a damn shame that this is the most recent entire to Marvel's first family. I like the 2005 movie but it's doesn't feel as Fantastic as the cartoon did. I have three perfect Spider-Man movies, I have five perfect Batman movie, I have four perfect Superman movies, I have three perfect X- Men movies, I have at least one perfect Hulk movie. But not one for Marvel's first family. What the hell?! Four young outsiders teleport to a dangerous universe, which alters their physical form in shocking ways. Their lives irrevocably upended, the team must learn to harness their daunting new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy. They use their origins from the Ultimate line of comics and you know something Kate Mara was actually going to read the comics to learn about her character but a FOX executive said \"No don't worry where going to use only the origin from the ultimate line, not any of the character aspect\" yeah actors who want to be in comic book movies if a studio executive says that to you get out of the project because they're not like Kevin Feige where they are a walking encyclopedia on Marvel or a person who gives a crap about the movie, if they don't care why should you. In this movie their is a scene where Reed Richards one of the smartest minds in the Marvel universe who while may take an obsession in his work abandons Ben, Sue, and Johnny in the facility where they are being kept. Reed would never do that especially to Sue or Ben! Victor Von Doom one of Marvels most feared and powerful villains looks like absolute crap! His character is absolutely horrible as well he's an emo punk who's a stalker for Sue. But the thing that really grinds about this movie is the one thing that they had in the Tim Story movies they completely ignored in this film, do you want to know what makes the Fantastic Four standout in the Marvel universe aside from their villains, forget their villains for a minute, the most important thing they forgot about the fantastic four is............. THEY ARE A FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SCREW THIS MOVIE,IT IS THE WORST COMIC BOOK MOVIE AND ADAPTION I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!!!!!",

            "content": "It is almost impossible to imagine that in 2015, as movie audiences experience the golden age of superhero movies that there can still be crap like this. Somehow, someway Fant4stic reaches into the depths of awful superhero movies, and takes the crown for being one of the worst superhero movies of all time. Lets start with the lack of story or even a simple plot. For starters, we really aren't even introduced to some resemblance of a plot until an hour into the movie, and even then the plot essentially boils down to Doom sucking a hole out of the earth to somehow build his own planet, which is completely bare. Considering that synopsis, I think it is almost safe to say that this movie doesn't even have a plot (or one that at least makes sense). OK so the movie doesn't have a \"genuine\" plot, that been the case with some other superhero movies. It should at least have some cool action scenes or provide some worthwhile visuals. Nope! I honestly can only recall maybe five minutes of some actual \"action\"' and even that was happening, it was absolute crap. There were multiple opportunities throughout the film to showcase their powers, especially in the scene with Reed Richards and Ben Grimm, but instead, all we are left with is crappy one-liners. Even in the last 10 minutes when we get the big battle, it ends up being a boring, uneventful, clich\u00e9, and yes crappy letdown. So we've got no story, no action, no villain (I won't even waste my time with Dr. Dumb), how about some witty dialogue or a couple of humorous scenes. Wrong again. In its attempt to be the Dark Knight of FOX superhero movies, Fant4stic is stripped of all the humor and campiness that at least made the earlier Fantastic Four movies watchable. Instead, we get a dark and surprisingly depressing film that doesn't evoke any sense of emotion from the viewer except for boredom. The jokes are laughable (except there not) and just about all the interaction between characters feels forced and inauthentic. OK. So by now you get the idea. Fant4stic is an absolute crap-shoot of a movie. A movie void of a plot, action, and OK dialogue doesn't even deserve to be called by its name, hence the Fant4stic's. It makes the earlier Fantastic Four movies look like The Avengers, and in the end, serves as an embarrassment to anyone associated with the film. And if you were wondering, yes, it is even worse than Batman & Robin. :0",

Seemingly not giving a damn about the source material, it was refreshing to see those kind of balls especially from Marvel. While I welcome Michael B. Jordan as The Human Torch, I wish I could say the same thing about the rest of the film. Fantastic Four is merely a reboot that loses its steam after the first act. Coming in at just over an hour and a half, the film is a rushed piece of reject summer movie drab. The characters are paper thin and about 10 years too young for their respective roles. The visual effects are far from stunning, especially The Thing, whose transformation into the ghastly beast is something closer to a PS2 game than an actual film with a $100 million price tag. Miles Teller proves here that his performance in Whiplash is truly a fluke. As Mr. Fantastic, he struggles to sound like he knows what he is talking about. Perhaps a little more rehearsal time and a little less focus on that cheap looking silver streak in his hair could have benefited him. Kate Mara as Susan Storm is about as idiotic as it can get. Mara is a great actress, there's no other way about it but Kate Mara as Susan Storm is terrible and borderline embarrassing. The biggest shock here in this film is where all the controversy started...Michael B. Jordan as The Human Torch. Jordan's ability to be a badass likable gear head is insanely good. He's the best part of this film by far. If there is anyone that could single handedly carry this film on their back, it is him. The film overall is too dark for Fantastic Four and too shallow for Marvel which leaves it drifting somewhere between ridiculous and not necessary...and at times, both. If there's any movie to see this summer, I can assure you, Fantastic Four is NOT it.",

            "content": "I wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie at all. I was a huge skeptic when the first trailer came out thinking it would be another FF movie chock full of cheesy one-liners and cartoony humor. In that respect, I was way off. Josh Trank's Fantastic Four is grounded in relative realism, showing what would likely happen if people did in fact crack inter-dimensional travel and brought back superpowers. It has a darker tone than the other movies and is a wildly different experience because of it. The characters are more relatable, their situations are more believable, and for a good part of the movie, it actually feels like you're watching the true Fantastic Four origin story unfold.I can't blame Trank for the discrepancies I have with the movie because he is not at fault. Apparently the producers demanded reshoots which rear their ugly head about 20 minutes from the end. It turns from this relatively dark, stylish superhero drama to an overblown one-liner infested CGI-fest. Mind you, I was still pulling for the heroes the entire time, but the moments following, preceding and including the final confrontation are so forcefully rushed and haphazardly put together it completely disconnects you from what the first hour of the movie set-up. The climax is generic and lackluster, and the believable shaky chemistry the characters shared in the beginning of the movie becomes incredibly forced and awkward. The shift is so drastic it's as if they Frankenstein'd two separate movies together, making for one extremely disjointed watching experience.Miles Teller and the rest of the cast have the benefit of being immensely likable. They worked well together and had palpable chemistry for a good chunk of the movie. Even Doom was fine. Once I got past the fact that it wasn't the comic book's adaptation of \"Doctor Doom\" and took him at face value as a sci-fi villain, I thought he worked wonders and actually posed a genuine threat to humanity. The CGI as a whole is great - a few moments will leave you scratching your head as in \"was that really necessary?\" but for the most part, the alternate dimension looks fantastic and the few fight scenes there are (literally only two or three) are executed well.Again, these are simply hints of what the movie could've been. It's obvious Trank had a vision with this world, and it's a damn shame that we won't be able to see it in full effect. What we're left with is a promising set-up and a complete mess of a third act with potential bleeding out right up until the final frames. Fantastic Four is more realistic and immersive than the other two adaptations, but unfortunately not as fun as either. What we're left with is an exercise in \"what could have been\" and another superhero movie with promising aspects that simply did not click.",

            "content": "'Fantastic Four' has always been a fun comic book. Ever since the early 60s, these four heroes have entertained us in each crime fighting, earth saving, and alien destroying issue. With Reed Richards, Johnny and Sue Storm, and Ben Grimm, there was nothing that these four couldn't handle. One of my favorite story arcs was from the mid-2000's where Ultimate Fantastic Four had to deal with zombies. It was an excellent storyline, one that I wish will be told on the big screen at some point. Speaking of the big screen, the Fantastic Four have never seen a good adaptation.There was a movie in 1994 made by Roger Corman (king of the B-Movies), which was never released. It was only made to secure rights for a friend, and is stuff of pure cinema legend and sought out by cult film fanatics. If you've seen any YouTube clips of it, you know it's terrible. Let's fast forward to 2005, where the guy who made the 'Barbershop' movies was given the opportunity to make a 'Fantastic Four' movie. If you can recall it, you'd remember it was awful and that Jessica Alba was really the only memorable thing from the movies, or at least the most talked about. 'Fantastic Four' is one of those Marvel properties that has yet to be turned over to Marvel itself, and is still owned by 20th Century Fox, which is unfortunate, because that studio still has no clue what it's doing with this franchise.That brings us up to date with 2015's 'Fantastic Four', which is a movie where nothing happens for 100 minutes. The studio hired Josh Trank to direct the film. Trank's only other credit was the \"found footage\" superhero film 'Chronicle' which had its good moments, but supposedly Trank is very difficult to work with, which is why he was booted off the upcoming 'Star Wars' film. Whatever good 'Chronicle' had going for it is non-existent here with 'Fantastic Four' and seems like it's one long set up for something yet to come. Over 95% of the film takes place inside a science lab where we see Reed Richards (Miles Teller) , Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) building a teleportation device and typing fast on a computer rather than using any powers or participating in an action sequence of any kind.Then there is Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell), who of course is Dr. Doom and is evil for really no real reason. Maybe he's angry because his name is Victor Von Doom. It's never really explained. For a movie that is really 100 minute of an origin story that is supposed to run deep with character development, we really learned nothing about any of the characters at all other than that Sue loves to listen to her iPod, Reed can type fast on a computer, Johnny likes to race 90's rice rockets, and that Grimm may or may not enjoy his new rock body. That is literally the character's story arcs. Sure they come together and travel thru their teleportation device to another dimension after one of the monkeys from 'Dawn of the Plant of the Apes' does, but that's about it. It's not until the final 45 seconds of the film where we see some fraction of a team forming.I get that this is the start of something new and a big origin set up for future films, but there has to be something at stake here and some sort of conflict. Unfortunately, there isn't, other than at the end of the movie, there is a small crater in a rural area.The only good moment of the film was seeing Dr. Doom show his sadistic and violent powers, but it was over way too quick and was met with some bad directing. Then there is a the issue of the script, which is just terrible. I've seen better dialogue the 'Sharknado' films than I did here with 'Fantastic Four'. Most of the movie is just someone shouting what's happening on screen and what they should do to fix it. It was cringe worthy, complete with Ben Grimm yelling his actions as he's executing it in full on Thing mode. This is a shame too, because there are some very talented actors here who aren't given anything good to work with. My advice is to wait a few more years until Fox gives up the rights to Marvel so that we get a real origin story to this great superhero team.AVOID THIS MOVIE!",

            "content": "Fantastic Four (or as many call it Fant4stic) is a comic book movie starring Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell, Directed by Josh Trank, was produced by Twenty-First Century Fox, and has the run-time of 100mins (1hr40mins).This is the 4th movie (and 3rd theatrical one) in the Fantastic Four Franchise. Now despite the hate i actually liked the last 2 movies in the franchise (Fantastic Four 2005 and Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer, please don't kill me). Now this Movie has been out for almost a year now but has still been getting much hate. To prove my point I would just like to say the movie has a 9% on Rotten Tomatoes which is tied for the worst rated superhero movie of all time. Let me just say I am NOT a professional critic, I just go to movies to have a good time(as shown with my liking of the old Fantastic Four movies) not necessarily to look for major flaws. However this movie makes that goal rather insufferable. Anyways here it is. A lot of people give a pass to the acting simply because these actors have done good work in other movies. Personally I find this to be a terrible excuse. All of these actors such as Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller just seem like they have no soul throughout the entire movie. It's almost as if the whole time these actors had been forced into making this movie. Also the chemistry between them is just awful.Now let's talk about the pacing. Simply put it I have no idea what they were thinking. Why would you make a Fantastic Four movie and have them do absolutely nothing the whole time except for that horrendous fight at the end. Now let me just say Superhero movies without much action can be done well (Batman, X-Men: First Class, etc.) but if your going to do that you have to having interesting conversations and a good origin story which this movie does not have in any way.Speaking of origin stories, am I the only one who almost hated the first half as much as the second half. I mean I know a lot of people who say that the first half is pretty good and all I have to say is how. It's just a drawn out, overly dark useless story that EVERYBODY knows.Then there's the tone, which let my question why did they think that make a dark and gritty reboot of Fantastic Four would be a good idea. Again let me just say, a darker story of a previously existing light heart movie isn't necessarily bad. But it has to have more reason then some executive saying \"Hey The Dark Knight was popular let's make this just like that.\"Then there's the part I was most regretting talking (or writing) about the Action and Effects. Let's get out of the way that Dr.Doom and CGI Miles Teller Face is awful. What I wanted to talk about was the action sequences (or just the 1 action sequence). To be honest it's the most clich\u00e9, predictable fight ever. Basically what happens is that Dr.Doom makes this ray thing that shoots into earth from the planet he's in and The Fantastic Four have to stop him. So they go into the other planet and try to fight off Dr.Doom separately and fail so they decide to team up and defeat him. What I hate about this fight (aside from it's predictable nature) is that the whole scene is shot in extreme darkness plus it's all out of frame so you can barely tell what's going on.Last, I would like to quickly mention the forgettable score, the incredible amount of plot holes such as Dr.Storm going to a science fair for some reason, Dr.Doom magically making a cape, and Dr.Doom looking at people and killing them but not doing that for the Fantastic Four. Also just to say it is incredibly obvious Fox wanted to make some sort of MCU with this movie and set up an entire expanded universe around this movie when it cannot hold it's own weight as a good movie to do something like that.ConclusionNow as you could probably tell I do not like this movie, it has awful pacing, terrible effects,a rehashed story,and laughably bad action. While many have pointed out that Fox took over the project and made it a generic superhero movie. I agree with that but I still don't think the part that wasn't taken over was even passable. It was just Josh Trank redoing the exact same plot as the 2005 version but slower. But the worst part is that the whole movie is just a set up for more Fantastic Four movies with a set up scene every 5mins. This movie has been called by many the worst superhero movie ever and I will personally agree with that. At least Batman and Robin had an overly joking theme and never took itself seriously unlike Fant4stic which thinks it is going to be the Next Iron Man which could never happen because Iron Man actually made a good movie before setting things up. Overall i think the movie has too many problems to count such as bad pacing, no structure, and awful effects to even be close to recommending.Rating1/10Unwatchable",

            "content": "WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS!! As a lifelong fan of Super Heroes and comic books, I have always loved movie adaptations. I love the good ones, and even with the bad to mediocre at best ones, I have always found something in each of those movies that I liked, that made it worth watching. NOT THIS TIME: I admit, I am more of a DC fan and I follow characters like Batman, Superman, Aquaman, Justice League, etc, over Marvel, but what limited things I do like in the Marvel universe, I have always loved the Fantastic Four. I had the Mego figures and the Power Records book and record as a kid, I enjoyed reading some of the comics back then and I loved the animated series from 1968 by Hanna Barbera and even the 1978 series with HERBIE the Robot. And I personally loved the Fantastic Four movies with Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans. I love both the 2005 and 2007 movies. They may not be the greatest, but at least they stayed close to the source material. When I went and saw the new reboot last weekend, my reaction was the same as Cameron's loud scream in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. It was a complete abomination!! If you're going to make a movie based off a popular iconic franchise, do it right!! Stay close to the source material and don't get too far away from it. I believe in the old country saying, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!\" And that's exactly what 21st Century Fox did in their unsuccessful attempt to keep the franchise. The best thing they could have done was turn it back over to Marvel. They would have done it right. While I understand that some of these changes have taken place in the Marvel Ultimates Universe, I bet they haven't been around for too long. I say stick with what most people know. Here are what I hated the most:1: A Naked Thing: Really?! Come on!!! There are kids watching! Would it have hurt to give the Thing pants?! Even if it wasn't the shorts from the comics, at least Michael Chiklis's Ben Grimm had nice pants and he was the same tough Ben as opposed to this little guy. They really Joel Schumachered this movie really badly!! 2: Reed Richards age and characterization: Too young to be believable. Plus, there's no way I could have seen any relationship form between him and Sue. Plus, I did not like him being portrayed as a yellow bellied coward. He's supposed to be the leader of this team. I just can't see Reed being younger than Johnny or close to his age.3: Johnny Storm: Period! If you want to change the race of a popular established character, be careful who you select. I would have been more accepting if the Thing, Ben Grimm had been African American. But Johnny Storm? I just couldn't see it!! And Sue being adopted? This was just too much to take it. 4: The villain: We've already seen Doctor Doom. I would have preferred another villain like Prince Namor the SubMariner (and spin him off into his own movie) or the Mole Man or the Skrulls. Doom was an arrogant punk instead of royalty.5: New Story: Not Retooled Origin. I absolutely HATED this new origin. Nuff said.All in all, this new Fantastic Four reboot is something I didn't even recognize. It's like watching the Cathy Lee Crosby TV movie of Wonder Woman, which also unrecognizable. The disappointment here is that I was hoping for a reboot with new actors cast according to the traditional source material. To see the FF that we knew from the first two movies with new actors carrying on the stories with new threats and menaces. This movie was so awful, that the director, Josh Trank and the producers and studio blamed each other. Since Chris Evans (who I liked as the Human Torch) has gone on to win the hearts of many as Captain America, I was hoping for a new blonde haired blue eyed Torch. Then again, I also wanted to see the blue costumes with the 4 emblems. Not that garbage they wore in this movie.There's no cameo by Stan Lee and there are no extra scenes during or after the credits, so you're better off leaving when the credits roll. In conclusion, this is one Super Hero movie that is a complete failure and a total waste of money. If you're a traditional fan of the FF, YOU WILL NOT RECOGNIZE IT!! I dreaded this movie before I saw it and I walked away totally disgusted!! A complete two thumbs down!!!",

            "content": "\"Fantastic Four\" (2015) is a dismal, abysmal, painfully-lame action movie based on the legendary comic book of the same name. What goes right in this picture? Almost nothing.Our lead actor Miles Teller (Reed Richards) has the face of a turtle without its shell. And he wears glasses. This does not stop director Josh Trank from doing endless closeups of Miles' chubby, geeky, inexpressive face.The entire pace of the film is off, with far too much time being spent on the origins of the Fantastic Four gaining their super-powers. By the time the characters actually go to fight crime there's twenty minutes left in the film, and the finale is a humiliating rush of action clich\u00e9s so predictable that even the children in my theater had lost interest and were talking in their seats.The entire second act of the story- in which the Four test out Reed's inter-dimensional transporter- is triggered by the team getting drunk one night and deciding that traveling to another dimension would be \"really cool.\" Reed even calls his best friend & basically says, \"Dude! You gotta get over here! This is freaking' awesome!\" No explanation is given for the other dimension, for HOW the four gain their powers from traveling there, how the team gets back to their home dimension or how they magically arrive back on Earth at the end of the film. This is sloppy writing that slaps you in the face and laughs at the fact that you paid for your ticket.A sub-plot about Reed escaping from the military facility at which the Four are being held goes nowhere, accomplishes nothing, and fails to further the story or characters in any way.The cast shares ZERO chemistry, the \"jokes\" fall instantly flat, and the final scene of the film- where Reed suggests the group come up with a cool name for themselves- is awkward and sad:THING: This place is fantastic.REED: Wait a minute- say that again...Yup. That's it, folks. That's how they got the name Fantastic Four. My face was red for everyone involved in making this hot manure sandwich. Bad music, dull actors, blank faces, dialogue by Mrs. Johnson's second-grade class, zero conflict, cheesy visuals, and no story.Is that enough or are you actually still thinking about watching this movie?GRADE: D-",

Promising young director Josh Trank was handed the keys to this superhero franchise after his blistering debut Chronicle, yet it appears he's not ready for big budgets as he makes a complete and utter meal of it. Stories of on-set quibbles and Trank's uncooperative behaviour have surfaced recently, and the final, woeful result certainly reeks of a movie struggling to be made. There's not a single, solitary redeeming feature to be found; everything from the shocking CGI to the disinterested cast to the appallingly dull origin story is yawn inducing at best. It's difficult to tell what is worse: Trank's uninspired screenplay and his subsequent incompetent direction, or the fact that 20th Century Fox, who interjected months ago, are willing to release a pile of crap just to stick to their date slot. Either way, this remake is going to be a huge blow to both the up-and-coming filmmaker (who has also since lost his gig of helming a Star Wars Anthologies instalment) and the major studio company who clearly can't be trusted to do the F4 brand justice. At least their previous efforts in this series were more kid-friendly than most films in the burgeoning superhero genre, something this remake also fails at thanks to a single sequence with a surprising amount of blood. There really is nothing to recommend in this worthless attempt at movie-making; heck, even the saving-the-world climax feels about as threatening as a kitten attacking a ball of wool. Do yourself a favour and skip this atrocity, unless of course you're just interested to see how dire the worst film of 2015 really is.",

The origin there was tweaked from the original in the comic books (but at least it was in space.....) Putting that aside - why reboot so soon? Plenty of films carry on the narrative and re-cast. I know that FF4 The Silver Surfer didn't go down too well (especially with the character of Galactus) but this film takes it to new lows.I read that the director produced a very different film which the studio demanded major re-shoots to. Maybe we will never see a director's cut but this studio cut is boring. Dull. Tedious. Unimaginative. But let's not lay all the blame at the studio's door.Script? Awful. Slow. Lacking in action. Lacking in character development. Lacking in generation of sympathy for any of the characters.Casting? It may have been a creative decision to make the lead characters almost children (though, as has been pointed out elsewhere, their screen ages and the ages of some of the actual cast are miles apart) but that decision gives them no gravitas. And Johnny Storm isn't black. Except in this film. Very strange. I am all for more black characters in Marvel films - great to see War Machine and The Falcon given more screen time - and more to come in the next Avengers film, along with The Black Panther. Can I put in a word for Black Goliath as well? But I still fail to understand why a white character in the comics becomes black in the films... first Nick Fury and now The Human Torch. Actually I felt most of the film was miscast.The Thing - they did him with CGI and so he doesn't look real - like the Hulk. You can so tell it's CGI.Someone said to me: well that's 1 1/2 hours of your life you'll never get back - and he was so right.

That's maybe what Fox thinks in pushing this new adaptation, given how franchises keep being rebooted and resurrected these days, assuming either lighter or darker takes, to pull away themselves from the shadows of their previous (most often, forgettable) forms. The latter is more evident with this film, as Director Josh Trank, puts a darker spin to it, employing a grittier feel to its plot. While that is true and recognizable, there's no denying of its desperate efforts to emulate its Marvel predecessors. Unfortunately, though, neither, succeeds. If it's any a consolation, Trank has assembled a group of actors that are all naturally charming, you would find anything messed-up they're in, tolerable.The spotlight is cast upon young genius, Reed Richards, at the beginning of the film, working on an experiment that attempts to construct a teleportation device. It was hardly a success as the object they've sent to who-knows-where, never returned. Seven years later, now teenage Reed (Miles Teller) is again trying his luck on the same experiment. The attempt yields a better result but is still dismissed as a magic trick by his high school teacher, but not by Dr. Franklin Storm, who at that moment, is drawn with utter interest to Richard's experiments. The meeting brings Richard's feet to Baxter Institute where he is joined by Storm's daughter, Sue (Kate Mara), his son, Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), and Viktor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell), to work in completing a larger and more advanced version of Richard's device. The success of their effort prompts their team to send all of them four to their target alternate universe, but the consequence is far worse than they could imagine.It's easy to dismiss Trank's Fantastic Four as an unfortunate victim of superhero fatigue that emerges in the wake of the continuous influx of superhero movies inundating the big screen, but you can't shrug off its fatal narrative flaws that include unfocused pace and bland character developments. The latter may have been completely covered by the actors playing the two-dimensional characters, but expositional defects keep sending them to becoming something the audience might find hard to care about. Perhaps its the ill-contrived rationales behind how all the often-sense-deprived proceedings work, that keeps the film constructing a form, worth-of- attention, or the forced CGI-gimmicks that strip the sense off the moment's supposedly strong sentiments, that hampers its spectators' ability to absorb its message, and thus, feel that the dangers these characters are about to face, is real. Either way, it's difficult to care, much less find reasons why we still should.If it's any consolation, the final battle of this film,sparks hope. But who knows who else is up with eagerness to see it when the rest of the film strikes more than enough to make the audience not wait for any longer. 5/10",

I mean I just didn't think it was hard to outdo the previous Fantastic Four movies. I am now glad that he got kicked out of directing, the new Star wars movie. Seriously though, not all faults should be placed on Josh Trank for this movie being as bad as it is. Fox got greedy, made budget cuts and didn't allow the director to have full control on this project. Which means, it was a last minute decision that really rushed this project. I mean just by watching the Comic Con interview for this movie, you could tell this movie is really bad. By the actors and the director not being enthusiastic or all that happy about the project they have worked on. In fact they all had this look after a horrific disaster. And just didn't seem to want to take credit for anything. I first thought the movie \"Ant-Man\" would be a dud and this would actually be the good one. But it turned out to be the opposite. For a young and up and coming director to tackle a big budget superhero movie, there was a lot of pressure on him. And when there is a lot of pressure but things are going nowhere the way you want things to go, it can make a man crack. And I think that is what ended up happening during the making of this movie. Still for a movie that has the budget of 120 million dollars. I thought it would at least be a watchable popcorn flick, but it wasn't even that. This movie was almost torture to sit through. Now I heard and read a lot of negative reviews when it comes to this movie. But I just didn't want to jump the bandwagon and hate this movie. So I kept looking for anything redeeming about this movie. But after 40 minutes in, all hope was lost. And the movie just kept on getting worse and worse. It's a superheroes movie, but there is like two small action sequences and it's all so forgettable and boring to watch. I mean the movie is just meshed with exposition after exposition which seemed to go nowhere. The first hour of this movie seemed like a really boring sci-fi movie involving scientist working on something, which involves space, planets and teleportation. But nothing is explained, and it's just generic as it gets when it comes to that matter. I mean why not just watch a movie that is actually focused on space travel and such like \"Interstellar\"? Instead of this movie that just doesn't focus on the superheroes elements. The characters has little to no comradery, they were so cardboard like with zero personality. The pacing and editing when it comes to transition was poorly done. I really don't want to rip this movie apart, but it's just that bad. This movie is a waste of time. Just pass on this on, although most audiences that know a bit about the Marvel universe is going to watch it out of curiosity like I did.2/10",

This is quite easily the worst superhero film since Batman and Robin, if not, actually WORSE! I'm not joking here, I'm not kidding, I'm not getting paid to say this, I'm not copying what the critics said either; I genuinely hated this movie because it was a movie that wasn't meant to happen, and doesn't care that it's a lifeless production that will be sold in supermarkets for under $10, which you can donate to a hospital or charity than kill your own sense of boredom in this hateful steaming turd.Fantastic Four is a B-Grade movie rebooted for todays audience, except it takes itself too f*cking seriously and has NO plot development or character development. It's like Josh Trank had no confidence in the film when he told the cast NOT to read the comic books. That's like an actor trying to play Hamlet except you DON'T study the character or the play. What's the bloody point if you don't do that?This is 'The Last Airbender' of 2015, the 'Dragonball Evolution' of superhero movies, the 'Howard the Duck' of horrible sci-fi. If anything, the critics who gave this thing 'zero stars' praised the damn film more than anything else. IT'S WORSE THAN WHAT THEY SAID!This is a film that should have died in the first place, and I'm sorry for Trank that he got the receiving end of the criticism. It's not his fault; it's 20th Century Fox's fault. They're a once great studio that turned to trash fairly recently, and only their 'Fox Searchlight Productions' seem to be of any consistent high-quality lately.I feel I should rap this up soon, because there's too much to say about this movie without getting into spoilers, but I was shocked by how generic this was for such a $120 million movie. It's like Foodfight level of investment money that just didn't payoff in the end; it just adds to how bad the film already was.Fant4stic is a failure of storytelling, a misfire of film direction, an appalling example of big- budget effects, and no acting bonding during the film, apart from MAYBE Johnny Storm's father in the film.

They must learn to harness their new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy.This is a well-crafted film. Rating it a 1, as a third of all voters have so far, suggests you saw nothing of value in it, and, to me, is merely an emotionally charged overreaction. Don't get me wrong. This has weaknesses. It's *all* origin. You barely get to see the trailer-promised flight, fire-ball throwing, clobberin'(don't get me started on the explanation given in this for that catchphrase...), elasticity, invisibility or forcefield creation and manipulation. Even less of them using it for anything other than getting better at them. And heroics? Less than I thought possible. The climactic fight is when they do turn on someone other than each other, and it's over faster than you can compare it to that of an Iron Man flick. As far as comic adaptations go, this is also, by far, in a *long* time, the slowest, least funny and heaviest - one joke about how frequent speeches in this are doesn't change the fact that, yeah, there are a ton, the promotional material wasn't overselling that.Casting, acting and characterization are great. They look, sound and, most importantly, help define, their written and drawn counterparts. Well, Doom's face is boring \u2013 why ditch the mask? Don't even pretend it ain't awesome. Still, The Thing(Bell, capturing the inherent tragedy) genuinely looks like someone covered the poor guy in glue and broke large rocks over his entire body. The claimed inspiration of The Fly and Scanners is easily seen here: it's emotionally devastating to see the 4 with their bodies broken, as they unconsciously attempt to heal, only to further hurt and harm themselves. Granted, this would be more effective if they had started out less quiet, reserved and, as this whole thing is, gloomy, so they had further to go in that direction once they get these disabilities.There is some PG-13 violence and a little strong language in this. I recommend this to the bigger fans of the source material and format. 7/10",

            "content": "The early 1960s was a pivotal time for Marvel Comics and \"The Fantastic Four\" was a big part of that. In 1961, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby both created an image, a personality and a system of collaborative comic development (the \"Marvel Method\") which became standard for Marvel. These big changes came about as Lee and Kirby developed \"The Fantastic Four\" (although which of these men deserves more of the credit for FF is still in dispute over 50 years later). Invented in response to the popularity of the \"Justice League of America\" superhero team at DC Comics (at the time called National Periodical Publications), \"Fantastic Four\" developed with unusual characteristics for a superhero team. This group of three men and one woman were ordinary people who each simultaneously gained their own extraordinary powers due to radiation exposure. Unlike other superheroes (including the Justice League), Fantastic Four don't have hideouts or secret identities and were a team from the beginning, but a team made up of flawed individuals who argue, hold grudges and have trouble working together. In all this, they're like a family, which makes them more relatable and likely contributes to the popularity of their series of adventures.\"Fantastic Four\" (PG-13, 1:40) is a reboot following the perceived disappointing performance of the 2005 and 2007 films about the superhero team. (I guess $619 million in worldwide grosses doesn't buy what it used to.) As a reboot, this version has a completely new cast (so long, Jessica Alba and company) and, of course serves as another origin story. It IS original, but it really isn't much of a story.The central character and eventual de facto leader of the Fantastic Four is Reed Richards (Miles Teller). As a child, he invented a teleportation machine in his parents' garage with the help of his best friend, Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell). The device works, but Reed and Ben aren't sure where it sends the objects that they're able to make disappear (and firing the thing up also blacks out an entire city block). Later, as high school seniors, they demonstrate the latest version of the machine at a science fair. They've learned to bring objects back (with the only casualty being a basketball backboard), but the guys still don't know where these objects go. Nevertheless, their invention attracts the attention of Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his adopted daughter, Susan (Kate Mara). Doctor Storm invites Reed to work with him and Susan at the Baxter Foundation, where they're working on a larger version of Reed's machine. They're all soon joined by Storm's brilliant, but selfish and aloof prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell), and Storm's rebellious son, Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), all working for Dr. Harvey Allen (Tim Blake Nelson). Storm convinces Dr. Allen and the rest of the Baxter team that this group of \"kids\" (as he calls them) are the ones to finally make their machine (the \"Quantum Gate\") work\u0085 and make everyone lots of money.Of course, this group does make the machine work. They successfully send a chimpanzee to what turns out to be a parallel dimension and they bring him back safe and sound. Since this new-found\u0085 place looks on their cameras like some other planet (and they're all hoping to find new sources of energy there), Allen wants to call in NASA to take over the project. The guys get drunk and decide that they deserve to be the first humans to try out the machine. Reed calls in his long-time partner, Ben, to join him, Johnny and Victor on their brief but incredible voyage. While tentatively exploring this newly-discovered dimension, they do find a new source of energy, but it promptly begins exploding out of the ground and comes after them. One of them falls into the glowing green goop and the others barely make it back, with the help of Sue, whom they left in the rear with the gear. This ill-advised mission ends with all of them, including Sue, overdosing on radiation and each developing different superhero-like powers. Now they have to learn to harness abilities like stretching the human body to freaky new dimensions, becoming invisible and creating powerful energy shields, transforming into a human torch and becoming a super-strong hulking pile of rocks. Naturally, their ultimate goal is to figure out how to reverse these mutations, but the Baxter Foundation has other ideas, as does a powerful evil force that this gang of four unwittingly unleashes on our beloved three-dimensional earth.\"Fantastic Four\"\u0085 isn't. Although the movie puts much of the Fantastic Four folklore on display and does so with creative aplomb, the end result is kind of a mess. The script is practically non-sensical when it comes to the setting (a parallel dimension that looks like earth from billions of years ago?) to the reasoning for exploration (just assuming that this new dimension will yield new energy sources??) to Dr. Stone's assurances (with all the brilliant scientific minds on the planet, all he needs for his project are a bunch of overachieving teens and 20-somethings???)! Besides all that (and more \u2013 I could go on\u0085 and on), this movie features probably the least-charismatic, least-believable cast ever assembled for a superhero movie and puts them through their paces in about the least-inspiring way imaginable. Not only is \"Fantastic Four\", Version 2015, decidedly un-fantastic, it's barely passable as entertainment. \"C-\"",

            "content": "Let me preface this to everyone first, I don't consider myself a big superhero-fanatic but I still enjoy many superhero movies we've had for the past years. Most of them are worth- watching but I strictly avoid those that are considered awful and I could agree with most of them who didn't like the bad ones. I have deliberately tried to avoid this movie after hearing so many bad things about it, but I decided to give it a shot anyway and find out if it truly was a bad movie or not.And after being able to see it, I can honestly tell everyone that this is truly a bad movie and my biggest question is what on Earth happened? The first minutes really got me interested and after 10-15 minutes it rapidly went downhill. It's very hard for me to tell what were the things that made this movie so bad in the first place. But I think I'm going to start by saying that this movie felt like it had absolutely no idea what everything in this movie were going through. The story is uninteresting, the whole teleportation thing became uninterested as well too. The acting was stiff and dull, none of the characters were remotely interesting either without any chemistry at all and had very little development to deliver.The custom designs were horrible too, they looked pretty simplistic to me and why on earth didn't they even give the Thing any pants? I've seen him wear pants countless times and even a clothe that covered his torso before, but this movie is a slap in the face for presenting him as a nudist and I don't like the idea at all.But one of the biggest disappointments of the movie would be the main antagonist Dr. Doom. His villainous appearance was way too rushed, it felt like the writers of the movie thought that everyone knows who he is and let's not waste more time explaining what he does. Come on, not everyone in the world knows who he is, if a certain character becomes evil you gotta at least find a new and interesting way presenting him instead of ignoring his appearance. I honestly think that even the Dr. Doom from those two previous Fantastic Four had a much more interesting appearance even though I loathe those movies.The final battle was incredibly ridiculous and if not laughable. It reminded me of a certain flaw from Man of Steel were one of our heroes seemed to get destroyed once and for all but managed for almost no reason to get out so darn easily and kick the villains butt quickly. It's rather something I would expect from a comical cartoon and not a live-action superhero movie.I'm very sorry I didn't like it at all, it's no wonder that almost everyone disliked it. Not even Matthew Vaughn who gave us Kick-Ass and X-Men First Class could save this drivel. And if that's not enough to tell how bad it is then I would say this is as bad and on par with Iron Man 3, the two The Amazing Spider-Man movies for some of the most boring and disappointed superhero movies ever made. It literally left me with a bad taste and I'm still dissatisfied with it. If you love superhero movies you won't like this one or if you love action movies then don't waste your time it will only bore you. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie and watch a good X-Men film or MCU movie instead, even the animated movie Big Hero 6 (which is also a Marvel movie) was a hundred million times better than this.Well at least it won't exist in the X-Men universe, although I was pretty eager to see an extended universe with both these superheroes meeting each other but after seeing this movie and reading its trivia then I changed my mind and can at least be calm. But hopefully we won't get a sequel, I can already imagine the sequel being bad too.1/10",

But even so I still had this small glimmer of hope that it would be good. I went to see it. I was right. It was horrible. I think this is the last you'll see of the Fantastic Four in at least 20 years. The cinematography was amateurish throughout. This movie looked like a college project movie in the 90s that was an exercise in practicing new CGI elements. But don't think that I'm saying the CGI was good. It wasn't. Everything looked just awkward and bland. The Thing was entirely CGI in a bad way. I'm all for giving new actors chances to shine. But every single one of these actors and actresses not only bored me and the audience of the packed theater I was in, but truth be told, they all looked like forgettable faces. It was awkward throughout. The script seemed mixed up. The characters had no chemistry with each other and no appeal for the viewers. Also, the horrible casting of the 'token black guy' as the Human Torch was a huge step in the wrong direction. The actor playing him was just boring and his attempts at trying to seem like a tough guy made me roll my eyes. Again, the visuals were just ehhhh. I took my phone out halfway through the movie and began surfing the internet, something I absolutely loath to see people do during movies and have never done myself, until this movie. But I saw that at least 10 other people were doing similar things out of boredom from the movie. At least 20 people, including families with young kids walked out of the movie. I could have walked out but the fact that I paid to see the movie made me stay. It was the feeling of being in detention back in grade school. Its such a shame since the Fantastic Four is one of the more beloved comic book super heroes yet they've found it impossible to make a good movie adaptation of them. Maybe one day. This is one of the few movies were I agree 100% with the critics. This movie is bad. I'm just warning you. Its not good. At all. Go see Ant Man or Mission Impossible 5 instead.",

            "review_title": "What's so bad about this?",
            "content": "I was prepared to hate this movie. Everything about it screamed disaster. As a Marvel fan, I was annoyed that the story sounded unfaithful to the source material. I was skeptical of the cast looking not much like the classic characters I knew. I wasn't too impressed by the trailers (which, oddly enough, use a lot of footage not seen in the movie). Critics unanimously trashed the movie, so I assumed they can't all be wrong. Most alarmingly of all, even the director, Josh Trank, publicly complained about his own movie on its own opening day, absolutely confirming that this movie must be an absolute train-wreck. Even though I already knew it had to be horrible, out of curiosity, I had to see for myself just how bad it really was.So I went to see it today. The opening sequence, when the characters were kids, wasn't so bad. So I thought maybe it probably gets worse when they grow up. As it went along, I kept expecting it to go completely downhill at some point. Maybe it goes sour when they get their powers. But it still wasn't bad. Maybe when the villain unleashes his evil powers, that's when it all falls apart. But no, Dr. Doom was actually kinda awesome. By the time of the big action scene at the end, I had to admit to myself I was really enjoying this. Dare I say it, this is actually a good movie! I have no reason to be biased about this. After all, walking into the theater, I fully expected a terrible movie.So why does everyone seem to hate it? I have a few guesses: 1) For one thing, it's not faithful to the source material. This is not the Fantastic Four we've been familiar with up until now. The characters don't look like or act like previous incarnations. They're not the fun family of superheroes we all know. But this movie doesn't try to be faithful, it does its own thing and that's not necessarily a bad thing.2) It's not as action-packed as the typical superhero movie these days. It's a fairly slow-paced movie. I guess this would disappoint you if you expected more fights and explosions throughout the whole thing. But this did not bother me, because I found the slow build-up of the story and gradually increasing intensity of the movie to be engrossing enough to keep me interested.3) Fanboys and their attitude of expressing loyalty to one thing by unleashing rage at its competitors. Currently the general consensus among fanboys seems to be that Marvel/Disney \"rulez,\" while Fox, Sony, and even DC/Warner Bros \"sux;\" so all the review scores tend to be skewed in Marvel/Disney's favor. How else can you explain the high review scores of those lame Iron Man sequels? Fantastic Four (2015), being a Fox property, unfortunately makes it an easy target for the Internet fanboy legions.4) If there's a flaw that matters to me though, it's that, admittedly, some of the character relationships could have been better. The Fantastic Four are supposed to all have interesting dynamics with each other, but some of the relationships just weren't developed. For instance, I'm not so sure if Jamie Bell and Kate Mara even interacted with each other once throughout the whole movie. Also, we all know the characters Reed & Sue are supposed to be each others' romantic interests, but this was only barely touched upon in this movie. I guess these relationships were something to be explored in a sequel, one that doesn't look like it's gonna happen, considering this one's underwhelming performance and reception unfortunately.\"Easter egg\" alert: The Human Torch has a Fire Flower from the Super Mario Bros hanging from his car's rear-view mirror. That was actually a pretty clever reference to throw in there for video game fans. Good job, Trank, or whoever thought of tossing that in there.Concluding thoughts: I should know better by now than to trust the hive-mind of movie critics. Believe it or not, sometimes the hive-mind is wrong. Even if all the critics are haters, see it for yourself and make your own decision. I for one was pleasantly surprised by this movie and maybe you will be too.",

The casting for Reed and Sue was just not quite right. There was zero chemistry between any of them. None at all.What little action there was was laughably bad. For a superhero film to contain such little action is unforgivable.The plot is also so bland and boring. Even if an additional 20 minutes were added on it wouldn't have saved the awful script, as the problems were too deep seated in the entire approach to this movie.It seems like there were a lot of clashes between director and studio, and director and stars in this film, and it truly shows.

            "content": "Fantastic Four follows four people as they attempt to travel to other dimensions and ultimately gain superpowers from doing so. They then decide that they want to find a way to reverse this, but major authority threatens otherwise. I knew this movie sucked. I went into it knowing it sucked. But I thought it'd be mediocre. Just mediocre. I've sat through mediocre movies before and it's not so bad usually, but this movie makes them look like bloody masterpieces. There were a couple of scenes that I liked, but every time they passed I thought 'wow, that was a decent 2 seconds'. Everything good about this movie was short-lived. I did like the tone of the movie though, it was darker than most Marvel movies. Fantastic Four doesn't even know what it's plot is, so I can't really say anything about that. It kind of skips around, like one moment this is the main plot, then it skips through a few years and a new plot is introduced very suddenly with half a resolution to the last one, and then another short plot. It's one of those movies where you can't really explain the plot without spoiling most of it. There's nothing wrong with this structure, but this movie had no idea what it was about, and it shows. So much of this movie feels like it just flies by due to how short all the conflicts are. Thankfully, that means that it felt like it was over pretty quickly. Everything terrible about this movie is in everything else. The dialogue seems like it was written by someone who's never spoken to another human being, or strongly dislikes doing so and thinks that everyone else does too. All of it is extremely short-lived and awkward, and oftentimes comes out equally as awkward. Some of the one-liners towards the end were so poorly executed I had to stop and process that it just happened before continuing with the movie. The rest of the dialogue is just so poorly written that it makes it hard to give a crap about any of the characters. And let's touch on the characters, wow, they were terrible. They have about one character trait each, and the writers didn't even try to make them go deeper. I saw absolutely no attempt to make anyone actually give a crap about these people. On top of that the acting really isn't anything special. Don't get me wrong, I like some of these actors, but I'm not so sure now. Kate Mara was cute at least.The special effects in this movie really weren't very good either. Maybe it's because I just saw the Jungle Book, but holy cow, they were not up to the standard at all. There was one particular scene where the Thing head butts another character, and I wanted to laugh, it looked atrocious. But I didn't laugh, mostly because I was already crying. Throughout the movie I thought 'Oh, this is just going to be a very mediocre movie' which is exactly what I expected, but then the climax started, and that was scary. Not scary good, scary for humanity. I was scared for humanity after that climax. It was as if the writers were writing the script and suddenly they realized that the climax was coming up, so they quickly tried to remember which villain they had partially introduced before and just slapped him in there. The villain just kind of appeared and started killing people. It wasn't even entertaining, it just sort of happened. It was so incredibly rushed. And the villain's objective, oh boy, that was great. Also, I'm sarcastic. His main goal is so underdeveloped and stupid. Again, it just kind of happens out of the blue. The villain is pretty much all powerful at this point, he can kill people without even trying, and yet when pitted against the Fantastic Four themselves it's like he doesn't want to kill them? Or he loses his powers all of a sudden? Then he gets some weird new powers that are never explained, and nothing makes sense. We get a clich\u00e9d garbage fight scene, some horrible one- liners and just horrible dialogue in general (again), and then the fight continues and ends in the stupidest and most rushed way possible. Everything about the climax was absolutely horrendous, and it destroyed any hope left for this movie. As I sat in my chair, legitimately crying at how bad it was, the falling action and resolution starts, and it's awful. And to top it all off, it hints at a sequel. That I'll probably watch. Oh boy.Overall mere words cannot describe how bad Fantastic Four is. I could talk about this movie for hours and just list and elaborate on every little thing that I hated. This review only scratches the surface. I would never, ever watch this movie again, not even at gun point. I already was when I watched this movie the first time. I pointed a gun at my head, whispering 'Don't you do it, movie, don't you-you just did it, why...'. It took so much of my energy to watch this movie. It was legitimately difficult to watch, and not in a good way. This movie has set the standard for bad film-making, and I think that I'll have to go back and change some of my lower ratings just because of this. My hope for Marvel was renewed with Ant-Man, but once again crushed by this movie (I'm not a huge fan of Marvel unlike many people seem to be). In the end I'm sure you know whether or not I'd recommend this monstrosity, but in case its still unclear, that's a no.",

Comic book films are supposed to make you feel inspired, but not this one. So what is wrong with it? One word \u2013 chemistry. In any superhero team/ensemble there should be great character interactions and a feeling that these guys can effectively make a team, never mind a ''fantastic'' team. The best team movies all have characters playing off each other as in the Avengers and X-Men. \u00a0However, there is zero chemistry between any of the F4. We see an attempt at some early romance between Reed and Sue which doesn't go anywhere. Johnny Storm is billed as a genius but troubled kid however we never see why he has a high IQ, he is just shifted in to make up the numbers. We never see him form any sustainable bond with any of the others. Ben Grimm also appears as an outsider, brought in with little sense to the project to fill the final slot. The chemistry between the original F4 (2005) was MUCH better whereas here they feel like 4 individuals. \u00a0The climatic battle takes place in the most boring environment that you can imagine. It is over within 10 minutes, with not much ingenuity to overcome a half decent attempt at Dr Doom, who at first seems very intimidating. This film will be quickly forgotten and the question isn't whether a sequel will be made or whether it will cross over with X-Men, but is the original Fantastic 4 film a better watch than this depressing, dull comic book movie.

Marvel had no control over what FOX did with their source material.For those not aware, this film was plagued by problems from the start.

No, but damn, this was a nothing movie. And that's too bad. The first part, the \"origin,\" or character introduction scenes, if you are willing, had promise. In fact, all the way through the first 20-30 minutes I was wondering what all the negative buzz was about. It wasn't great, had some incredibly miscast characters and dumb coincidences, but it was acceptable.But then minute 31 (or so) happened and I literally couldn't believe my eyes. I had no clue to what this movie was doing. It shifted into a movie somewhere lost in this movie. Almost like this was the very first draft, written on a cocktail napkin and never once edited or improved on from that idea. I saw something here, but it needed more substance, heart, a longer running time and most of all\u0085action, or them just being \"Fantastic.\"Instead of anything that would make a superhero or comic book adaptation seem justified, they settled for skipping an entire year of \"could've been cool scenes\" and barely showed anything \"super\" in the background. It would be like Martha Kent telling Lois Lane all about the Smallville fight and us just seeing a blurred 5-second news clip from her 19\" B&W TV across the room in Man of Steel.Worse, they never let you get involved in the characters, threw in clich\u00e9d tension, scenes missing without our knowledge, but then talked about as if we should have known what happened and had one of the laziest and least thought out climaxes (or conflicts) in superhero movie history. Hell, in any action movie. In any movie. Don't even get me started on the hilarious Dr. Doom'ed.What I was left with was a giant question mark above my head on how did this get made? Most likely this was made for the studio to keep the rights, like they did with the terrible The Amazing Spider-Man, but how did they see the end product and say: Yes, this is quality. Yes, this makes sense. Yes, people will see this 10 times each and make more than The Avengers. I was never a fan of the original two movies and only saw them one time apiece when they originally came out. Thinking back, now after seeing this sad mess of a poor effort, I actually am rethinking my opinion on those. Corny, sure, but at least they had action. At least they showed the team repeatedly working together to save humanity. At least there was the basic follow-through with superhero origin stories. At least I cared to see ANY ONE OF THEM live until the end.Again, this movie started off not-too-bad, but then turned all Hancock and just blew my mind\u0085in the wrong direction.",

Jordan- Fruitvale Station, Red Tails, he is also playing Apollo Creed's son in the upcoming movie Creed; Jamie Bell-Man On a Ledge, Jumper and Toby Kebbell- The Counselor, War Horse.This is a reboot of the Fantastic Four franchise from 2005 that is Not your father's Fantastic Four. It is based loosely on the 2004 Ultimate FF comic book series, but it even veers from there, too. It is directed by Josh Trank, who directed Chronicle, and he changed the Johnny Storm character to being portrayed by a black actor, in order to better show how families in real life have changed; he is of mixed heritage himself. The explanation for Sue being white is that she is adopted. The way they receive their powers is a little different, too. Here, they travel to an alternate universe and the alien energies are what are responsible for giving them their super powers. Miles plays Reed Richards, Kate is Susan Storm, Michael is Johnny Storm and Jamie is Ben Grimm. Toby plays Victor Von Doom, who starts out as a co-worker but becomes their mortal enemy, Doctor Doom, before you know it. The movie starts with the childhood accomplishments in teleportation that Miles has achieved, which catches the eye of a big scientific corporation that snatches him up. At his new job, he develops his theories and that is how they wind up exploring the alternate universe. Doctor Doom has energy powers, too. Like I said, lots of changes. I can see how comic book purists might not care for this new version but FYI, they have already green lit a sequel for 2017, so someone has faith in it. There is not a scene after the end credits and Stan Lee does not make his usual cameo appearance. It's rated \"PG-13\" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.

A lot of time is spent on silly science-y stuff, while the characters remain ill-defined beyond typical movie relationship shorthand: the loyalty between brother, sister and father; the love triangle between two scientists for the girl; and the childhood friendship from two broken homes. Then, there's the exploitation of the youngsters, from being sold on an education as they, instead, work in a laboratory for a profit-seeking institution, to basically being enslaved by the military. The movie does nothing to resolve the incongruity of its team planting the American flag on another planet while they bemoan the military industrial complex on their own Earth. Instead, we get an origins story that's blatantly formulaic in the studio's pursuit to make a (as we now know, failed) franchise out of it.The big problem isn't that the movie is ridiculously vague about what is dooming the Earth or how imminent it is in the movie, nor that Dr. Doom sets out to build a world that is even grimmer than that of the movie's Earth. No, it's that the world the makers of the movie set out to build is as hollow and exploitative as the institutions within the movie that the youngsters butt their heads against.

Not great, but certainly serviceable. It least it got Chris Evans, of Captain America fame, started with the superhero thing.Whereas this movie just... exists. Sure, the special effects have improved - even though I actually like the originals better because at least they had a distinct style and had some colour in them - but it doesn't really matter if the story has no soul.

            "content": "Spoilers below...So I didn't hate it as much as some critics seemed too. But, I do think the script could have been better. For instance, it's kind of ridiculous that Victor was allowed back on the program after setting fire to one of Franklin's labs. Also, its pretty ridiculous how Johnny becomes part of the program as well. We don't really know much of his backstory (besides that he likes to street race). Like is there any reason the government would allow Johnny in on the project just solely based off his dad's word that \"he can build anything\"? Are there no other scientists that could help? Also, the last 30 min or so is pretty messy in general. Reed has been on the run for a year and once he's been back for all of 20 minutes, he magically seems to fix the issue of re-opening the gate. It's just a bit too convenient. Also, while I liked the battle taking place on another planet (more fresher than Earth), the battle itself was a little lame. I felt like Victor got defeated a little too easily. And I also didn't like that we didn't get to see much of them as a team. Hell, I don't think we ever see Sue and Ben have a conversation. Also, while the special effects are better than the 2005 version, they still look fake. Reed's stretching powers and even Sue's forcefield ball that they float in. Also there was no Stan Lee cameo and you just don't F around with Stan Lee cameos.I did like the darker tone. I liked that it wasn't as cheesy as the 2005 version. Like, it didn't need Johnny making a billion jokes about how hot he was. Or anything like that. I also thought it was more believable when they get these powers that the military locks them away and uses them for their purposes. I feel like thats what would actually happen in real life. I thought the whole sequence where Victor walks down the corridor and melts people's brains was pretty bad-ass. And I also really liked that they put scars on young Reed to match Miles Teller. I liked little details like that. So it certainly wasn't the worst thing in the world, and I did enjoy it more than the 2005 version, but it could have been improved on.",

They had a movie, but then they realized it would be 3.5 hours long, so instead of doing the logical thing and cutting some of the exposition, they cut out the entire middle of the movie and added more exposition to compensate. Moreover, this movie is dumb because it reinforces the general consensus that the Fantastic Four are lame characters. We've only ever seen a silly, campy Fantastic Four, and this movie gives us the polar opposite of the 2005 movie. It takes itself way too seriously, and it was clearly only made so that Fox could keep the rights away from Marvel. On the other hand, this movie is a godsend for other terrible or mediocre superhero movies. Now when anyone says that Dark Phoenix and Daredevil (2003) were bad, someone else can say, \"At least they weren't as bad as FANT4STIC.\"",

            "content": "It's uncanny to see cinematic legend unfolding on screen - a film to be talked about in hushed tones for decades to come. August 2015 has yielded such a film. Ladies, gentlemen, and puddles of sentient ooze, behold: the legendary disaster of Josh Trank's Fantastic Four. Miserable set stories, drab trailers and re-shoots aside, it's still shocking how bad the final film is. While Tim Story's mid-2000s predecessors were cringeworthy in their own regard, their bubblegum-bright flair for fun made them hard to outright detest \u2013 a quality Trank appears determined to eradicate from his reboot at all costs. Indeed, Trank hammers the \"dark 'n gritty\" angle so fiercely that between the unimaginatively muddy visuals (Earth and the craggy alternate-dimension-or-is-it-an-alien- planet-the-film-never-quite-makes-up-its-mind are so universally dank the film may as well have been called '50 Shades of Brown') and venomous script, the only 'fantastic' thing is how all-around unpleasant a viewing experience the film is. Dark superhero reboots may be in vogue, but don't be surprised to see a Rennaissance of candy-colours and one-liners in future super-fare, if only to bury the memory of this dull sulkfest. Most comparably abysmal sci-fi flops are at least hammy enough to enjoyably mock their nonsensical plotting, hokey dialogue, stilted performances, and terrible visual effects. Fantastic Four has all of these detriments in spades, but, practically frothing at the mouth with the bitter 'Trank vs. Fox' spat, is too sour to even gleefully lambast. The film is so unapologetically lazy, with brazen continuity errors, scathingly brief and sparse action sequences, and childish temporal leaps to cover up patches never filmed, that it reeks of self-loathing, almost fiercely proud of how disastrous it is. It gets to the point where the audience starts desperately trying to spoon-feed worthwhile moments to the film out of secondhand embarrassment (\"that 15 second fight scene was kind of cool!\" \"Reed Richards disguising himself by stretching his face is clever!\" \"That Borat joke was almost funny...\") before giving up and succumbing to the unrelenting cascade of awfulness. Beginning with an insultingly distasteful prologue exploiting domestic abuse (Trank is so determined to squash fun that even the ever-lovin'-blue-eyed Thing's iconic catchphrase gets sullied), and starring Homer Simpson (no really) as cinema's most discouraging science teacher, the film flashes forward to the serious teen scientists working on their serious science experiment seriously. After an excruciating montage of the universally dislikeable characters welding, trading inane pseudo-science babble, and gritting their teeth and grimacing in a facsimile of \"bonding\", a despicably forced drunken (really\u0085?) foray to the alternate-dimension-planet-whatever has the team (sans Sue, because only men have adventures, apparently) mutated by green alien glop (really\u0085) in a boring Interstellar rip-off. There seems to be no hope. However, at this point, the film momentarily twitches, like a convulsing, electrified dead frog, and briefly shakes off its monotonous woe. The visual effects introducing the titular quartet first experiencing their powers are effective - Richards' grotesque elasticity is particularly believable - briefly delivering the body horror the film seemed desperate to become. GOOD LORD A POSITIVE OH THANK YOU. Naturally, for this indulgence, Trank subjects audiences to a further half hour of clich\u00e9d droning about how serious the serious quartet's serious accident was (seriously!), unoriginally lambasting the mean ol' exploitative military as if spitefully stalling. Rubbing salt in the wound, Trank showcases some decently exciting Thing action sequences, but sadistically restricts them to extreme long-shot blips seen through television screens. Finally: a pre-climax re-introducing the forgotten Victor Domashev-wait-Von-Doom-sorry-who-said-that. Here, in spite of hilariously rocky plotting and characterization, Trank momentarily invests, with an astoundingly gory telekinetic massacre that momentarily flirts with a promising climax to come. Nope.Instead, the film reaches a new low, with a climactic tussle on Doom's planet-dimension-who-cares almost as difficult to see amidst the feces-filter as it is uninspired (each character gives and takes a punch, as if choreographed by a preschooler). If this wasn't enough, the entire affair wraps up in a staggeringly quick 12 minutes, vomiting a final coda so chirpy and upbeat it's disturbingly at odds with the dour mess preceding it. We conclude with arguably the most forced, awkward title drop in cinematic history. Nice. The woefully miscast performers all somehow manage make the dire script even more banal. Unsurprisingly, despite being the most (needlessly) controversially cast, Michael B. Jordan is the only actor to generate anything of worth, with a cocky charisma that feels vintage Johnny Storm. Sadly, even he sputters under the indefatigable weight of the dross surrounding him. Miles Teller is so unimaginably flat as Reed Richards that it would be hilarious if his preening smugness weren't so loathsome instead. Kate Mara fares no better, her Sue Storm so pinched and bitter that the alien green glob is more engaging to watch. The most disturbingly miscast, Jamie Bell may as well have signed on as the Invisible Woman he is given so little screen time. Even when coated in horrifically bad CGI, Bell's perennially moping (and, distressingly, naked, rock-genitalia included) Ben Grimm spends more time sitting sadly in cells than clobberin'. The film's low point (impressive indeed\u0085) is Toby Kebbell, who embarrassingly transforms one of the most iconically menacing comic book antagonists into a squeaking, whiny, walking temper tantrum. Meanwhile, Tim Blake Nelson snores through his scenes as the requisite exploitative bureaucrat (so much for him playing Mole Man...), while Reg E. Cathy drones the same banal line about discovery and possibility repeatedly as if sleep-talking. The real Trainwreck of 2015 (sorry Amy Schumer), and almost irrefutable champion of \"worst, most unreservedly self-loathing big-budget studio film ever made\", Josh Trank's reluctant blockbuster is indisputably unforgettable\u0085albeit for all the wrong reasons. As Ben Grimm would dolefully sigh: \"It's Fantastic\". -1/10",

The events/pace in the movie didn't work. It was rushed when it should have explored and slow when it should have been fast. Genius was common place. Anything that needed to be accomplished was just sorted in a few giggly moments between the actors.

            "content": "There have been several memorable blockbusters this summer. I cant say it's as good as 2015 should have been, but I still loved quite a few films. Whether it was the nerdy spectacle of Age of Ultron, the action masterpiece that was Mad Max: Fury Road, the nostalgic Jurassic World, the fresh and unique Ant-Man, or the high octane thrill ride that was Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation, this summer had some great moments. Sadly, Fantastic Four is by far the most disappointing film to come out this year. I really thought that after the garbage first two films Fox may have had a handle on how to make a film based on these beloved characters, but I was wrong. I don't know yet if I think this is a worse film than the previous two, but it deserves a lower score for failing to separate themselves from those films. It's really a shame, even after all the behind the scenes reported issues with this film, (which I will choose to ignore in this review) I had high hopes for this one. The trailers sold me. I love this cast and I really liked Chronicle, Josh Tranks first film. Plus, the sci-fi/horror approach was far better than the campy first two. Boy was I way off on my expectations.The film is worse than reported. There are only a few redeemable qualities to the film. But I think the worst part about this film is just how slow and boring it is. I understand the different approach, but when you have a marketing push that stressed how fun and action packed the film was, you become really disappointed with how poorly this film is put together. There is one action scene and it's the end of the film. Even that was a huge letdown and actually rather quick. The film is only 100 minutes long, which has to be a low for superhero films. I'm trying not to succumb to rumors, but you have to wonder what went wrong considering this film feels so jumbled and convoluted that it seems like an 8th grader could have put it together. Not to mention how noticeably bad some of the CGI was. Especially the other dimension scene. It honestly looked like a Disney channel TV show decided to use green screen for an episode and looks entirely different than the show has ever looked. But going back to the marketing, the trailers show much more than what is actually in the film so I wonder how many deleted scenes there are.But I cant deny that I did like some of the film. Even though the way they decide to travel themselves to the other dimension is incredibly silly, I loved the aftermath and the horrific feeling and ominous tone set during those scenes. Ben and Reed really stood out to me here. The Fantastic Four really are normal people who accidentally get powers and have to deal with the damage both internally and externally that they can do. That's one of the reasons I was excited to see the movie, the trailers pushed the horror elements. And while they are here, they feel like they are from a totally different film. It's only a few times that this tone is present throughout the film, the other times it's a goofy semi-action flick. I really cant blame the actors. They do the best they can with the direction and writing they were given. The writing is wretched by the way. 3 or 4 times I got goosebumps because of how cringe worthy some of the dialogue was, and that's saying something considering how bad the first two were.Overall I was inexplicably disappointing with this film. It's a messy action film that is at times a comedy but wants to add horror or even an end of the world type of film. Which is another thing they didn't really explain, the end of the world. The whole film they are stressing that the research of the characters is necessary to save the world but I never heard exactly why it needed saving? There is really nothing memorable about this film. And the only redeemable part about the film is how cool the brief horror scenes were. Doom looks terrible, just one last thought.+Brief horror elements -CGI was bad, really bad -Weak script -Tone shifts too much -Nothing exciting happens, not even the final \"fight\"-Jumbled plot 3.7/10",

And as sexist as this sounds, Sue should be hotter. I almost liked Johnny. Effects - some of the early flying scenes of Torch were reminiscent of the unreleased (but in some ways better) Roger Corman version that can be found on youtube. Reed and Ben construct a teleporter of some kind, but they have no idea where it goes? They've never taken soil samples, sent a digital camera or cell phone to try and see? They are possibly stupider than the last incarnation of the FF, who only caused millions of dollars of damage and endangered a few dozen human lives on a bridge on their first outing. These morons thought it would be a good idea to take a drunken excursion to another dimension, which ends up nearly destroying the planet. Also, could someone tell me how they maintained radio and video contact with the other dimension once objects were sent? There were no open portals through which signals could travel.

            "content": "'FANTASTIC FOUR': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Twentieth Century Fox's reboot to their superhero franchise; which began in 2005 (and had one previous sequel in 2007). It's based on Marvel Comic's first superhero team, of the same name, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby (their first comic as well); and tells the story of four young scientists who are transformed into gifted superheroes, by teleporting to another dimension. It was directed by Josh Trank (the man behind the 2012 indie sci-fi hit 'CHRONICLE') and written by Trank, Jeremy Slater and Simon Kinberg. The film stars Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan (who also costarred in 'CHRONICLE'), Kate Mara, Jamie Bell, Toby Kebbell and Reg E. Cathey. It's received nothing but negative reviews, from critics and fans alike, due to studio tampering; which greatly altered Trank's true vision. I really enjoyed the first two-thirds of the movie, and I'd really like to see a director's cut someday (which Trank insists exists). Since they met as children, best friends Reed Richards (Teller) and Ben Grimm (Bell) have been working on a special teleportation device. While showing it off, unsuccessfully at a science fair, they impress a local professor, Franklin Storm (Cathey); who's been working on the same thing. Storm invites Reed and Ben to join his research team; which includes his daughter Susan (Mara), his son Johnny (Jordan) and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Victor von Doom (Kebbell). The young scientists succeed at their experiment, and then make a dangerous attempt to teleport themselves, to another universe. Once there, they gain special powers; and each must decide whether to use them for good, or for bad.The movie begins as a fascinating character study, filled with good performances (from Teller, Jordan and the rest). It's involving, although somewhat slow paced, and pretty entertaining, all the way up till the third act. Then the film morphs into a completely different movie, and ends with CGI filled nonsense (with characters behaving in ways nothing like the film leading up to it). Fox was unhappy with Trank's first cut (a more original, and creative, character driven superhero flick), so they hijacked the movie; demanding reshoots and totally ruining the conclusion of the film. I really like what Trank was trying to do with the genre, before that though, and look forward to seeing more from him in the future. I also hope the upcoming sequel doesn't have so much big business pollution. It's at least not as big of a disappointment as Marvel Studio's 'ANT-MAN' (considering what that could have been, with Edgar Wright at the helm)!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaTQgKVh7fQ",

I figured the \"die-hard\" fans were simply rallying against it and I'm not a Fantastic Four buff (always been a DC comics guy) but I do enjoy a great Superhero movie. Fox has made clear this is a \"re-imagining\" of the Fantastic Four and that's putting it lightly. The majority of the film is an origin story and the rest of it is a mess. The hour and a half run time which is brutally short for a Superhero flick spends SO much time opening the story and the entire film could have been told in 15 minutes so that you could get down to the brass tacks and actually have a big action flick. The film wasn't the worst I've ever seen by any means. It was watchable but it was also a mess. The cast was completely misplaced, the story is incredibly weak, the pacing is awful and it simply isn't Fantastic Four at all. I personally think Fantastic Four is simply one of those superheroes that is very hard to translate to live action. They are campy and silly and fit better in the comics world. However, I agree with what many are saying that this film made the 2005 version look much, much better. At the very least the casting for the 2005 version was significantly better.Miles Teller is very talented and he is becoming a front runner for hot commodities in Hollywood especially after his head turning performance in Whiplash last year. Teller is better than this film. Reed should not be this young and the character is not developed at all so Teller has nothing to work with. I think he's trying his best but the direction of the character does nothing so he, and the rest of the main cast, seem out of place and almost bored. Michael B. Jordan caught a lot of flack simply because he was going to play an African American Johnny Storm. I don't care about his colour but exactly like Teller he is given nothing to work with. At least they gave Chris Evans a sense of humour in the 2005 version. I will say the same thing about Kata Mara and Jamie Bell...no development, seem bored, and way too broody. All four of them are depressed and look depressing and have no chemistry together at all. Jamie Bell's Thing who is usually the highlight of the Fantastic Four (Michael Chiklis was the best thing to come out of the 2005 version no pun intended) is boring and grunts and groans with zero personality. Mara just looks angry all the time but then they all do. I honestly don't blame the cast one bit. I have seen them all in good roles. I think the direction and script was terrible. Toby Kebbell plays Victor Von Doom and although I think he should have been much older and a well known actor, he actually does an okay job compared to the rest of the cast. I actually enjoyed his look (although the fact that his mouth didn't move seemed cheesy) and he could have been a decent villain if not for the bad story and how long it took to get to him in general. Reg Cathey and Tim Blake Nelson are the rest of the main supporting cast and they're decent in their respective roles.Everyone knows now the viral tweet from director Josh Trank about how his vision a year ago was much better. I honestly find that hard to believe. Even if the studio requested changes, there isn't even really much potential to this particular rendition/story. Its too far removed from the original Fantastic Four concept and the characters are downright bland as we discussed. The pacing is terrible and the best parts of the film are the final battle which lasts ten minutes while the build up is 1 hour and 20 minutes. The run time is ludicrous for a film of this type and he would have to add an awful lot to make this worthwhile in my opinion. Now all that bashing being said...I didn't hate it. It was okay at best. I remember sort of breezing through another iteration of this film in the 90's that was made just to keep the rights and thinking it looked dumb but passable and that's what this is too. I don't really care who holds the rights, I don't think this can be done properly in live action. This one is completely forgettable and you can watch the 2005 version and have more fun at least. 6/10",

I wasn't overly impressed with the younger cast but thought maybe they would take a different aspect on the film.

I couldn't be more wrong. -There was limited character back-story on the Fan 4 -There was no middle just a five minute climax at the end that was hardly gripping -The cringe-worthy quotes towards the end of the film were just punishing to watch -Dr. Doom looks like a Droid and goes completely insane over a minor issue and the movie doesn't quite explain why -Dr. Doom is also meant to be one of the most O.P characters in the comics but yet he seems to drop down to the levels of the Fan 4 in the final battle which previously you saw him destroy anything in his path previously. -Whats the go with Tim Nelson being in this movie seriously can they stop regurgitating actors from previously failed ' marvel ' movies and maybe have a fresh start for some characters, especially for someone with a mediocre role as he had -Not really a huge issue but very disappointingly no after credits scenes which are signature to marvel based moves ( even though it is owned by FOX ) The only reason I have given it a 3 is the visual effects, only for one character though. The Thing looked insane compared to the 2005 version, only problem was due to the short length of the movie he got limited time and whipped out some really punishing quotes towards the end of the movie. Also I did like Franklin Storm in this film, he was a breathe of fresh air...but again wasn't perfected pulling out some pretty cheesy lines.So overall it was a total dud, no background characterisation on the characters, if there was it was limited and to go along with the short running time, it was hard to watch.

Deeply deficient on the story level as well as the character level. Some of the problems:Sue isn't even on the team that goes exploring in the other dimension; she has been replaced by Victor Von Doom. She just gets hit by an energy backlash as the others return, and in this back-handed \"ad hoc\" way receives her powers. They could at least have addressed in a few lines of dialogue WHY Sue wasn't going to be one of the \"astronauts\". Instead it's just a boys' club.

He's not part of the team, but is only called in to participate in the experiment because he is Reed's old friend.Johnny is hardly in the movie for the first twenty minutes or so, and never gets much development of his own. Is he a mechanic? What can he do, besides weld? He doesn't get any real or memorable character moments. Neither do the others, for that matter.Reed reads like a one-trick-pony who has no other project than the dimension machine. What else do they do at the Baxter Building? Or at \"Central City\" at the end. Reed is supposed to be smart; supposed to be Mr. Fantastic - he is the core of the team, and any story involving him should be intelligent. This script very much isn't.There is little meaningful interaction, chemistry or bonding between the characters, and the very end of the story (when the military just gives them what they demand for no reason) doesn't make any sense. The movie as a whole is dark and humorless and almost as unlike the FF comic as it is possible to be.One of the greatest \"huh?!\" moments is when Sue helps the military find Reed. Sue is opposed to being a super-soldier for the military, but still she apparently accepts that they've turned both Ben and Johnny into super-soldiers, and uncritically helps the military find Reed - when in fact she should be angry about everything they've done. Bunch of nonsense. They're probably trying to show the team's early days, before they understand what's going on, but instead the screenwriters are exposing the characters as dupes who are easily manipulated. This script is a disaster.The main actors, in and of themselves, are not bad. But, for one thing, they are too old. Late twenties, early thirties, for characters who are largely supposed to be high schoolers. It's another thing that sadly doesn't work at all. Also, the way they behave towards each other: They act like moody teens, nonchalant, not looking at each other when they speak to each other, not relating anywhere near naturally to each other. This, frankly, is perhaps what I find most toe-cringing about the movie.In retrospect, this movie actually does look like a half-hearted effort to just put something out there, no matter what, without doing anything remotely artistic to it. I'm sorry to speak so negatively about a lot of people's presumably hard work, but this really turned into a bad movie. I don't know exactly who's to blame, but I hope they learn a lesson from this and won't repeat these mistakes again later.What a shame, and what a dud.3 stars out of 10.",

            "content": "Fantastic Four (2015) was an absolutely joyless experience that was just unpleasant to watch. In fact, unpleasant is the perfect word to sum up the movie. The characters act unpleasant, the visuals look unpleasant, and the story feels unpleasant. The CGI breaks the pattern by being jawdroppingly awful. It all looks fake and unconvincing, even in strange places where there doesn't need to be any CG. One scene jumps to mind involving a monkey; they could have used a real one and nothing would have changed, but instead they blew some of their CGI budget on an obviously fake creature that looked like it belonged in Planet of the Apes. In fact, it kind of looked like Caeser from Planet of the Apes. Maybe he really needed a paycheck before the next sequel.What baffles me about the whole production is how the studio followed the same beats and made the same mistakes as their 2005 film, yet somehow made it all worse. The team not actually fighting crime until the last third of the movie? Doom's out of nowhere attraction to Sue? Ben going from Reed's best friend to his mortal enemy in a fight? Check to all of them, but somehow with infinitely less heart and effort. The Storm family doesn't even feel like a family, they just talk to each other like acquaintances in a classroom. Say what you will about Jessica Alba as an actor, but her Sue Storm never sounded like she was sleep talking through her lines like this one does. It gets extremely baffling just how little the makers care as the movie goes on. Apart from Doctor Doom being turned into a total loser without the slightest bit of gravitas, he has a one-hit-kill power that he demolishes an entire building staff with and doesn't even think to whip it out during the final fight. And Ben Grimm being deployed by the government for covert ops? The man is a 200-ton orange rock giant. There is no universe where any of that qualifies as covert apart from this half-baked one I just watched.It's not even a so-bad-it's-good kind of movie, just a really draining experience that put a damper on the whole evening. It didn't even leave me with enough energy to muster any hate towards it. Simply put, nobody cared. The filmmakers didn't care. The actors didn't care. The effects team didn't care. The audience didn't care. As such, I didn't care.",

First Roger Corman tried making one but didn't bother releasing it and when we did finally see it, it was pretty darn awful. Then Fox had a go with the 2005 series and even though the two films we got were okay I wouldn't go out of my way to call them the best superhero flicks ever.Yet here we are with another attempt to bring the superhero family to the big screen and make no bones about it.... this film is absolute vomit.An unbearable amount of awfulness is what awaits you in this all singing, all dancing (certainly not any of those) 100 minute explosion which goes out of it's way to ruin everything you know and love about The Fantastic Four.All the characters are dull and uninteresting. You won't even care when our four main heroes get their powers because the script is that appallingly written, all you can do is kick back and laugh at every single word that comes out of the actor's mouths.Acting is almost non-existent, these characters don't even feel like humans. They feel more like dead walking zombies to me. Even everyone looks bored on the poster itself.The CG is absolutely atrocious, this film was released in 2015 yet these effects look more right at home on a PlayStation 2 or Xbox game. No even better, they look better on a Commodore Amiga.The film is incredibly rushed due to the 100 minute running time leaving little to no time for development for anyone. (Not that you'll want any because all these characters are as dull as someone's shiny forehead.) Even Doctor Doom looks so retarded and ugly you'll want to punch him right in the face. (You ain't got nowt on Julian McMahon)And to think that Marvel cancelled the comic book series for this...It's clear that Fox just doesn't know how to make a good FF film and just like Steven Seagal needs to stop making all those crap straight to DVD films we've seen 8 billion and fifty nine times before, Fox just needs to give up and give the FF back to Marvel where they'll be able to do justice.Or maybe the FF is unfilmable.I don't know, nevertheless avoid this disaster of a film at all costs otherwise you'll end up hating the Fantastic Four for the rest of your miserable life.",

            "content": "Fantastic Four is a terrible film, a $100 million dollar pi\u00f1ata, deserving of its critical and commercial mauling. It's so dire it could become a case study for the contemporary studio system's flaws. But feel for the film's director Josh Trank, whose only other feature was the mildly effective superhero film Chronicle, starring Michael B. Jordon. It cost $12 million dollars and earned over $100 million dollars\u2014a massive return, which would have contributed significantly to Fox's decision to hire Trank to adapt the Marvel comic and reboot the franchise after the two previously dismal films. At a conceptual stage, the negative press was already building. Racist comic book fans rallied against the casting of Jordon as one of the film's superheroes because the character in the comics is white. The Hollywood Reporter site also has insider comments about Trank being uncommunicative on the set, describing him with words like \"erratic\" and \"indecisive\". Furthermore, the film underwent reshoots, which is always troubling when this sort of money is involved. Most damagingly, Trank attacked the film and the studio on Twitter, arguing his version of the film that will never be seen. But is any of this rumour and innuendo relevant? Hollywood now hires inexperienced directors and throws big money at them because they believe they'll be obliging. But isn't granting a relatively novice filmmaker top dollars and not expecting trouble playing with fire? No other industry in the world throws money around as carelessly as Hollywood. On this occasion it's burnt a lot of people and potentially ended a career that's barely started.A better cut of the film wouldn't dispel what unconvincing tripe this is. The technology in this film is ridiculous and treated a bit like that Internet joke \"because science\"\u2014starting with a boy genius building a mini teleporter in his garage. As grownups, Reed (Miles Teller) and Ben (Jamie Bell) showcase an improved teleporter at a science fair. Reed is invited to join a research group in the city to help build a new teleporter. Half of this dreck is dedicated to building the machine before anyone receives their superpowers. Can the machine forward us an act or two? It's rare to criticise a superhero movie for not having enough action but given how underdeveloped, nondescript the characters are and how boring and lacking in tension the film is, any heat would have been a reprieve. The other characters include Professor Storm (Reg E. Cathey), who has a hilariously deep voice, his son Johnny (Jordon) who drag races so we know he's a rebellious, Storm's adopted daughter Sue (Kate Mara) who talks like a computer and has one look on her face and Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell), who leaves the blinds closed because he's dark and moody\u2014nothing sinister there\u2014and whose original theory has been completed by Reed. Once the real teleporter is constructed, the film becomes monumentally stupid. After a few drinks, Reed, Ben, Johnny and Victor decide the very night the teleporter is completed they'll test it themselves. Let that resonate with you for a moment. And if you were teleported to a mysterious alien plant\u2014while intoxicated no less\u2014 would you touch some mysterious green goo? An explosion leaves the kids with superpowers, except Von Doom who is left for dead on the planet.The way the film collapses from this point is both sad and unintentionally hilarious. The film's disjointed shape\u2014a result of those reshoots\u2014is painfully evident in the gaping plot holes, time lapses and incoherent story threads. For example, the film forwards a year to when the characters are under military supervision and only then does Johnny's father\u2014slow on the uptake\u2014tell his son he's worried what the military will do to him. Trying to make this film dark and serious in tone also falters horribly, not only because there's a talking rock monster but because von Doom makes for a laughable villain. This cut of the film tries hiding him as long as possible. In his short appearance, the bad von Doom stares at people until their faces explode\u2014except the heroes\u2014and he sneaks in clunkers like: \"there is no Victor anymore, only Doom!\" His showdown is appalling rushed, perhaps mercifully for the audience. However, it's meaningless to throw anymore fuel onto this disaster. It's an awful movie but it's important to remember that inexperienced directors like Josh Trank are made the scapegoats for big studios and corporations that gleefully overspend with the wrong people at the helm and then cast the first stone when the project fails. It just can't continue this way.",

            "content": "\"Fantastic Four\" is one of the biggest new superhero movies of 2015 and the characters and their abilities made me pretty curious about wanting to watch this one. The director is Josh Trank, still a fairly young filmmaker, but his work on \"Chronicle\" and \"The Kill Point\" was appreciated. Unfortunately, his effort here was not. \"Fantastic Four\" is generally considered a flop and a disappointment. I would not call it that, however. I quite enjoyed the first hour of the movie, the way the scientists received their super powers. Still I wish, they would not have jumped ahead a year in time when we see them stuck in the lab. They possibly could have elaborated convincingly on how the quartet actually learns to properly use their powers, but this was completely left out.There were other story flaws early on too, for example that there was no security to make sure nobody uses the machine or the 3 protagonists' (plus Victor) idea to go on the journey themselves. Nobody of them was properly trained for that. They were all scientists and only theoretically, in terms of knowledge, possibly ready for such a journey, but never physically. Also Jordan's character seemed like he had absolutely no connection or interest when it came to his father's work. It felt pretty random that he was part of the team suddenly. Needless to say the struggling father-son relationship was not elaborated on properly. I did not like the Victor Von Doom parts after his transformation. He was much more interesting before it. They probably thought it would be bad to make a movie without a real enemy, but if they include one they should have elaborated better on him (for example the Sue Storm connection). It was basically 15-20 minutes of special effects and fighting with little substance to it in terms of the whole story. This is quite a shame as Von Doom is somewhat considered the most memorable antagonist in the Fantastic Four universe. He was truly wasted here for the most part. Still I can forgive them for it as, even if this film has flaws, it was an enjoyable watch for the most part.Nonetheless, I felt that almost everybody in here had no chance to show us their talent in terms of range. They all gave great performances in previous films, but they don't have the material to come close to these. I am especially referring to Miles Teller in \"Whiplash\" here of course. It's definitely easier for him to play unlikeable characters and he is absolutely not supposed to be that here being actually the leader of the quartet. This is a fairly short film for superhero movie standards. 100 minutes really isn't that much, especially as 7 of these minutes are credits. I am generally not a big fan of Constantin Films and by general perception it seems as if they messed up as usual with this one. Still, I cannot say I agree with the very negative reviews. It's an okay superhero movie, decent watch if you like the genre like myself, but if not, then you probably better skip this one. Overall, I give it a thumbs-up and I will probably also watch a sequel if they decide to make one. And check out the older films what I've been planning to do for a while anyway as I quite like Alba, Chiklis and McMahon. I hope that one did a better job when it came to depicting the 4 as an epitome of teamwork.",

Then, nothing else happens. Well, virtually nothing anyway. Some stuff to do with them at a research facility and Dr Doom, who proves the Marvel Cinematic Universe don't have the monopoly on terrible villains. So, this looked pretty bad and had a turbulent production. But did it all work out OK in the end? Well, there are inept films and then there's this. How on earth was this released in this form? Did no-one realize how bad this movie is? It doesn't even feel like a movie. It just feels like various bits of different movies directed by different people who were each trying to tell a different story. The direction is terrible. The dialogue is excruciatingly awful. All of the talented actors give terrible performances except for Michael B. Jordan. The film is hopelessly dull, emotionally blank, incoherently plotted and overall less intellectually and viscerally engaging than a YouTube compilation of Slasher movie death scenes.

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that this is NOT a perfect film. It is very far from that, but to call it an awful film? I have to disagree. The major problem with the movie was that it takes WAY too long to build up the characters, and then when they finally get their powers, the movies rushes and then suddenly ends. But it's not like the first half isn't at least interesting. Director Josh Trank attempts to restore the Marvel comic in his second film after his successful debut of Chronicle.The story is a pretty good origin story that got way more devoted time then it should have. I did enjoy it for the most part, but it could have been cut down a little bit in favor of more action from the Fantastic Four. One thing I really enjoyed was that even though it was a Marvel movie, it had a dark feel to it. It tried to act like a DC movie instead of Marvel, which was a fresh surprise considering that all Marvel movies are starting to all feel like the same light humor action festival. The cast consists of big up-and-comers Miles Teller (playing Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic) and Michael B. Jordan (playing Johnny Storm/Human Torch), the somewhat established Kate Mara, (playing Sue Storm/Invisible Woman) and the relatively unknown Jamie Bell. (Playing Ben Grimm/The Thing). Miles Teller keeps the story together and I feel like he plays a very good Reed Richards but a cheesy Mr. Fantastic, but that is the script he had to work with for the second half. Michael B. Jordan is the most impressive, but he got the least amount of screen time out of the four. Toby Kebbell (playing Victor Von Doom/ Dr. Doom) is also decent but he disappears in the beginning and then comes back when they're is about 20 minutes left. I feel like Dr. Doom definitely should have been used more but you will remember his scenes. The special effects were impressive, and making The Thing created by CGI worked well. I just wish they gave him some pants, along with Doom. You can tell about 80% of the budget went towards the climax alone. Speaking of the climax, it was kind of fun to watch but it was so rushed, and left me wanting more. Overall, it did have a decent amount of flaws, but I enjoyed it overall. The origin story was pretty interesting, the acting was good enough for the cheesy script they had to work with, and the action scenes were fun for what they were. It was far from The Dark Knight, but it is nowhere near Batman & Robin.7/10",

            "content": "First of all, let me tell you that I was very dubious when I read the IMDb reviews. And 3.9 for \"Fantastic four\" by Josh Trank, what the hack??? I'm not a huge fan of \"Chronicles\", but I (positively) admit that director Josh Trank and screenwriter Max Landis were sometimes able to transcend some overexploited \"super-hero-standards\". The flight sequences (if properly seen in a theater, of course) are breathtaking and the youngsters are remarkably well portrayed with all their strength and weaknesses. Kids. With superpowers. But still kids. And what else is Trank's new film about, so tell me? Or should I rather ask if what we have here is really such a bad adaptation of The Fantastic Four created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby? I didn't go with any particular expectations, but as a former fan of the Marvel comics, I must admit that everything I saw on screen this afternoon is, in my personal opinion, a brilliant comics-adaptation by Josh Trank. Yes, what we have here is another story about kids with superpowers. But still kids who need to learn to control these amazingly powerful skills within a very short lapse of time. Or these skills may be a threat for the whole planet. Just imagine for a sec what they are experiencing... So, c'mon guys, what is going on here? \"Chronicle\" is a hit for most people and \"Fantastic Four\" a stinker? Josh Trank just did it again, this time on a much larger scale. And as you can read it everywhere, it wasn't a piece of cake to make the film: it's not the director's approved version you saw... Can you imagine it? Or have you forgotten who is behind the making of this movie? Then have a closer look: The director gives you a clue each time you see the character of Tim Blake Nelson on screen... Under these production conditions, as a real Marvel \"Secret Wars\" lover(and do you remember what happened to Victor Van Doom out there, on the Beyonder's planet?), I admit having been ultimately well surprised by this dark, respectful, fine written and directed (even if not perfect) super-hero adventure, with a little something more... All the actors and SFX are in my point of view brilliant. Lovers of the Dark Knight Trilogy and Christopher Nolan's more realistic Gotham world may be delightfully astonished. Just give the damn movie a chance. At least, Josh Trank and Matthew Vaughn deserve it, with or without Stan Lee's special appearance!",

            "content": "This latest reboot of the long time marvel comic about 4 scientists who get unusual powers when an experiment goes wrong has had quite a bumpy time in production according to the media. Many rumours of mandated re-shoots, squabbling in the editing room and director Josh Trank (Chronicle) seemingly getting let go from directing a stand alone Star Wars films on the heels of this potential disaster. Then the reviews started coming in and they have been savage with people even claiming it to be the worst super hero film since Batman & Robin... which is untrue. So I went in with low expectations, which served me well.The film starts strong with a backstory of two of the fantastic ones from when they were children and the whole thing is endearing and shows the charm that JJ Abrams was trying to get but failed to do so with Super 8. The film then skips forward a few years and starts setting up the origins of this team of super heroes. This all works quite well and even though this first half of the film has no action it all works quite well. At this stage one would wonder what all the hullabaloo is about with all these negative reviews. The Second half however is where it starts to fall apart with some poorly put together albeit brief action scenes and a really poor design of the villain. This last point is made worse by the fact that even though they did not use the comic book origin for him at all, they did find a pretty cool way to explain his famous look.. in theory, but in reality it looks terrible, they totally botched it. The finale goes out with a whimper and it is all over rather suddenly. One surprise from the second half was that in what felt like a pretty family friendly film that we did get one pretty bloody and nasty section.I am not sure exactly what happened behind the scenes but we have a really good cast who all put in good work and most of the film is crafted well enough. The film is going for more of a scientific angle rather than adventure or action and those are its strongest points but it is let down by everything else. The film had glimmers of potential and I would not be adverse to seeing what they could do with a sequel now that the set up has been done in this film that was basically all set up. It is certainly better than the reviews are saying and much better than the previous Fantastic Four films but the film itself is certainly not fantastic. 5.5/10 P.S I should mention it has a fantastic score, adds a lot to the proceedings.",

            "content": "Being a fan of superhero flicks based on the ever-popular Marvel comics, I went into this with fairly average, if not high expectations. These movies have always ended up being some of the biggest and most entertaining films during the summers, often leading to major box office numbers. Unfortunately, this is not the case with this disastrous reboot of the Fantastic Four franchise which has suffered an unfair amount of abuse in the last ten years, beginning with Tim Story's outing in 2005 and later its sequel two years later; both of which failed to commit justice to the Fantastic Four league. This reboot directed by Josh Trank, who made the surprisingly entertaining hit 'Chronicle' not flounders to improve upon the previous outings, it does worse. This film follows Reed Richards (played by Miles Teller), Sue Storm (played by Kate Mara), her rebellious step-brother Johnny Storm (played by Michael B. Jordan), and Ben Grimm (played by Jamie Bell), a group of young outsiders at a research lab working a giant teleporter known as the Quantum Gate. When one of their experiments goes awry and their colleague Victor Von Doom (played by Toby Kebell) is killed, they obtain mysterious superhuman abilities that they must learn. Soon, they discover Victor von Doom is back from the dead and has become a murderous villain a.k.a Doctor Doom, with an intention on destroying the world, for some unknown reason. The team of now-superheroes become the world's last line of defense.What is wrong this film? The real challenge here is pointing out anything in this movie to consider redeeming qualities. First off, the story is not lousy in writing, but suffers from a significantly awkward pace. The storyline covers the whole origin story of how the four main characters became who they are, and it spends an unnecessary amount of time, over half of the movie to be more specific, focusing on needless exposition we already seen in the previous entries. It makes you wonder if Fox demanded extensive cuts from the final product (which wouldn't surprise me). With all that time wasted, it takes absolutely no time to develop the characters. Reed Richards becomes Mr. Fantastic, Johnny Storm becomes the Human Torch, Sue Storm becomes Invisible Woman, and Ben becomes the Thing. Other than that, there is no construction to these characters whatsoever. And it certainly doesn't help that these characters show such thin chemistry between each other. It's not until the final twenty minutes of the film when the action finally kicks in, and that's when the team is pitted against Doctor Doom. When Doctor Doom appears, he looks ridiculous. The green coat that he wears over his head looks so fake and the CGI done on the character isn't pleasant to look at either. Lastly, the whole fight against Doctor Doom is super short, lasting for roughly three minutes, and during this fight, audience are greeted with a shortage of tension and excitement as our heroes effortless take on the villain who's intention on destroying the world is supported with no real motivation. By the end, you're left with the feeling of \"What! That's it?\". It is pretty disappointing. I have to say I was quite disappointed with how Fantastic Four turned out, probably one of the worst additions to the superhero genre I've experienced in a long time. From it's like able cast and timely source material, I had so much hope for this movie. If there is sequel planned, the writers and director should really consider some major changes, if there are gonna show some improvement.",

Josh Trank, you did a bang up job.I realize that most people went in with the idea of the previous FF movies but lets be real. Those were camp. These characters all play a pivotal role in the Marvel Universe and if I were the Fox I would use this as a spring board for more use to keep the fans coming back for more. If this was a bad superhero movie then I shudder to think what people think is the best. I give it an 8 out of 10.

            "content": "I never got the hate for the Fantastic Four franchise in the mid-2000's and I don't get the hate for this latest movie. I had read somewhere that this may be the worst superhero movie of all time. Clearly that person has never seen the theatrical release of \"Daredevil\", or \"Batman & Robin\", and certainly not \"The Spirit\".This latest incarnation of the Fantastic Four does take a markedly different approach than the previous duo of films. Gone altogether are the lighthearted banter that made the previous series more of a comic book movie with the emphasis on the word \"comic\". Instead, here we find a much darker, grittier movie, but one that that can only be said for in comparison to its predecessors. This isn't a horror film by any stretch (that scene with Doom walking through the hallway being the lone exception). But it is an attempt to retell the Fantastic Four story with a more mature vibe. In the comics world this would translate to the difference between the FF of the Stan Lee era (which the previous series was heavily based around) to the Ultimates universe (Marvel's comic line of re-envisioned story lines for the new millennium). The writing isn't hokey but is instead a serious take on a traditionally fun, lighthearted group.This reimagining is not completely without its problems. The interdimensional travel works for the film, but just barely, and it certainly was a bold step to conceive Doom the way that this film has done. By the same token, though, it's nearly impossible to portray Dr. Doom on the big screen via standard imagery without making him look odd. Doom's metal suit just doesn't carry over well into real life storytelling. The new incarnation takes some getting used to, but it's not that terrible of a concept.The thing that I was most impressed by with this movie, though, is the pacing and the complete and thorough storytelling that is extant in the film. Usually when a movie like this gets bad reviews, it's because it has failed to tell its story well (\"Daredevil\" and \"The Spirit\" are both good examples of that). I'm happy to report that that is really not the case here, as the 2015 Fantastic Four movie does well in the storytelling department.That being the case, I'm going to give this movie 7/10 stars. Was it as dynamic as other superhero movies in its class? No, it missed the mark, just slightly, of being exceptional. And I would indeed go so far as to say that I do prefer to the mid-2000's films over this one. But it's a far cry from being a \"bad\" movie.",

I liked it a lot! I'm not saying it's the greatest movie I've ever seen or anything, but it was really pretty good. I'm excited that they have decided to go through with the sequel. I won't let negative reviews turn me away next time. Maybe it was because I went in with such low expectations, or maybe, just maybe it really is a pretty good film after all. Which leads me to my conspiracy theory. I'm usually not real big on such things. I'm mostly an I'll believe it when I see it type of guy. But in this case I've seen it. So why all the bad reviews and negative press on an otherwise competent film? Is Disney trying to pressure Fox into selling back the rights? By hook or crook? I have to believe... maybe! I just don't see any other explanation. I was sitting there waiting for the thing to fall apart as the reviews had said it would, but it never did. It stayed fairly solid all the way through.

So with these scores I was expecting it to be a disaster of epic proportions, the worst comic book film ever as some have referred to it...But halfway into the movie I thought well this is still okay maybe it's the second half. But no again, the movie never actually get's bad. I'm not saying it's fantastic either but biggest problems imo are that there is not much spectacular action, some VFX don't look that great (but a lot of movies seem to have that problem these days -cfr San Andreas / T5) and Victor Von Doom looks like a crash test dummy. But on the other hand I like the darker look of the film and the cinematography was pretty good. Most of the VFX shots are pretty decent (apart from aforementioned ones) and the acting is fine (if you think that was bad acting - see Cyborg). Another comment people have is that the whole movie is exposition. What they mean is that there is actually to much talking and not enough wall-to-wall action but it helped the characters and I didn't find it a problem at all. After they get their powers they feel a bit like freaks and in the real world that would be the case. You wouldn't go off playing a hero right out of the gate. I have to say I enjoyed the movie and it does serve (or was intended as) a bit as a setup for future sequels but it also works as a stand alone film.

My only conclusion is that johnny-come-latelys to the superhero genre have been spoiled by some of the outrageously high quality of films like GotG and The Avengers, so they all cry 'waaaa' when a superhero film of above average-ness comes along. I mean, let's be honest, most feature films don't come close to being above average, with the largest proportion of films I see in a year being only around the 4 star mark, so this movie is at least a hold-your-head high 7 out of 10, and that's a win!

Going in I was expecting an unmitigated disaster comparable to \"The Happening\" but instead I got one of the most interesting Marvel movies released so far.This a genuinely daring reboot, a film willing to explore the horror of having your body irreparably altered due to a terrible mistake. Pain and guilt and the reconciliation of these emotions are at the heart of this film and it's not often you can say that about a comic book adaptation.After building what he thinks is a teleporter wunderkind Reed Richards is swiftly enlisted into the Baxter Institute by Dr. Franklin Storm after they meet at a science fair. Storm explains he has actually forged an inter-dimensional transporter and together with Storm's children, Sue and Johnny, and irascible former employee Victor they build a device that can facilitate the transportation of living matter to the new dimension.During a drunken celebration of their achievement Victor slyly inveigles Reed and Johnny into joining him as the first human party to explore the new world. Reed calls on his old friend Ben who has supported him since they were children and together they venture forth into a planet that resembles a nascent Earth. Victor is entranced by an energy pocket and places his hand inside causing tectonic activity and eruptions. Sue realises what they are up to just in time to save them but she is caught in an explosion when they return.What follows is a completely different take on the acquisition of \"powers\" than any ever before portrayed in the Marvel Universe. The doleful depiction of Ben (\"The Thing\") is both poignant and resonant. Reed's guilt, Sue's paranoia and Johnny's eagerness to \"become\" a weapon are equally jarring.This is not a flawless film but it is memorable, no more so when Victor returns as a villain of pure monomaniacal malice. Modern cinema needs people like Josh Trank. I pray this won't be his last shot at big-budget movie-making.",

There's only three things wrong with that - 1) if we like the original actors there's no reason for the change (other than the studio saving money!); 2) we've already heard this story before; and 3) there was a third reason, but until I can remember it I think replacing guys we liked should count for two. The original casting for FF was great, spot on, and it's not that important to the FF concept that they stay teenagers (that is a little more important to Spidey). Subbing in a new cast came just too soon after getting connected to the original actors. Beyond that, these new folks were ehhhh and the story wasn't very compelling and the action that did happen was on another, bland planet. So not only did they engage in premature substitution (I hate when that happens), the product wasn't very good. Can they still bring the old guys back? Sheesh.",

            "content": "I'll be honest with you: I REALLY wanted to love this movie going into it. I loved the first Fantastic Four film from 2005 and was disappointed at its sequel, Rise of the Silver Surfer. After seeing this new one, instead of feeling elation at a great reboot, I just feel empty. However, I don't see a reason to throw my drink against a wall and rage at a wasted cost of admission either.The four main characters have gone back to high school as compared to their more mature counterparts in the original film. Reed Richards, the super smart nerd who no one will listen to, befriends at age 7 Ben Grimm, an abused but loyal bodyguard. Together, they create a gateway to a world in an alternate dimension.This somehow loses them the high school science fair (guess some teachers don't react well to teleportation), but attracts the attention of Dr. Abram Storm, biological father of Johnny and adopted father of Sue (this shows how lazy the writing was in how to explain why Sue is white and Johnny is black; literally, the explanation is Reed asking Sue \"You adopted?\" and sue going \"Yeah.\" And that's all we get.)These four, along with soon to be enemy Victor von Doom, also a kid, but older than the four, will travel to this alternate dimension, where they will get their powers and become the Fantastic Four and Dr. Doom (except neither of these phrases is ever said.)As far as a story goes, it falls short as an origin story because more than half the film is devoted to showing how they get their powers but not even five minutes to showing them develop their powers. Also, Dr. Doom, the main nemesis, shows up so late in the film it feel like it was tacked on to give the film a reason for being. Finally, the ending is virtually copy and pasted from Avengers: Age of Ultron (if you've seen it, you can already imagine what it looks like.)This is not to say that as a superhero movie it doesn't fulfill its main purpose of being a fun escape for 90 minutes or so. In fact, it has many attributes that make it a decent movie. However, the problem is that we consciously recognize those elements as being from other, much better films.In the end, I would say that the trash talk going around is from super comic book fanatics throwing a temper tantrum. It is a good movie, go see it.Just don't think too hard.",

Especially the back and forth between the Thing and Human Torch but there is no team interaction in this film whatsoever. On top of that Sue Storm isn't even with the group when they get their powers! In a time when technology is getting better and it's getting harder to tell when something is computer generated or not how does a blockbuster such as this get away with bad CG. Fant4stic could have addressed all of the previous complaints and would have still emerged as a pretty bad movie; above everything else, the biggest problem with the film is its story. Not just that it's poorly conceived and not fleshed out at all, but that it's told in such a lazy, haphazard way. There's the usual protracted pre-transformation set-up that's been mandatory since Batman Begins, which runs for the first half of the movie and falls flat thanks to the poorly written characters. Then bright lights happen, powers are given, heroes are captured and\u0085 we jump forward a year inexplicably. OK, so things are going to look at how they've changed in that time, right? Nope. All of a sudden the third act motivation \u2013 heralded by the return of Doom \u2013 appears out of nowhere and we're into a rushed final sequence where the heroes' first attempt to stop the destruction of Earth actually works. THE END. That's it. That is the most measured way to present Fant4stic's narrative. I'd say it was written for an audience with a severely short attention span, constantly mixing up the status quo just to make things appear vaguely interesting, but the short run time suggests key development points were actually edited out, leading to such incredibly choppy pacing. Again \u2013 an explanation, not an excuse. Fant4stic is barely a movie. It's a bunch of vaguely connected moments cobbled together to 100 minutes so it can qualify for a cinematic release; the idea there's a coherent narrative with a flowing story between its vaguely defined beginning and end is so contentious it's insulting.",

Indeed, if you wanna know, in spite of its much higher budget, this movie is worse than that one, which has been made with no real intention to be released. It was also ridiculous to put Susan Storm as a Kosovar adopted girl just to justify that she is the sister of a black Johnny Storm.

Then there's no second act and we rush straight to the third act with a barebones villain doing something vague with no real motivation. The build-up has no payoff and I felt like nothing really happened. The film has a lot of good elements and a lot of potential, but with no appreciable results.",

It definitely could have been a lot better if they omitted out the government conspiracy part and fleshed out the body horror aspect of the film which I loved.

            "content": "When Fox announced that they would reboot FF with the director of one of my all time favorite films, Chronicle, i was hugely excited. Then the teaser trailer seemed pretty good.Bun then things started to get complicated, the trailers seemed just bland and uninteresting, the director seemed to getting highly negative buzz, and now i know what happened with him and the star wars drama. He was fired. And thank God for that! What a disappointment with a director that showed so much potential with his first film. I wouldn't want him anywhere near Star Wars!And then the horrible, terrible, no good, very bad reviews came out, one after another. But i went to the theater, just for curiosity, to get my own opinion and mainly because i'm very stubborn. And...This is probably the worst comic book movie ever made. And one of the worst films ever made too. I mean it's watchable, but only for one reason, the cast. They are the saving grace of this film, and its a shame such great actors are wasted in this. They try to make what they can with what they have, which is nothing.The film has a first few minutes that while not good, are satisfying to some extent, and while the buildup is just plain \"what the hell were they thinking?!\" it passed, and OK i don't mind, but when this buildup lasts for an hour in an 1 hour and half movie, i think it pretty much says everything. I mean OK, they could keep this strange buildup if the film was a lot longer and had at least a resemblance to a pay off, but...No. I think the script is definitely the worst thing in this film, by far. Its one of the worst scripts ever written. Let me tell you what happens in an hour: Reed builds something, Ben helps him because, no one believes him, 7 years pass, someone believes them, they build a bigger version of that something, they travel to a terrible planet or whatever because they are drunk, they get the powers, and 1 year goes by. All of this moves at snail speed.One of the worst things is how they focus on everything they shouldn't, the most mundane things! Then when they should focus on the highly interesting ideas and stuff that happened in that 1 year after for example, they don't. They basically say all that in a previously on FF under 30s type of thing, and its so much stuff! Like The thing working for the military, on numerous missions, which would be awesome to see, but no. Or what happened to Reed. Then they return to the planet, the villain appears for 5 minutes, a rushed, stupid, dumb climax and the film is over.To call the script uninspired, lazy, dumb as hell, a piece of crap, wouldn't be enough to say how bad it is. There's no plot, no character development or something that resembles this, no logic, really there's no logic or sense in anything in this script, the dialogue is just soooo bad and odd, that forces the actors to look awkward as hell. Then there's an action scene, really i'm not kidding, one action scene that qualifies as such, in the last 5 minutes. And its bad, really bad. This couldn't be further from being a comic book movie or a blockbuster, this just seems like a bad documentary or something. The visual effects are great, the production design is meh at best, the score is fine, i mean the composer could do much with this material. The sound is meh at best and the cinematography i think it's fine, a little darker, but its fine.But you know, i don't blame the director, because no matter how terrible his direction is, or how terrible his vision is, thats his vision, period. I blame the Studio, Fox. Because how on earth could they read this script and greenlight it?! How?! Just how?! And how did they spent 120 million on a film that seems to take place in a warehouse the entire film with nothing happening?! They should have hired a director that presented them a great script and vision. But I guess not. How could Fox believe this would be a great remake?! I will never know. This is one of the most odd, strangest, awkward, mundane, dull, weird, films ever made. They could develop tons of important things, and there's some good ideas, but i guess the film then would have like 2h or something and that would be just stupid. 0 plot, 0 development, 0 characterization, The thing appears for 5 minutes, and Ben is just there because, the villain appears for 5 minutes and he's, bad? i guess. People say things they never do, people do things wee never see, people talk about things they should never talk about, we see things that no one cares about. What a stupid film. This is the end of the FF movies. Don't watch this. Hell watch the original films, at least they were entertaining in their own way.",

The four must learn to harness their new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy. Fantastic Four is the 20th Century Fox reboot of the Fantastic Four film franchise (2005-2007) that many would agree was not that good - but so horribly fun. This is ironically the fourth Fantastic Four movie and the second (technically third) stab at Fantastic Four, which comes just eight years after the first try and its sequel. Which didn't really set the bar inordinately high. Based on the oldest Marvel comic titles, this inherited property feels less like a blockbuster in this age of comics-oriented productions. This film isn't an embarrassment but a wrong experiment. Although, disappointingly this new adaptation isn't that much better than the previous one. They barely drew from a different source to reimagine the quartet's origins, without even improving them. Moreover, the cast is significantly younger. The heart and soul of the original comics were part of the interaction between each character. From Ben's depression at having become a \"monster\" to the budding relationship between Reed and Sue, to Johnny and Ben's squabbling. Those things didn't even slightly emerged. Central characters are mostly gazing intently into computer screen throughout the major part of the movie. There's no clear development to Victor's drastic transformation into the powerful villain. It felt that Victor was a better character before he becomes Dr.Doom. Technically, the look has slightly improved. Starting with the Thing who picks up computer-generated size, muscle and menace which might have lacked in the former incarnation. As for the costumes, they are built for utility only. Film goers are treated with a lot of science, that, I'm not complaining about, I always liked good theories. CGI is not convincing at all though. Even the green screens are laughable. Not one of the extraterrestrial scenes are believable, like this world might exists somewhere. Nothing really happen, it's long and boring. This movie displays a bunch of people trying to make something and then they get powers, but don't really use them so nothing's happening still. Alas, it takes a long time before anyone gets around to smash much of anything. And because it's hardly a mystery the heroes will end up facing off with Doom, there's a sense of killing time in the early going that's not adequately compensated for by the action sequences and especially the \"big\" finale. Where many recent superhero movies have risked overstaying their welcome, Fantastic Four, at 100 minutes has a slow initial pace, climax probably should have come at least half an hour sooner and the end feels a little bit rushed. Don't expect a lot of action as the film takes most of its time with exposition and development from the very beginning. In fact, this film is one giant exposition. There isn't one single memorably cool moment in the movie that people would talk about.Director Josh Trank sharing script credit with producer Simon Keborg (veteran of the X-Men franchise) and Jeremy Slater go way back into the group's past this time around. Plus, the script made major changes to the origin story which immediately distinguishes itself from the previous adaptations, with a seriousness of tone and a near-absence of humour, horrid dialogues and predictable moments, all accumulated have ruined the potential this film had. The final third and the last scene are so suddenly cheesy, I cringed. The collaboration of Marco Beltrami and Philip Glass also yields some intriguing riffs in what ultimately sounds like a pretty conventional score. Finally, they made a movie to set up another movie. Producers no longer intend to make good movies on their own. I genuinely never thought to this day to see a superhero movie that is that bad. There's no post-credit scene as it's probably not tied to the MCU. Overall, I really wanted so bad to love this movie but the entire run time is exposition. This movie feels like a teaser for a more exciting follow up that might never happen. The cast is all very talented and do their best to make this believable. What the heck happened?",

In fact there is very little chemistry between the foursome in this film.Given the underwhelming reception of The Amazing Spiderman reboot I would have thought Fox would had learnt some lessons as to how to relaunch a Marvel franchise.Reed Richards (Miles Teller) is a rising young scientist who discovers he can transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. He is recruited by Professor Storm and teamed up with other scientists that includes his adopted daughter Sue Storm (Kate Mara) his troubled son, Johnny Storm (Michael B Jordan) and maverick Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell.)Once they finish the teleporter, the team decide they want to be first for inter-dimensional travel before the military send their own team and Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to join them.Once they get to the other world they follow a power source that takes Von Doom and in their attempt to get back to earth an incident causes their physical form to change and gives them superpowers which the military learns to use. However Von Doom returns and wants to destroy the planet.The film had a lot of post production issues and director Josh Trank distanced himself from the final cut from the film. Apparently Trank wanted to make a superhero film with no action sequences!The film had to be rewritten and reshoots done to give the film some action scenes. It is still a drab, inert film where very little happens and there is no fun between any of the characters. The film just feels like one long set up for the obligatory sequels which is now questionable after the poor box office of this film.The film actually looks cheap as well with many studio bound footage, its like watching a television show when you see scene after scene inside a lab or even worse in corridors. The special effects are relatively poor, maybe because after the reshoots they were rushing against time to complete the film for release.The final showdown with Von Doom was pure nonsense and all over too quickly.

We have four troubled kids, but their background is not overdrawn at all. There are just some little hints: the impressive face of Miles Teller and the laconic remark \"My parents weren't interested\" tell a story that needs no staged melodrama. Likewise the problematic relation between Johnny Storm and his father.Talking about Johnny Storm: the movie makers made him afro-American and used the character to illustrate the perfidious habit of the US military to enlist young black men with poor social background and dull prospects.Of the background of Victor von Doom we also just get some glimpse, not the whole story. There obviously had been some incidents and you always feel them under the surface, but it is not necessary for the story to know all the details.The only flaw is the showdown. It comes to rash, the characters that had some serious problems of trusting each other bond again too fast and the solution in fighting Doom comes as well too fast, too linear and too easy. Just ten minutes more of suffering and trying to sort out their personal issues and the problem \"Doom\" would have done it.I hope they will not drop this because of unbelievable bad rating!

            "content": "Before I get to the \"predictable\" review, I'll admit this: I was excited for this movie. The trailers are mind-blowing. The cast is composed of great actors. The director of Chronicle is taking the helm. The new take of Marvel's first superhero team is intriguing. With all that said, I can firmly say how much I am betrayed by Fant4stic.The plot is not only nonsensical, but empty. The first act, starting with Reed Richards' childhood, builds up weakly but effectively. Then it strays lazily to the rest of the running time, with nothing gained but frustration. As an origin story, it not only goes by-the-numbers, but clutters plot elements with no pay off. How does it work? As every movie critics' pet peeve, exposition. Director Josh Trank tries his best to squeeze in every familiar plot beat to 100 minutes, but exposing every story detail gets no redemption. As a result, nothing is exciting. Being loyal to the Stan Lee-Jack Kirby comics is beyond my knowledge, but this movie never feels any semblance of a Fantastic Four story.Not helping is the fact that the movie feels rushed, throwing character development and conflict out of the window (important story elements by the way). Speaking of characters, none will actually impact, but frustrate, courtesy of the wonky script and wooden dialogue that was given to them.Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic is the clich\u00e9d determined genius with Murphy's Law in his application. Miles Teller tries his best in the role, only to end up bland and one-dimensional. The Storm Siblings, Johnny Storm/The Human Torch and Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, barely shows any discernible trait. And that says a lot given their unorthodox casting. There could be more material for Michael B. Jordan and Kate Mara to work on, like Sue being adopted to a family of color, but nothing came out of them. It does not help that Reg E. Cathey's Franklin Storm is the blandest of father figures I ever seen. Tim Blake Nelson is wasted as a stock government official guy. And Toby Kebbell's Victor von Doom is the most unforgivable character of the movie. His Victor personality, being a nihilistic computer programmer, is nothing new. And his Doctor Doom alter ego has the most unconvincing villain look, turning his serious look into a laughable presence, making Power Rangers baddies look intimidating. The only character that I root for is Jamie Bell's Ben Grimm who transforms into The Thing. But his performance cannot save this dreary experience. From that, the team dynamic that the Fantastic Four is known for is never apparent or recognized. They are just awkward, wearisome characters, with no superhero antics lathered.What can I say about the others? The CGI is the most horrendous of this year. It looks that it had been dated from the year when the Tim Story Fantastic Four came out. There are obvious green screen scenes in the proceedings. Mr. Fantastic's stretch effects are atrocious. And the climax is where the sole action set piece of the movie kicks in, with no buildup, no progress and no excitement. All of these attributes to one of the frustrating movies I have watched in a cinema.Say what you will about the 2005 film and its erratic sequel, movies I hate by the way. At least they stayed to the spirit of the team dynamics of the comics. 2015's Fantastic Four never establishes anything other than a studio-mandated update that never gains anything but disappointment. Fant4stic is indeed not only one of the worst superhero movies ever, but also one of the most disappointing movies of all time. It indeed gets the \"dishonor\" as the worst movie of 2015, dethroning Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. This is no recommendation to witness an atrocity, but a warning to behold the most hollow that Hollywood can offer.",

            "review_title": "Average retelling with the phenomenal and sensational superheroes taking on Doctor Doom",
            "content": "A decade after the original film \u00a8Fantastic Four\u00a8 (2005) with Ioan Gruffud , Jessica Alba , Kerry Washington , Julian MacMahon , directed by Tim Story was released, this film was rebooted because Jessica Alba decided not to do another \"Fantastic Four\" film and Chris Evans had moved on to play another Marvel comic book hero Captain America . Fantastic Four (2015), which starred Miles Teller as Reed Richards, Kate Mara as Susan Storm, Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm and Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm, was a darker recounting of the \"Fantastic Four\" story and failed at the box office . It deals with four young outsiders join an investigation team at New York to carry out an experimental space voyage . Soon they learn that the research facility has a covenant with NASA to transport astronauts to the other universo . However , they decide to go by themselves , to be the first humans to reach the strange place . Then the youngsters teleport to an alternate world and a dangerous universe ; but things go awry, it alters their physical form in shocking ways. Further, they achieve super-powers, but Victor/Doctor Doom is left behind . Four people are forever changed and the four must learn to harness their new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy. Reed Richards , inventor and leader of the group gains the ability to stretch his body and takes the name Mr. Fantastic . Sue Storm, gains the ability to turn invisible and create force fields becoming The Invisible Girl . Her brother, Johnny Storm, becomes The Human Torch with the ability to control fire, including covering his own body with flame , as Johnny morphing into a ball of flames . And Reed's friend , Ben Grimm , is turned into the super-strong , super-tough Thing . Together they become a team of super-heroes and use their unique powers to foil the evil plans of villains .The incredible quartet taking on the threats to the world with their extraordinary force .Change is coming.When you change the world, prepare to defend it. Beyond darkness... beyond fear... lies the fantastic... However there is an accident and they are all affected by the power in the planet.\nThe spectacular and bizarre adventures of Marvel comics group's greatest super-heroes team .The movie blends thrills , noisy action , comic book , spectacular feats , overwhelming special effects and it results to be pretty entertaining but mediocre , including a silly and ridiculous plot .This is a free adaptation from famous comic book by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee , taking parts here and there . The screenplay is pure entertainment but far from Marvel canon , containing some absurd and embarrassing scenes . The plot is well known , plain and simple , it begins with an experimental space journey financed by a strange N.Y. Research Institute . But the starship arrives in another world and things get worse , and they find themselves turning into fantastic Super-heroes .The Fantastic Four become into team of Super-heroes and use their supernatural powers to battle the nasty enemy, Doctor Doom .The picture is regularly realized with state-of-art FX , impressive production values and so-so casting formed by agreeable young main actors . And for the first time , The Thing/Jamie Bell was created in computer-generated rather than going through make-up or prosthetics . Amazing array of technical special effects with rousing action set pieces illuminate the full-blown feats carried out by the Fantastic four . The final duel between the protagonists and villain super-hero Doctor Doom is breathtaking and moving . Many comic-book fans disliked the way Doctor Doom was portrayed , but original series author Stan Lee, agreed with them , though here Stan Lee declined to make his usual cameo . It has been reported that 20th Century Fox interfered with the film, to the point in which Josh Trank's original movie layout was changed drastically , as some set pieces don't make sense , that's why one of the most major changes was the cutting out of 3 whole action scenes . Several moments in the movie take their visual cue from Jack Kirby's work in the very first \"Fantastic Four\" comic book . Although have given bad reviews to this film , I think that is amusing with spectacular scenes during whole the movie . The motion picture was middlingly directed by Josh Trank (Chronicle , The Kill point series) . It was really panned by critics , that's why after the disappointing reviews, Josh Trank went on to tweet that he'll \"never be working on a comic book movie again\". Trank finalized his version of the film in 2014, the studio was dissatisfied and didn't like the director's work, demanded re-shoots, which were done in early 2015.\nOther films about \u00a8Fantastic four\u00a8 are the following ones : 1994 \u00a8Fantastic four\u00a8 by Olley Sassone with Alex Hyde White , Jay Underwood , Rebecca Staab , Michael Smith , and \u00a8Fantastic Four\u00a8 2004 by Tim Story , this is the best version dealing with the spaceflight crew who suffer Gamma ray attacks in the Van Allen belt , being formed by team leader scientific named Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud) , the pilot named Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) , Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) , his brother Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and included Victor Doom . As Mr. Fantastastic, leader of the group gains the ability to stretch his body to any shape ; Sue Storm achieves the skill to become invisible girl and projects telekinetic fields ; Johnny Storm as the human torch creates a flying blazing ball and with power to control the fire . It is followed by the sequel titled \u00a8Rise of the Silver Surfer \u00a8, with the same players and Doug Jones as Silver Surfer .",

If it were not for the snacks the movie would have even been worse.This movie was doomed long before the director got near it and no special cut could have saved his production.First of all, lets modernize it, bring characters to start with to 2007 and make everyone \"be friends\" starting with Reed Richards and an abused Benjamin Grimm who somehow become friends because Reed is a thief has to steal an item he needs for his project that in the junk yard Grimm's family runs. The stay friends threw high school. Where it just happens a black doctor and his white adopted daughter are out scouting.Now we are going to take a comic book which is over 50 years old and re-write it so everyone meets as high school age students and change the race just to get a certain race in on seeing they movie. Sony tried that with \"Annie\" didn't work there and does not work here.Add in a college aged Victor Von Doom, who couldn't solve the inter-world travel problem and must be coaxed back into the project. Because a punk kid Reed Richards had some how solved this in his garage.What is even worse that they changed the race of Johnny Storm, they then decide to present him in a stereotypical manner and show he doesn't really care about his father's work that he goes off acting like a thug race car driver.This move plods through bad script, lack luster effects, bad acting to get to the highlight of the movie \"how they become the fantastic 5\" well 4 since Doom goes crazy. This is NOT part of the original story, they just thought they needed to fit him in their bad story line.We are supposed to believe that a special school for genius kids is going to be let loose unguarded to run expensive science experiments and that no alarms were set off when this equipment is activated.This movie ends by the government giving an expensive project center to a bunch of high school student. Then Reed Richards coming up with the name which is presented in the end credits roll \"The Fantastic 4.\" This should be burned and removed from existence.",

Anyone who likes the characters and superheros in general and is a fan of the series and is curious should give this a chance-odds are you won't be disappointed as long as your hopes aren't too high. The special effects, story, foreshadowing, and star chemistry are all good and worthwhile.** 1/2 out of ****",

I would advise not blinking during the final moments of this film as you would miss what is suppose to be the final battle between the four protagonists and antagonist.

The two young scientists Ben Grimm and Reed Richards have worked one a teleporter for years and so they are appointed by one Dr. Franklin Storm to complete a so called ''Quantum Gate'' together with his children Sue and Johnny as well as Storm's proteg\u00e9 Victor Von Doom (I hate that name). The five youngsters succeed in trying out the teleporter which allows them to travel to different dimensions. However, the machine gives them supernatural powers. Four becomes good, one becomes evil. You know the rest.Even though this film contains good up-and-coming actors such as Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Jamie Bell and Michael B. Jordan it totally fails as a comic book movie. The plot leads up to these great and epic events and twists but they are executed terribly. You are literally sitting at the theater knowing that something bad-ass will happen and when it doesn't. And you just feel dooped. When the director of a film states to the public that the film sucks... well then you know it's gonna suck. Unfortunately this was the case with Fantastic Four. According to reports, the director Josh Trank who created Chronicle (2012), a movie I loved, had to change almost the whole script in order for it to be more ''audience-friendly''. I literally cannot understand that part. Even though I believe that a story like Fantastic Four should be more for kids than say Iron Man, I still think that it could be serious. And if Trank could have done that his way, I am certain we would have a different, better movie today. But it became serious in a pretentious way that does not work. Heck even the CGI looks terrible from time to time. How did they go wrong THERE with THAT budget.Now, the question you are all asking: ''Is it better than the 2005 movie starring Ioan Gruffud and Jessica Alba?''. Even though I absolutely hated that movie, I'll have to say yes. Because that movie didn't take itself as seriously as this one. Even the Silver Surfer is better. Jesus... Like I said in the summary, I do believe and hope that this movie gets an overall grade LOWER than Batman & Robin (1997). As much as I hate it, George Clooney's nipple suit and Arnies puns still beats this crap. Go watch Mission Impossible instead, a movie containing Tom Cruise hanging off an airborne airplane is a far better choice. Trust me.Goodnight from Sweden!",

The unfortunate thing is the film's not so bad it's unwatchable, it's just a flat third act drags the entire film down. The origin story usually encompasses some build up, that is a given but the entire film contains 2 action sequences, and 1 of them is about 3 minutes, while the other is anti-climactic. The pacing is thrown off because instead of progressing the pacing the film stops and slows down, while the special effects crew does as well. The film may have gotten away with this a little more but the last 45 minutes are dull, because the actors are suffering from Star Wars syndrome (a lack of direction), and there's no humor to help move things along. Then after a boring 30 minutes one of the best comic book villains of all time is shoehorned into a climax, just for the sake of having one. The climax is so generic it comes across as anti-climactic as it never really surprises.

            "content": "What the hell have they done to my beloved Fantastic Four?! When I first heard that they were re-booting the franchise, I felt back then that this was somehow going to have moderately improved special effects and a definitely diminished storyline. Sadly I was not proved wrong. This movie is not only garbage and a total waste of effort, it's a huge slap in the face of everything the Fantastic Four ever were or stood for. I surprised myself that I didn't just get up and storm out of the theatre.Fans of the superhero movies will see this as just another movie, fans of the Fantastic Four comics and cartoons, will most likely side with me and this review and hate this, seeing it as a homogenised and castrated version of what the superhero quartet should be. And despite the cheesy 2005 movie, it was still a far more enjoyable outing than this disjointed and offensive effort.Based on what I read, director Josh Trank was determined to not make a movie that was in any way respectful of the old comics or cartoons and as such that \"Michael Bay-esque\" decision will most likely come back to haunt him forever. And I hope it does. No good ever comes from meddling with what audiences and/or fans really wish or expect to see and there are numerous reports of Trank's erratic behaviour on set. Having said that, I have also read that Trank wanted a different version than what we ended up seeing, and the result was yet more unnecessary studio interference that just can't leave well enough alone. Regardless of which version is the more accurate one, this flick is only fit for burning.The original Fantastic Four gained their powers through cosmic rays during a scientific mission to space; in this new version they got their powers after some kind of drunken cowboy stunt to an alternate dimension, that they weren't even supposed to go on. Sue Storm, AKA Invisible Woman, didn't even go with them, she just happened to get some of the fallout from the alien world when the guys returned from their impromptu journey to God-knows- where.I don't know why they had to make Johnny Storm, AKA the Human Torch African-American. He never was in any version of the Fantastic Four that I've ever seen. He and Sue are supposed to be brother and sister, so why the half-arsed political correctness trying to keep over-sensitive people happy? Is having an all-white superhero cast too much for audiences these days? And having Sue as an adopted sister may explain the mis-match but it doesn't explain the obscure necessity to change the dynamic.The Victor von Doom character turns out to be nothing more than a self- destructive emo-styled eco-warrior that turns into Doctor Doom while being stranded and understandably left for dead on this alternate world they ventured to. He displayed no real sense of the perfectionism that the Victor character had always prided himself on and his transformation resulted from a kind of fusion of his spacesuit and his own body after he was enveloped by a weird green alien liquid.Overall this movie was just a mediocre attempt at trying to cash in on the overwhelming superhero franchises that are doing the rounds, knowing that audiences will flock to the theatre in droves just to see the latest Marvel installment. The movie takes quite a while to get going and just when it starts to pick up, it's suddenly over. It dwells too much on drawn out pre-history of when Reed Richards and Ben Grimm were kids and then seniors in high school. It then draws out even further in building the device that ends up sending them to an alternate world. All the action takes place in the last 30 minutes. At only 100 minutes long, it's certainly not long enough to get audiences bogged down in useless back story. I'll never understand the insatiable need that directors and studios seem to have in wanting to steer away from what the story is supposed to be about. Fantastic Four is anything but fantastic and I still prefer the 2005 version than this slow- paced and derivative version. And don't bother hanging around at the end of the film as there is no additional footage after the credits have rolled, (as has been the case in nearly every other Marvel movie) so you'll just be wasting your time; actually you're wasting your time sitting through this at all.",

That was interesting but nothing of that was developed but it could have been through short vignettes of the boys growing up together. It would have been great.

THEN, when Reed goes off the college, Ben could give him the Swiss Army knife and thank him for helping him get into another college and that because of Reed he was going to be a pilot (which Ben was in the original comic). That way, when Reed calls Ben and tells him he wants him to go with him it wouldn't look like some kind of pity payback. We would know Ben was at least capable of being a pilot, etc.The story hung on Reed and Ben's relationship and that should have been developed more. They had plenty of time to do it. As it was, when Ben turns into the Thing and Reed runs off, etc., it would have been much more powerful. and their reconciliation have been more touchingI could talk forever about the terrible storytelling in every sci-fi movie made since JJ Abrams began sh**ing our stories and raping television legends, but I wouldn't be able to stop. And this movie suffers from those same kinds of defects. But it was still an entertaining story. See it, if you like to go to the movies. Wait for it to stream otherwise.",

            "content": "Really isn't fantastic, more so average, but why? It seems this series of marvel characters always have a hard time being on the big screen. Is it the actually film and film making itself or is it the characters and plot leading me to debate, if Joss Whedon did the movie would it be any better? Could it be that the powers these characters possess are kinda insignificant when compared the rest of the marvel universe? The background story isn't exactly fantastic either and it can't be easy trying to make a movie with four main characters. It only works with Avengers because we got introduced to each character individually before them uniting. I enjoyed Josh Trank's chronicle and you can see the same gritty darkness emitting here in this Fantastic Four. But I don't think this, or any of the previous F4 films for that matter have been well casted. I like Miles Teller, especially his Whiplash performance and I'm a massive Toby Kebbell fan because of Dead Man's Shoes and Rocknrolla. Even his smaller, sillier roles make me enjoy a movie more. But both roles here aren't amazing. The rest of the cast, okay but that's all. Again I don't think there's anything the audience can relate to or feel anything with these characters. They're not anymore likable as heroes then when they were before they had super powers. It's like they wanted to make the characters geeky scientists that have had a rough time being kids in hope to earn the audience's empathy. They did try very well to get this human element across, the friendship bond between Grimm and Reed, and the parental/sibling struggle between the Storms, mix that with Doom's unworthy ambition that manifests into home world destruction and you have a fantastic mess. Kate Mara I think has a face that'll suit the next Planet of the Apes movie, no offence, but she does. Bad call on using CGI over prosthetics for Grimm's Thing, yet it looks like they used toilet roll tubes and green LEDs to portray Doom. Who could have been, should have been such a bad ass and instead give him Vader like powers. And Michael B. Jordan seems to lack the flare Chris Evans had in the previous ones. (Pun intended). Reg E. Cathey's voice is amazing though, he sounds like a transformer! His voice would be perfect for Soundwave! The plot line isn't new nor is it interesting, and the beginning felt more like a remake of Explorers, (no they shouldn't, or could they? Love that movie) Reed being River Phoenix's Wolfgang and Grimm being Darren Woods. Then it turns into Space Camp! They breach another otherworldly dimension, upset the planet's chemistry and pay the consequences returning to Earth as US military experiments. You don't see much superhero action, even at this stage. And The Thing's action is seen mainly second hand from a monitor. The thing is a bit of a whinge bag of stones, think sadsack but as a rock. He wines \"help me\" more times than saying \"it's clobbering time\". Plus he doesn't wear any pants. And what's with that force field!? Again, Explorers! It felt like a cheap shot with them flying around in it as an escape pod that ripped off Stark's reentry in Avengers Assemble. It's a let down but with the bad press going about, it was expected. As Sue Storm would say, there's a pattern here. There is no Stan Lee cameo, and no sneaky extra scene hinting at a sequel which isn't a bad thing. Leave it as the only one, not a terrible two.

I was completely entertained by this movie, enjoying it just as much as I did The Avengers, Thor, and Captain America: the Winter Soldier. There were funny moments where I, and the audience with me, laughed out loud. I was invested in the characters and understood what motivated each of them. I had no problem following the plot, and had no problem with the pacing.I'm s die-hard fan of the original FF series as created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Yes, I wanted Sue, Reed, Ben, and Johnny to fly into space and be exposed to cosmic rays, but I accepted their gaining powers through inter-dimensional travel. Yes, I would have preferred casting Reed Richards as a middle-aged, brilliant, respected scientist, but at least the young Reed in this movie is a better depiction than the nerdy, incompetent goof-ball presented in the Tim Story versions. I liked that Sue made better use of her powers here than in the previous versions, I liked this depiction of Doom more than the Tim Story version, I loved the depiction of the Thing, and while I would have preferred Johnny as the teen-aged white guy Stan Lee and Jack Kirby gave us, I very much enjoyed Michael B. Jordan in the role. The actors did a great job here.I do wish the movie had been maybe 15 minutes longer, both to give us more of the battle between Doom and the FF and to give us more interplay between Sue, Johnny, Ben and Reed. But the battle scenes we get here are as exciting as those in any other superhero movie, and I walked out of the theater feeling satisfied. This is an origin story, and it does exactly what an origin story should do: set the stage for future stories. And while it may be unlikely given the drubbing this movie has taken, I would like to see a sequel with this version of these characters.",

            "content": "It's been 8 years since the 3rd attempt at making a Fantastic Four film, which left such a bad taste in the mouth of movie goers. Josh Trank and this new, young cast bring us back to the universe of the team. Was it too soon? That doesn't seem to be the case. Almost everything about this film tells us that they tried to separate themselves from the previous films, and I think they succeed when it comes to that. Let's take a look at differences.New Director- Josh Trank brings us a new, grittier feel of the team we know and love. If you go into the theater expecting a fun, superhero blockbuster, then this movie will disappoint you. Trank gives us a different perspective of the team, starting them barely out of high school. From there, we take a journey into the race for successful inter-dimensional travel, and the emotional conflicts that go with it. For better or for worse, that is the main concept of the movie. Trank takes us through the lives of each and how they must intertwine to face each obstacle that lies ahead of them. Unfortunately, as soon as things start going downhill for our characters, the pace of the movie takes the same route.New Cast- The new Fantastic Four: Miles Teller (Mr. Fantastic), Kate Mara (Invisible Woman), Michael B. Jordan (The Human Torch), and Jamie Bell (The Thing). - Miles Teller is a strong lead. As ridiculous as the script got at a few points, this kid can act his way around it, and make me buy the scene. They put a new take on the character as the boy genius, who still has a lot to learn. We see this knowledge appropriately define who he is as the movie progresses. - Kate Mara is a refreshing site to see after Jessica Alba's version of the character. this universe, she is a young scientist-to-be, that is smart. We actually see and hear her intellect. And thank you to the writers for having none of those stupid \"invisible woman naked in the streets\" moments. - Michael B. Jordan. This is the guy to watch in the movie industry. Every time he hit the screen, all eyes were on him. He took a poorly written scene, that coincidentally puts him with the rest of our team-to-be (earlier in the movie), and makes me believe it. - Moving on to the The Thing himself, Jamie Bell. As Ben Grimm, he has a close relationship with Reed. Their differences are astronomical, and yet it works. He was clearly not the focus of the movie, but had one of the most clear character arks. The one thing i didn't like was kind of like the Hulk in Avengers. The Hulk had trouble controlling his powers, but then conveniently could when it was needed. The problem I had here was less physical and more emotional. He spent a year hating Reed, and then all was forgiven without much effort. The script just didn't work in his favor for that part of it, but his performance was still good. - Toby Kebbell as Doctor Doom. As Victor, he was a good addition to the cast. Now real quick. When it comes to movie portrayals of characters, I am a strong believer that the writers of the movies can do what they want. It is their story. Their portrayal. If you are looking for the character from the comics, this is far from it. In the movie, he is terrifying, powerful, and mad. And though it may sound the same, its not. Just see it for your self. And when i say terrifying, I am saying to not bring your 5 year olds to this movie. They may have nightmares. It's a quick scene, but still. Doom is different, but I enjoyed it.New Story- Keeping this part nice and short to avoid spoilers, it was interesting to say the least. As I said earlier, this is not your everyday comic book movie. This is more of a sci-fi thriller, that seemingly has hints of horror and action. The story starts out well, showing us who these characters are, and how they come to be who we know and love. The issue here, is that they built up some suspense and drama as we try to figure out what is going to become of our heroes, and I feel like it cops out from there. They would give us some tense scenes, and they would be too short. Then more poor dialogue would drag on for too long. It was kind of a tease to say the least. That same pattern would take us to the end of the film.Conclusion: Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, and their team really stood apart from the Tim Story Fantastic Four films. It was a different genre. Better cast. And there was no Mr. Fantastic dance sequence. The movie had pacing issues, and the script had quite a few weak points.Great start. Shaky middle. Decent ending. 6.5/10",

            "content": "\"With every new discovery, there is risk, there is sacrifice... and there are consequences.\"I was surprised that critics and audiences were ripping this film apart because in my mind there was no way the producers could go wrong with this young and talented cast, so I was prepared to enjoy and defend this movie. I had heard about the production problems, but something similar had happened with Ant-Man and that movie turned out to be surprisingly fun. At least the director, Josh Trank, had decided to stay on board for this film despite reports of disputes with his producers. His first feature film, Chronicle, was a very entertaining and unique low budget found-footage sci-fi movie, so I thought that with a bigger budget he could deliver an even better film. Evidently I was wrong because Fantastic Four is a gigantic mess. There were several concerns over the film being rushed so that Fox wouldn't lose the rights to the franchise and the movie definitely felt that way.Fantastic Four is basically an origin story that ends up being so long that by the time the villain shows up it feels more like a cameo than anything else. The final climax of the film is one of the worst I've seen in a superhero movie. I wouldn't mind this as much if the origin story would've been interesting, but none of these characters were engaging and the dialogue was quite terrible. Every one of them seemed to have daddy issues or some sort of clich\u00e9 that characters in this genre usually have. Even Toby Kebbell who played Victor Domashev in this movie shared all the basic stereotypical traits foreshadowing who he would later become, Dr. Doom. Superhero films always tend to follow the same basic formula, but the successful ones manage to stand out for some unique quality, either benefiting from a great central performance, its funny upbeat light tone, or its spectacular action scenes. Fantastic Four uses the same formula, but doesn't do anything unique with it. There is no chemistry between the cast and the delivery of some of their lines are overly dramatic at times. There isn't a single strong performance here, there is no comedy whatsoever, and the action scenes (or should I say scene?) are underwhelming (especially if you compare it to other action Summer films like Mission Impossible and Mad Max). Unfortunately the film is a huge mess because it fails at setting up interesting characters and later rushes the final climatic action scene, completely changing gears on the slow and drawn out pacing that the movie had during its long introduction.The main character in this film is Reed Richards of course, so we follow him from childhood. He dreams of creating a device that can teleport people into an alternate place. In school he befriends a tough boy named Ben who becomes his assistant. Reed is a genius and working from his garage he comes up with an impressive mechanism in which he manages to teleport some objects, but in the process he leaves the entire town without electricity. Several years pass and now Reed (Miles Teller) and Ben (Jamie Bell) are in a High School science fair showing off their invention. Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his daughter Sue (Kate Mara) are impressed with Reed so they offer him an opportunity to work with them in their advanced state of the art laboratory. Victor (Toby Kebbell) had been working on a very similar project, but had unsuccessfully been able to teleport the objects back so the two begin working together to make their dream a reality. Dr. Storm's other son, Johnny (Michael B. Jordan) also joins the project and when they succeed at teleporting a group of chimps to an alternate universe they decide its time for them to take the trip as well. Of course something goes terribly wrong and they each go through a unique physical transformation. They will have to learn to deal with their new acquired abilities, which the military takes a keen interest in, but Reed is focused on fixing them instead.Miles Teller had been on a roll with strong performances in films like Whiplash and The Spectacular Now. He was even great in his supporting role in Insurgent, a film I didn't like. But here he simply didn't have the charm to tackle this super hero. Perhaps the blame can be put on the screenwriters, but he couldn't do anything to make Reed an interesting character (not prior to his transformation nor after). Michael B. Jordan's career seemed to be taking off after his impressive performances in Chronicle and Fruitvale Station, but he wasn't able to do much with the small role that was given to him here. Reg. E. Cathey was perhaps the weakest link thanks to his overly dramatic delivery of each line with his deeply serious voice. Toby Kebbell came in a close second, but I really do have to blame the screenwriters here for making his character such a clich\u00e9. Villains have always been a problem in super hero films and it couldn't be more true than it is here. I've heard a couple defenses claiming that this is more of a sci-fi centering on human transformation (with comparisons to Cronenberg's The Fly), but that couldn't be further from the truth because when these heroes acquire their new abilities the film inexplicably leaps forward in time showing these characters already adapted to their transformation and coming to terms with it. All the psychological trauma is ignored in order to prepare for the final climactic action scene which was to put in nicely, underwhelming. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

Fox clearly either A) doesn't care about these characters, B) doesn't get these characters, or more likely C) Both. I say Fox and not director Josh Trank because I actually stand by him in his tweet simply because I can't fathom a human being being responsible for something as soulless as this waste of two hours. A film this void of emotion, of stakes, of logic, of ANYTHING can only be the demented work of a committee of suits. Right, RIGHT??I would even throw in another star if it fell into the \"So-bad-it's-good\" Tommy Wiseau realm where I could at least have a good laugh and be the jackass heckling it. But it isn't even that bad. It commits a far greater sin, the greatest sin of all: It's nothing. I felt nothing. No nerd-rage about the desecration of beloved characters. No anger at the complete lack of logic. I just sat there and watched a sequence of events that I'm told were a \"story.\" It wasn't funny, it wasn't exciting, it wasn't scary, it wasn't sad, it wasn't inspiring... it just... existed. Afterward, I got up and left, leaving a few brain cells behind to be swept up by the theater staff.Towards the end I found that I enjoyed the film better once I started rooting for Dr. Doom. He looked cooler than our \"heroes\" (who never seemed to be a team; just four people who happened to stand next to each other), he had his heart broken by Sue, and he was a man of great determination with a plan. So what if his plan makes absolutely no sense?As much fun as it is to shred this film for being an insult to the human race, in all fairness it was Dr. Doomed from the beginning. Fox made this for one reason and one reason only: If they didn't they were going to lose the rights to the property. Just like Sony made those half-hearted Spiderman remakes. When there isn't a soul on the set who isn't there for anything other than their paycheck, it shows. And that's what all the nit-picky complaints really boil down to: We want the people bringing us the story to love its characters and world as much as we do. And when we sense the apathy underneath all the CGI, we're out. If you don't love it, how will we?Everyone seemed to just be going through the motions, like a family tradition that no one wants to take part in anymore but we have to because grandma always liked it. Unfortunately this might make it tough for Marvel once they get it back - will anyone want to see a THIRD iteration of these dated characters? Is there even room in the MCU for them now that Ant-Man, Dr. Strange, Spidey, Black Panther, Daredevil, the Punisher, and Elektra are joining the scene? I certainly hope so. The suspense I'm in for the postmortem fallout is far greater than any suspense in this film.",

A fresh new cast of actors take up the main roles, and three of them are very good, but not so here.

After the atrocious Batman & Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. Eight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice?Reed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B.

An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth.The one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start.When a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.I had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy.The story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best. It all culminates in one of the most boring finales you will ever witness in a superhero movie. Compared to what else you see happen in other superhero movies these days, it all looks and feels amateur.Then there are the performances. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell are all young actors who have the world at their feet. They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot.Fantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.",

He meets Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) at a science exhibition. Dr Frankiln helps make his dream a reality bringing Johnny storm (Michael B. Jordan) and Victor Von Doom (Tobby Kebbell) to help build the machine. On completion the youngsters decide to test it out for themselves and find themselves in a strange world with a benevolent energy that inflicts each person with super powers.That's the just of it all. Unfortunately the beginning of the story is so well developed as it dives into alter universes and general kickass science fiction. And for a large junk of the film I forgot that it was even a Marvel comic film. Then I was sadly reminded. Saying one is not a fan of something sort of hints at being the complete antithesis of a fan but I am going to use the phrase in its most literal sense. I am not a fan of superheroes films. I don't research characters. Won't go to a convention. Never use it as wallpaper or a cover shot. Never gonna write a blog about the rich subtext of the X-Men. And that's not to say that I don't enjoy the films, I enjoy them very much but it's all for fun\u0085 yeah? This film is the perfect example of why the superhero aspect is kinda silly. Everything about 'Fantastic Four' as a science fiction is mildly captivating, with a fair pace, intriguing characters and lukewarm old-fashioned entertainment - this is not surprising when the director's (Josh Trank) last film was the indie hit 'Chronicle'. Then the writers need to bring in comic book moments so that fans don't flip their lids. And what you have is cheesy dialogue to match up with the original child-inspired story. The finale is probably the most disappointing aspect about 'Fantastic Four' as they drop the ball, entirely loosing character engagement, believability and credibility. Perhaps this film is strictly for fans but if you ask me the fans are the very reason this film was unable to take creative license to a tired and dated story; reinventing the case of a group of scientific superheroes to be more than just childhood nostalgia. With a second instalment already in the works, though, it seems there was more up the production companies sleeve and this is merely something to wet the pallet. I don't care, it ends up being a Fantastic Bore.",

            "content": "I remember when the 2005 adaptation of the Fantastic 4 came out. It never seemed all that amazing to me at the time, so I didn't even ever think about watching it, at least until Silver Surfer came out. I watched both of them but I wasn't really all that impressed. Jessica Alba though was pretty hot though.When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought immediately, \"Oh, okay. A reboot. I hope it's good.\" I was pretty excited, especially since the media was making a pretty big deal about it prior to it's release this past summer. It wasn't until after it's release that I wasn't as excited, but still curious. It took me a while to actually see the movie and come up with my own opinion.Well, I've seen the movie and all I can say is I love the characters. They really chose a wonderful cast. Doom was perfect and I loved how they made his character out to be a bit of a bad attitude a-hole off the bat. I just wish they showed more character development of him becoming Dr. Doom himself beyond the portal.Reed Richards, Mr. Fantastic, was casted very well. Miles Teller is a magnificent actor and I hope to see more of him in other movies soon, but he really embraced himself as a young Reed. It was almost as if he was made for the part.Susan Storm, The Invisible Woman, was good as well. Kate Mara fit the part pretty well, she just didn't have too much dialogue and they could have done a lot more with her than they did with her and her brother Johnny.Johnny Storm, Human Torch, was amazing! Michael B Torch did a wonderful playing the role of this headstrong character. Honestly, I would have never even thought of him as The Human Torch, but he really does pull it off.Ben Grimm, Thing, was pretty good. He didn't come across a the right guy at first, but as you watch the movie, you see that he does a good job. Also, I love the way Thing actually looks, when compared to the other version of Thing.The characters were by far the best part. The story could have been better, but it's not bad at all for being an origin story. I hate movies that are meant to be origin movies, and yet jump right into the character right away. The 2005 adaptation did that and I din't like that at all. Same goes with Spiderman. The first one, not the \"Amazing\" series with Garfield. This movie had a pretty good pace to it for being an origin story and had it's potential, but I guess it was too dark for most people to handle. Plus critics and most people are very stubborn and are always dying for action and CGI. Well, guess what. You get some, but you can't just go into a movie and say it's crap because it lacks a lot of action packed scenes. People really need to grow up and understand what actually makes movies good.8 out 10 stars for me. Please, actually consider this review and give the movie a chance. Everyone is subject to their own opinion. Go get your own.",

            "content": "With every new discovery, there is risk. But we are stronger together than we are apart. - Dr. Franklin StormWalking into the cinema... Does this franchise need another re-boot? Overall Rating: 2 stars Cinematic value: 2 stars Big questions value: 3 starsIt is hard to believe that it has been 10 years since the original Fantastic Four film, but in 2015 we are introduced to a new and younger foursome. Director Josh Trank (Chronicle) takes on the retelling of this familiar graphic novel tale, but takes it all the way back to a youthful time in the lives of the team. The central focus is Reed Richards (Miles Teller), from his misunderstood child genius stage to his recruitment into the Baxter Corporation. He is sought after by the group for his technological abilities and his affinity for quantum transport. As he is introduced to the fateful pack of geniuses, a journey begins of building their friendships and the technology that would provide their eventual powers, the quantum transporter. At the conclusion of the project, Richards and the crew take a harrowing journey in their transporting creation. In the process, they find themselves on the new planet, Zero, and come in contact with its mysterious transformative properties. They experience a series of events that lead to the loss of a counterpart and find themselves with unexplained physical abilities. The four contemporaries have to learn how to manage their new skills while the government attempts to find a way to get back to this new planet of possibilities. Over time the youthful bunch learn to use their new found skill sets and develop a partnership to defeat a new enemy, Dr. Doom (Toby Kebbell), that comes from similar origins as the powerful foursome. If Josh Trank has proved anything throughout his short directorial career is his ability to recruit some of the best young talent in Hollywood. In Fantastic Four he assembles a wonderful central cast for this origin story. At first glance this re-boot seems to offer a trailblazing experience on a well-worn trail of super-hero legend. Miles Teller (Whiplash), Kate Mara (House of Cards) & Michael B. Jordan (Fruitvale Station) provide the new legs that a proper re-franchising needs. The story has promise through the first half of the origins journey until the initial transport journey and then something goes horribly wrong with the script and direction. Primarily that they lose the central character, Reed Richards, for the whole second act. Without their leader at the helm, the story becomes rudderless and loses its heart, even with the potential development of their transformative abilities. In the third act, the writing becomes merely elemental and clich\u00e9d. What should be a tension- filled climax to the inevitable battle between the four friends and their enemy, Dr. Doom, proves to have little more than a forgettable conclusion to a misguided narrative. The Fantastic Four is disappointing in that with the potential strength of the first half of this film could not translate into a better second half.Trank may have a knack for young talent, but fails to provide the right players to perform the menacing government officials and that of the villain. He is the primary disappointment of this cinematic adventure. In the beginning, Toby Kebbell plays the brooding loner well, but cannot act his way out from behind the bad make up and effects. This is not a reflection on his acting abilities as much as a poorly crafted script that fails to provide a formidable foe for the four young heroes. This comes down to being a lesson for a young director of super-hero film: the heroes are only as interesting as the villain they must battle. The expectation for Fantastic Four would be to provide fresh chemistry in this overworked genre, but the results never seem to make their way out of the laboratory. Even in a less than satisfactory package, there are a multitude of different ideas to ponder. This team focused story bodes well to the discussion of unity and the value of each part of any community, but the heart of the story is a discussion of belief. The father-like force of Dr. Franklin Storm talks about his belief in the young Fantastic Four. As would be expected, this belief is misplaced, because this small band of young scientists do eventually fail him. Which consistently proves to be the case when you put all of faith into humanity, mankind will let you down. Yet, the discussion of belief does not have to be hopeless, there is more to consider on the topic of belief or faith. Is it in humanity or is it in something outside of ourselves that faith should be placed? Should belief be in another super-hero franchise or should it be in God? Something fantastic that is worth considering. Leaving the cinema... Originally, I wanted to become a believer in this new Fantastic Four, but ultimately this belief was misplaced. If you want to see a better super-hero choice this year, go see Ant- man. Reel Dialogue: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What really matters when it comes to heroics? (1 Samuel 16:7, Matthew 13:31-32) 2. Can we become better as humans?' (Genesis 1:27, Mark 7:20-23) 3. Can mankind's hearts change from evil to good?

But after watching it, I felt betrayed. Betrayed because I defended it online from haters that started shitting on it by just watching the trailers. The truth is, this film was a disaster, and here's why:1) No chemistry. You couldn't feel like any of the actors liked each other. You didn't feel any kind of bond between them. The Fantastic Four are supposed to be a family. This felt nothing like that at all.2) No character development. Or at least, it had a shitty one for all of them. You really didn't care for what ever happened to any of the main cast.3) Bad pacing. Some scenes looked really out of place and unnecessary.4) Boring as f@#k. This movie was not entertaining at all. I don't remember enjoying any part of it.5) Origin story butchered. This was supposed to be an adaptation of the Ultimate Fantastic Four written by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Millar. I saw little to no resemblance to the comic book. It was completely unfaithful to their Ultimate comic counterpart. 6) What the hell happened in Act II and III? Around the second half of the movie, the film took a twist in a totally unnecessary way. And the third act of the movie was one of the worst endings I've ever seen in a movie.7) Terrible CGI. The whole movie looked like CGI crapfest. But the scene that took the price was when Mr. Fantastic had the \"face- lift\".8) Horrible villain. Doom looked like manure. When I saw him on the trailers, I thought to myself he would look better on the actual film, but no, he looked even worse in the movie.",

            "content": "Apparently this is the 3rd attempt to make a new Fantastic four film. To be honest I thought it was going to be good, at least better than the 2005 take on it but I was wrong. The trailer had some things in it that weren't in the film which made the film worse than I thought it'd be.I recently realized that all Marvel films since 2008 have been around 2 hours and take 30 minutes to tell an origin story. This one however lasts only 100 minutes and it takes more than half that time to set up an origin story that we already know and don't care for anymore. I could live with the first 50 minutes if the film would have been 30 minutes longer where it actually showed more of the Fantastic four. The end is rushed and not at all imaginative because we have seen it in a lot of other superhero films.The cast is not interesting, the characters have no chemistry or fun together. I honestly liked the ones from 2005 better, Sue Storm and Reed Richards were better than then than now. They still can't get metaphors right and just call the bad guy victor Von doom (seems like drax from guardians)I can't even call this a Marvel film because it's not at all good like the ones from the MCU.

            "content": "With all the negativity surrounding the production from the earliest stages, I went into FANTASTIC FOUR hoping for a triumph over the odds. And in a perverse way, I guess it is, but not in the manner I'd hoped. See, with all the intense negativity surrounding this production from even the early stages, if there was one thing I didn't imagine would be possible, it was that FANTASTIC FOUR could possibly disappoint me. And yet, somehow, it did.I'll try to explain. The most disarming thing about this is that, for the first 40 minutes or so, this is a freaking GREAT movie. Like, me open- mouthed stunned, sitting in the cinema thinking, \"Oh my God, they pulled it off. This ultimate underdog has managed to silence the haters.\" Yes, the characters are mostly a bit younger than they should be. But scrape past that, and in that opening sequence, this is a film that just *gets* the Fantastic Four and what makes their characters and the relationship, on a deeper level than the previous films managed. The actors are all top- notch, and inhabit their roles so well, bringing the humanity to each of the key figures and cementing who they are before the powers hit them. Miles Teller is just great in the film, and for the first time on the screen they managed to nail that Reed Richards is the most fascinating character of all the four, and that it's not his stretchy powers that make him special, it's his incredible mind. And science, and the power of intelligence and future-thinking, is presented as being right at the forefront here in a way that's kinda inspiring. It felt like superhero storytelling laced with an INTERSTELLAR-style awe with the might of human potential.Even this much-dreaded interpretation of Doom is handled so well at first. There's no computer hacker/blogger Victor Domashev: he's Victor Von Doom, from Latveria. And Toby Kebbell is leagues ahead of Julian McMahon's smarmy yuppie, and totally nails the character's motivations. He's all fragile ego and simmering jealousy towards Reed, his contempt for Richards' supposed lesser intelligence hiding an insecurity that Richards may be smarter than him. And yet still he finds himself starting to admire Reed and become friends with him in spite of himself, it's all handled so well. Sue's complicated protective relationship with Johnny, Ben feeling out of his depth amongst these intellectual heavyweights but having Reed's back no matter what, it's all touched on here. Even the origin itself is handled well, a skillful display of steadily escalating tension, with the heroes' transformations handled in a quite jarringly horrific \"body horror\" fashion that gave things a fresh new angle and totally made sense. And in terms of character focused origin-telling that makes these characters feel fleshed out and relevant, I genuinely thought Fox were on course to giving us a BATMAN BEGINS for the Fantastic Four, that's how good it was.And then it falls apart.I'll try not to get too much into spoilers, but I'll say there's a clear dividing line between what was a great film and what just turns into a mess: it's a black screen, with a caption reading, \"ONE YEAR LATER.\" And everything after that, it's like a different director working from a different script. Suddenly, all that carefully built up momentum is gone. And you realise that all the stuff that was so beautifully set up in the first half of the film never gets adequately paid off. Toby Kebbell's great work is largely undone and Doom turns into a damp squib. And perhaps more unforgivably, the Fantastic Four themselves lose all their chemistry. Suddenly it's like there's no chemistry between them, to the point where they might as well have filmed their scenes separately and been green- screened together. We don't actually get to experience them becoming a team, just get told they are. The Thing in particular gets a bum deal here. Jamie Bell is actually really strong as Ben Grimm, selling his pained humanity and making his friendship with Reed the heart of the film. But he is never given a chance to really connect with anyone else in the cast or feel integral to their unit. Seriously, I think I could count the amount of dialogue exchanges between Ben/Johnny and Ben/Sue COMBINED in one hand, and have fingers left over.Really, the back half of the film just feels so rushed, and therefore inconsequential, to the point where by the end of the film I didn't even think it was the end. As the film entered its final minutes, I was thinking maybe we'd seen a lackluster mid-film set-piece, and hoping that the film would be able to claw back its momentum for the finale after a sluggish middle. Then it just ends, and I'm like, \"HUH?\" I genuinely think so many people stayed waiting for an after-credits sequence (there isn't one) because of this shared feeling of, \"That CAN'T be it.\" This is a very slender hour-and-a-half filling.So, that brings us back to the beginning, and disappointment. In a way, I'd have preferred for this to just be a steaming turd of a film. Then I could have just disengaged and laughed at how awful it was. Instead, there's so much good stuff here, and they come tantalisingly close to making a quality film. And the fact that they then spectacularly fumble the ball at the goal line makes the whole viewing experience that much more infuriating. The fact they did enough right to see the great movie they set the groundwork for but ended up not making. In the end, FANTASTIC FOUR is not a turkey, and given the hate this film has endured, that in itself is a sort of triumph. But ultimately, I'd classify FANTASTIC FOUR as a frustrating near-miss.",

            "content": "Fantastic Four has had one of the most controversial, fascinating behind-the-scenes stories in recent years, and it seems like nothing but negativity has followed the production to its end. Critics and audiences alike are now completely ripping the film apart, but\u2013in my opinion\u2013for some of the wrong reasons. Many apparently just expected another fun, endlessly humorous superhero movie (with boring non-stop action) as if there aren't enough of those. Director Josh Trank had the right idea to implement some more refreshingly unique elements into the superhero genre though. Fantastic Four starts out its first five minutes introducing us to Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) in their childhood where their friendship truly sprouted. Seven years later, and these kids are now teenagers working on a fairly interesting science fair project that apparently irritates the school's administration more than impresses them with its ability to teleport small objects. I mean, who wouldn't scoff at those \"pure magic tricks,\" right?From there, Richards and Grimm's lives take a wild turn when they're recruited by a professor named Franklin Storm who runs a government- funded research institute. His daughter, Sue Storm (Kate Mara), and he run into this school demonstration and invite them to participate in a scientific experiment that could fully envision interdimensional travel. That's when every major character, at some point or another, runs into each other and the real journey begins. The movie very concisely takes us through all of their introductions and the fateful meeting. In fact, this first third of the film is grounded in science and is utterly focused on exploring the sci-fi origins of the property. Geniuses are conversing about compelling scientific theories and concepts, and several montages detailing the experiment's progress ensue.However, after their expedition into another dimension goes terribly awry, the four friends wake up to sheer horror (their bodies have been horrifically mutated and their physical abilities frighteningly enhanced). At that point, Fantastic Four immediately turns into a cool body-horror movie where the superheroes painfully struggle with what their newfound powers have transformed them into: total monstrosities. Richards' limbs are stretching six feet forward, and an ominous score hits. (That's surely a new take on a genre that's been growing increasingly stale\u2013the wait for Batman v. Superman is frankly unbearable). We even witness an eerie introduction to Dr. Doom in his full villainous form as he walks down a facility hallway\u2014dim lights flashing\u2014and blood thereafter lines the walls. The demon's pressurizing force and telekinesis faculty ruptures the soldiers' heads into gory stains. Honestly, the entire sequence made for a boldly gritty scene in a big-budget PG-13 film. So, when moviegoers criticize it for lacking fun and humor, I frustratingly think to myself, \"is humor now part of this firmly defined criteria for a superhero movie?\" It doesn't need to be \"fun\" if the tone is going for something far more intriguing and inspired.Now, how could a film with such a promising start turn into such a comical, cheesy mess by its climax? When you take yourself so seriously as a movie and set yourself in a creepy, haunting atmosphere where you're battling with the unpredictability of science and then, all of a sudden, turn into a generic CGI-infested superhero movie by the last twenty minutes\u2013that's when you really deserve to be called a disaster. That, in essence, is the problem: there are so many tonal shifts that you have no idea what the overall vision of the film even entails. At first, it's a Sci-fi feature about youthful inventions and imagination. Then, it turns into an incredibly dark and bloody horror film, and then, once everyone realizes they only have 25 minutes to conclude the story, there comes the pressure to finally end on the typical superhero note.Continue the review at: http://moviemuscle.net/fantastic-four-2015-review/",

You don't dissolve the brother sister relationship. That was just wrong. You don't change a race of a person for any reason. That was just wrong. I watched it and just kept asking myself WTF. Why would someone do that to these characters and all those still alive to know the difference. Tragic is all that comes to mind.

            "content": "Boy, has Marvel come a long way in terms of movies! The Marvel Avengers are probably the biggest blockbuster stars at the moment, with Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America and so forth have won the hearts of children and adults for being funny, action packed, and seems like a genuine group of friends. If you were to go back ten years before, I don't think anyone would have anticipated a cinematic universe the way Marvel is becoming. Back when the comic company was starting to lend out their characters, many of their creations went to different people. Spider-Man went to Sony while the X-Men went to Fox and many going to Universal and Paramount. Now figuring that out can lead to a headache.Among these heroes are the Fantastic Four, which was one of the original team heroes that got recognition for having chemistry like a real family. I've never read those comics but the imagery seems well enough that cinema could work well in their favor. After all, if the Avengers can get great dialogue out of an Iron clad human and a radioactive monster, it should work fine for friends that all got their powers at the same time. Family is NOT a word to describe the Fantastic Four. Young Richard Reeds (played by Miles Teller) is a prodigy whose had dreams of inventing teleportation ever since he was a boy. Together with his best friend Ben Grimm (played by Jamie Bell), they toy for years until they are found by Professor Franklin Storm who runs a government sponsored institute where young minds can develop their aspiring technologies. Richard is hired to bring his project along with Storm's children, adopted daughter Susan (played by Kate Mara) and biological son Johnny (played by Michael B. Jordan). They also bring along a troubled but brilliant genus Victor Von Doom (played by Toby Kebbell) to build a gate to another dimension.After months of work, the machine is finished and even runs a successful animal test. But the Insitutes supervisor Dr. Allen (played by Tim Blake Nelson) wants to give the technology to NASA or the military for further examination and testing. Deciding they want to stake their claim, Richard, Ben, Johnny, and Victor all use the machine and are transported to another world. While there, they are exposed to a new kind of energy that comes home with them. Victor is left behind who plans on using the new world energy to destroy the Earth.I'm cool with Fantastic Four taking a darker direction, as the previous adaptations have been too cheesy and silly for their own good. But I have to say that I prefer the older versions because of one thing; they are superheroes first and foremost. Fantastic Four may be one of the only superhero movies around that has no crime fighting. In fact, they don't get their powers until an hour into the story and don't even talk about using their new powers till the last fifteen minutes. Aside from\u0085that stupid move, Fantastic Four is just dull and boring. There's hints of a smart story with the idea of wanted to show our tortured souls, but never does anything with them. It all feels like chess piece story telling. Give your hero's their powers, sent them to training, go after the villain, and that's pretty much it. There's very little action, very little magic and wonder, and there little to no chemistry between Marvel's first family. I don't even recall Susan and Ben sharing any dialogue. It's clear that Fox and the movie's director had problems behind the scenes and it's unfortunate that the audience has to be the one to suffer the consequences. I'll give this one burnt comic book out of ten. Fantastic Four is seriously one of the worst comic book movies of all time. I never felt so much fatigue watching something that could have been awesome. I think it's time that the Fantastic Four go back to Disney and Marvel for the proper treatment.",

Basically, treat it like a Sharknado level movie. However, taking literary characters that are complex and for years deserved the title of \"World's Greatest Comic Magazine\" that appeared on their cover and reduce them to this inane drivel is outrageous. Everything about this movie is a waste of film and of talent. The lead up and first act is dull as possible with the characters having the depth of a mud puddle. Still, it was mediocre enough to keep the viewer's attention. Then, they completely forgo any kind of second act at all and jump forward in time. Finally, they deliver the worst concluding act and lack of payoff in comic book adaptation history. It felt as if I was watching a school assignment or test given to a child that clearly couldn't handle the material. It actually feels like Fox was the teacher and Josh Trank the child and the teacher gave the student a certain amount of time to finish. When the kid clearly was having trouble the teacher either asked other incompetent students to step in and try and help or else the overwhelmed kid just started scribbling anything to fill the page. The movie honestly gives off that vibe. How does something this incompetently pieced together hit the summer big screen? Whether it was a combination of an overwhelmed director, an awful script, lack of budget or budget being stripped away at the last second by a panicked studio or straight up studio interference it doesn't matter. What was released in theatres is an abomination to the genre and painful to watch.",

            "content": "I had a free movie ticket to use last night, and while I was not going to use it on Pixels or Vacation, my other options were to see Ant- man again, or see Fantastic 4. I've been perusing the boards on IMDb and I've seen nothing but malice; but it was free. I went into the theater expecting to see something as bad as X-men 3 or Ghost Rider, or god forbid, something worse than the first 2 F4 movies. When I left the theater, I left angry. I wasn't angry at the movie, and I wasn't angry at Hollywood. I was angry at you. And I get it! Everyone has a chip on their shoulder because Hollywood is pumping out either EPIC blockbusters, nonsensical indie movies, or absolute pig swill. Pixels was a last straw; the beginning of the new era where everyone isn't just a critic, but a legitimate movie reviewer. Pixels was torn to shreds, and there is still blood in the water. F4 was sadly wading in the pool when it all went down, and has been blasted for no GOOD reason. I believe this film is the sad casualty of the mob mentality of the average Joe. You didn't understand what the movie was shooting for, and therefore couldn't see it for what it was.This movie is NOT: The Avengers. Or really any super hero film that has come out in the last two decades. The CGI effects are 90% amazing. There were a few shots of the Thing and Reed that were a little less than perfect, but I'll allow that blame to fall on executive rushing.This movie is NOT: A huge budget action flick. It's not self aware like Deadpool, it's not drummed up with anticipation like Avengers, it's not a Shakespearean trip to Asgard.This movie IS: A new idea for hero flicks. It finely walks the line between the realism of The Dark Knight, and the Sci-fi nature of the source material. I thought it walked the line very well. There are sci-fi horror-esque scenes that help you feel the real fear in the 4. There are balls out action scenes where the thing is tearing apart a small army (This scene shouldn't have been reduced to a TV viewing screen, probably a Trank scene that Fox cut for no good reason). The over all tone is Super 8 meets the X-men.Did you want a huge movie? Sorry there bub, this isn't for you. Did you want to be catered with easy to swallow cheesiness and shallow dialogue? Probably not your cup of tea either. If you wanted a movie that acts as a great launchpad for future explorations into space, our messed up military, REAL science fiction, and more than just a popcorn flick, this is for you. If you wanted a movie that didn't HAVE to be huge to be fun, didn't HAVE to be ultra real to be believable, and actually has the ability to save some of the hugeness to bank later, this is the one for you. The characters are REAL. The villain isn't over the top and laughable. Reed learns his place and has DIMENSION. You actually feel sorry for the Thing instead of wishing you could be made of rock. Human torch is ACTUALLY hot headed, not just wise cracking and sexy. Sue Storm plays a REAL introvert, not someone flower just waiting to bloom.Trank took an odd route and made a smaller movie, in hopes to get bigger and bigger with each sequel, and you pooped all over him for having the balls to go small. I really liked this movie for being what it set out to be; 4 scared kids gain powers they can't quite control, get exploited by our government and learn how to be a team in a real world with real consequences. This movie lands above the middle for Marvel movies. There have been A lot worse (Looking at you Iron Man 2-3) and there have been better (Winter Soldier was rad as hell). Hopefully the world comes to it's senses before we don't get another sequel, Galactus can be redeemed on the silver screen, and we can maybe in the next decade get an Onslaught movie.",

            "content": "I love superhero movies and I don't mind reboots, so this movie should have been made specifically for ME. What I saw was a mind-boggling, 70 minute exposition followed by 5 minutes of controversy and 10 minutes of climax. Looking back over it, it reads like an hour long found footage mockumentary about superscientists that they decided to throw a villain into right at the end. If the idea was that everyone knows Doom, so why bother introducing him or making him menace anyone or anything throughout the whole movie... Then why take so freaking long to actually get to the fantastic four? The audience knew the whole time what direction they HAD to go in order to 'save the dimension' or whatever, but it was decided to take the longest possible (and most boring) way to get there. As for comedy relief, there was exactly one joke in the movie, ONE. And it was given out in the first trailer. Not that I require superheroes to engage in two-hour stand-up routines like three of them did in Age of Ultron, but SOMEthing that made the audience smile would have been nice. Since Doom wasn't in 90% of the movie, there was no antagonist, and therefore no conflict. As a result you have this makeshift, insane attempt to turn the audience again Reed, while trying to make them think he has some other kind of long term plan rather than just a year-long depression. Instead, they pick up a year later, everyone a little bit angrier, find Reed, fight for a minute, then go back to depression. I never much cared if comic book movies followed the comic canon faithfully. I've seen examples for either side of the argument that shows it only matters that you have a great story. What you had here was almost a bait-and-switch con. Getting people to buy tickets with a big budget, young actors, and trying to fly through on Marvel's decade of success. It's incredible to me that Antman and Guardians movies both knocked it out of the park, but I'd rather watch the LAST Fantastic Four movies than THIS Fantastic Four movie.I do need to say one thing about Doom. While the origin story might have been a good idea, his introduction was insane and completely without any kind of support that one of the top-tier villains deserves. And the way he wound up looking... So the story is that his hazmat suit fused with his skin after coming into contact with this radioactive energy substance. And what covers his mouth used to be the vent on his suit. But the effect winds up looking like a grey, shiny, Downs Syndrone looking head. And once you see the vent not as a vent, but as two enormous lips, you can't see it any other way. His head is FAR too large for his body and shoulders, and the overall look is more comical and pitiable than menacing or scary. In one of the final scenes, it is kind of disturbing to see a 6-foot, shiny, grey, down-syndrome patient with enormous lips that never move stalking through a compound and incinerating soldiers with eye contact. I'm sure it wasn't what they were going for when creating the Doom character, but for God's sake, I don't see how you can look at the film and see anything else!Only go see this movie if you have a curiosity about how they went about telling the story, as it is totally worthless as an entertainment experience.",

Together, the team must harness their new abilities to prevent Doctor Doom from destroying the Earth.......It was only a matter of time before the bubble burst for comic book movies, and while this most certainly isn't the beginning of the end, it certainly shows you that in order to get a successful franchise started, you have to put a lot of hard work into making sure the narrative is coherent, not just rely on name alone.For a superhero film, the tone is way too dark, and it does show that Tranter was looking for a more Cronenberg like body horror movie in the first two acts, but the fundamental thing is that this movie is about superheroes so it needs to have a slightly lighter tone, not just showing three of the cast getting drunk and having a laugh.It's woefully miscast, Bell looks uncomfortable, Mara looks out of her depth, Jordan looks bewildered, and Teller must be the only young actor around who in one year has given his best and worst performances of his career.And the final act just seems tacked on for that little bit of wow factor, but by the end of the film your only more concerned about when Maras wig will make another appearance.I'm sure there is so etching there, in Tranters alleged original vision, but I still think it would've been a borefest, much like this poor excuse for a tent pole release.The Tim Story version is miles better.",

It's certainly not the worst or the best, and it's way better than some of the highly praised films in either action or drama categories. At best, it's a hybrid, trying to give the background store more weight. At worst, it suffers from a lack of editing its script plus the fact that it seems to lose steam in the final scenes.This adaptation takes us back to the very early days of a couple of the quartet. We are supposed to understand the drive and intelligence of the main scientist and his best friend. We get a bit of background about the rebellious Johnny Storm and his sister's character is truly underdeveloped to the point one can't help ignoring or disliking her.I thought it was interesting to get more information on who these people are, and I liked to see the fact that Van Doom was a bit more than just a sketch. The first half of the film is really good, though I am able to see that audiences used to three-second flash editing might have a problem concentrating. It's not that these scenes are slow or deep. They are not typical comic book fare.There are problems with the way the other dimension is shown, nothing more than a valley of shadows with pretty much nothing worth mentioning. Even the threatening green rivers of energy are boring. How can we feel threatened by such geological fare? I found more drama in the chemistry between Teller and the actor playing Doom. Are these two colleagues or just fighting suitors for Susan? Even the matter of Doom being opposed to what the suits expect from him makes it clear why he goes \"mad\" and wants to destroy the world in the final scenes. It's a strong idea that is never given enough weight, and the final confrontation is indeed terribly short.Many will find the lack of humor in the film a problem because that has been a trademark from the early animation series to the last two live action entries. This time everyone is so serious and intelligent that they forgot to have a good time or enjoy each other's companies. We also notice how the bad guys are just not much than stereotypes, and everyone knows how much a good/bad villain brings to the conflict.Still, one can find some entertainment here. There has been talk about pressures from the studio and non-conformity by a few of the involved parties, and it's obvious because the film loses momentum as it nears the end. The involved parties don't seem to be happy at times, and there's some direction and tone missing. In the middle of all of this, there are hints that we could have a better sequel. Look at the original \"Star Trek\" movies. The first one was directed by Robert Wise, and we were surprised by how empty and bloated it felt at the same time. Yet, the second entry is one of the best films of the series. Who says that maybe the \"Fantastic Four\" haven't food their footing yet?",

Wow, putting numbers in place of letters in movie titles is really getting old, and this is certainly one of the worst examples of that! Any way, let's get to the review. Well, this \"movie\" sucks! Saying that this \"movie\" sucks is an understatement if there ever was one. This is the worst overall Marvel superhero film! It may not be part of the official Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise, but it's still classified as a Marvel film, unfortunately. This is one of the most boring \"movies\" I have ever seen in my life. It has the same old cliched storyline, terrible acting, underwhelming soundtrack, boring sets/locations, and also, surprisingly, for a modern \"movie\", the special effects look cheap and even a little cartoon-like! I love the first two \"Fantastic Four\" films from 2005 and 2007, and even the unreleased version from 1994! Those movies are masterpieces compared to this \"film\". It's like during production the film makers said: \"wow guys, check it out! We have full creative control of these superhero characters. How can we possibly ruin it?!\" Well, big shock, since it's modern movie times, they did. They did nothing to improve on the real storyline, the actual story is entertaining compared to this! Something else to point out is that the words \"Fantastic 4\" are not spoken at any point during the \"film\". They almost say it at the end, but the end credits show the words on the screen. Wow, even the actors were embarrassed to say \"Fantastic 4\" in this \"movie\". Talk about embracing the concept with pride! The \"acting\" is dull, boring and abysmal. Another thing to point out is: why is The Thing naked? His character is not naked in the comics, he always wears pants or some other form of clothing. Well at least in this \"movie\", we can't see his \"thing\"! The rest of the cast is abysmal and completely wrong for their characters. Another thing you'll notice right away if you're unfortunate enough to view this \"film\". Almost all of it takes place in dark rooms, or other locations with hardly any lighting. Sounds exciting, right? What, did the film crew forget to pay the electric bill? Finally, the soundtrack is lazy, overproduced, boring and generic. There is nothing positive I can salvage from this \"movie\". This \"film\" should have never been made! I rate this \"movie\" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. Ignore the 1 star rating on IMDB, if I could rate this \"film\" lower than 1 star on IMDB I would. My real rating is 0 stars! Another big shocking thing to point out is that the director of this \"movie\", Josh Trank, said, and I quote: \"A year ago I had a fantastic version of this. And it would've received great reviews. You'll probably never see it. That's reality though.\" Sadly, that's the truth nowadays, money now seems to be more valuable than making entertaining movies. Also, it's a coincidence that the director's last name is Trank. That perfectly describes this \"film\", tranked! From that point, he completely disowned the film, and it's no surprise why. Even the late, but great, Stan Lee sent Josh Trank a letter asking if he was okay. Wow, there's ouch, and then there's bludgeoning to the head! Do yourself a favor, stay away from this \"movie\". Trust me, I'm saving you 100 minutes of your time! This \"film\" is anything but \"fantastic\".",

I do not recommend this to small children because this movie has a lot more violence than the original franchise of The Fantastic Four because kids love The Fantastic Four due to their super powers and you should not put that much violence or mild language in a super hero film like that especially GD.

The formation of the team as well as the presentation of the characters and the villain feels too forced to the audience.If you're a fan of the Fantastic Four, you might skip this one and save you some time and money, cause this is not a Fantastic Four movie.",

I do like to keep my eye out for comic legend Stan Lee for his cameo appearances but I didn't catch him here nor does his name appear in the uncredited cast list, so for me that was a minus. Same thing for the after credits sneak preview, there wasn't any so that's strike two. Otherwise though, I thought the picture delivered for what it was, a reboot of the Fantastic Four franchise that apparently has miffed a lot of the fans on this board judging by the negative reviews. I recall as a kid being upset when movies didn't maintain continuity with their characters, I'll use the Bowery Boys as an example. Today I watch those flicks and take them as stand alone pictures instead of nit-picking the film makers for changing the names of the characters or rehashing similar story lines. If I ever read the Fantastic Four origin story I've certainly forgotten it, so the way it was presented here seemed acceptable enough. If I have to come up with a negative, I guess it would be the ease with which the team took out Doctor Doom for the finale. In fact, he probably had a hand in his own demise by tampering with black hole science. But it's not anything I'm going to get worked up about.",

            "content": "Fantastic Four has had in my opinion a surprising amount of criticism both from viewers and critics. And it also produced badly at the box office. IMDb average stands week as of 4,3 and Rotten tomatoes percentage is 9. Well, I have to admit that Yours truly went to take a look at this of five-minute whim and boredom. But at the end I was positively surprised.The film begins with the discovery of Reed Richards's (Miles Teller), youth and telecommunications visor device which the whole movie rotates. When Richards meets Ben Grimm (the role of a surprising choice, Jamie Bell), they begin to develop this invention. Some years later, they presented to the school science fair. They get Franklin Storm (Reg.E.Cathey) and his daughter Susan (no surprises Kate Mara) attention. And that's how the half-drama, half-superhero flick begins!It's the actors in this movie, that save this film from the self- loath and eating out of paper plates. Miles Teller, Jamie Bell and Michael B. Jordan are brilliant in their roles third of the Fantastic Four. Kate Mara gets a little overshadowed by the dudes but yes, he also performs quite well. Previously unknown to me Reg E.Cathey also has a great role as the dad of Susan and Johnny Storm. And that's all I have to say about that. I mean- wait.\u00a0Did you know that: 1. This film went through the hard way when it was made. 2. All of the very small role actors have only played at modern 7/10 drama-adventure movies. 3. I like this film, although it's like a recipe of how you make bad movies 4. It has caused controversy only of it's director's complains. 5. IMDb's forum only talk about this film like this: wonder at the choice to make Johnny Storm dark-skinned, wondering about it's average grade and asking do people get killed, because children want to see this.As I have already said many times like this (forgive me if I repeat myself), this film wasn't all that bad. The only stuff that is wrong with it is mild weakness in the plot and kinda bad CGI effects. Previously mentioned, the actors do a good job, especially the shining Miles Teller at the neurotic Richards role.",

I seriously enjoyed on the same level as \"Avengers Age of Ultron\", they are both equally messy and uninvolving. It is bad that \"Fantastic Four\" didn't had any humour, and ending was very generic, with villain who wants to destroy the earth - how is that for some originality huh? While the plot is predictable and lame, acting was OK, but nothing special. After this movie will end you will forget it very quickly, but it's not the worst movie.Overall, \"Fantastic Four\" is by a mile better then for example second \"Thor\" movie. Still that doesn't make \"Fantastic Four\" a guilty pleasure, because it is simply becomes boring and uninvolving by the end. At running time 1 h 30 min it drags here and there, so if you will skip this flick, you won't lose anything.",

What i can understand is failed expectations of audience, i mean i suppose that i kinda know what superhero movies audience wants and they just gave a shot to the other approach. I mean not the most impressive effects, poor fighting scenes, beginning takes too long, no that much of full f4 squad together, maybe not the best Doom and yeah explanation sucks. I remember how one smart man once said: \" We will never see superhero movie build on dialogues. It would be supercool, but it isn't happening and we all know why\". I'm not talking about this movie in this way, but it is about thing that usually the audience isn't ready to give a shot. I dunno, maybe bad promo happened( hasn't been following movies back there( and still not used to watch any promo or trailers)). Like, i'm so mad on good movies, i'm turned on quality, dialogues, scenario, to be honest everything. And even being this kind of annoying and complaining freak i'm willing to admit that this movie isn't bad really. If you missed it back there, like i did give it a shot now: take cola, pop corn, chill and watch.",

I mean I like the dark tone being used in films at the best of times (& don't get me wrong 'Dark' is my middle name) but in this film it bittered the hell out of it & was just not fun to watch! I mean the dark tone just doesn't suit this film at all! It would be like adding a darker tone to Avengers Assemble! This is an action film not a horror film! Damn!I also felt the film lacked the elements which made a good super hero film & of course the original 2005 version! That was saving lives, humour, good story-line & interaction with the real world! This film was very cut off from all those things & made living in a mental asylum seem more enjoyable! That's how dull this crap was! It was lifeless & gloomy!The story-line of the film was basic & dragged on! The film was just slow, boring torture & not fun, literally! The characters were flat, dull & completely unlikable. They didn't do anything humorous in or with their powers like the 2005 original did pretty much. The remake had no interacting with real world & no life saving which I think let this film down badly aside from the darker tone being added which I mentioned above was the main downfall of this film! Along with the film dragging on too much & the group to not discover their powers naturally unlike being locked away in a facility & the film ending there in a planet unlike in the real world like the 2005 film did! It was just complete sh!te to be honest!It seems like in this day & age whenever a Marvel film gets made their made only for 2 reasons 1. To boast the effects especially the CGI ones, which means sacrificing the interaction with the real world like saving peoples lives & their powers going haywire in funny humorous way like the 2005 film did & 2. Just to please the fans of the Sci- Fi films as a whole because they like fantasy films which are completely separated from the world! It annoys me quite abit how they just can't make them like they used to!The film overall was just dull & depressing & had no life in it! The film was cut off, isolated & gloomy just like that of a nerd who locks himself in his room away from reality! Not to mention how nearly all the elements & things which made the 2005 Fantastic 4 film way more superior to this pile of crap remake were absent! The dark tone was the biggest mistake these morons ever made on this film & should leave the dark tone to horrors & dramas only! So I'd say this film deserves a 3/10! Not good! :/",

At least it did not sound like a loud and lousy like any modern sci-fi flicks, chasing bad guys, bombing cities and downing buildings. But as a superhero and sci-fi film, it had its moment, only at the end.Obviously the film was too slow and dramatisation was a backslash keeping the youngsters (audience) in mind. I actually expected hefty stunt sequences. Without actions, a superhero movie is like a limbless spider and toothless shark. If the web and tooth are the superpowers, then they must handle it quite smartly. So that is where this film failed to be a clever. This film had 4 superheroes and until the climax they were impotent. Which means the only superhero movie in the recent time that meant for older people. Precisely to say, if you are a 30+, you might enjoy it as I did. I know I can't talk for you and what kind of movies you like, but I know todays youngsters who refuse dramas and accept action-adventures.I agree it did not deliver as it should have been as a theatrical feature where surround speakers are ready to give us a breathtaking sound mix. I felt it some kind of a television episode. Because that is how the modern television series are presented. Personally, I would like to say that don't mind my words and the review, because I usually enjoy all the films I watch. So this one was average to me, but definitely not a bad and I won't slam it. Though I recommend it for old people who does not like modern high-octane stunts.6/10",

Let's not just curse about it, there were some promising paths which could lead to a better reception but never happened and the first fifteen minutes were decent. The story is poorly told, like if there was some hurry to present the events. Resulting in a minor significance and concern for the public. As the super-hero and sci-fi gender didn't work that well together, some scenes were a bit off and the film didn't manage to create an identity. Some differences from the others productions of same name, which were motives for controversies and certain curiosity of how they would be explored, instead of being used with some cleverness, they were simply threw abruptly and careless. The characters are badly developed and don't gain the public's empathy.The cast, they have already showed some talent in previous works, the script and probably the fight between the director and the 20th Century Fox ruined any chance of a decent job from the acting. The CGI is awful, one of the worst in super-heroes movies. It's so bad that some older films of same gender have better visual effects. There're scenes which is even hard to believe that they were approved to be in the final product, being in such horrible and poorly finalized state which they are.",

He was in another dimension. He wasn't supposed to be some crazy hermit, he's the ruler of a country. And.... everybody was a genius. Johnny Storm is not some genius, he's the obnoxious one. (His special effects were also awful.) Also, Susan was the assistant, not another genius. 3) The effects were awful. The human torch in the 2005 movie makes you want to actually be him, but in the new movie, it makes you think \" that's awful.\" It looked like a cartoon was pasted onto the movie. THE thing looked like a rocky hulk. He's not supposed to be that big.I'll never get those hours back...",

I liked Kate Mara as Susan Storm as she is a much stronger character actress than Jessica Alba who's a really awful actress. I prefer Mara. Also, actor Reg Cathey and Tim Blake Nelson, who plays Mole Man, are great! Overall, the adventure and the plot were ok, but many of the scenes didn't make sense and their friend Victor who fell into a lava type substance on the planet in the beginning of the movie, survived to become Dr. Doom, as it wasn't really explained. The 'Dr. Strange' type thing that he did to planet earth was pretty cool, but there was no rhyme or reason why he became evil and why he wanted to destroy earth wasn't known. The ending regarding the new research laboratory is where they came up with their name and apparently the new facility the F4 will be working from is not on any 'government books'. To tell you the truth, it was an enjoyable film, but Rotten Tomatoes gave this a 37%, but I think a 5/10 is a good rating. Some Marvel films are terrible, but why remake the Alba Fantastic 4, only to make it worse than the first?",

But critics think otherwise, and that is why they demanded a reboot.This film is bad, but not Batman and Robin(1997) or Superman 4(1987) bad. I see there was some effort put in here, but I feel the effort stopped along the along way. I heard stories that it had trouble production, and it shows a little on camera. The movie feels like it was cut down, feeling like there where too many scenes that are missing. Now the effects are pretty descent, even when they are using there powers.Has for the actors, Miles Teller as Reed Richards does a good enough job, showing how much he does cares about the production, and you clearly see it in his performance. But Kate Mara and Jamie Bell as Sue Storm and Ben Grimm are terrible, not that they are bad actors, but both of them are clearly sleepwalking through this, I see a lack of interest while watching them in this. I've seen better acting from Jamie Bell, and when his character becomes The Thing, he is still not that interesting, Michael Chiklis gave more too it, in both Fantastic 4 films. And Kate Mara I don't think is a bad actress, but feeling she deserves better after this and last years Transcendence. Michael B. Jordan has Johnny Storm is not bad, but I feel he was not giving much to work with, unlike Chris Evans. Toby Kebbell is alright as Doom, he gives more into his performance than anybody.All in all it's bad, but not all terrible, I feel there was a better film hiding in there some where.",

It isn't just that it cost a boatload to make and doesn't live up to its expectations, it's just bad. Acting is terrible, pacing is terrible, I can't stress enough that it's bad, and you've been warned. If you're looking for accuracy to the original story, you're not going to get a lot of that either. Pacing is terrible it's another thing I can't stress enough there is about 45 minutes of it that just drag on and on it seems, though I think the bad writing exacerbates it.The first 15-20 minutes I actually laughed several times when the film wasn't supposed to be funny. The dialog was cheesy. Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm has a street racing sequence where it looks like they're trying to copy Fast and the Furious more than anything (I guess originality isn't a strong suit here), not to mention Johnny Storm wasn't African American in the comics, but whatever, they don't even have the ages correct so it doesn't really matter. By this point you already realize things are pretty much out the window so you go along for the ride.After you get past the first 20 minutes prepare yourself for about 45 minutes of inane dialog and Miles Teller as Reed Richards staring at a computer monitor (yes, this happens several times and he has this blank gaze on his face), lots of people sitting at boardroom tables and so on. Some of the sequences were so boring I was researching the film during them (don't worry, I didn't disturb any moviegoers because there was hardly anyone there).Things start to pick up in the last half an hour in lead up to the final battle. Our heroes get to battle Victor Von Doom who in this film apparently wants to simply kill everyone (he could have killed a few of the characters multiple times but apparently chose not to because he didn't). The epic battle uses cheap CGI well not exactly cheap but it looks like something that could have been done on a SyFy made for TV budget.By the end I was literally dumbfounded. Where did they burn through the money? With costumes that looked like paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9, guns that looked and fired unrealistically and CGI that for the most part could be done on a home computer it didn't go there. It certainly didn't go to polishing the script, it is laughably bad at points, yes you may laugh, I did several times. So much is wrong it's hard to find what's right. About the only thing I can say is I didn't walk out on it. I'm giving it 2 stars because it was OK at some points.",

Spoiler: It didn't.I understand that movies nowadays would like to stray away from using animals, especially in scenes that make it look like they've been harmed in some way (or have the potential to be), and I'm all for that. But if you're going to use CGI instead of an animal how about making it actually look real instead of making it look massively computerized, I also realize that graphics are hard and take time and effort, but if you want to say that this movie is made from the same studio as X-men, why don't you make the effort to explain that amateurs actually rented out the studio and created the graphics using technology found in the 1980's. An entirely different movie would have been a better choice, than trying to (poorly) redo a movie that complete failed from the start. It completely fell flat and disgraced the name of the Fantastic 4, and honestly it made Marvel studios look like a complete joke. I understand that movie making is hard and requires a lot of time and effort, and I think that they tried, but it was so far from their best it's not even comical. This is not a movie that I look back and think \"It was so stupid it was funny,\" no; this is a movie that makes me regret wasting two hours of my life sitting down and hoping that their was some just God in the world that could save this movie and actually make it interesting. Thinking about it... I will give it two stars... the saving grace of the movie was actually the first 20 minutes of the movie describing Reed and Ben's relationship and how they ended up making their transporter machine. But other than that the movie spent more time describing how the machine was made than actually getting to the meat of the issue. And the fact that Doom was completely forgotten about until the last 10 minutes makes me think that they were going along minding their own business finishing filming and then one intern runs on set saying \"WAIT! WE FORGOT ABOUT VICTOR VAN DOOM!\" and since it's the last day of filming they have to quickly patch him in and say \"oh yeah, that's right, well here is a short fight scene to make up for lost time, but you die, sorry for forgetting about you, I'll have flowers sent to your door.I hope you have something better coming Marvel, because if this movie is any indication... I'd say fire the writer and move forward and try to bury this one where no one will try to find it; maybe that useless dimension you guys thought was a \"brilliant\" idea.",

Reports of erratic behavior from the director, rewrites of his script and the film ultimately being taken out of his hands and being heavily re-edited hung over the entire thing like a rain cloud. Critics hated it (%9 score on Rottentomatoes.com), audiences stayed away ($56 million dollar total gross in North America, though it did do better overseas) and it became one of the few real bombs of the comic book movie era. But is it really as bad as its reputation? Not quite.Make no mistake, 'Fantastic Four' is a flawed film. A very flawed film. The chaos behind the scenes is evident in the finished (or more accurately, unfinished) product. Trank was clearly going for something a bit more unconventional here. Something that actually might've worked and been fresh had he been allowed--or able--to see it through to completion. As it stands, the film feels jumbled, choppy and incomplete. Particularly the third act.I can't say with certainty that Trank's original vision would've worked, but pieces for a much better film are scattered throughout what we did get.",

Fantastic Four is a sloppy reboot that doesn't offer anything new, or anything at all. It's a literal origin story we don't need, and not even as enjoyable as the previous rendition with Jessica Alba and Chris Evans, which speaks volume of how terrible it is.In a more youthful take, Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and friends are involved in making a dimensional teleporter. It will then, unsurprisingly, fail catastrophically and turning them into the titular heroes. The story is excruciatingly boring, it would probably not last as weekend TV show. Devoid of any novelty or humor, it's an expected dull endeavor.The cast is full or promising actors, each of them is capable of starring as leading role, and they have, but here they are far from convincing as heroes. Not only that the chemistry is dreary at best, more often they engage in a display of awkward interactions than looking like a fully functioning team. Granted, it's an origin story, but at least the previous team looks believable as team.Pacing is a series of prolonged events that we already know. It doesn't take comic fans to know these things, yet the movie tries so hard to sell novelty it doesn't have with soundtracks and timid dramatic moments while audiences yawn witnessing plot developments from 90s. Some of the actions scenes, from the total of ten minutes, are choppy and looks outdated.It even tries to shoehorn incomplete villain, lame attempt on humor and force message on how we destroy the planet. When superhero, or action movies in general, have offered much superior quality, Fantastic Four is not worth your money or time. It will eventually be teleported to another dimension where we occasionally gaze upon to reflect past mistake.",

I thought the thing was a terrible character because he kept asking Reed for help every part of the movie and that seemed kinda weak of the thing. Invisible Woman could've needed help because the way the story between her and Reed was developed seemed kind of rushed and the story line could have taken its time. I like the fact that they basically did the story of how they all got their powers, but the story line should have been developed better. Finally, with Doom, Doom needed a lot more character development and showing more of his jealous side which then turned him into hating Reed. And the fact that Doom was beaten within a few minutes bothered me because he is such a stronger enemy than what the movie showed.",

They expended so much time in the first act that the 2nd act of the film is (invisible) and we jump directly to the 3rd act that burns into ashes without any support.Usually I try to be positive with every film and to find their good side. But in this case I'm really disappointed. The previous films, yeah those with the blonde Jessica Alba, were way more entertaining and exciting than this oneThe only good thing from it is the casting. But I can't understand why these actors accepted to be in a film with such a bad script. OK, I get everyone wants to be a super hero but not everyone gets second chances like Ryan Reynolds so they should be more careful with their choices.Maybe Stan Lee thought the same thing about it, so he decided not to do this time the now famous cameo.I don't even know if there is an post credits scene, I didn't stay.

At least it has the decency to keep itself to 100 minutes and forego a false ending.Note to future scientists: DO NOT work on an inter-dimensional travel gate with anyone whose last name is VON DOOM, especially after he gets his advanced degree and (spoiler alert) becomes DR. DOOM. But as with many of the other summer movies, the real villain is reckless pursuit of science.Most other critics have noticed that the main cast is certainly capable and the acting is fine, but boyoboyoboy, manomanoman is this plot a dud. With a thud. And you know Tim Blake Nelson plays a bad guy because he chews gum with is mouth open, and with great affectation, possibly an acting skill he learned from his junior high drama teacher.The movie is about 80% boring and lame setup, then a reckless drunken trip to Planet Zero, and then a final act which is sudden and innocuous. The movie is shot with a really dark blue look, and that sets the tone of depression and malaise.It starts with a search for a power converter, and ends with everything being fantastic. Sue Storm is cold but she loves Portishead and is really good at pattern recognition. Apparently none of the patterns she can see raise any red flags about working with a creepy guy with attachment issues named VON DOOM.The origin story includes welding and screwing and bolting and tweaking source code. Oh, and there's a really exciting moment when Reed Richards spins in an office chair and takes a selfie (spoiler alert) of himself. And remember your really cool sunglasses when you're in the lab, because inter-dimensional travel is really bright. Personally, I would just look away.Here's the real spoiler alert: how they get their superpowers is pretty lame, just a simple throwback to The Fly and the Brundlefly. They return to Earth, but the rock guy does so with rocks, the flame guy does so with fire, the plastic guy does so with, um, Silly Putty (I guess), VON DOOM does not return but instead fuses with his suit and the Planet Zero, and somehow their return causes Sue (who never went to Planet Zero) to fuse with a force field and an invisible hat (I guess). This all happens just after a healthy dose of American exceptionalism by planting a U.S. flag on Planet Zero and Instagramming it.None of it would've happened if they hadn't been drunk. So raise a glass and get drunk, because you never know where you might end up the next day, or who you might become.It's funny that VON DOOM gets jealous over the face time Reed gets with Sue, but Reed only seems to have man-bro love for his buddy, Thing. It is a bit reminiscent of Captain America's love for Bucky.The final battle includes some pretty laughable special effects, especially when Reed does a double-punch across about 50 yards, \u00e0 la Dhalsim. But even though they have some differences, the Fantastic Four are able to set those differences aside to save Earth and become a family.It would be touching, but who wants to touch the Thing?",

All in All a great movie that was marketed the wrong way. Trailers will have you thinking its an action movie but in fact it is a Adventure/Fantasy Movie and a very good one at that.

            "content": "Don't get me wrong: this movie is not a masterpiece in anyway. In fact, I must start this review by saying that I do not actually believe this movie is deserving of a ten star rating -- If I were being fully honest, it'd be more deserving of a 6. I'm just giving it that because it most definitely deserves more than its current 4.2, and because I know its score would be a lot higher if the exact same film had been produced by Marvel studios.You see, the odds were always against this movie. The Fantastic Four is not an easy team to adapt to the screen; angry fan boys seem desperate to hate on Fox's every move; Michael B. Jordan's casting as Johnny Storm resulted in a disgusting wave of racist comments disguised as worry for the source material; Josh Trank was inexperienced and had never been involved in a movie this big. And all this negativity surrounding it, I believe, were the movie's biggest downfall. And I'm saying this because the bad parts of this movie generally weren't the cast, the tone or anything related to pre- production. The movie's idea and premise is great. For the most part (more on that later), the screenplay is good enough. The cast is excellent. What made this movie fail was how the studio seemingly gave up on it somewhere halfway through post-production.But let's start from the beginning -- the first half of this movie is great. Now, before you yell \"bullsh*t\" and scroll past this review, allow me to explain myself: this was never meant to be an action flick. It's a sci-fi thriller with coming of age elements. And as that, it works well. It doesn't have fight scenes and too much CGI because that is not the point. The movie is an origin story, presenting these characters as real people and establishing the universe they live in. The entire movie should have been like this, and its biggest mistake was to introduce unnecessary conflict in its second half. It would've worked just fine as a movie establishing the team, showing how they got their powers and how they got to be so close. The acting is great, with a special shout out to Jamie Bell (Ben Grimm) and Michael B. Jordan (Johnny Storm) who had less to work with but still managed to do a fine job with their characters. I was concerned about how they would manage to make Ben Grimm's emotions and suffering believable when he is in rock form, but that is a non-issue with the superb Bell. As for B. Jordan, he seems to really understand Johnny and adds some depth to what could have been a shallow character. As a fan of the Fantastic Four comic books, I also appreciated the many nods to the Ultimate storyline that the first half of the movie presents. A few scenes seem to have been taken directly from the first issues, and it's pleasant to see as a fan. Their dynamics are also good in the first moment, with Reed Richards and Ben Grimm's lifelong friendship being a particular highlight. Grimm is presented as Richards' protector, but instead of going down a much more obvious route with him fighting bullies away from Reed and standing up for him at any moment, they chose to present their relationship in a much more natural and subtle light, with Ben being almost like the proud parent Reed never had. It's sweet and well-written, never giving too much information away.The elements of body horror were, without a doubt, one of the strongest parts of the film. Had it focused more on that, it would've been better. The scene where we first see Ben Grimm's new physical form is absolutely heartbreaking, and Reed's powers' reveal is just as disturbing. Unfortunately, it is here where my compliments to this movie end.You can pinpoint the exact moment the movie begins its downward spiral towards chaos. The addition of conflict made it all seem very rushed and forced in comparison to the nice and evenly paced first half. From that point on, the CGI is suddenly terrible and the screenwriters seemingly forget how to make a proper screenplay. Dialogues are extremely cheesy and just downright terrible. You can see the re-shoots very clearly and it's extremely rushed. It all could \u2013 and should \u2013 have been about 10 or 20 minutes longer, and because they deal with the threat so quickly we don't even have the time to find Doom to be that threatening at all. As for the action sequence\u0085 there's no way to sugarcoat this. It sucks. It shouldn't have been there in the first place. It doesn't fit the rest of the movie thematically and ruins what could have been an otherwise excellent villain for a sequel. All in all, it looks like the SFX team simply threw the towel and the editor stopped caring altogether and not even the young cast's talent manages to save the movie from its final act.Basically, what I'm saying is that this movie looks like two different movies that were forcibly turned into one. The first one is a good sci-fi character study and origin story that offers a fresh take on this otherwise unoriginal genre that has become comic book movies; the second one is, simply put, a train wreck with some of the worst SFX in recent memory and bad dialogue. It's sad to see the transition from one to another, and as the credits begin rolling, you can't help but imagine how the movie could have played out if they hadn't forced that second half in.",

            "content": "Like the 1994 Roger Corman's film with the same name, this film was made so Fox could keep the film rights for the Fantastic Four, rather than, having it reverted to Marvel Studios. Based on their \"Ultimate Marvel\" origin by Mark Miller, the movie directed by Josh Trank, serves as a continuity reboot for 20th Century Fox's Fantastic Four film franchise, and has no connection to the 3 previous films. Its story follows Reed Richards (Miles Teller), a brilliant scientist researching travel into another dimension. However, when a test involving him and 3 other subjects goes horribly wrong, the four must adapt to their rapidly changing bodies, while preventing those around them wanting to exploit Reed's research for personal gain. Can Reed protect his research or will the bad guys win? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, unlike the previous version, this one features a much younger version of the heroes with lots of teen appeal: Miles Teller as Reed Richards, Kate Mara as Sue Storm, Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm, and Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm. The fact that they're very young, is kinda jarring. I really didn't buy them, as scientists, most of the time. The acting from them, was alright, but very dull. The writers didn't give them, much to work with. The dialogue was very humorless grim, exposition driven. The pacing for the film really show this. It drags for so long, that much of the movie is spent on the set up and exposition. Then, when it got good, with the Cronenbergian Body Horror. The pacing skips time, turning the film into a more standard superhero tones. I really wish, they show how were able to control their powers, rather than skipping ahead a year and showing that everybody's fine. Yet despite all this drawn-out buildup to the creation of the interdimensional machine, the movie never takes the time to actually have Reed, the Storms, and Grimm really get to know each other or to let the audience get to know them. Whatever bonding they had happened off-screen. So when the team finally gets together for the final act battle against Dr. Doom (Toby Kebbell); it's really hard to believe. Somehow, but they come off, more like resembles a dysfunctional Family than an actual surrogate family. Sue Storm comes off way too standoffish, when it comes to Reed Richards talking to her. Aren't them, supposed to be lovers? Both barely have any chemistry or any charm. I really don't believe, these two characters, honestly like each other, in this version. Ben and Reed's relationship could also need some work. I barely think of them, as friends. The movie even taints Ben's catchphrase \"It's clobberin' time!\" by associating it with what his big brother would say before beating him as a child! Also, why is Johnny such a dick? He barely knows Reed and Ben, but he acts so mean, for no reason. I really don't buy that they were, able to work together, during the action scenes. Sorry. While, the film is less violence than in many other Marvel-based adaptations. It's a little more, gruesome, than the other films. Near the end, there are tons of multiple deaths, some of them fairly gory. Still, the action is very limited and short. It was very disappointing. Not much, entertainment value there. The film's visual effects are fairly mediocre. The Thing never quite looks like anything other than a CGI character, lacking the more photorealistic quality other films finally managed to achieve with other monster-like characters. I didn't care, that he was nude, like other critics, did. I didn't find it, jarring. After all, there are tons of nude monster superheroes. I also didn't mind, the negative zone AKA Planet Zero's visual effects. They were pretty good. I also didn't mind, that Dr. Doom wanted to control it. I just wish, they make Dr. Doom look better. Why didn't they listen to lot of complaints that Doom looks like a homeless person wearing burned trash bags after his transformation. I do have to complain that the \"metallic face\" look, doesn't work. Just give him, a mask! In my opinion, I have to agree with some people claiming he looked like a crash test dummy. He was by far, the worst thing in the film. One thing, that I had to disagree with the critics and some fans, is their hatred for the casting of African American actor Michael B. Jordan's for the traditionally-Caucasian Human Torch. I found those critics to be suffering from a big case of xenophobe. There is nothing wrong with this casting. Some critics argued that he received the role because he was friends with the director, but I think, it was based solely on his acting ability. Plus, I think the movie made a good explanation of why Sue Storm looks so different, from Johnny. Anyways, I do have to say, the actor, Reg E. Cathey playing their father, Franklin Storm, did an amazing job, in his limited role. One person that didn't live up to his role is the director. The film was shot in overall claustrophobic environment. It looks like it was shot almost entirely inside a dark storage unit. It didn't help that Josh Trank show up, drunk and high, during filming. During production, he was very combative and abusive toward the cast, producers, and crew. Plus, there is no end-credit-scene in this movie or a cameo of Stan Lee. WTF! Director Josh Trank outburst after the film's release, following the rumored incredibly Troubled Production, probably severely damage this film. A sequel was officially slated, long before the film was even released. However, plans may change after the movie was hit with extremely negative critical reception from critics and audiences alike and an absolutely bad opening weekend. Overall: Fant4stic isn't unwatchable or that awful. It's just really mundane, and devoid of any fun. Marvel's First Family deserves better.",

First off there's no other way to describe this movie, this movie is horrible. The story,the pacing, the action,the writing, just everything about this movie was bad. Even the CGI at times was very awful. Now I will say that at certain times, it was very interesting but those certain scenes only lasted a few moments. The acting also was good by everyone but you can see that they were doing the best they could do in a bad movie. It wasn't there fault. Now the action... Well there's sort of no action. The trailer shows that there will be a lot of action, but the scenes in the trailer are not even in the movie. There are maybe 1 or 2 action scene in the whole movie and they don't even last that long. The biggest problem I had with the movie was the pacing. The pacing was very odd and it jumped forward in time too many times. The final battle also didn't feel right, it felt rushed like they didn't know how to finish the movie. Overall Fantastic four was a huge disappointment. It had no fun, took its self way to serious. I Definitely don't recommend seeing it in theaters.",

Turns out Fox's new Fantastic Four is incredibly frustrating. The movie had a lot of things going for it. The cast is incredible, they might not have been the ones I would have pictures in these roles, but they are still talented and interesting actors. The way they approached the characters and their relationships was also interesting and it sort of made sense to me. The fact that they were all outsiders in their own way, them being wickedly smart and kind of awkward was an idea that I could have lived with. There's also the \"scaryish\" elements in the movie that I liked. It felt like they were monsters, they were strange, and all of these ideas were potentially good ones but the execution was botched.The pace was so F-ing slow for two third of the movie, and once there's a little bit of action it ends. At times it was obvious that some scenes were cut short, some bits of dialogues annoyed the hell out me. Fox had all of the right ingredients to make an awesome movie but they sorely missed. If we look at the bright, among other things, you can use this movie showcase the importance of editing. @wornoutspines",

            "content": "Ugh. Just bad. Really really bad. You can tell that Fox totally tinkered with Josh Trank's take on the Fantastic 4. I just don't understand why a Fantastic 4 film is so difficult to make. Obviously a movie is a different medium from a comic, but the comics are right there as a template, and Fox Studios just keeps disregarding it. It's a shame cause despite all the negative reaction and the dumb look of Doctor Doom, the trailers had me sold into the film. You hardly care about any of the characters in this movie. It's exposition layered upon exposition. Sure there are some moments where they do have moments but ultimately choppy editing and storytelling dismisses everything that is remotely positive about this film. There are moments when the story is just starting to kick in, but it keeps cutting away and away. The narrative does not flow eloquently at all. It's very scrambled, especially after they receive their powers. Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, and Jamie Bell are solid actors, but they are barely developed and their talents can't even disguise the stink that is this movie. I did however sort of liked Reg E. Cathy as Franklin Storm, there was some down to Earth-ness about him that sort of put the movie together in a way. Now lets talk about Doctor Doom. They failed him so bad. He is arguably one of Marvel's greatest villain, at least in the top five and they just cannot get him right. It's insulting. Tim Story director of the first two Fantastic 4 films did a better job representing Victor von Doom than Trank and Fox. Wrap your head around that. He just appears out of nowhere and is suddenly evil and also gains powers that are far more powerful than of the core four without any explanation, did I also mention he looks flat out dumb. Toby Kebbell is a fine actor, but just like the others he's wasted and dull. Keep in mind this is a short movie. Surprised that it was, and it was missing key sequences that we saw in the trailers. This movie definitely needed more time to pave things in gently so that there is a natural feel to the story. If you thought that the first two acts were bad, the third act is just unbearable. You see the world sort of in peril, but you don't care cause you're not invested in anything. The visuals aren't terrible, in fact I really liked the display of superpowers, and how the Human Torch and the Thing looked, although the Thing could have used some pants. That's one thing I can say positively about. As of now it has an outstanding 9% on rottentomatoes. Somewhere Kevin Feige and Marvel Studios are smiling. That doesn't mean they'll get the rights back obviously, cause it's all on Fox's hand and it's their property, but I do think it makes the chances higher. Potentially. Having said that I think this proves that the behind the scenes drama was fact not a rumor, director Josh Trank also deleted his tweet about how Fox messed with his version, but think about this, I don't believe for one second that the studio messed with his version of the film for the sake of messing with it. I think it ultimately comes down to two reasons. Firstly, Fox probably wanted it to be more marketable and more comic-book oriented, or they just weren't that impressed. Secondly the test audience, if there was a screening prior to the reshoots, then people probably did not like it anyway which prompted Fox to make all those changes. So perhaps even if they didn't touch Trank's version, it may have been still bad, meaning this project was doomed from the start. Save your money, there are better films out there. A good Fantastic 4 film can be made, it's been done before, and it's called The Incredibles. At this point, Fox have three strikes on their Fantastic 4 property, let them go home, they deserve and belong to be in the MCU they'd fit and gel so perfectly. When the MCU reaches it's end with Thanos in Phase 3, who's better to top Thanos or match him in Phase 4 than the Skrulls, Annihilus, Doctor Doom, Silver Surfer, or Galactus himself. Fittingly it deserves a 4/10",

In any case; it was an entertaining movie with decent commercial success. Sadly the sequel did not hit the proper mark and felt short compared with the first movie. It seems Marvel / Disney correct errors by changing everything instead of trying to find out why it did not perform properly; but they do it without the proper quality control so things get really worse. This main problem is that the movie is boring; nothing interesting happens until near the end and it is too lazy written and full of commonplaces that you know what is happening even with your yes closed. The second problem is that the incompetent directing, writing and editing pretty much limited the performances of Miles Teller to an unsympathetic character, Jaime Bell (a great actor) to just a few lines he does not even look very convinced (and later to a CGI character that barely speaks) and Tobby Kebbel as a joke of a bad guy (also later to another inexpressive mask). The third problem is that the rest of the cast is even less interesting and they seems to know that so they looks that they were in a rush to collect their meager checks and acted accordingly. The four problem is that with all the stupid things that happens and the bad acting; the movie is overly serious and lacks any humorI believe is time to stop Marvel/Disney short and ask them to put some effort in their movies. Avengers Age of Ultron does not support a second viewing and if people are going to see Ant Man (which is almost a comedy); means they are tired of this crap and with good reason.",

            "content": "I thoroughly enjoyed it.I have always been a Fantastic 4 fan since their early comic days and when the first Fantastic 4 movie came out, I loved it. My comic heroes came alive on screen doing the things they always did.I can understand comic fans getting mad because it was probably too much of a departure from the heroes they learned to love. When I first saw the trailer, I thought: \"Oh no, these are not the Fantastic 4.\" However, when I started watching the movie, I found myself drawn into their early years growing up with their ideas and dismissal by the rest of the sane world around them but nevertheless hanging on to their dreams.Despite the slow pace of development of the plot and characters, I never felt bored, luckily I guess for the fact that I also like good drama and the deeper aspects of science fiction - teleportation, inter-dimensional travel and alien forms of life (in this case, energy or life force).I liked the way how Dr. Doom came to life and the ingenuity of the Fantastic 4 in the way they defeated him. Short, yes, it was and likely did little to satisfy action fans who went hoping to see the old Fantastic 4 in extended action or in the genre of other sci-fi action movies like the Avengers, Thor, etc. I don't blame them.I admit, however, certain parts were rushed particularly towards the end. One very obvious part is where Franklin Storm dies under the hand of Doom. It was too quick and illogical - Doom leaving the others while killing Franklin Strom with no hesitation whatsoever. That (and some other parts of the script) could have been done better. It could be keeping to a schedule to finish the film or some budgetary pressure to end the filming.Despite the faults here and there, I admit I enjoyed the movie and probably even more than the first installment as it was, yes, darker with more drama and sci-tech thrown in - a mix that appeals to me.As one reviewer put it, this movie builds a solid foundation for the future and, the way I see it, the potential for a good TV series along the lines of Minority Report.",

What am I talking about. simply by them making a choice to do nothing caused human beings to stand no chance of being. its simple 1 in the scene where doom is sucking up the world there is a road with lots of traffic next to a secret military facility 1 ya right 2 when they go to other dimension all these vehicles go to other world and get sucked into a matter to energy converter.

            "content": "Like many reboots, the latest edition of the Fantastic Four was met with hostility from both audiences and critics alike as it received some of the worst reviews of any superhero movie released since Catwoman (2004), the movie that nearly killed Halle Berry's career. For anyone paying attention to the film over the past few months, this should come as no surprise. Fantastic Four had one of the most tumultuous productions of any in recent memory. Relations between sophomore director Josh Trank and 20th Century Fox became quite miserable during production, so much so that Trank eventually boxed himself off from the crew, became completely unresponsive and essentially went crazy on set, a chain of events stemming from the massive amount of oversight that Fox lumped onto the director, stripping him of his creative freedom. Or so the story goes. Knowing all of that, there was no way I could resist buying a ticket to witness the mayhem that surely was to be the Fantastic Four reboot. Unfortunately, I wasn't disappointed. This version of the Fantastic Four follows Reed Richards (Miles Teller), a boy genius, as he invents his way into a program for the gifted through the Baxter Foundation. The team to-be assembles here as Reed meets Johnny and Sue Storm (Michael B. Jordan and Kate Mara), along with Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell). This team of whiz kids then invents the impossible: a portal into another dimension. Using the level of common sense appropriate for geniuses, the team drunkenly uses the portal without supervision, dragging Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) along with them because the filmmakers had to squeeze him in somehow, and the body horror ensues. If I'm being honest, I must admit that even though I had heard the terrible stories about the film's production, I still had hope. Trank's directorial debut, Chronicle (2012), was fantastic. It's gritty originality wasn't something often found in the superhero genre and I was hoping that would translate to Fantastic Four. Early interviews with Trank revealed that his approach to the film had similar grit to Chronicle's. He wanted to get away from the bubblegum style of Marvel's cinematic universe and really dig into the horror of being transformed into a man perpetually on fire or a man made of stone. Given the fact that the Fantastic Four is traditionally the most ridiculous of any superhero team, with their matching bright blue suits, Fantasticar, and absurdist power sets \u2013 like being able to stretch one's body endlessly \u2013 this sounded like the perfect direction to take the team. Turn the concept on its head and instead of a bunch of circus clowns, you have a group of teenagers struggling with life-altering deformations. On paper, that's a killer concept. The trick is the translation.Through the first half or so, it seemed as though that translation had worked fine. The film featured some pretty interesting ideas, a very talented cast and a reasonably well-plotted story. It didn't seem to have the capacity to be terrible. If anything, it was just boring. I just didn't get what all the fuss was about.But all of that changed rather swiftly in the final act. What was a relatively decent movie revealed itself to be a disaster cataclysmic enough to rival Pompeii. In the last fourth of the movie's run time, every facet of Fantastic Four falls to pieces. The villain, a character so shamelessly terrible that I refuse to mention his name here, ushers in this bombastic drop in quality. It's as if the ending features dialogue, plotting and special effects from an entirely different movie, one without any budget, talent or soul. However, this sudden turn for the worse wasn't planned, but was actually a result of the aforementioned clash between the director and the studio. Trank imploded before they had filmed the ending, so the conclusion was shot well after the rest of the film, and it was done so in an embarrassingly haphazard fashion. By that point in the production, Fox had dumped too much money into the film to simply abandon it, so instead of throwing it into the garbage like they should have, they finished the film. But I use the term \"finish\" very loosely. Yes, technically the Fantastic Four has an ending. But it's done so quickly and with such little finesse or attention to anything resembling quality that instead of providing an actual conclusion to the story that had been told up until that point, we are left with a horribly warped, poorly scripted anti-conclusion, something so foul that it must've come from whatever dimension that disfigured our poor heroes in the first place. So for those of you hoping that Fantastic Four in any way resembles director Trank's 2012 hit Chronicle, you will be heavily disappointed. This is a reboot that will haunt his career for a very long time.",

            "review_title": "a fiasco of mostly bland proportions (until the final 15 minutes)",
            "content": "First off, you know you screwed up when Stan Lee - who started off his iconic streak of creating characters for Marvel by revamping the Human Torch with three others into the 'First Family' - declines a cameo.I have to wonder how the director Josh Trank sold 20th Century Fox on the concept of a deathly serious take on the dopey science fiction take on the Fantastic Four (Reed Richards \"Mr. Fantastic\", Sue Storm \"The Invisible Woman\", Johnny Storm (you know who) and Ben Grimm \"The Thing\"). Perhaps it was at the time when they were once again looking at the competition - Nolan's Batman movies and his produced Man of Steel - and thought if the dark-dramatic cinematic approach could be taken with those, so too with the story of four scientists (and good old Dr. Victor Von Doom) who get affected by Gamma Rays and get their own powers. And maybe some day in the 21st century - if by some miracle it comes up again - another filmmaker can try his hands on a 'serious' Fantastic Four movie. Sadly, Trank's effort (as well as Simon Kinberg's and Fox's) makes it a nigh impossible thing to attempt much less accomplish.A thing to remember is that, unlike Batman, F4 is not really a serious series; even when things might get more serious or dangerous as in some of the Bendis/Millar Ultimate F4 comics, it's with the tone of it being kind of light. To try and adapt Cronenberg's The Fly and Scanners into a world where a character like Victor Von Doom IS a character with that name just doesn't work. How can it, unless it becomes some weird subversive joke (which this isn't)? There's perhaps one or two minor moments of levity (thanks Michael B. Jordan, one of the only actors trying here by the way despite the not-really-controversial change of color), but otherwise it has the tone of something that is as serious as the 1985 film Come and See (look it up) but is still under the banner of Fox's bland production side of things. In short, Trank screwed up his approach here, and also had a big miscast with Toby Kebbel as Victor Von Doom. Even typing that name with association to this is cringe-inducing.A big disappointment comes with the villain since, if nothing else, a compelling villain could have made things a little greater (as the convention goes, a hero is only as strong as his/her villain). But Victor Von Doom in the first act is a) only vaguely drawn as to be misanthropic and (sort of) with a crush on Sue Storm, thus some competition there from Richards, and b) he disappears for most of the film and returns looking like a rejected design from the early 90's Power Rangers show. He looks absolutely ludicrous and yet does things that should be cool in a darker context (the scanner power comes with making heads explode). But it's just silly and his plan doesn't make sense nor, especially most of all, how the Fantastic Four finally face him on the other-dimension \"Zero\" planet where they have the final (routine but hilarious) battle.But a bigger one is just, on a fundamental level, getting us to care about these characters, and that also comes from motivation issues for characters to do things: ego drives them to go on to the device that takes them to the Zero planet; Ben Grimm isn't really part of the group, is very tangential, and only comes on due to a late night phone call; the plot jumps ahead after the heroes get their powers a FULL YEAR, thus losing any growth or discovery, which is at least helpful if not essential in an origin story; there is no real 'central question' posed at the start that gets answered by the end. Reed Richards makes an invention, it gets spotted at a high school science fair (?) and that's it, off and away we go. Everything is grim, no pun intended, but I never felt the stakes or drama actually kick in, which is a major problem with the movie. And as much as Trank tries to add the atmosphere of a brooding science fiction tome, the acting from (usually solid and interesting) Miles Teller and Kate Mara is bland and not compelling.In short, watch for interest in knowing how it came out due to the production horrors behind the scenes (allegedly on the front of the director, surely from the studio once they saw what was there), and maybe get some laughs at the finale. Otherwise, beware.",

            "content": "When the initial reviews of Fantastic Four dropped, so did my jaw. A whopping 17% was what it started out with on Rotten Tomatoes. Now granted I was never excited by the film in the first place, and the trailers really didn't allow me to have much faith. Nevertheless, a seventeen percent was still a catastrophic peculiarity too hard to ignore. If the behind the scene subplot of the whole Marvel-Fox rights shenanigans didn't make me wish Fantastic Four completely fall on its face, the rumor of the detestable, extraordinary douche-bag nature of director Josh Trank during the production certainly did. Regardless of my own bias though, I was willing to walk into the theater completely open-minded to give this movie a real chance. I mean, it can't possibly be that bad, right? Wrong it can.When the last awkward scene ended and the credits began I was left dumbfounded in the theater as few of the audience member decided to inexplicably applaud. A lazy, putrid excuse disguising itself as a motion picture \u2013 this was cinema at its pessimal, aimed towards the lowest common denominator of movie goers. There's very little good thing as to say about the movie... actually... there's very little to say period. NOTHING. HAPPENS.The only thing that was scantily serviceable though was the sci-fi horror tone. Not being a big Fantastic Four fan of any medium, I wasn't as upset at the change of tone as others were. I really didn't mind the big departure from the more fun, bright and colorful tone of the comic books in favor of a more dark and gritty and horror atmosphere. While superhero horror movies has existed in forms of the Blade and Ghost Rider series, the genre crossing borders with a property such as Fantastic Four does peak certain curiosities. Not saying it necessarily worked, because nothing worked in this movie, but it was at the very least an admirable attempt.There is no \"plot\", but unfortunately there's not much in form of \"characters\" to be found either. Sure there are human beings in the movie in the flesh, they speak and breathe, but are also soulless and hollow as a pipe. The fact these are a bunch of 28 to 30-something-year-olds playing 18 makes the whole bad movie experience even more abominable. You heard that right. They're not young looking 30-somethings either, which immediately took me out of the movie just by how distracting that is.Miles Teller who plays the lead character Reed Richards, is dry and boring and looks uninterested. With reports of him and director Trank coming to set high and drunk on multiple occasions, I can understand why work would seem uninteresting in comparison. His character has zero motivation to do what he does. I for the life of me couldn't figure out the reason he wanted to build the Quantum Gate, he just does, because script. When the main character of your movie has zero motivation the rest of the movie tends to crumble. Is it so hard to create a reason for why a character strive in a narrative? I'm not even asking for all supporting characters to have motives or anything, but the lead whom is suppose to lead the story? WHAT IS THE POINT of the movie if even the lead is not trying to accomplish anything in particular? Why is he even there and why are scenes even happening? They just... do. There is no three act structure as found in real movies, only random scenes sewn together in a barely coherent way.The rest of cast seem to be phoning it in as well. Monotonous line delivery and standard acting galore from everyone involved. With a group of superheroes that are supposedly family, these people seem to be less than strangers. With the nearly 50-minutes required for the movie to give our heroes their powers, there should've been ample time for character development, but there is incomprehensibly none of it. While the screenplay written by director Trank along with Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater was aimed to be \"dark\" and \"gritty\", the dialogues sure seem more in line with the cheesiness of children's cartoons than the earnestness of The Dark Knight.Because of the randomness of events just happening, the pacing is all over the place. 90 minutes long, the movie is all buildup till the 45-minute mark when the team members finally get their powers, don't start using it until 60-minute mark, Doom doesn't show up until 75-minutes, and... it's over at 90 minutes. Just when you thought the movie can finally get started, it just abruptly ends after one of the worst-shot big-budget climatic battle ever witnessed on celluloid. The final scene with the team acting like a \"family\" when half of them never even had a moment with one another was cringe-worthy enough even if it wasn't accompanied by an obligatory \"team naming\" scene that was nothing short of an abysmal embarrassment for everybody involved.Say whatever you want about bad superhero movies like Batman & Robin, but at least they know they're bad and we can watch them and laugh at it and be entertained; Fantastic Four actually takes itself seriously. I have a rule, if you want to be a movie that's serious and devoid of humor, then you just HAVE TO BE good. If we can't laugh, you can't bore us to tears and be horrible at the same time. Unfortunately, that is exactly what Fantastic Four achieved. Please go see this so you can experience what watching an awful big-budget collage of moving images feels like, but don't pay for it because giving Fox your money will just accidentally encourage a sequel that nobody wants. If a film like Ant-Man is cheesecake \u2013 sweet, enjoyable and full of flavor, then Fantastic Four is cardboard \u2013 sterile, rough and indigestible.",

Reid (Miles Teller of the Insurgent movies) was the catalyst in the transport device's ability to work while Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell; Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) was the one who designed it. Susan Storm (Kate Mara; Iron Man 2 and Transcendence) is a genius in patterns, understanding them enough that she lends her expertise in catching Reid when he flees from the science facility to hide. Johnny Storm (Michael Jordan) is the rebellious genius son of the transport device project figurehead, Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E Cathey). Reid will have limbs that can stretch, Johnny will be able to turn his body into a flaming inferno at will, Reid's neighbor buddy, Ben (Jamie Noble), who he invited to join him in a trip in the teleport machine once it is successfully able to do what it was built for--inter-dimensional travel--is transformed into a giant rock monster (rocks and the source of the \"zero planet\" that can chance the bodies of humans on it enter the teleportation pod he is in, with Ben unable to close the door). Susan can cloak herself in invisibility and use a type of forcefield as protection or weapon if need be. Victor travels to the other planet, decides he'd like to see up close it energy source, eventually being carried into it, with his protection suit melding into his body as it is provided powers that can implode folks by merely willing it.I get why this film is so poorly received. It is so much origin story (and not even exciting origin story) and not a lot of \"superhero teams fights villainous heavy\". It builds and builds to an unsatisfying and rather lackluster conclusion due to how little we get of Dr. Doom. Doom in the comics is a badass villain. He causes the heroes a lot of trouble. In this film, he's some sad sack genius in love with Susan, with no charisma or grandiosity. When he returns from the other planet, he does some cool damage to a bunch of military and scientists, making them all explode from the inside like a scanner or causes their skin to roast before returning to his \"new home\", addressing his disdain for the government by enforcing a type of black hole device to suck Earth through a portal created by the teleport device. It's much too late by the time this happens, and really causes very little carnage overall to the people of Earth or destruction besides a giant crater in one wilderness spot. The \"joining forces\" of the 4 against doom, realizing that separately they are not capable but as a unit they can, culminates in a lot of CGI on a dark, rocky planet. This whole battle is like maybe ten minutes. This is a film truncated from a much larger film we haven't seen yet. Fox needs to put out Trank's film if just to allow us to see for ourselves if his version is better. It can't be much worse than this dour, ever so serious (where's the fun???) super hero movie without the superhero action fans are expecting to see. The cast might can be salvaged if they are given a much better film. Doom should have been a surefire winner as a villain if cast correctly and given more to do than rest easy on another planet. Instead we spend a majority of the film with scientists designing the damned transport (what is this, The Fly?) and getting used to their abilities. I think this origin story mentality is killing reboots. The Amazing Spiderman is such an example. I don't know where the Fantastic Four franchise goes from here, but it is in dire need of a changing of hands to another studio. This was a damned good comic book and is worthy of the right kind of treatment. Even the \"other planet\" looks like something out of Star Trek 3.",

I didn't delve into the reasons why it was bad because I wanted to give the movie a clean shot. It was terrible. The film seemed like a long TV pilot episode that should never for any reason see the light of air time or ever be considered to develop. The dark story that the film was going for didn't work out. The movie was only an hour and forty minutes. There was no time to focus and develop characters and story. It seemed as if the movie had scenes that were haphazardly cut together without any sort of flow or structure. The director Josh Tank (Chronicle) made this look like a comic geek's student film with a big budget. Tank came out and said that the studio forced harsh restrictions on him, but even if this movie was an hour longer I don't think it would help. Not only is the story terrible the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The actors in this film seemed hollow and shallow. Since the dialogue is so bad I don't think they were given anything to work with.Now the one thing I read that gave the movie some credit was it's special effects. There was one scene, the new dimension, that had decent effects and you see it in the trailer. The rest looked like today's CGI techniques were used on a Windows 95.While Fantastic Four had potential to be another great superhero flick it failed disastrously. What the film ultimately lacked was direction and plot. The story felt forced and chopped together; and, the actors seemed unable to bring energy to their characters with the dialogue. The CGI wasn't good and there's not much left to have any positives. Some of it was entertaining but it was far from fantastic.",

However some of the back story seemed a little ridiculous such as young child discovering telleportation and making a device out of scrap. I found the cast to be a little young to be believable. The whole backstory around about how they gained the powers was a little bit silly - green goo - creativity seemed to be lacking. I feel Dr Doom was portrayed quite well and was very threatening however his on screen presence was too short and he was defeated too quickly to build up any real threat. I felt they rushed the ending and I am not sure why.

At least Jamie Bell has the decency to hide behind CGI for the small sections of the movie where he bothers to show up.The title is a mess. There are 5 of them, that much is obvious from the trailer. Also the Fantastic part just never happens. The clues were obvious in the trailers though. Some of the quotes change between trailers, so it is clear something funny was going on. In the end result most of the quotes in the three trailers are not even in the film. The few that survive in their trailed versions are used completely out of context in the trailer. I can completely understand why Stan Lee doesn't appear in the movie. He must be so utterly disgusted at what was done to his work that he wanted to distance himself from it.

In the comic Thor always wears an helmet and transforms into Dr Blake which is not the case in the movies There is less action in this movie compared to other comic movies like Iron Man 3 which is the worst Marvel movie devoid of any any reality, a leave your brain at home movie, action is there for action sake not to advance the story.This film gives you gradual build up of excitement little teasers providing you with a snapshot of each character and how they get to where they are, reaching a big explosion of excitement and action at the end.The characters are more believable.

            "content": "Fantastic Four is directed by Chronicle's Josh Trank and stars Miles Teller, Jamie Bell, Michael B. Jordan, and Kate Mara.This is the third attempt at a Fantastic Four film within the past decade. The first two films are major disappointments to say the least. When news surfaced about a new try at the superhero squad, I couldn't help but get a little excited. Marvel fans had not seen a well done Fantastic Four movie yet. Fox-Marvel had just released a well received X-Men: Days of Future Past and it seems like the studio had everything together. With a talented cast and up and coming director working on the title, it looked as if fans would finally be treated to a good Fantastic Four movie.However, everything seemed to go completely wrong. Fantastic Four is without a doubt the worst superhero film I have ever seen. The film misses the mark on every element of a superhero flick.I was a little worried about this film after seeing how there is a \"4\" in the title, which comes off trying to be creative. Adding a number in your title is not a good sign. It may sound like a good idea at first, but in reality it actually just messes up the title. Then news dropped that there were some major controversies behind the camera making this film. This is really present in this uninspired film because it appears that no one had fun at all making this film. All the actors in Fantastic Four look as if they just want to leave the set and be done with the project. A very important goal for a superhero flick should be to make the viewer want to be the title hero; just like a kid. This makes the audience interested in the character and care about what lies ahead for the protagonist. Some of the characters in this movie are so horribly developed that no possible interest is sparked in their story arch. Speaking of story arch, I don't think there was a single one in this movie. No characters had to overcome anything or prove themselves. It is just skipped over completely by a \"1 year later\" title. Why would they do that? They complete ignored how the characters felt about their powers. The closest the film comes to that is with the Thing. Sadly, it is not investigated enough for it to be a plot point. The movie fails horribly having no real story. It's just one scene after the other of honestly nothing compelling whatsoever. The team obtains their powers and that's what the main focus of this movie really is. It's almost as if they forgot to add a threat to the movie.This leads to my next point, Dr. Doom. This villain is so horribly underdeveloped that it's almost like he is just thrown into the movie randomly. There is no motive or logic behind why he wants destruction caused. Fantastic Four is just a build up to an eventual sequel. Fox is so focused on having a strong money making franchise that they forget to make the movie actually watchable. The studio makes the mistake of not having a good beginning entry to the franchise to make an audience want to return to the world again in a sequel. It almost comes off as a parody with some horribly executed and terribly cheesy scenes. The film tries so hard to take itself seriously that its embarrassing. The movie was made just so Fox could keep the characters away from Marvel. No effort or care is put into the final product. It's sad that Fox made that clearly obvious with this dull and uninteresting superhero movie. I thought it was impossible to make a superhero movie not fun, and Fantastic Four proves me wrong.",

Take your comic book loving self back to 2005, expectations were high, we as a society were still blissfully unaware of the horror, the horror to come in X3(6.8) and Spider-man 3(6.2). Electra (4.8) was fresh off the flop pile, but female leads have always been a detriment in a male centric story world. Fantastic Four was received with mixed reviews. It was stuck somewhere between the matter of factness of the fist two X-Men films and the childish cartoon days of the 1990s, and 1970s, and I think the 1980s as well. All in all it is watchable for a comic fan or someone with an especially specific social or emotional tie to the film, but in comparison to the 2015 reboot, it is laughable as an artifact in an evolving genre. 4th - As to the 2015 Film This is an origin story. The story is a linear one, as appose to something like Man of Steel(7.2). The majority of the story takes place when all of the main characters are of an early college age, 18-25ish. This is an origin story. After the Four get their powers some time is spent using them to solve the greater and lesser problems of people on earth. Some of these problems are cause by Dr Doom. This is pretty much what we all learned from the trailers, and the general plot is similar to the 2005 and 1994 films, and every comic book with Dr Doom in it. Except for the one time where he may or may not have saved a kitten. The characters are well developed, gritty and true to their world and the events in it. I have recommended the film to everyone that I have met since seeing it. Even though I went into the film with firm reservations, I feel like this is the best Fantastic Four Movie that could be made outside of Marvel Studios.

Jamie Bell is terrible as Ben Grimm AKA 'The Thing.' They could've at least affected his voice in some way to deepen it and make it sound Thing-like, but they didn't. So we're left with a normal, puny voice coming out of a hunk of CGI crap. It doesn't read as 'real,' it regrettably reads as 'this is a temporary track while we work on the real ADR.' The actor who plays Doom also suffers from this baffling creative choice. He sounds like a stuffy Englishman imitating an American accent, not Dr. Doom! Cheap VFX -- The Human Torch's flight scenes (all TWO of them!) are awful. He looks like unrendered CGI. The Thing looks cartoony. And Mr. Fantastic's stretchability looks like something out of The Mask -- a movie that's more than twenty years old. Planet Zero looked like something out of a generic video game. And why mess with Doom's design? He looks awesome in the comics, and in the other movies, why make him look like a Power Rangers villain in this version? VFX company for this should be banned from making any more movies.Terrible script -- not sure if this is the editor's fault, or the writer's, but the origin is all screwed up. Why not have Sue teleport with them? Her gaining her invisibility --a staple of this franchise!-- is a tacked-on afterthought. She gets it from the shockwave once they return? Then why doesn't the whole city turn invisible? They were hit by the very same shockwave she was! But, no. So idiotic.Once the Four get their trademark powers, do we spend time with them? Do we witness their pain, their confusion, the fallout from their experiment gone wrong? Do we watch them cope with these supernatural changes to their bodies and react in horror? Nope. Not even close. We get a title card that says 'One year later' and we skip over what could have been a section of interesting scenes in favor of a lame military subplot with The Thing being used as a Special Ops weapon.But what about the action, you ask? Surely, that must be fun to watch? NO. There's literally ONE ACTION SCENE in the whole movie and it lasts about a minute and a half. It's the worst and most anti-climactic CBM battle ever put to film. It lacks stakes. We don't have enough visual information to process what threats the F4 (finally grouped together as the super team we recognize) face on 'Planet Zero,' so we're just staring at muddled pixels of CGI as the actors clumsily float around on wires to defeat Dr. Doom using 'teamwork,' I guess? Or punching? It's honestly as dumb as it sounds. They kind of work together to get the Torch to do something and Reed to distract him, and Sue to do nothing, so The Thing can punch Doom.That's it. That's not only their big SOLE action scene, it's also their big ticket climax. What a joke.Just rent the older ones with Jessica Alba. At least those movies --while flawed and forgettable-- understood that you need to... A) have the team fight together and learn how to work together, B) show each team member experiencing their changes, learning how to use their powers, C) understand Doom's motives and watch the team face him, and D) end the movie with a climactic battle that lasts longer than 90 seconds.Thanks for nothing, Fox.",

            "content": "I honestly can't believe I'm going to say this, I never thought the day will come when I say that Batman & Robin is no longer the worse superhero movie ever made after seeing this movie, but the difference between the two is that at least Batman & Robin was fun to watch and not depressingly dull that Fan4stic was. The story is about a contemporary take on the classic super-hero team - four young scientist are involved in an experiment where they find themselves teleported to another dimension. When they return, they find themselves gifted with unique powers - ones they will have use to stop an evil rising to power. It's been 10 years now since the 2005 \"Fantastic Four\" was first release. Looking back on that film is like looking back on a bad memory that you wish will fade away. The 2005 movie wasn't all that good, but to me it wasn't on the same level as Batman & Robin as some people think. Rise of the Sliver Surfer was the squeal that nobody asked for but they're made anywhere because...well I don't know they just did. The squeal wasn't all that great just like the first movie, but the movie itself wasn't like the worse thing on the planet as some people have make it out to be. I'm not going to talk about the 1994 movie because it's not worth it. Now here's 20th Century Fox fourth attempt of making a Fantastic Four movie. We got a new director and a new cast to start off fresh and try to make a new franchise. Many people didn't react very well to the news of a reboot and people got even more mad at the new cast and the fact that they young and Michael B. Jordan was cast as Johnny Storm. I was the only one giving this movie a chance as I believed that Josh Trank will make a great Fantastic Four movie and make us forget the other ones as Josh Trank is a good director. But it's not until I sawed the movie myself and my jaw was on the floor not because the movie was amazing, but how god awful this movie was. Fantastic Four (Or best known as Fan4stic from the posters) is one of the worse superhero movies of the year and of all time. I heard a lot of bad things coming from director Josh Trank. Some people who have worked with him on this movie have openly said that he was awkward to work with and at one point he actually came on set drunk and intoxicated while filming a scene. The problems that happened behind the scenes really do show in this movie, as I can tell they did some re shoots as Kate Mara hair keeps changing color in a couple of scenes. I blame the studious for changing a lot of things and making it a living hell for the director and the cast. Josh Trank is best known for directing Chronicle and that movie was a smallish movie that Josh Trank had a lot of freedom to work on with and at least they're wasn't any studious coming in and changing things and making it really hard for everyone else. It's very clearly that Josh Trank wasn't ready for something big like this as he was originally suppose to direct the upcoming Star Wars movie but dropped out because he had enough. The biggest opportunity that was wasted was the cast. They didn't do a terrible job as they characters but they didn't do anything special and that's a real shame as these are great actors that had nothing to do in this movie. The visual effects in this movie are probably some of the worse looking effects I've seen since the early 90's and it's quite shocking that this movie with a lot of money behind it and have such awful looking effects. The CGI used on The Thing was completely hideous and I kind of miss the 2005 Thing a little bit. Some people may like the CGI used on The Thing but I didn't. These a shot in the movie where Reed Richards after he gets his super power stretches his face to look like someone else to be in disguise, when he puts his normal face back and the CGI used in that one shot looked laughably bad. There wasn't a single shot in this movie that didn't even look convincing. Now lets talk about Dr. Doom in this movie or I like to call him Mr. Freeze number 2, because Dr. Doom is this movie was a complete joke and he wasn't in the movie that much, he just turned up towards the end of the movie. Dooms motivation in this movie was pretty random and wasn't well written at all. Before Victor turns into \"Doom\" the only character development that we got from his character is that he thinks he's smarter than ever one else and he just hates people...WHAT!. The way Dr. Doom looks in this movie is so freaking awful, I mean he looks like that robot from Superman 3, but if put a black bin bag around it and set it on fire and let it dry out a bit, then you add some Christmas lights around it and now you got Dr. Doom. The final battle scene with Doom and The Fantastic Four is only five minutes long, yes I actually timed it to see how long it was and it was too short and disappointing.",

There was a disconnect through the cast but it was understandable as most of them had a troubling past in the movie and this was the first time they were forced to work together. A lot of the comments for this movie are negative but they are comparing the story to old school fantastic four when the movie, from the beginning, clearly highlights that this movie takes place in a very modern place. Many of the negative criticism is about the movie not being funny enough i liked the new direction they took, it was freaky at times to watch the F4 being exploited. The movie wasn't catered to the critics or angry fanboy who were already furious that the movie was going to be based on the UF4 and that they were changing Johnny ethnicity. Ultimately only the audience can decide whether they liked the movie instead of relying on others to decide for them.",

            "content": "There isn't just one thing wrong with this movie. I don't know why Marvel has continuously failed to milk the Fantastic Four cow so far. I came to know Fox had something to do with this reboot, but hello! why not give everything back to Marvel that actually happens to have the golden goose and is on a super hit spree? The movie kicks off really well. By the time things reach its peak, where it actually matters it begins to dwindle. True colors of the flick are revealed when the director chooses to take a time jump instead of catching the heat of the moment. From there, right there! things go downhill.SPOILERS AHEAD: It had somehow managed to nail inter-dimensional teleportation bit. The science made a silent promise to bring in characters like Galactus and the Silver Surfer in the long run, which appeared promising. But alas! Everything hit rock bottom when important scenes for e.g the trauma right after the change, finding about their power, and the science behind it etc. were simply skipped. Trank decided to go without the crucial scenes of the movie. That being said, editing was pathetic. Even the visual effects didn't appear out of the world. Sue Storm's power looked weirdly animated. Trank spent a lot of time building the characters in the first half that he forgot to cash in on them in the remaining, when they actually get their powers. When he was really supposed to hit home run, he decided to take a walk and that too a very mediocre one.There is this scene where Johnny Storm takes out a drone which looks absolutely unreal and pathetic. It looked more like a video game. Likewise, couldn't help but yawn at Reed's and The Thing's fight scenes. There is really no focus in the movie, or a score that would rivet you, force you to pay attention.Trying really hard to look at the bright side: One dialogue about scientists being overshadowed by people who are put to test was pretty good though. The world remembers only the pioneers who actually step into someone ideas, who wear the suits and not the brains behind it. Also, Doom's entrance and aftermath looks dope when he bursts open heads. Sheer gore there! The screenplay is poorly written. It was really disgusting to see the whole team struggle to get to their group name eventually. Where is the subtlety? You can pass this one, but if you are really curious you can still give it a go. Not really that bad as they say.You can also read my reviews at straightfromamovie.com",

            "content": "\"Fantastic Four\" is one of the most middling superhero films in recent memory, uniformly bleak, and not in a good way, drearily slow despite being such a short film, and entirely uninvolving, despite four proved charismatic actors at the forefront. The smothering sameness that carries through every shot, combined with the lack of any attachment to the four characters on-screen makes for a redundant, plodding excursion that drains nearly all the wonder out of the superhero formula and replaces it with soulless characters and a tired focus on the science.The plot: nearly lifelong friends Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) have been working on a prototype teleporter since they were in elementary school, and, upon showing it off at a science fare, attracted the attention of Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), the leading director of a government-sponsored research facility for the young and brilliant known as the Baxter Foundation. Reed and Ben work alongside a scientist known as Sue Storm (Kate Mara) and a technician known as Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) to create \"Quantum Gate,\" a more advanced teleporter crafted by Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell), which has the ability to teleport people to different dimensions.After a night of drinking to celebrate Quantum Gate's success, Reed, Ben, Johnny, and Victor decided to test out the invention and subsequently wind up being in a life-threatening situation in a totally different dimension of the universe. All but Victor return safely, thanks to the help of Sue, but the remaining survivors all exhibit some physical deformity. Reed is left able to stretch any limb of his body without limits, Sue is left with the capabilities to turn invisible, Johnny can make himself engulfed in flames at the blink of an eye, and Ben is left a towering monster made up of rocks. Together, the four grapple with their newfound powers in the midst of squaring off against Dr. Doom.The immediate problem with \"Fantastic Four\" is its pacing. It's the type of film that seems so focused on future installments that it forgets to operate in the present. We get a drearily paced origins story, amidst meticulous emphasis on the science behind teleporting, that writers Trank, Jeremy Slater, and Simon Kinberg forget to make what's occurring in the present of any interest. With that, upon the four heroes receiving their powers, Trank chooses to focus on the individual person being examined for their ailments, all while not adding any additional character development nor meaningful interaction with them whatsoever. It's as if we're arms length away from the characters, their agony, and their personalities at all time's and that arm's length stretches almost as far as Mr. Fantastic's arm can.You may remember Trank's directorial debut \"Chronicle,\" which rocked the box office back in 2012, making Trank amongst one of the few young directors to merit the honor of topping the box office with their first film. \"Chronicle\"'s bleak nature, which housed found footage, superhero, and action film tendencies, was a brilliantly entertaining picture, and, to his credit, Trank replicates that sort of intriguingly dreary world, where everything seems melancholic. The problem is he fails to capitalize off of the environment, so the film carries this emptiness in the realm of why the environment is so ugly and the cinematography so dingy throughout the whole picture. It's a nice aesthetic, but with nothing juxtaposed or defined, it's as empty as the characters at hand.However, the rushed quality \"Fantastic Four\" bears is the ultimate nail-in-the-coffin. At ninety-five minutes, this is hardly an introduction but almost a prequel to the characters, ostensibly made up of odds and ends found on the cutting room floor. It's like watching a board game being set up before your eyes and, once every little thing is meticulously placed and every rule is read, the game is put back into a box to be open another day.The fact that gifted actors like Teller and Jordan and a clearly ambitious director like Trank signed onto \"Fantastic Four\" indicates that, at one point, there was a glimmer of hope for a franchise built around four unique characters with superhuman capabilities. That glimmer, however, with the looks of this finished product, has withered to little other than an agonizingly slow superhero film that make for the genre's worst in recent memory.",

            "content": "It is an incredible age for the comic book fan. Obscure characters are finally managing their way to the big and small screen, and obviously certain companies are grossing large amounts of money because they have put the right talent and creators to work on these mega franchises. Unfortunately \"Fantastic Four\" still remains to be done right, especially with the respect it deserves. I don't really wish to dive into what has been reported as a wealth of behind the scene problems, but in the end how could you not be frustrated with the resulting picture?Of course early trailers promised a much younger cast and some controversial casting choices, more importantly however it offered some very drastic storyline decisions that was sure to disappoint hard core fans of the comic book series. None of this ever really bothered me, I just wanted to see the characters done justice and see something with more edgier material than 20th Century Fox's last two outings. The comic itself was more Science-Fiction than Super Hero to begin with, and by the time of this movies release every actor had gone on to receive great acclaim in other projects. Director Josh Trank had already shown great confidence with 2012's \"Chronicle\", displaying great camera movements in a genre that doesn't really lend itself to much (Found footage to me has many ups and downs). The first 20 minutes reaffirms that Trank can confidently work in this genre fine, so just how bad could it all get?Well it wasn't screened early to critics and the cast hadn't seen it, that's a good sign right? Child prodigy Reed Richards, introduces new friend Ben Grimm to a machine he has built that can transport small items he believes to somewhere else on the planet. Cut to seven years later, shady government scientists decide to recruit Richards (Now played by Miles Teller) to perfect his device that is actually capable of something much more special. This scenario introduces Susan Storm (Kate Mara), Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) and Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell), who will help construct the device that will obviously lead to the powers we all know and love (Ben Grimm later played by Jamie Bell, just kind of fits into place somewhere).Again, while the first 20-30 minutes moves along at a brisk pace, the film slowly builds towards a disappointing 2nd act, to an absolute abysmal 3rd that manages to do something special most bad movies make me do. I reassessed everything from the beginning and saw that there was no real development between characters, and no great events that made me feel connected to these people as a family unit. No depths explored enough when it came to their predicaments, and the effects were so awful the first 20th Century Fox movies actually offered more in terms of action and payoff (I cannot believe that the shallow 2005 movie is actually better than the darker re-imagining a decade later).To explore a little bit of the controversy, Fox had reportedly cut 3 big important action scenes and most clips of the trailers don't actually appear in the final product. The editing of this movie is so atrocious the re-shoots of Kate Mara's many wigs and hairstyles are blatantly forced into scenes that obviously don't match. I don't know who was responsible for wanting to hit the 1 hour 40 minute mark so poorly, but I would sit through more of anything just to stretch out what was again a horrendously rushed final battle where Doctor Doom himself acted and looked ridiculous (Seriously, one of the worst costume designs ever created for a film, and I thought the concept of his space suit fusing to him was a good idea). The final script was also atrocious, cutting some many promising first draft ideas by Jeremy Slater. Whatever dialogue remains is poorly executed among characters and actors I slowly became less interested in as the movie progressed. Doom became evil for the sake of doing so, and Reed fled because he was afraid, but coming back a year later (I.e. captured) was enough for Ben and everyone to ultimately forgive him (Who knew?). I could go on forever, but what I will say that I enjoyed about this mess is that the directing was good at the beginning, the music by Marco Beltrami & Philip Glass worked wonders, and the David Cronenberg-ish \"body horror\" moments were actually very well done and the best thing about all this.Final Verdict: I don't know who is to blame for this mess, but this is just unacceptable and the critics have spoken. Obviously money has been lost as a result, and I hope that it wakes someone up at Fox to realise that your audience demands more from this stuff nowadays. Of course I was upset as enough was marketed to me to hope for the best, but to not put a substantial amount of footage you marketed in a trailer a month before release into the final product, you have essentially LIED to everyone (I cannot recall a current movie that has ever done that, and that is this movies downfall). Just watching the film it felt like I was in the editing room watching 30% of footage quickly clumped together. It's broken, lazy and falls apart in every aspect. 2/10. I hate being mean, but everyone involved in the production is better than this. Grab a shotgun and take this movie round the corner Fox.",

I took warnings on the previous from my friends but when I saw the trailer for this film I decided I had to see it. What the trailer refuses to mention in that the 2.5-3 min trailer is about all there is worth watching.It starts off like a lot of good superhero flicks, the origins of the heroes. It starts off good but at a certain point, you would like to see the actual heroes in a hero movie. Instead you probably get about 85% of the way through before they even get their \"powers\" let alone start to use them.Past this there is so much more bad throughout this film, not the least of which is the acting, fight scenes, special effects or script, basically any part of movie making was butchered in this film.

I was engrossed in the story, it was slow but as you can imagine, it is the case with almost all origin stories. This was not meant to be a one hit wonder. It was clearly meant to be a series of movies and this was just the start of it all. If given a chance, the sequel (which is highly doubtful now) could have possibly been much better. A good example of this would be the X-Men movies. I found the first X-Men Movie to be quite slow with very little character development and a slow plot with a few great effect here and there. The second X-Men movie (X2) however, absolutely blew me away.We are so quick to judge and dismiss but you can see that they were at least trying to entertain us and I for one although not overly entertained nevertheless was entertained and I'm the kind of person who can't keep his eyes on the screen if I find a movie boring withing the first 10 minutes.I did not go for it in the Cinema and I'm glad I didn't.

            "content": "This is the fourth attempt, counting the unreleased 1994 version, to give one of Marvel's most popular superhero teams, The Fantastic Four, a live action feature; and among these installments, Fantastic Four (2015) seems to have its very own vision, though being overly criticized by comic book fans about casting Johnny Storm, who is traditionally a white blonde, with an African American actor and the age of Reed Richards and Ben Grimm are the youngest, which is a total contrary from the comics. But these gripes are nonsense compared to the faults of the actual film. The movie takes a lot of time making sense out of its absurd science which will lead to an origin that rather feels forced, thus fails making an at least engaging superhero movie.Most of the first half focuses on a science experiment about traveling to another dimension which happens to be the source of their powers. So far, this makes for an intriguing premise talking about the importance of their nonsensical science, but also ties in with a friendship between Richards and Grimm and some issue about the Storm family. In theory, this is supposed to represent youth or family or whatever and we could somehow see where this is going. But the movie hardly explores this potential and just skims the narrative right after they gain their superpowers. It doesn't let these characters shine and just hangs them as nothing more than potentials. But what really ruined the experience is how horribly contrived the whole superhero elements are. The story is so reserved from actual story or character development, even the plot jumps an entire year and assuming that a lot has happen, except we rarely felt anything happened at all.And so, the movie just forces itself to be a superhero movie, forcing the team to work together as the villain who immediately goes evil almost destroys the world out of nowhere. These are supposed to be what we're seeking for here, but it's just too shoehorned to appreciate. There is supposed to be some subtext that we should rather concentrate here, but again, the storyline is unable to keep focus. And it's disappointing, while it's trying to be gritty or epic or awesome or what else; this is supposed to be an opportunity for this team to have actual fighting. Observe, the other movies made them do nothing else than team work, which is nice, but only few had any real fighting, which is today's appeal to superhero movies, and the superpowers of these guys doing actual fighting may look pretty cool on screen. But again, it's all shoehorned, because it is supposed to represent something about their powers that the movie also failed to explain.The action scenes are either rushed or just around the edges being expositions, which is odd for an era of larger and much explosive superhero films. People might call it \"refreshing\" for focusing more depth than bloated action. It's understandable, but depth is really nonexistent in this movie, and depth cannot be mistaken with over- serious. The cast has a lot of real talents, but doesn't quite shine here. Miles Teller can be a solid Reed Richards and the first act does hint some intrigue, but then the movie lacks the depth and even forgets about this character as he is given a sudden lone adventure in the middle act. Kate Mara suffers with an underwritten Sue Storm. Michael B. Jordan can bring levity, but there isn't much about this Johnny Storm either. Ben Grimm is a more vulnerable character here and Jamie Bell does live up to that definition, but again, the movie lacks depth. Toby Kebbell can be sinister, but Doctor Doom here looks too ridiculous and ugly to take seriously. Tim Blake Nelson is another good talent wasted and Reg E. Cathey is made robotic by generic preachy dialogue.Fantastic Four forgets how to be superhero movie. I'm not sure what the movie is exactly trying to say to the audience, but much like the action, everything seems rushed and underdeveloped. It's all about weird science and then we go to oppressive governments trying to weaponize their powers. It's interesting, actually, except it's not fleshed out really well. The storyline is nothing more than just hinting, shoehorning and preaching for some thought-provoking themes(?) that doesn't go further. It often feels like an incomplete film or just some bored viewer skipping some scenes, except strangely, even the cool parts are being subdued. It's not horrible since it does try to be something else, it's just not executed very well, which is a shame. As a fan of these heroes, it's just another sad moment to question ourselves: is it really hard to make a proper Fantastic Four movie?",

That does not mean it is a bad film because the origin stories are very interesting and it is very entertaining to see each character developing into their superhero or super-villain and how they do it. I am glad this film went into so much depth with the origin stories because it is rarely done in the Marvel cinematic Universe (with a few exceptions) All the problems with this film could be fixed with simply adding an extra 30 minutes (and a post-credit clip!). If you are considering watching this film just do it and remember just because it doesn't quite follow the beloved Marvel tradition it doesn't make it an appalling film and think of the ending as a bridge to future sequels and appearances in other Marvel films.",

            "content": "It's been 8 years since Fantastic Four Rise of The Silver Surfer and Marvel's 'first family' graced our screens.Now with a new direction and armed with a youthful, talented cast as well as a respected director in Josh Trank at the helm, what could possibly go wrong? Well..it turns out almost everything. Don't get me wrong, it would be unfair to not mention that this film has received a lot of negative press (perhaps unfairly) even in pre-production with certain directions the film was taking (such as Johnny Storm's race and Dr Doom's blogger origins). Regardless, as I entered the screening with popcorn in tow and unaware as to what exactly to expect, the film felt as if it had ended before it even started with it's 100 minute run time. There's absolutely nothing wrong with a a film this length, in fact it's quite nice to have a superhero film that doesn't have a run time of 2+ hours. However, with that that mentioned Josh Trank doesn't get to expand on characters and character development. The end result is that you just don't care about these characters. Now onto that cast and quite a promising one at that. Miles Teller who is fresh off his success with the Oscar Winning film Whiplash, leads this ensemble cast as Reed Richards. He is supported by Kate Mara as Sue Storm, Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm and lastly Michael B Jordan as Sue's brother (how they are brother and sister is addressed and simple to understand) Johnny Storm. I felt that Michael B Jordan faced a lot of unfair criticism due to his casting as Johnny (who in both the comics and previous films is white) as having seen in films such as Josh Trank's very own Chronicle, he has the charisma and charm to pull off Johnny Storm's cocky yet funny attitude. It just raises the question as to why people can't comprehend the idea that maybe choosing the best actor possible for the role is a better choice as opposed to staying in true to comic book origins. There are some parts of the film where you can see the actors looks like they're are having a blast, but this family dynamic that is so prevalent in the comics is entirely missing. In fact, even some characters feel as if they are totally missing and are neglected throughout the majority of the film. Toby Kebbell's Dr Doom is quite one dimensional and it's a shame having recently seen him in Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes in which he stars as they villainous and rebellious Koba. Overall the cast of this calibre just feel wasted. In terms of GCI I wasn't too impressed, and the film quite clearly has a lower budget than most superhero films, which I guess is understandable given Josh Trank's directorial background and Fox wanting to make as much profit as they possibly can. It just doesn't bode too well on the big screen. In fact, I found it quite ironic having just watched an interesting video by Freddie Wong ( Why CG sucks, expect it doesn't- RocketJump Film School) defending how CG can be brilliant and add to film when used right. Except in this situation, Fantastic Four isn't one of those examples. I also felt that the dialogue was weak and cheesy and there is an especially cringe-worthy scene where the team try to figure out their name. The soundtrack scored by Marco Beltrami and Philip Glass is forgettable and bland. The story is basic and predictable, perhaps not as engaging as I was hoping for it to be. As I mentioned, the films run time prevents it from many things. For instance, tackling themes such as identity could well have separated the Fantastic Four from other superhero films but these are just not addressed well. Ultimately, the film lacks character, heart and well even action. The big battle that one is accustomed to in almost every superhero film is short and there is a lack of tension and danger. It's a shame that all of this talent has been wasted.",

What is wrong with the Fantastic Four then? First the movies length feels more like a television series pilot than feature film. They use half on the movie time trying to tell back story, not even manage to tell almost nothing. There is no chemistry between characters or team. And when they finally got they super powers is conclusion total mess. Four lackluster teenagers hopping around in the front of the green screen which is after wards filled with nonsense digital effects. Nothing gets out of the characters and when digital effects looks like mediocre television series digital effect is catastrophe unavoidable. Is this what you have to pay a price of a movie ticket? Unfortunately. Usually I don't let critics to make commonplace for my movie experience, but this time I've should listen the warnings. Let just hope that Marvel takes seriously this catastrophe and leaves Fantastic Four to comic book pages. I just wonder where they spent all that 200 million budget if final result looks like this piece of crap? Maybe at Hollywood these digital effect makers capitalize stupid Hollywood studios with greedy. Tenth of these Hollywood budgets European studios make far more better efforts than this is. As a movie experience Fantastic Four is like a root canal therapy, long and painful and cost you a lot of money. If you like it, be my guest, other avoid this crap and don't buy a movie ticket. Hopefully we as a audience can send a message to Hollywood that we are not stupid audience and we wont swallow this kind of lackluster.",

They were all too young so of course Reed Richards didn't have gray streaks, who thought it would be a good idea to make a tiny guy the Thing?, and was it really necessary to make the Storm family have a \"modern home\"?

Movie wasn't bad, it was a NEW Fantastic Four and it's not as bad as everyone says. It is not a comics one at all, but it's good. One of the worse things is that Doom wasn't actually a true Dr.Doom, he was like a villain who appear as fast as he die, so I can say that there was only name of Dr.Doom. Movie was very fast. First part of the film was good, perfect, but second and third, when action starts to take place - that was too fast! 1 hour 40 minutes - it is not that time that gotta be in movie like that. Trank is a good director but must fight more for his projects. I vote 10 just because everyone think it is bad, but it's actually not. Go to the cinema and make your own opinion.",

NO! 4 movies, and NONE of them go right. This one has to be the second worst movie of them all; just before the 1994 movie. Nothing is right in this movie! The movie is far too short to be even called a Marvel film. The story is boring, the characters are bland and atrocious. What's worse? You bring in people like Michael Jordan here. Movies like this can effectively destroy one's career. I don't think any of the characters are done right, especially Victor Von Doom. Some random location in a different plane of existence? That is just thrown in there. Victor is suddenly consumed by some power? No. I'm a fan of Doctor Doom especially, so you can imagine my frustration at how he was handled. He's not supposed to be some sort of weird alien looking thing. He's supposed to be a man who uses his father's medial and scientific knowledge and his mother's magic to create various inventions and eventually become the Dr. Doom we know. Where is that?! Where are the Doombots, for God's sake?! There is so much wrong done to this character! Oh, he's suddenly smarter than Reed? Reed Richards is quite possibly THE smartest character the Marvel universe. Yes, Victor is smart, but he still pales in comparison to minds like Reed. As for the Fantastic Four? There was very little, if any at all, interaction as a team. The powers? Susan wasn't even there when the powers are around. Sudden conflict between the characters? Wow, Reed and Ben have been friends since childhood, but suddenly hate each other? Whoops. It's like seeing a bunch of kids trying to imitate their favorite heroes. Ugh. The entire movie is nothing but exposition. It leads to absolutely nothing. The CGI is absolutely pathetic. The story and actions are far too predictable. Also, it's a superhero film. Gee, I wonder how many fight scenes are in this movie? JUST ONE! AND IT BARELY TAKES UP A FRACTION OF THE MOVIE! It wasn't even that entertaining! Like, literally, when it all ended, I was like \"...That's it? THAT'S IT?!\". What kind of a superhero film is this?Absolutely nothing in this movie can be called correct. Just nothing. Personal pet peeve, why wasn't there an after credits scene? Isn't that customary for a Marvel film? Well, yeah, but it's not a Marvel film. It's a shameless attempt by 20th Century Fox to show that they still own the rights to Fantastic 4. The director, Josh Trank, was the man behind the movie Chronicle, which was very enjoyable to watch. He tweeted that his original plan for the movie would have been received better and that the producers ruined it. I honestly don't know if I should believe that, but I'll take his word for it. Long story short, don't watch this movie. It's not worth it.",

I'm tracking all these Marvel Movies to what I remember from reading the comics in the 1970's. This movie is good with reservations.1) Too much time spent with young Reeves's as a child and his \"Science Project\".2) Not nearly enough \"romance\" between Reeves and Sue.3) No time spent on Ben's adjustment to his new self.4) No time spent on any of the Four in developing their powers and teamwork.5) The BEST scenes in the older FF film were those adjusting to Earth Society; those were absent in this film.UPDATE: Just watched the film again -- and this time I gave it a \"9\" (up from a \"7\") All of my reservations above are true; but I think this second viewing has allowed my to view the film more on its own. (And, Sue Storm seemed to be cuter this viewing) Very, very good film; give it a watch!UPDATE: Just watched for a 3rd time 11 June 2021; found the film to be very good. I cannot tell what studio execs did to the film, but my guess is they mucked it up. It's really hilarious that a comic that (apparently has stood the test of time at least since the 1970's when I read them for a few years,) can have such apparently universal disdain from the film industry. I disliked the continuing \"origin stories\" of Superman -- as they seemed to go on forever, over several films; but this origin story of the FF was quite good. However the film ended where most FF comic-stories begin -- with the incredible teamwork of the FF working together. I'm sticking with my \"9\" rating.P. S.

I quite liked the actors from the 2005 film too. For me, this reboot lacked character development, as well as plot.Having read form other reviews that the movie is not heavily based on the comics, it makes me question the reason they want to reboot this at all. Seeing as the story is based on a comic book, straying from that would not only angry the fans of the comic, but also, make it increasingly difficult to make it a success. I was not invested in the story much, and was expecting more action. Though I guess I can't say much in this review, because I did miss a few scenes here and there (I was on a plane, and kept nodding off). I won't attribute it being boring for the reason I couldn't stay awake, because I might've just been tired.Anyway, I am not such a fan of Teller, but he did a reasonably good job in this. His nerdy act as Reed was believable enough. Other actors/actresses like Bell, Jordan, Kebbell and Mara also did well in their roles. As well, Owen Judge and Evan Hannemann who play the young versions of Reed and Ben respectively, are a good addition to the film. It gave some background as to their childhood and how they became friends. The visuals and the effects are nicely done as well. It seems nowadays that the visual aspect of a film is the one thing that cannot go wrong (mostly). Overall, it isn't such a terrible watch, but isn't anything special.",

            "content": "This is a disappointing film that has a riveting first half but a rushed and forced second half. Four young minds create a machine that transports them into a alternate universe. Once they come back they have acquired unique powers that they need to control.The first half looked quite promising. The pace, character development and story are very engaging. The darker direction they take with the story makes it enjoyable. My favorite scene is when the four discover their abilities. There is a sense of fear, tragedy and betrayal with the characters. It starts out as another successful origin story, then it feels as if the editors pressed the fast-foreword button once it starts to get interesting. The second half feels as if it is a long sneak peek for the next Fantastic Four film. It has a great head start but it left me wanting more in a negative way. There is enough four, but it lacks \"fantastic.\" The updated special effects are one of the redeeming qualities of this film. The presentation of each power is stunning. The impressive design of Ben Grimm/The Thing (Jamie Bell) and the fluent stretching effects of Mister Fantastic give this film an updated edge. At first there is a connection among the characters; both with each other and the audience. The actors pull this off seamlessly and you are sincerely captivated with their goals and struggles. However, they suffer during the second half as all their hard work is painfully rushed. My favorite character is Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic (Miles Teller). Richards is one of the people who help build the machine. He ends up getting the ability of an elastic body which means he can stretch any part of his anatomy. Miles Teller has been on a roll with his career and for good reasons. He's a talented actor who dives deeply into the characters he plays. This part is no exception.The moral of the film, though a bit forced, reminds me of Abraham Lincoln's quote, \"A house dived against itself cannot stand.\" The four heroes face Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and attack him individually. Soon they realize, that together, they are stronger.I give this film 3 out of 5 stars and recommend this to 10 through 18-year-olds. There's some dark material and language that younger audiences may not be able to handle. This film has some saving aspects but sadly, they do not recover the whole film.

Shorter can be better, in some instances.Do I prefer this outing to the 2005 version? Well, no, to be honest. Though that had plenty of faults, there was more interaction between the characters than here. However, here, in what is essentially an origin story, they had to set the scene. Sure, we all know who the Fantastic Four are. They really need no introduction, but that isn't how franchises are made.The complaints about lack of action just highlight how sad and limited what passes for a good action movie these days is expected to be. I like build-up. I like character development. Non-stop action, for me, is a big turn off. So I appreciated the more measured approach of F4. As I said in my Ultron review, all action movies quickly become tedious to endure, which is probably why I rated this movie higher than Ultron.So I think Trank did a passable job with this film. Certainly he is not deserving of the vitriol being spewed his way at the moment. It is easy to jump on the hate wagon, but less easy to get off. If this is the kind of movie that ruins a man's career, then it says something more about mob mentality than it does about his ability to direct.SUMMARY: Absolutely nowhere near as bad as it has been made out to be. Quite entertaining, in fact. Just as you shouldn't believe all the hype surrounding movies these days, so you should take with a large handful of salt, the vilification of movies.

I actually thought the story was re-told in a pretty cool way at it's most basic form. The idea of traveling to another dimension, instead of out into space, I think could work very well. It leaves a lot of possibilities, but unfortunately most of these were not explored. The movie started off pretty well. In fact, for the first half of the movie, I thought maybe it was going to be a lot better than people let on.A lot of people on here are complaining about the cast, but I think they were okay, just poorly directed. Most of them have proved themselves to be good actors in other films. I heard Trank was telling them on set to be as flat as possibly with all their deliveries and it shows.I'm glad to hear that they are moving forward with FF2, because I don't think there is anything about this world that has been created that is inherently bad. The movie had lots of problems, but mostly that it felt incomplete, like it was cut short and scenes were missing along the way. This shouldn't really stop the next movie from being good.I heard stuff was cut from the movie, so I'm not really sure what the script looked like, if maybe things were cut afterward that make the story seem non-sensible, but the script as it is in the movie, is pretty bad. The characters aren't properly developed and it really seems like a bunch of random pages got deleted throughout the film, but they continued using it anyway.As far as the whole \"dark, gritty\" thing, I think it kind of works, but I'm not sure if this is the best superhero story for that. I feel like Fantastic Four is one of the more far-fetched superhero stories. I could buy the idea that they go to space (or another dimension) and come back with some sort of mutation. Chances are it would be negative of course, like some sort of cancer, but for the sake of entertainment, I could but the fact that cosmic radiation causes a beneficial mutation. But 5 completely different, random, and really cool mutations that are all completely different from one another?? Yeah right. If anything, they would all have the same or at least similar powers. That being said, this doesn't seem like the type of story that really needs to be taken super seriously. That's why I rather like the fact that Avengers and most of the other MCU movies have so much humor. Captain America and Iron Man have much more believable origin stories than Fantastic Four, so it seems silly to me to pick this one to make super serious, but had the plot holes been filled in and the movie been directed better, it could have worked.",

Turns out there was an error in the IMDb rating calculation system because this movie is a 7 at worst. Plain and simple, in my opinion obviously. don't know what people were expecting. This movie is like progressive deep house: constantly slowly building up, never really dropping. And I appreciate those types of movies. Kinda like Full Metal Jacket (though I don't want to comparing those two) in a way. I wish more Marvel movies were structured like this, rather than the usual mainstream mayhem (which is also fun, but you could balance the 2 and make something really fresh).The way I rate movies: 10 means there is absolutely nothing I can think of or pinpoint that would have made the movie better, and the more things I can think of that could be changed/improved, the lower the rating. This one landing at a 7.5, as there were 2 major things I think could use improvement. Overall, even though it certainly is no masterpiece, this is a solid flick. If you like movies, watch it.

            "content": "Decades ago - in my youth - I actually was more of a DC guy, so I only read a few of the Fantastic Four comics. Therefore I apologize in advance to all fans of the books who might not find their favourite stories depicted adequately by this movie. As I said I only read a few of the stories decades ago, so my only comparison is with the 2005 film. So in my opinion this one is much better. I never liked the candy coloured tone of the first one, admitting that its sequel was better. I prefer the darker and more serious tone of this one. I also liked a lot that the movie took its time to develop the character, making them more complex and believable - even if this has the word: \"sequel\" written all over it. Especially Victor van Doom who is not the smug, arrogant and selfish villain, but a good guy who has been betrayed and now tries to protect his new world, even if this means the destruction of his old one. So to sum things up: I believe anyone who claims the movie does not do justice to its origin. However regarded as an action film on its own it has everything I want: good effects, good acting, believable but slightly broken characters and an interesting story even if it stays open ended.",

            "content": "This was a miserable experience. There was little to no colour throughout, rendering those scenes boring. The dialogue was predominantly forgettable. Personally, this was a boring movie to sit through. The action scenes were nonexistent. Now that statement might sound petty, but consider that the \"fight\" between Mr Fantastic and Thing is approximately 20 seconds long, the only physical interaction being Thing knocking his head against Mr. Fantastic's. The central antagonist is barely in the movie only for 10 minutes before he's immediately evaporated into his portal/teleporter device. Overall, the fantastic four deserved a better adaptation. They technically got that in the 1990s, but that's based on how closely it commits to the source material, and not about its other middling qualities.",

            "content": "Since kids, Reed Richards have always been the scientist, thinking his ideas way out of the minds of others. His best friend Ben always helps him, although he doesn't have Reed's brightness. In a science fair Red gets a scholarship offer at Baxter for his machine which cracked inter- dimensional travel. There Reed meets Sue Storm, the adopted daughter of scientist Franklin Storm. Franklin is obsessed with the inter- dimensional travel project, entrusting his vision to young kids like Reed, Sue and Victor von Doom who was the pioneer in the field until Reed figured out what's missing from his formula. Also joining them is Johnny Storm, Franklin's son. After a series of tests, it's determined that I's doable for humans to do the inter-dimensional travel, but the leaders at Baxter decides to bring in NASA and hold the thing. Victor and Reed decides that it's the fruit of their labor and dreams thus it's their right to go travel first. Reed phones Ben to join them and they with Victor and Johnny go.In the other dimension they find a pool of oozing energy. They go to investigate it and the pool comes to life and devours them. Victor gets swallowed and they can't save him. They all go back to the pod. But it's jammed so Sue helps them from our side. Just as Sue overrides, Ben's capsule door opens and he gets slammed by rocks. Johnny's capsule windows breaks and he's engulfed in flames. The pod returns home creating a blackout and wrecks the lab. Reed's legs get trapped under rubbles. As he crawls to find Ben he finds his legs stretched. The government detains them. They are promised a cure as the government searches for it but for the mean time they're asked to do assignments. Apparently Sue also gets some powers through the electric shock on the pods's return. Reed escapes his cell. Ben, Sue and Johnny trains and hone their powers, believing Reed abandoned them. A year later Ben is successful in military missions and Johnny is about to be sent those missions too, but Sue refuses to be a tool. Franklin talks Sue into tracking Reed, leading to his arrest by Ben.Franklin talks Reed into helping complete the second portal to get the cure from the other side. They travel back to the other side and find Victor surviving with metal covering his body, slumping and passing out. The mission brings him back. But Victor wakes up and lays waste to the place. He uses the pod to travel back to the other dimension and creates a vortex through the pod that sucks everything to the other dimension. He easily subdues Reed, Ben Sue and Johnny on their own. But Reed gains a chance and throws Victor away for a while. They then unite and throw Victor at the vortex, destroying it at the same time. As the vortex closes they fly out of the other dimension. The story seems interesting at first, of how the scientists are being pictured as youngsters now. But then everything starts to fall apart since development. The story anchored it's start point quite nicely at Reed's childhood, but it took too long in dwelling in that time period. Further, that long dwelling wasn't used properly to balance and develop all the characters, especially Ben who was already there with Reed. Sue and Johnny seems limping empty since the movie is all about Reed. Even the antagonist Victor isn't really developed well, particularly on the reasoning of his behaviors.As a superhero movie, this movie took too long before the audience can see any real action. I noted tat it took about 36 minutes until the first suspenseful sequence happen. All the stuff before minute thirty- sixth was just a load of build-up that seemed overdone yet imbalanced. Yet when it's there, the action seemed very much scarce indeed. The parts of Ben as a military operator, Reed's fight avoid capture, even Johnny and Sue's training should have been emphasized better and given more screen time. Instead the movie enjoyed in keeping to the dialogs.The acting overall seemed just at a standard with the young cast members. Miles Teller was nicely aware of the overwhelming focus on his character and he played his parts adequately enough. Although we can still see that it's quite a struggle for him to switch from his earlier characters. Kate Mara also did okay for her parts. It's too bad that her role didn't have a deserving portion of the movie. Michael B. Jordan was quite flat here due to being quite polarized on his character. He over done things both on the serious and the joking parts. Jamie Bell is really under utilized, both as Ben and as The Thing, as he also didn't get enough exposure.I agree with those who score Fantastic Four (2015) a 4 out of 10 score. A recommendation is instead a negative one from me. Don't go see this in the cinemas, it's not worth your money. It's quite bad as an entertainment due to taking too long to build up, and also the action lacks the epic factor a superhero movie requires.",

This isn't a team, this is a family that has to face the odds and come together through thick and thin. This movie has it's faults, but doesn't every movie?

However, there was no action, and no real conflicts which made it quite boring. But it was still watchable. And then it all went to hell. This isn't a spoiler, but there's this abrupt time jump near the halfway point of the movie. And it's at this very moment where everything began to fall apart. First of all, not only did this time jump completely skip the best part of origin tales, discovering and testing out your superpowers, but it killed everything good that was set up in the first half. Characters were inconsistent, direction was messy, dialogue became cringe-worthy, and CGI was outright dreadful. The second half honestly felt like a whole other movie; you could sense a whole lot of studio intervention going on. There were scenes in the trailer that that didn't end up in the final product, which tells me that Fox had no faith in their film; basically, they sent this to the editing room to die. My biggest problem with FANATSIC FOUR is that it has no personality whatsoever. There's no fun to be had here, in fact there's nothing to be had since nothing really happens in the movie. I'm shocked by how much this disappointed me, mostly because they got Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, and Jamie Bell; that's a damn good cast right there, and yet none of them added much of anything to their roles. In fact, by the end most of the cast seemed to tune out. Speaking of the end, my God was that third act atrocious. Doom comes out of nowhere and we're suddenly thrown into the finale. Not only was his character design laughable, the guy didn't even feel like a character; his motivation felt like it was written by a 5-year-old. There was no weight to this battle at all, from the forced speeches to the noticeable green screen. If there's anything redeemable in this film it's The Thing's look; apart from that, FANTASTIC FOUR is the farthest thing from fantastic.",

            "content": "Fant4stic might be one of the worst superhero movies for quite a while. I have to be honest that it actually looks very good when the trailer first came out, it has a wonderful cast, a promising director who brought us Chronicle, and it's a Marvel movie! How bad could it be? However, Fox ruins it again. I went into the movies expecting to see something very, very bad after looking up the reviews, regardless on IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, or the reviews on Yahoo Movies (Taiwan). Every one of them said how Fant4stic it is. and I guess they're right.The first act of the movie is actually pretty good. You get to see Reed Richards and Ben growing up, which kind of reminded me of the intro of the Guardians of the Galaxies. To me, it seems like a good start.However, Fant4stic is extremely boring. At first, it does look good when it introduces each character and doing their researches, but it really bores you out when it didn't make any progress after 70 minutes of unnecessary dialogs. I kept yawning and checking the time on my phone throughout the movie. Yes, the cinematography does look good, but there are no action sequences but inferior-quality special effects. Seriously, the movie makes you doubt was there a problem with its budget.The third act is where I hated the most. When you finally receive that fight scene you've all been waiting for (after 80 minutes), the villain just died within 10 minutes. This might be one of the weakest and worst villains I've seen in a movie. Dr. Doom finally appeared in the last 20 minutes. He got send back to Earth, he went insane, he started killing people, he went back to his planet, and then he got killed. All of these happened within 15 minutes. That 15 minutes simply just made me hated the movie even more after all of the boredom. Oh, and the ending, I'm speechless. I really like Miles Tellers as an actor, but what he concluded in the movie really wanted you to punch him in the face real hard. That was one of the cheesiest dialogue I've heard, not in a romantic way. I have no idea what these producers and screenwriters were thinking when they had such a talented cast to say such idiotic lines. That ending just made the audience sighing and sneering while they leave for the exit. When you actually look back to the 2005 version of Fantastic Four which wasn't that great as a superhero film, Fant4stic actually really makes you wanna re-watch the 2005 one again. At least, the 2005 has enough action sequences, and I'm not saying about those awful 100% CGI battle scenes in Fant4stic, I want to see the streets, the cars, the citizens. I want a sense of humanity which makes it actually make the 4 real superheroes. I'm really disappointed with Fant4stic and all I can say about the positives of this movie is that it has good cinematography and good performances that not always worked well. The rest of the movie is just clich\u00e9d and lifeless. I think Fant4stic really took itself too seriously; it has a very strange atmosphere just like having a dark atmosphere in an Adam Sandler movie. But the truth is, it isn't good enough to put it on a shelf with the other Marvel or DC superhero movies. It just doesn't fits. Lastly, just don't go watch it in the theaters. Go watch the 2005 version. At least it gives you a couple chuckles and enough fighting scenes to satisfy you.",

Is there anything really wrong about a silly Sci-Fi movie? If it gives a lot of people employment, makes money for investors and provides a fun time at the movies, what's the big deal? This movie is certainly not an epic by a famous and legendary movie maker, but it is a fast paced, exciting and fun film to watch. Can four nerdy twenty-somethings create a matter/dimensional transfer invention and keep it out of the clutches of the evil military? And along the way keep us all from being devoured by a pesky black hole? Many opportunities for comic relief and sarcasm were missed and could have kicked the hollow plot along. The dimensional transfer machine constructed in a top secret location is a four-holer version of Woody Allen's Orgasmatron in \"Sleeper\" (1976), complete with Reed's horn rim glasses on inside his helmet. In any event, this time dimension road trip is brisk and carried by really cool animations and special effects. There is a brief nod in the library scene to Jules Verne's 1870 \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas.\" Bust out a copy of this book and read something by the master. But in this film, the emphasis is on the \"fi\" and not the \"sci\" of SciFi. Any reference to science came from a dictionary because the fancy scientific language used of moving mass through dimensional changes is nonsense and requires a little more thought on how to jump start E = mc2. But so what. If it is only a silly SciFi movie that is a load of fun, is there anything really wrong with that?",

The acting wasn't anything special but it was okay. CGI was cool (except that monkey) but when all that big action finally started (in last 20 minutes) I already lost my interest. Dr. Doom doesn't look the way he's supposed to but is still pretty intimidating. That scene when he starts a chaos in the end was really good. The first half was okay but slow. And now the bad things: The plot is a mess. Victor is a whiny nerd. It tries so hard to be realistic and ends up just being dark and depressing mess. The Thing's naked butt. There are, like, 3 action scenes. Takes itself waaaaay to seriously. On the half of the movie they get their powers but they only get to use them in battle in last 20 minutes.

After visiting the other dimension a tragic accident leaves the four young outsiders with shocking new abilities. As an old threat comes back, the four must team up to face Doom (Toby Kebbell) together. Fantastic Four is a failure on multiple levels. The characters are underdeveloped, the pacing is completely off, the villain is generic and bland, the story is lacking, and most importantly it is not fun. Fantastic Four is so dull, with little redeeming qualities that it may cause you to think that the previous attempts at this franchise were actually decent in comparison.Full Review:What happened!? I was among the few in my group of friends who was genuinely excited and was rooting for this new incarnation of the Fantastic Four. It has a great cast, writer, and director, all the essentials to make a good movie but somehow, almost nothing clicked.It is a pity that the movie didn't work considering the cast. They were the one decent aspect of the entire movie. Despite the occasional awkward dialogue, at least they gave it their all to their respective roles. In fact they may be the reason why in the first 30mins I thought \"this isn't so bad, what was all the fuss about?\" Of course, I spoke too soon because the movie randomly starts to lose track of its own plot.Where do I even begin with the negatives? I am not an avid Fantastic Four comic reader but even I know that they are supposed to be a family. At no point did I feel them sincerely bonding with each other. Near the end they throw a couple of punches together for about a minute, and that apparently constitutes as teamwork. It all felt contrived, only Reed and Ben's relationship was believable and that's because we see them together as kids in the beginning of the movie. Other than that it makes no sense why these four would be working together. And that's not something I should be questioning!!!Then the pacing, or lack there off. The problem is that the purpose of the whole movie is to setup the characters of the Fantastic Four for the next movie. So there is no coherent storyline. It is just stuffed with filler scenes of people sitting in front of computers, people deeply brooding, or lame practice montage to fill the run- time till the villain shows up.As for the villain, first of all, the character design for Doom is horrendous. He looks like a crash test dummy with a burnt curtain on his head. He has one of the shallowest motivations for being villain. Then, in a typical dumb villain style, is almighty powerful that he can literally blow people's heads with his mind but will refuse to use this power against the heroes. Because you know, you don't want to make things too easy for yourself right?The biggest sin of this movie is that it feels like the film studio and creator are ashamed at even the idea of Fantastic Four. These characters in comics are colourful and have funny banter with each other. But the filmmakers were so concerned about coming off campy that they went unnecessarily dark to the point that even the characters don't embrace their hero names. We live in a day and age where audiences are embracing a talking tree, gun-toting raccoon, and a guy who controls ants. So show some pride in the fact that you are the Fantastic Four! Or at least fake it so we feel less ashamed of watching this fantastic disaster.Everything that could go wrong with this film, went wrong. There was so much potential, and you see glimpses of that in the first 30- 45mins of the movies. But then the movie quickly divulges into a meandering plot that concludes with one of the most abrupt endings in recent times. You better off watching the 2005 or 2007 Fantastic Four movies\u0085 and I can't believe I am saying that.",

None of them are charismatic or given a chance to be compelling. Kate Mara and Michael B. Jordan could do so much better than this.It becomes simply going from one point in the plot to the next. There is no excitement. The dialog is bland. It could have worked as a moody body horror but it's obvious that somebody desperately wants an action packed thriller.

Like this, and you think, no, this cannot be the end, the final battle as any final battle should last 30 minutes minimum with its up's and downs (i.e. first avengers, the new superman...), but here the final battle lasts... 10 minutes? For the rest of the movie, I've liked a lot, the only minus for this movie is that you fell a little cheated by the very weak final battle, you cannot build up, build up a MAJOR problem to be solved and then... snap your fingers, one solution and all fixed? It is like they were short on money and had to finish the movie any way.Even with this set-back, this movie does not deserve the rating the people are giving here (I would give a 7) so I am giving a 10 to try to help a little, as all F4 fans, I feel thankful they made a reboot of a so cool comic book.The action scenes with Reed Richards are so cool and any comic fan would love it (although they are few, its true).It would be nice to see a second part, but it looks like for the box office that it won't be true. A new reboot in 10 years? Sure.",

            "content": "Fantastic Four (stylized as Fant4stic) is a 2015 superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. It is the third theatrical Fantastic Four film to be distributed by 20th Century Fox, and a reboot of the Fantastic Four film franchise.Friends Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) have worked together on a prototype teleporter since their childhood, eventually attracting the attention of Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), director of the Baxter Foundation, a government-sponsored research institute for young prodigies. Reed is recruited to join them and aid Storm's children, scientist Sue Storm (Kate Mara) and technician Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), into completing a \"Quantum Gate\" designed by Storm's wayward prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell), who begrudgingly agrees to help due to his unrequited feelings for Sue.The experiment is successful, and the facility's supervisor, Dr. Allen (Tim Blake Nelson), assembles a group of astronauts to venture into a parallel dimension known as \"Planet Zero\". Disappointed at being denied the chance to join the expedition, Reed, Johnny, and Victor recruit Ben to help them commandeer the Quantum Gate and embark on an unsanctioned voyage to Planet Zero, which they learn is a world filled with otherworldly substances. Victor attempts to collect a sample of the substances, causing the entire structure they are in to collapse and the ground to erupt with a green lava-like substance. Reed, Johnny, and Ben return to their shuttle just as Sue brings them back to Earth. Victor is left behind after he falls into the collapsing landscape. The machine explodes, altering Reed, Sue, Johnny, and Ben on a molecular-genetic level, affording them super-human conditions and abilities beyond their control: Reed can stretch like rubber, Sue can become invisible and generate force fields of energy, Johnny can engulf his entire body in flames and fly, and Ben becomes bigger and develops a rocklike hide which gives him enhanced strength and durability. They are then placed in government custody and confinement to be studied and have their conditions and abilities tested. Blaming himself for the accident, Reed escapes the facility and becomes a fugitive while desperately trying to find a cure.One year later, Reed is located in Central America by Sue and captured by Ben, who has become a military asset along with Johnny and Sue. Johnny and Sue have been outfitted with specialized suits, one of which Reed later receives, designed to keep up with their conditions and abilities and to help them stabilize, control, and contain their abilities. Reed is brought to Area 57, where Dr. Allen conscripts him to open another portal to Planet Zero in exchange for giving Reed the necessary resources to find a cure. Arriving in Planet Zero, Dr. Allen's explorers find Victor, who has been fused to his spacesuit and can now control the elements, as well as having telekinetic abilities, and bring him back to Earth. Driven insane by the experience and believing the human race needs to be destroyed so he can rebuild Planet Zero in his image, Victor escapes, killing scientists and soldiers in the base including Dr. Allen and Professor Storm. Victor returns to Planet Zero using the Quantum Gate, with Ben, Johnny, Reed, and Sue in pursuit.Now dubbing himself \"Doom\", he activates a portal on Planet Zero using a structure he made while in the realm, that begins consuming the landscape of the Earth. He is confronted by the four and, after a destructive battle, Ben punches Doom into the portal's energy beam, disintegrating him, while Johnny closes the portal. Returning to Earth, the group is rewarded for their heroics by being given a new base of operations by the United States military. They decide to use their powers to help people and adopt the mantle of the \"Fantastic Four\".Fantastic Four is really a great must see movie for all audience.",

The only thing missing was some comical rivalry scenes between Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm. I like the setup very much. Ben Grim's tagline \"It's clobberin' time\" get's its own origin story. The racial inclusion of a black Johnny Storm was seamless. I would love to see the FF hang with the Inhumans on screen but the studios have no respect for American art. Also we would really need Quicksilver to be alive for the whole Quicksilver/Medusa arc.The bad reviews are undeserved. I suspect there was some sort of campaign to kill this movie's potential before it left the barn to push the studio to give up it's rights. Selling the rights would make up for the losses on this expensive film. We'll never know. I'm looking forward to FF2 regardless.

            "content": "I never liked the the 2005 version of \"Fantastic Four.\" I've always considered it a disappointing superhero film. Amazingly, I found myself actually longing for it when I saw the new, rebooted version. Yes, this film is so bad that it almost makes the original seem like a good film. It's the type of movie that just gets worse and worse and drags on more and more with each passing second. The picture introduces us to Reed Richards (Miles Teller), a young boy-genius who builds a small teleportation machine in his parents' garage (Might I add that the film already lost me at this point; seriously, a twelve-year-old builds a TELEPORTATION MACHINE.) After befriending Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) at the junkyard, the two enter an updated machine at the high school science fair seven years down the road. It is here that Reed is noticed by Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his adopted daughter Sue (Kate Mara), who offer him a scholarship at an institute attempting to create a device that can teleport human life to another dimension. Storm's son Johnny (Michael B. Jordan) and former colleague Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) get forced into the plot and help build the machine. On a drunken night, Reed, Johnny, Victor, and Ben (who randomly gets invited by Reed) decide to up and travel to a planet in another dimension, breaking every rule in the book. Bad things happen, Doom gets left behind, and the others have outstanding abilities when they return. Oh, and Sue gets powers too, but instead of just having her travel with the guys, the screenwriters decided to leave her behind and give her powers when the teleportation machine explodes for some reason...don't ask why. A year passes with our heroes held in a maximum security location, and then all of a sudden they're battling Victor (now Dr. Doom presumably) who wants to take over the world without any given motive. Yep, that's pretty much it...Director Josh Trank claims that Fox Studios took control of the film from his hands, then took his great product and turned it into this piece of trash. Whether this is true or not is debatable, but it's pretty evident that he didn't have control of this picture. The story is nearly unwatchable when put on screen. Nothing exciting, interesting, or intriguing happens for most of the film, then everything happens at once in the last fifteen minutes. Even worse, what does finally happen is nowhere near worth the wait and falls short of anything that can be described as \"epic\" or \"fun.\" The terrible script does not offer much to the actors, but it's not like they make the most of what they are given. Teller tries much too hard to fit into his character and fix something that just cannot be fixed. Mara and Bell seem like they do not really care at all most of the time. Jordan and Kebbell are really the only ones who \"almost\" make the most of what they are given, but it's not enough to save the picture. The sad truth is that these characters, like the story, are ill-conceived and undeveloped. The filmmakers completely wasted would-be-great characters like The Thing and Dr. Doom (who is only on screen for those last, awful fifteen minutes.) It's not enough to make the scenes between the Fantastic Four extremely corny (especially during an absolutely unwatchable scene where they attempt to come up with a name); it also gives them no time to develop into a team. These people are barely likable and still seem like strangers when they are finally called into action. The cinematography was the one aspect of the film that was done right in the first hour. Then, when the need for strong special effects came, the film seemed almost as cartoonish as \"The Green Lantern.\" In this day and age, where great special effects rule cinema, audiences should not be subjected to the simple, effortless effects seen here. \"Fantastic Four\" might have been watchable if it seemed as though those involved actually tried to create an acceptable product. When watching this film, I wondered if the filmmakers even watched the final picture. Then I wondered if they had any idea what they were doing while making the film, because it seems as though they just threw it together like a crappy collage. Apparently, there is already a sequel in the works. It may be a terrible idea, but at least Fox has put the sequel in a situation where it can't possibly be worse than the first installment. Then again, I never say never. Perhaps it's best for the Fantastic Four to pack their bags and follow Spider-Man over to Marvel Studios.",

How can something so short seem so interminably long? The story, yet another origin story (why do we need to keep rebooting with the origin, we all know how the four were made) was fairly original, I grant you that, but the execution? Terrible. Much has been made of how good Chronicle (director Josh Trank's previous feature) was. I saw Chronicle, and stylistically speaking, this is almost a retread. As though Trank has one original idea and he was going to mix up the elements a little and apply the result to the Fantastic Four. The problem is that this is Marvel, this is a long-established story with much loved characters that were almost unrecognizable. The tone was quite dark, however it was also dull and lifeless. The four leading actors were bland and unremarkable, it was hard to care about their fate. Only Victor Von Doom offers us anything like the twisted personality that Von Doom is supposed to be. Unfortunately his screen time is limited, and making him a borderline creepy stalker, to counteract the maybe romance between Reed Richards and Sue Storm (that goes absolutely nowhere) was just pointless. Miles Teller never comes out of sulky teenager mode, there's no fire or passion, he's just one note, as Reed Richards, that's almost an unforgivable sin. Jamie Bell looks really uncomfortable as Ben Grimm, he is a fine actor, but the script gives him nothing to get his teeth into. The Storm siblings have been re-written as an unnecessary socially modern family, with Sue being adopted (has nothing to do with the plot, and really only serves to flag up the complete lack of chemistry between Kate Mara and Michael B Jordan. As siblings they seemed to barely know each other. So disappointed in the film, that's \u00a313 and one hundred minutes of my life wasted.",

            "content": "Since it was announced, Fantastic Four has been the subject of media scrutiny and overwhelmingly negative reception from hardcore fans of the series and the general public. Everything from Michael B. Jordan's casting as the Human Torch to director Josh Trank's on-set troubles, which included showing up to work both drugged out and late, as well as reportedly verbally abusing Kate Mara to the point where she cried, had given the film a bad reputation several months before it was to be released. It's a surprise the film even made it to cinemas on time considering the massive amounts of reshoots that supposedly took place after the film had already completed principal photography. Those reshoots were completely for naught, however, because nothing, except perhaps Trank's original vision for the film, could have saved this trainwreck of a reboot, which was only made to prevent Marvel from obtaining the rights. It goes without saying that this film will be studied for years to come, but not because of what went right, but because of what went so terribly wrong.The film tells the tale of the Fantastic Four, a group of young 20- somethings who crack inter-dimensional travel and acquire superpowers when they travel to this alternate dimension (known as Planet Zero) and are exposed to its elements. Simple? Not quite. Nearly the entire film is devoted to exposition and as so, we are given countless scenes that fail to push the film forward. This scenes try to explain the film's science and develop the film's characters, but instead end up making the film's story feel muddled and dull. In fact, the expository dialogue is so clunky that even though the main actors try to do their best what has been given to them by Trank and co-writers Jeremy Slater and Simon Kinberg (who wrote the actually fantastic X-Men: Days of Future Past), they only amplify its clunkiness. Because the film attempts to be as serious as possible, he attempts at humor end up falling short and I only chuckled once or twice during the film's 100-minute runtime. The film's biggest grievance, however, is how pedestrian it truly is. Every single story beat has been spoiled by the trailers and therefore, the film falls to trite predictability.The only thing that keeps the film watchable is the cast, despite that none of them even approach the level of success they have had on previous productions. The quite underrated Jamie Bell is perhaps the best member of the team as Ben Grimm. Unfortunately, he also gets the least screen time of the four. On the other hand, Miles Teller, fresh off the success of one 2014's best films, Whiplash, barely convinces as Reed Richards. Michael B. Jordan, who was at the center of much controversy because he was cast in the role of the typically white character Johnny Storm, is in the end, unremarkable. The other Storm sibling, portrayed by Kate Mara, is also unremarkable, and spends the majority of her time either staring at a screen or failing to develop much chemistry with her co-stars. However, it is Toby Kebbell who takes the cake in regards to the film's worst performance. Cast as the film's main villain, Victor von Doom, Kebbell fails to make him menacing in any type of way, and ultimately, makes one wish that they were watching Julian McMahon's Dr. Doom from 2005 instead.However, although Kebbell is partly to blame for the failings of Dr. Doom, blame should also fall on the editing and visual effects departments. The film's pacing is completely off-the-mark, and certain characters simply disappear for long periods of time. Even though I am not an advocate for action over story, the uneven editing left me yearning for some action - until I finally got it late in the third act. However, the action, just like the story, is muddled and dull, and fails to take advantage of both the powers of Dr. Doom and the Fantastic Four. The climactic battle really isn't that much of a climax at all, and wholeheartedly disappoints. The film's visual effects make matters even more disappointing. Although I liked the design of The Thing, it says something when the design of Dr. Doom was better a decade ago than it is now.It actually pained me to write such a negative review for this film. Since the release of the first trailer, I had been cautiously optimistic, despite the fact that negative publicity seemed to leak every day. Trank's directorial debut, Chronicle, had been a pleasant surprise, and despite my skepticism about the overall cast, I believed that Trank could finally give the Fantastic Four the film they finally deserved. But alas, the day when that happens still isn't here. There are great ideas every now and then, but they never seem to gel into something cohesive. Plagued by an unimaginative story which seems to confuse exposition for dialogue, so-so special effects, poor character development, a final act that's weaker than its villain, and a never-ending sense of predictability, Fantastic Four is one of the worst superhero films to come out in a long time. We'll never how much of the film has been changed by Fox from Josh Trank's version, but perhaps the film would've been better had they left it in his hands.Miles Teller was right when he said that \"this is not a movie (that) we're going to go on Rotten Tomatoes and it's going to be at 80 or 90%\". This is a movie that's going to be at 9%.",

He plays his role well, that is in most movies, and I again had high hopes. The director, Josh Tank also directed the successful film, Chronicle which also starred Michael B. Jordan. However, like his last name; this film TANKed. It was honestly one of the most over-hyped, over budgeted, and underachieved movies I've ever looked upon. IMDb gave it a 4/10, which is ironic considering the movie is entitled the Fantastic FOUR. More like the NOTSOFANTASTIC FOUR. This was the biggest waste of 2 hours, and wasn't at all worth the $9 ticket I purchased. The part of this movie I was most looking forward to was the recreation of Dr. DOOM, and I was getting excited to see how well executed his character would have been. Yet, after seeing him for a total of 7 minutes of screen time in a nearly two hour long movie, I was again, disappointed. If you didn't enjoy the first 2 in the early 2000's, you will most definitely NOT like this film. Definite No from myself. RATING: 3/10. AGE: 11+.

One reason for the reboot was that they used the same actor as Johnny Storm and Captain America (Chris Evans) in other Marvel movies, so I went in to it with an open mind.I expected to walk into a crap movie based on other reviews but can't say that happened. Perhaps I'm more forgiving or know more about the characters and have a better intuitive grasp of movie links as they happen BUT:The team really was a mix of individuals who were supposed to be a team (which we saw for like ONE fight). Even Reed Richards inviting Ben Grimm on the trip was kind of a favor to a buddy vs. the comics \"needed the best pilot he could trust\". Sue Storm and Johnny Storm couldn't have possibly been less we-grew-up-together. Doom wasn't evolved as a character enough to really justify his actions. Miles Teller as Reed Richards ... really? Had to wonder if the casting director was predisposed to ignore other possibilities. He (the actor) did well with the awkward initial relationship stuff with Sue, but I don't think he pulled off ultra-brilliant as he should have. Ben Grimm turning on his life-long bestie because the gov'meant said he ran away was awfully fast.Now, positives: Michael B. Jordan is always great and brings greatness to his movies, keep eyes on this one. Kate Mara is freaking wonderful, and I think she took on a Sue Storm well - I blame the director or writers for her sudden inexplicable jumps in power level and control. Her initial awkwardness with Reed was ... I'm not blaming her and perhaps not even Miles.Oh, BIG negative: If you're gonna buy out a Marvel franchise and make a Marvel movie, the least you can do is add a Marvel after- credits scene! Tie in or stand out as the exception, and not in a good way!I'll see this when it comes on TV, but (contrary to my nature) won't be buying this on Blu-Ray unless it comes out as \"Fantastic Four - the unf*%ked version\".

The addition of Johnny and Sue's father into the story definitely made the story more interesting to me than the previous movies, where I had never even thought of their father. His character was a good catalyst for the team.

            "content": "Fantastic Four. A more gritty realistic reboot. The film has a fresh new atmosphere to it, almost as fresh as Batman: The Dark Knight did. But I would not compare story and characters to that. Just how it doesn't feel like a typical superhero film.Director Josh Trank successfully builds a new atmosphere and feel for a superhero film. You instantly know the characters, and feel compelled in their journey to success. This is much more of a science fiction thriller than a superhero film though. Do not go in expecting the typical multiple fight scenes, as this film keeps its pace and does not feel rushed. That is, except for the climax of the film, which at a point you suddenly realise this is the climax, and you are near the end. There is a lot of great build up, but ends rather suddenly. But once you get to the point where you realise it is the climax, you will accept it, as it is still thrilling.The movie actually deals with their powers as almost disabilities, disfigurements. They don't achieve their powers and then are like \"oh woo, I'm going to help people and stop the bad guy\". They are actually scared of their 'powers' to start with, and it is disturbing. You feel it too as you watch it, and that is great. I haven't seen a superhero before which successfully pulled this off. The characters confused at their new abilities. I hope Marvel don't one day buy the rights back and reboot it for their Marvel Cinematic Universe. If anything, I'd love for them to continue this franchise, but let it be in an alternate world which Reed could cross over into the MCU. Bring it together. As then they would have more possibilities for the different alternate versions of characters, giving the studio more advantages of changes.",

            "review_title": "Fantastically underrated, worth watching.",
            "content": "To many people this movie is known as the big BOM of 2015 with ratings falling below the 1 (Rottentomatoes). This movie is even considered worse than Batman and Robin directed by Joel Schumacher. So is this negativity towards this movie justified? Well before I dive deeper within this conundrum I need to state that this is my own opinion, however for this movie I really hope you agree with me at least a little. Let us begin with a little history lesson. Superhero movies have grown exponentially in the last couple of decades starting with the x-men (or Blade). During this period the superhero genre has evolved from parodies to a movie genre with deep character development, storytelling, and a good balance between action and drama. Also we can't ignore the power house that is Marvel with their line of interconnected movies. However, for every x-men movie there is an x-men 3 or for the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy there is Dark Knight Rises (Am I wrong?!!). So am I saying that this movie belongs in the bad category (e.g., Batman & Robin, Catwoman, Daredevil) NO I am NOT!!! Let me be honest here, YES I was one of the haters out there who believed that this movie would be bad. However, after watching it I was surprisingly and Fantastically entertained. Before I continue about this issue, why this movie has failed at the box office, I would like to talk about the movie first. Some of you may have seen a previous version made in 2005 and 2007 they were corny but fun popcorn flicks. So fast forward a couple of years after the Batman trilogy by Nolan and the Marvel effect and we have a complete movie remake: FANTASTIC FOUR 2015. The story starts with a couple of kids named Reed Richards (Wizkid) and Ben Grimm (Muscle) becoming friends and trying to build their own teleporter. This hobby and relationship grows into their teens and during a science fair their project was discovered by Dr. Storm; who invites Reed to join his project to complete a dimensional gate/teleporter. During this time we get to know Johnny storm (Cool Guy), adopted sister Sue Storm (The Girl) and Victor Von Doom (Bad Guy). Eventually they succeed in building the machine and they teleport to an alien planet that contained some kind of unstable energy. This energy changed them before they could teleport back and from that moment on they have SUPER POWERS. The character development starts strong (for some) but after the first act it feels like though the script lost focus. There was no character fleshed out completely and some characters didn't even get any development. The music was average to say the least with no memorable score (however many movies these days are guilty of this SIN). The atmosphere within this movie is constant with a feel towards the serious like the batman trilogy. The story flow is the biggest problem with this movie, because after they have gained their powers they decided to skip one year. It would have been better to use this time to develop and enrich the characters within this movie. Based on the three act structure I would say that the movie has a strong beginning, okay middle, and an enjoyable but not perfect ending. The movie is about 90 minutes long, which is much shorter than an average superhero movie these days. However, this isn't a bad thing. Within this time span the director Josh Trank was able to make a movie that checked almost everything on the list, please note MOVIE. When comparing this with similar movies within its genre it becomes clear that this isn't a real Superhero movie. Yes people have powers and there is a bad guy, however for a superhero movie there isn't any superhero moment or feel. That is why I think this movie BOMBED at the box office. This movie IS NOT A SUPERHERO MOVIE. With the growing amount of superhero movies these days people have created expectations of what a superhero movie should be, based on movies like batman or marvel. When a movie like Fantastic Four shows up that is not similar to any other superhero film people are happily to start saying that it is bad, which is very harsh and unfair. While this movie isn't as good as a typical marvel movie or other hero film it is very enjoyable. This movie contains many scientific explanations and technical constructions etc. etc. so in essence it is a SCIFI film. So what am I saying? Fantastic Four is an enjoyable movie that does not deserve the harsh backlash that it got. People should accept the movie for what it is and not what it could have been or what they wanted it to be. When you watch it please watch it expecting it to be an average SCIFI film and I promise you it will not disappoint. This movie was truly Fantastic. I give this movie a 6.5",

            "content": "While the movie had lazy action scenes and a time consuming back story it did manage to interest me.I really applaud the person who came up with the rethinking of the original back story of the Fantastic Four. It certainly made the movie a whole lot more engaging and to some extent let off the errors of this movie. Another positive thing about this movie was that it was much more darker than the 2005 movie although I don't think this tone was fitting for the the characters and their powers.In terms of acting it was adequate. I especially enjoyed Miles Teller as Mr Fantastic whom I had low expectations of. Fox did certainly choose a wide variety of talented individuals. I preferred to see a younger version of the Fantastic Four.Now while I enjoyed the movie, that didn't stop me forgetting the major flaws.Fantastic Four had a running time of 106 minutes but 2/3 of it was the origin and the experiment meaning only 1/3 was the Fantastic Four in action. I strongly disliked this decision as I paid \u00a310 to see the Fantastic Four not their dimension traveling machine. Unfortunately characters like the Thing and Victor Von Doom didn't receive enough screen time despite their significance. Jamie Bell, who is known for the playing the the title role in Billy Eliot managed to become likable although not as nearly as funny or immerse as Michael Chiklis's portrayal of the Thing. However I enjoyed Victor Von Doom's portrayal at the beginning of the movie though I wish we saw more rivalry between Reed and Victor. Sadly as Victor became Doctor Doom, Toby Kebells portrayal was truly doomed. It wasn't really Toby's fault but the directors and writers.Nevertheless the costume department need to be sacked for their poor effort. Doom looked like something out of an 1970s Doctor Who episode despite it's \u00a3120 million budget.The worst bit of this film was the truly dreadful fight scene near the end. It lasted for about 2 minutes. Doom was portrayed as an unstoppable villain who easily exterminated everybody yet all 4 of team managed to easily kill him without being harmed.Whilst the cast seem quite friendly off screen, there wasn't enough of a chemistry between the Fantastic Four. Ben Grimm and Reed Richards really didn't seem to know each other that well and Sue and Johnny felt more like awkward relatives than brother and sister.A aspect of the story that I felt was stupid was the fact that Sue didn't actually join the team at first on the expedition and only received her powers through a explosion. This felt unnecessary. Please note I'm not a professional and most likely don't know what I'm talking about ;)",

It seems to me that people went in having already decided to dislike it, and nobody wants to be the one to go against popular opinion by saying it wasn't bad.The one bit of criticism that I feel has some merit is that the climax is rushed. The movie is actually quite short, so filmmakers certainly had enough time to put more in if they'd wanted. A wasted opportunity, I felt.Aside from that, though, I enjoyed it. It was supposed to be an origin story, and it did that very well. The effects were infinitely superior to the 2005 version, and the acting was up and down. I think Chris Evans was a slightly better Human Torch, but I prefer Kate Mara's Invisible Woman. Miles Teller's Reed was a bit weak at times, but nothing too horrible. By far the best performance was Reg E. Cathey as Dr. Franklin Storm; it's a shame his part wasn't bigger.People have been comparing this unfavorably to movies like The Avengers, and I really don't think that's fair. True, it's not nearly as good as The Avengers, but few comic book movies are. Had this come out in say, 2008, the response would have been mostly positive, I think. Especially since, as I said, it was certainly much better than the '05 attempt - and not just in effects, though that was definitely the most obvious improvement.I hope all the impotent internet rage doesn't dissuade them from making a sequel, since they've set themselves up nicely for one and I'd like to see it.

First, they begin throwing around things like alternate dimensions, a world much like outs but more primitive. Then it gets worse. The characters get powers from green veins of power in the rocks on an alternate planet?? Give me a break. That's weak even for superhero origin stories. And in the original marvel version, they got caught in a space storm. Then after getting their powers, every character lost his charm. Reed becomes extremely cowardly, Ben is just whiny, Sue is useless, and Johnny is just plain dumb. They skip over the best part of the original which is them finding out what they can do and how to use their powers and instead, the fantastic four spend a year in a government research facility training to be human weapons. The only redeeming quality is that, at least in this one the thing looks like he's actually made of rocks instead of plastic. I assure you it's not a fair trade. There is no backstory, no plot advancement. Just Ben being used as a human (or rock) war machine, Johnny begging to be exploited and sue flying around in a bubble. They barely even use their names and don't even call themselves the fantastic four until the very last minute. And then, to make matters worse, the movie's villain only shows up for the last 15 minutes and I have absolutely no idea what happened to him or even what his power is. He can blow up people's heads, move rocks, create black holes???? And I have no idea what they did to defeat it or how they managed it. This may be one of the worst superhero movies I've ever seen.

There was no need to retell the origin story just ten years after another Fantastic Four movie told it. We're fortysomething minutes into the movie before they get their powers and then, when they do have them, they never do anything impressive with them. Not to mention they overcomplicated the whole origin and repeated the first movie's mistake of shoehorning Dr. Doom into things (more on him in a moment). Poor Sue Storm gets screwed over royally here. First, they robbed her of her rightful place as one of the four (she gets her powers just by being in the lab when the other four return with the cosmic energy or whatever). Second, she's portrayed as this frigid and colorless robot. None of the characterizations were right but hers was probably the most insulting. Reed doesn't fare much better. We're told constantly of his intellect but you sure wouldn't know it from the way he speaks or acts throughout this thing. Miles Teller is just awful and hopefully will never lead a movie again. Jamie Bell and Michael B. Jordan leave no impression, despite playing the two members of the group with the biggest personalities. Finally we come to Dr. Doom. I could not stand what was done to Doom in the prior Fantastic Four movies. Little did I know it could actually get worse. Doom is wrong in every way. He's some whiny hipster douche who, like the movie's version of Reed, we have to be told how smart he is because it never comes through in the performance. When I first saw him in his powered form I was ready to quit the movie. Here Doom looks absolutely ridiculous, like something out of a crappy horror movie. Doom is one of the most iconic Marvel villains. I do not understand what is so damn hard about getting him right in the movies. They always insist upon changing his personality, his origin, his look, his everything. Whatever this thing is in this movie, it is no Dr. Doom that I recognize.Director Josh Trank, in an effort to stop this movie's failure from hurting his budding career, is putting all the blame on 20th Century Fox. Because people liked his previous movie Chronicle and because people hate corporations, a lot of folks are buying his excuses. Frankly I'm not among them. Unlike some, I was not enjoying the first hour of this movie. I did not think it was a great way to go for an FF movie and I cannot imagine where Trank could have gone in the second half that would have made it work. Everything is dour and bleak and depressing. Here's a clue for anyone looking to tackle the Fantastic Four: if you don't think this concept is fun, you don't need to be doing this movie. This was not a happy experience in the least. Save the emo stuff and the lack of color for movies about Batman.The best part of the movie was when the gum-chewing guy got killed. He's one of the most annoying characters in recent movie history. If I had to endure one more scene of his smug, irritating face while he chewed that gum I would have screamed. As I said before, the origin story was overcomplicated (and unnecessary). The \"heroes\" are all unlikable assholes. The movie lacks any real point and does everything it can to steer itself away from what the Fantastic Four should be about, namely exploring the unknown and the wonder and adventure that comes with that. Thankfully this thing bombed and we are hopefully spared any sequels. If another FF movie is ever made, I hope it's by someone who gets the characters and the concept because I do believe an FF movie done right could be truly amazing.",

It is this grittiness that makes this film enjoyable to watch because it makes the dangerous threat actually seem like a game changer whilst actually exploring both the physical and psychological traumas of the power-giving accident.The villain however is one of the downsides to the film. Yes Doctor Doom is the main villain of the ff but they have others which could be transferred brilliantly into film. I'm not saying they didn't do a good job of bring the character to life and i applaud them for actually coming up with a legitimate reason for the suit but his powers are virtually ungrounded through out the film with no limits or actual base work of what they actually are.The second bug bear is the length of the film. At a running time of only 1hr 40mins it isn't long enough to explore the characters and plot lines deeply enough. The relationships between the characters are virtually sidelined in favor of rushing through what could have been great character scenes in favor of cramming in plot points to stick to the tight time schedule. Overall the film has made massive improvements over the cinematic takes that have come before it but there is still room for improvement but none the less i would recommend it to anyone to go and see. 8/10",

They spend way too much on establishing nothing, making weird changes to the Storms and Doom, and giving Richards the Spiderman treatment: his thing is that he's literally in the top ten smartest Terrans, but it's more important that he's young.They actually giving us a more interesting (not hard) origin story, and then went right back to (explicitive deleted) it up again, changing Sue's powers so they don't need the Fantastic Four flying car, and turning them into a military asset instead of a scientific research team. They even took Ben's mechanic abilities away.They also dehumanize Doom, completing changing who he is, his powers, his motivations, and even his classic look: which cosplayers have shown works in real life, they just had to tweak it.I'll maintain, pre-disney, there hasn't been a good F4 movie. Eventually we'll see them get introduced to the MCU in some movie, they'll probably buy Stark Tower because the MCU is too broken to have two special towers at the same time.",

The scenes in the beginning between Reed and Sue make you feel like they are going to have some sort of romantic relationship but the movie never actually does that. And I think Johnny Storm and his father were terrible actors, it was so hard to watch god.And the worst of all was.. Victor Von Doom. You basically have no idea why he decides to be the 'bad guy', like we don't know of any motives he has, it's as if he's just bad cuz he's..bad?Literally, the movie is great, really cool, until after the one year jump mark, it just goes downhill after that.

            "content": "Fant4stic (The first mistake fox made about this film) is the re- imagining of one of Marvels most beloved teams. This is the fourth time they have tried to do a Fantastic Four movie (If you include the one from the 90's) and each one has missed the mark completely! Before the trailers came, this film was getting a lot of hate and scepticism as there was no promotional footage or images before the trailer. But everyone had a bit more hope when the trailers came until Fox made an awful move of embargoing reviews 12 hours before the film was released. This was Fox basically telling us that they had no faith or trust in the movie...and they were right!Fant4stic was an absolute mess! Once again Fox has managed to mess up these characters again and put them in another horrible film! For the first 15 minutes or so, the film seemed to be going along smoothly and didn't find many flaws in it but after that the film got progressively worse! My first major criticism of the film is that this film is lifeless and dull. Never before have I seen a superhero film with so little charisma and charm to it! I know they were trying to go 'darker' but many other superhero films (The Dark Knight trilogy) have done it but still had an engaging, immersive plot and story. The reason this film is so lifeless is that nothing happens in it! It takes them 40 minutes into the film before they can get their powers and you would think the films pace would pick up by then...sadly it does not. The screenwriters had a really bad idea of skipping a whole year after they got their powers! So the next time we see them they've already gotten use to their powers! We could've spent at least a few minutes and scenes watching them get used to their powers and trying to control them!Even though the cast is very talented, they can't save the film unfortunately. The lines they say to each other feel forced and don't feel natural and the screenplay is sometimes very cringe worthy. The four also have no chemistry with each other which also makes the scenes with them together even more painful! You know a film is bad when even talent like Miles Teller, Micheal B Jordan, Jamie Bell and Kate Mara can't even give of their talent because the film is so sloppy.$100 million went into this film so the CGI must be good? Right? Once again no. Some of the effects were laughable and you can even tell where the green screen is in some shots. The worst CGI has to go to when Reed Richards transforms his face from a disguise back to himself. That scene looked atrocious and brought me straight out of the movie!Then there's the last act...which I can safely say may be one of my least favourite last acts ever. Out of nowhere Dr.Doom appears from the alternate dimension and gets brought back onto Earth where he is getting checked up on. He then kills everyone in the building and goes back into the alternate dimension with him taking the machine so no one can follow him. He then wants to destroy Earth with absolutely no motives other than \"I am the bad guy and there needs to be an obstacle for the Fantastic Four to overcome\" The Fantastic Four get to the other dimension and in 5 minutes they kill him. And then the film ends. There was no build up, no pay off, and an extremely anti-climatic ending. Once again they ruined one of Marvels greatest foes! He looks ridiculous for starters, he has no motives and is killed in minutes!The film has no development, no plot, no character arcs and especially no action as we never see them use there powers for most of the film! Where Fant4stic failed is where the MCU is not and I think that is a main reason for this not being a good film! What Fox are trying to do now is build a connected universe and build everything up for sequels and in doing that the film is all exposition and set up with no pay off at the end and instead of trying to build a cohesive and effective world where you can make sequels and lots of money, they should of tried to make a cohesive, effective, well done film.I do not recommend Fant4stic and give it a 2/10 and not a 1/10 only because the first 15 minutes were watchable.",

And why do they ALWAYS make Dr. Doom one of the original exploration team members, ultimately giving him super powers?? It certainly wasn't a selling point for the first set of movies! Doom has no superhuman physical abilities!! He's all tech and magic! Johnny and Sue are blood, one of them is not an adopted refugee from Kosovo! African American comic fans deserve an African American hero like Luke Cage, or an African hero like the Black Panther! Characters who are actually of African descent! Stop giving them black versions of white characters! They deserve better!! Do a Hancock sequel for crying out loud! THAT movie was great! I wish that trying to please a demographic was the only thing wrong with this film! Unfortunately, it was only the last six inches of a very large iceberg! Not only was Doom nowhere close to his highly successful comic book counterpart, Neither were the FF! The Thing and Torch are supposed to be funny, not pathetic!! Sue was NOT a scientist! Johnny was NOT a scientist! Ben was a football jock over 6 feet tall, not Reed's 5 foot 7 lab assistant! I don't understand why the film makers had to repeat so many of the mistakes that sank the last two films!

            "content": "Honestly, this is one of the worst superhero movies I've seen.After Tim Story's Fantastic Four films, I was pretty glad that Fox had decided to reboot the Fantastic Four and start anew. I thought that maybe, Fox might get things right and finally make the Fantastic Four movie we've all been waiting for.Instead, Fox has given us a film with no meaning and no character development. The film starts off with Reed Richards as a kid, who is trying to invent a teleporter. Ben Grimm eventually helps him, and the two become best friends. A few years later, Reed and Ben try the experiment again at the science fair, which attracts the attention of Dr. Franklin Storm from the Baxter Building. Dr. Storm offers Reed a full scholarship to work at the Baxter Building, where Reed meets Victor Von Doom, Johnny Storm, and Susan Storm. Together, they build a larger version of a teleporter, and enter a new dimension. There, they all get their powers.To start off, the film has a solid cast (Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, and Jamie Bell). Acting was OK to good. The only bad thing was that they didn't seem to fit in their roles.However, despite the cast, the film had little to no backstory for any of the characters. Besides Reed and Ben, we have no idea who the characters were like in the past, their childhood, etc.After Susan, Johnny, Reed, and Ben get their powers, the film starts becoming boring. In fact, once the government becomes interested in the Four, the film goes on a dark and dull path. There is absolutely no meaning to the plot. The government takes interest in the dimension (now known as Planet Zero) that the Four have visited, and forces Dr. Storm and Reed to build a new, advanced teleporter to help their military get there.Once the military reaches the dimension, they find Victor Von Doom, who was thought to be dead. With no reason whatsoever, Doom takes on a dark path and wants to destroy Earth and create his own world in Planet Zero.Just when things could get interesting, the film continues being dull. The fight between Doom and the Four was incredibly boring and predictable. Doom, who is one of the most powerful beings in the comics, is made to look like a weird machine with weak powers. The Four was also made to look weak against Doom, when their powers can do much more in the comics. The only good thing about the final fight in the film was the CGI, which was not impressive, but okay.Overall, this film was fantastically boring. The end was cheesy, and the film is highly predictable and dark. Out of the many superhero titles, this is perhaps one of the worst films out there. Even if you are curious or want to see how bad it is, you are better off skipping this film and saving your money.",

            "content": "Honestly, I'm not sure, but that's beside the point.Anyway, the \"Fantastic Four\"... I think a renaming is in order, to be honest. I prefer Flummoxed Foursome. The Flummoxed Foursome are bland, unequivocally boring characters. They remind me of the room. Not the movie, but just an empty room, with nothing in it but bareness. It's a bit like building up a fancy four-bedroom joint, then remembering you forgot about the furniture and the roof (yes, that is a snipe at the budget leading to this mess).Of course, big movies with big budgets flopping at the box office is not a new occurrence, but when you create something this terrible with an estimated $120 million, you have to ask yourself what went wrong. For me, it's perfectly simple. The Fancy-less Four as characters have no personalities to speak of, and with the addition of a script laced with time-skips and nothing else, there was always going to be a serious problem with pacing. I think Doom gets half an hour of screen time, if that. Maybe. I was so bored by the time his first appearance came around that I stopped keeping track. And that's precisely the problem. I sat through movies like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, and even then I wasn't as bamboozled by the lack of... well, anything, as I was with this movie. The incongruity surrounding a would-be clich\u00e9d plot of heroes banding together is stifled by the fact that the entire run time consists of build-up, with one final act so jilted and rushed it feels like Josh Trank forgot superhero movies are supposed to have action sequences and hastily threw it in near the end of production.Now for my favourite part of any review... acting. Wait, there were actors in this movie?! I forgot... almost. Miles Teller is simply a miscast actor, and has zero chemistry with his fellow leads. He is the most uninspiring lead in a superhero movie since the Dragonfly in Superhero Movie, but at least that was deliberately satirical. Jamie Bell and Kate Mara seem bored with the proceedings, but the crowning ace is undoubtedly Michael B. Jordan. Here we see an actor so arrogant and pretentious it's insulting to the viewer. I imagine getting smacked around the face with a wet fish is less painful than watching his performance. Or maybe getting stabbed with a swordfish is a close second. The truth is, I don't care for the controversy surrounding his casting. I only judge him as an actor... and he does so little in this movie that isn't awful that that's my judgement complete. In short, don't watch. Just don't. Seriously. A lobotomy on a Friday night might be a more entertaining alternative. This movie is just flat out boring, and has, I think, killed any chance of ever seeing the Fantastic Four have the big screen portrayal comic book fans deserve. The Fantastic Four are now the Farcical Flagbearers of Trank's less- than-appealing method of directing and I, for one, am disappointed.And amused.",

But sure, I would watch the movies when presented with an opportunity to do so.And it wasn't before 2021 that I had the opportunity to sit down and watch the 2015 reboot of an already mediocre superhero quartet. And writers Jeremy Slater, Simon Kinberg and Josh Trank just didn't really manage to win the lottery here with this movie. Essentially then the 2015 reboot titled \"Fantastic Four\" was every bit as unnecessary and pointless as I had initially anticipated it would be back in 2015.The movie felt wholeheartedly unnecessary. Sure, it was watchable, and definitely had some nice CGI effects, this being a Marvel movie after all. But wow, this movie was not a great addition to the franchise.Sure, aspects of the storyline were interesting, but the movie was rather mundane and slow-paced. So not enough contents were in the storyline to make it a wholesome movie.And I just don't understand that whole political correctness tsunami that has been pounding through Hollywood for many years already. It just made absolutely no sense to turn the Johnny Storm character into a black character. It just doesn't prove accurate to the comic books.The acting in \"Fantastic Four\" was adequate, though nothing outstanding really. People here were putting on fair enough performances, given the limitations of the script and the lack of character development. I have to say that all of the characters portrayed in this 2015 reboot feel like one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs.A movie like director Josh Trank's \"Fantastic Four\" is a movie that you watch for the special effects and visuals. Yeah, I said it. And I stand by that, because the storyline here is vague and one that I will have forgotten completely come tomorrow.Ultimately then \"Fantastic Four\" was generic and mediocre, just as I had expected it to be.

Not only was she described as smart, she was written as smart.I also liked that it actually felt like a movie about the man that created the Fantastic 4, Mr. Reed Richards. The actor took the role and made it work, showing us all of Reed's developing strengths, as well as his foibles and humanity.Overall, I thought the play of the government seizing control of the team, the work being forced upon them to open up the next portal, and the trials of the team were well done.BUT...I think an extra 20-25 minutes to develop Johnny and Ben would have been useful. I think they could actually have left Doom out of the movie entirely and introduced, oh...Annihilus!! since he is a pan-dimensional baddie as the chief protagonist, would have made much more sense.Which leads me to say that the extra 20-25 minutes could actually have made the final battle more ...ahem...'Fantastic', and been a proper lead-in to the group remaining together in the end.So, overall for a movie that seems to have it's legion of detractors, I for one will admit I could have used a bit MORE of the movie...as long as it was done to the same level as the first 90 minutes.",

            "content": "If I were to be honest, I didn't have that many expectations for this movie beyond hoping that this will be a good adaptation. Previously, the Fantastic 4 had an unreleased Roger Corman film in the 90s, a flawed but still entertaining 2005 film, and a disappointing sequel \"Rise of the Silver Surfer\". Not exactly the best track record for the original superhero family when it comes to films. Then the trailers for this reboot came out and, despite the controversy surrounding things like the Human Torch being played by an African-American, it showed some exceptional promise with the plot, designs, tone, and effects. Considering that 2015 already had \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" and \"Ant-Man\" under is wing, the stakes couldn't have been raised any higher for the FF. Sadly, its seems this film has left a hollow impression on me.Plot: Even at a young age, Reed Richards had proved himself to be an ambitious young genius. After he and his best friend Ben Grimm managed to make a working teleportation device, an elderly Dr. Storm approaches him to invite him to join a government-funded think tank to perfect his device to help explore an alternate dimension (presumably the Negative Zone). With the help some Storm's children, Susan and Johnny, and former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Victor von Doom, Reed is successful and decides to explore this newfound world with Ben and his newfound friends. However, Doom becomes lost and the four are exposed to unknown energies, thus gaining incredible powers and becoming Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and the Thing. While the guilt-ridden Reed tries to find a way to reverse the effects, the government wastes no time trying to exploit his friends' powers and recreating the device, but that all changes when Doom returns with sinister motives. It is here that the four must unite to save the world.Despite the filmmakers previously claiming that the film is not based on any source material, the story mainly takes elements of the first three volumes of the Ultimate comics, which in itself is a good story, so I was naturally interested to see how they'll translate this into a movie. At first, I was actually liking this movie. The characters were set up nicely, they're for the most part likable even if they're not always best acted, the science and the ideas/applications it presents are great and thoughtful, and even the scene where they all get the powers was a nice and tragic moment. The effects were good, especially with the Thing's well-detailed design, and the Negative Zone's environment had this barren but beautiful look, giving an alien feel. This first third seemed like an ideal set-up for the FF. So what went wrong? Everything after they get their powers! There's a bizarre shift, both in tone and story. There's the subplot about the military wanting to exploit their powers, which appeared fine at first, but not only does it take up the majority of the film, but it lacked presence since there isn't much exploration of this. The characters mostly brood over what's happened to them, which gives the impression that the filmmakers are trying to imitate Batman. Why does Hollywood insist that making superheroes into something dark and edgy like \"The Dark Knight\"? Some heroes aren't made for that and even if they are, Batman would just blend into the crowd rather than be a unique character. The FF are essentially super-powered, scientific explorers who get into fun adventures and fight various villains and while I like the new twists to the Four, they don't much to live up to said traits. Heck, the filmmakers didn't even make time to try and build the team dynamic the comics are famous for. Also, I can't remember a single bit of soundtrack in this movie. That's how bad the music was.Furthermore, the climax is a huge letdown. The film keeps trying to build up to some grand finale (and whatever intended sequel) with very little payoff, in part thanks to the brooding. Doom returns at some point of the film, giving a decent amount of menace, having deadly powers and an understandable plan. It's here that the heroes finally decide to do something about it. This is where the film was suppose to be exciting, but unfortunately the film fails even at that. Not only is the action a bit dull, but this whole part of the movie is WAY too rushed and not much fighting actually happens. I also feel that Dr. Doom is becoming almost as overused as the Joker and that a villain like Annihilus would not only be more fitting for this new world the characters discovered but would also be something fresh to see on the big screen.The 2005 film was far from perfect, but it at least knew what kind of material it was working with. The characters were more memorable because of how they interacted with each other, understand the traits/flaws of one another for the most part, and how they grew together as a family. The lighter tone was ideal, the effects good at the time, and the action fun. Granted, while not much happens in the middle of that film, it made up for it with a thrilling, lengthy battle against Dr. Doom, who was entertaining to watch despite a weak motivation. This reboot fails at all of that with the only remotely good character being Dr. Storm, who was heartfelt and a nice mentor figure.It pains me to say this, but this is not a good year for the Fantastic 4. This reboot suffers very little action, terrible tone shift, brooding characters, short climax, lack of memorable score, and poor direction. A bunch of great ideas were presented, but the film lives up to the term \"wasted potential\". Appropriately, I give this 2015 adaptation a 4 out of 10.",

I realized later that it was because this movie gave neither of us anything to work with. It left nothing. At the time of watching it, I was enjoying myself, and I had a few laughs... but it feels like it's stuck in first gear throughout.Say what you will about the 2005 movie, but I watched that after this one, and enjoyed myself so much more. There's just way more character, humour and even action than in this reboot. I only enjoyed a few laughs during the 2015 Fantastic Four, the biggest of which was when Reed utterly failed an invitation to a fist-pump by Johnny. There's very little character development in this movie. Beyond that she was adopted from Kosovo, we know nothing about Sue, and she barely even cranks a smile. Johnny never becomes a developed character, and thus we just don't care about his angst. About the worst cinema sin happens with a single message flashing across the screen over half-way into the movie.I don't know, there's just something really missing in this movie. By comparison, the 2005 movie gave us these developed characters with complex relationships and really entertaining banter (especially by Chris Evans), whereas the 2015 reboot feels like it barely even happened. I didn't much care for the Thing being all-CG either, he just doesn't feel authentic.I guess I should've smelled doom coming when they marketed this movie as dark and serious. Marvel, that's why I prefer you to D.C., you've got a much better idea on how to make entertaining superhero movies, and you should've poured that same energy and spirit into the reported First Family of Marvel. As it is, this reboot only sheds the movies it was supposedly trying to outdo in a much better light. A big whoopsie, and it accounted for the most sombre Marvel cinema experience I've had.",

You spend a lot of the time listening to the characters babble. For a comic book movie I was expecting just a little bit more action. Doesn't have to be over the top, but give us a little bit more than 20 minutes of it. Besides The Thing I really felt no emotion or connection to any other character. I actually felt bad for The Thing, I felt sympathy for him. Everyone else felt like they were stuck up their own asses, and you could really care less about them. I did think the graphics were especially cool, and the last 20 minutes or so when they actually fight Dr. Doom I especially enjoyed. That brings up another thing I enjoyed. Seeing Dr. Doom in the last act was IMHO pretty cool. His look, his power, the way he had no sympathy for anyone but himself and just killed people. Loved it. The movie has very few fun and cool elements to it. Other than that, believe me it is incredibly boring.",

This film is an introduction of 1 hour with 46 minutes, which is a total error.Any movie has an introduction, a development and a conclusion, but Fantastic Four does not have the last 2 aspects (and that are too important) history develops slowly, giving to know the characters one by one in a way little showy and poor. Development in the characters does not exist, there is no personality in them, not even the villain is interesting, there is no reason and no reason to be villain.Josh Trank and the same FOX not knew handle the start of these super heroes, let us hope that in future, the 4 fantastic or \"Fantastic Four\" have a movie just and decent, let us hope that Disney-Marvel take advantage of this situation.

Not releasing it to critics, or asking them to withhold their reviews speaks to me of a lack of confidence in your own work. Unfortunately, that lack of confidence was entirely deserved. Fantastic Four is a terrible movie, it's very slow to start, with very limited character introduction and almost no back story. Relationships that are pivotal \u2013 such as the friendship between Ben Grimm and Reed Richards \u2013 get all of five minutes of screen-time, which makes it very difficult to follow along with decisions made by these characters. The history between Sue Storm and Victor Doom is another such matter, a hint or two, but no explanation, no back story and therefore no motivational background for anything the characters do. The movie is relatively short, compared to some of the others in the genre, and certainly could have benefited from a bit more expos\u00e9. Unfortunately, adding more background would have further slowed down the storytelling, and it's already too slow. Too much time staring at computer screens, tinkering away and talking. And, being a scientist myself, I found myself annoyed with the 'science' in this movie. Watching a superhero movie requires a certain suspension of belief but can still be very enjoyable, prime examples of such movies are the first Avengers or the first Iron Man. But then there are movies like this, which frankly, when it comes to the science and the practice of it are on par with Prometheus (the guy making the map gets lost? Come on\u0085). One 'successful' trial run does not a safe process make, nor does it seem likely to me that a kid as smart as these characters presumably are would go around sticking his hand into a completely unknown 'alien' substance. I could go on and on about what bothered or disappointed me about this movie, suffice it to say that after having vehemently discussed all that is wrong with this movie for 45 minutes I still hadn't run out of major issues. All in all, Fantastic Four felt unfinished, ill- thought out and downright boring.",

I don't know why 20th can't get there act together to make a descent Fantastic Four film but they can't.Which is sad because I think Chronicle(Josh Trank's first film) was a superhero film classic, I think it's a great example of a super hero film. When I heard of the cast and the director that would be be making this film, I got excited. I think I got blind sided like 20th century fox did when they got this cast and crew together. Because from reports about the production it seems like 20th did nothing as the film was being made and it was quite clear that Josh Trank didn't know or was just overwhelmed by the production of the film. It almost seems like it wasn't even the same director that made Chronicle and this film, because they are the complete opposite in terms of quality.They were able to get very talented actors, they do their best, but even then they seem lost and feel like they are being directed by a director that doesn't know what to do. The talented cast includes Milles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordon, Jaime Bell, and Reg E. Cathey are cast well but when you are not being directed probably and not given a vision, even the greatest actors can't give a proper performance.The first question that came in my head when I left this movie was, \"They did they even get an editor for this film?\" This film has no pacing and editing. It seems like a rough ensemble cut with the studio just cutting out what they didn't like about the film. The film has no character development, scenes just begin and end with no development or the plot being moved forward. You have a great cast and the director just wastes there talent just to fill in exposition or just slightly move the story forward. That's another problem with the film is that it doesn't move forward fast enough or even at all really. It takes forever to get started and the moment the story goes somewhere it ends and all of the studio re-shoots get in the way.Speaking of re-shoots you can tell the studio destroyed what ever \"vision\" Josh Trank had for this film. There are some shots that are just beautiful and capture the characters very well. especially with The Thing and Sue Storm. You can see a glimmer of the vision idea almost shine through in the first act but by the time the third act hits the film makes no sense. It seems like even the actors have just given up on the film and so has everyone behind the camera.I saw the film earlier today and I can tell you that I'm already forgetting what happened in the film. It's just forgettable and bland. Form start to finish the film is one note and it's not a very pleasant note. Hopefully 20th Century Fox gives up the film rights or just shelves any future project because they clearly have no idea to make a Fantastic Four film.1.5/4 Stars",

When I registered on IMDb over 12 years ago, my user name was in tribute to the team. And I walked out of the theater with a feeling that could best be described as \"empty\". It was worse than being disgusted or annoyed or appalled...this move was not the Fantastic Four in any sense.Now, my dislike of the film had nothing to do with the changing of The Human Torch's race (as so many of the Fox shills seem to immediately assume); I actually had no problem with that aspect of the change. But his entire CHARACTER was absolutely wrong. Johnny Storm was a fun, if childish guy with a playful streak and a good sense of humor. A \"sense of humor\" is pretty much what the comic book always employed; the team was a family, with its ups and downs, and had it dark moments, but they always landed on their feel and always had a cheerful undertone in the long run. The Fantastic Four in this film was not the Fantastic Four I was accustomed to IN ANY SENSE. This was FAR closer to being \"Chronicle 2\". Morose, dark, depressing, and totally devoid of the sense of fun and wonder that was this property's calling card. It almost more of a \"let's watch these unlikeable kids undergo painful body disfigurements\" feeling than anything.I certainly got the impression that Josh Trank has personal family issues...but I don't go to a superhero movie to watch a spoiled kid go through regression therapy. I'd be surprised if the planned sequel to this film happens, to be honest; there wasn't a likable character in the move (with the temporary exception of Reg E. Cathy's Franking Storm)...I've never walked out of a superhero movie with such a sense of disappointment. Although, as I said previously, I'm an admitted fan of the characters, so someone who wasn't AS aware of the correct back-story and nature of the property might not be AS disappointed.Please, for your own sake, avoid this film.

I also didn't think the 2005 version was as bad as most people thought it was, but again didn't know the source material to feel violated.A few comments to add to all the (redundant) complaints others have mentioned.First, who cares if they change a character's race. Along the same line many are complaining about Reed being portrayed as a nerd - I didn't get that at all. Just because he was smart didn't make him a dork. What WAS a problem with him was his out-of-nowhere becoming a badass in the middle of the fight when the more experienced Thing was down. Didn't work.Second, while my experience was that the lack of chemistry was the biggest issue, I know that can also come from crappy editing. Given the bad pace of the movie I tend to suspect this. Ultimately, of course, it's the director's fault.Third, one of the biggest problems I had was a result of bad trailers and the abrupt ending of the movie. There were scenes in the trailers that seemed to show them, as a team, on some sort of a mission - something about Thing diving out of a helicopter while Reed estimated his landing time. Imagine my surprise when the movie stopped short WITH NO MISSION. I half wondered if there was another half-hour of movie after the credits. So take everyone else's shock with the sudden, anticlimactic ending and double it for me.I will stay hopeful for the sequel since Fox will most assuredly can Trank.

If Avatar could so easily ripped off other movie plot lines without batting an eyelid, why not follow the formula of his past hit? These teens would then goof ball around with their powers in second act, followed by its final act of Victor Von Doom just going nuts. Why oh why? It would had been a better quality story in comparison to this gawd knows what...dud... ><I do not mind the first act of this movie, setting it up realistically. There was a chemistry there for Reed and Ben. However, when they decided to edit Ben out half way through that, I was optimistically hopeful. Then the set up continues with Reed and Sue (add a little sprinkling of Johnny into that mix for the hell of it just because the mythos called for it - not story, but the mythos of Fantastic Four)...i was like ooo-kay.They then introduced Victor into the mix, i was like uh huh. All the while enjoying the set up that they had in this first act. But the problem was, while watching the movie, i felt that this first act was going on for way too long. When were they ever getting powers?It appears that it took them half the time to get to the gist of THE Fantastic Four. By then, i was already tired of prodding along the first act, and it does not help that the Negative Zone (or whatever Planet Zero) was one boring unimpressive wasted-barren-land. zzz. Not to mention the reintroduction of Ben (just because of the mythos yet again. Not because the story needed it but because he needed to be in it again. How convenient).Finally the second act. And boy...by the first few minutes of the second act, i sensed my interest for the film was already dwindling. Second act to me was just a montage. It wasn't even story driven. It was just a montage of scenes put together to show their training (this has been done to death by all superhero movies ever since Spider Man. It is really a chore to sit through it all over again). A montage to also serve as a reason to get Reed Richards back into the story, after they so dumbfounded-ly cut him out at the start of second act. And er...the scene where Ben head butted Reed in the forest...that felt like a tangent being forced into it. yawn.And finally there was the third act. Boy oh boy...they reintroduced Doom. But the look of Doom was what distracted me from it most of the time. He looks like a walking mushroom with his hood on. At least Mario's mushrooms were cute. This Doom, to me, was just a cheap CGI or whatever. At least do a lip sync for him, for crying out loud. It doesn't help that he looks like a crash test dummy that has a voice- over. It was majority because of this Doom, that basically took me out of the movie by this time.They set Doom up as an omni-powered villain with powers that could explode heads just by his thoughts and also blocking lots of bullets by a force field of some kind. And yet...i beg to question why doesn't he just explode the heads of Reed, Ben and Johnny when they fought? Granted Sue may be able to prevent her head from exploding because she had a force field throughout. Obviously Doom knows how to control his powers in that short amount of time when he exhibited it. So why doesn't he?As an analogy, its like: We all know that a cat when confronted will always bite, hiss and scratch. But no cat will suddenly forget about those and tries to use its tail instead as a whiplash fighting mechanism. That was what Doom was to me. He forgot about his omni powers and decided otherwise. He could had easily just gaze upon each of them and exploded our heroes' head.And the final fight - it took place in the boring barren whatever land. That quickly ended as it began. Borefest.And for the love of all movie gods out there. Please do not attempt a Marvel humor at the end just because Marvel did it well, so you have to do it too. That is just following a trend rather than to set out to be innovative. And just because of that one scene alone at the end with its tacky humor...it suddenly came about much more jarring because no where in the whole run time of this movie was there such a display of cheap humor. And suddenly we had this out of place attempt to close the movie out. Sigh.My rating can only be for the first act. End rant >.<",

I loved the old Fantastic Four movies, but it makes sense to reboot due to the new Marvel Movieversum.But just after a few minutes I realized, this movie will get worse and worse. Not only that Susan Storm appears to be too meek, also why for heavens sake did the change the family history and why for crying out loud is Johnny suddenly black? Also I miss the more mature Reed and the back ground story of Ben being a high ranked pilot makes much more sense than him being used as a tool of the military - he is not as dumb, as he is portrayed in the crappy reboot!Hopefully they wont continue this story line! I hoped to see the Fantastic Four joining the Avengers at some point, but these kids should just go home and be ashamed of this movie.",

            "content": "This year's Fantastic Four is dull and dreary and devoid of any thrills.As far as Fantastic Four's faithfulness to the comic book subject matter, we can't speak of it. In terms of audience reaction and entertainment, it fails on all fronts.Gifted young scientists build an amazing machine that teleports matter to an alternate universe. Yearning to be the historically important first humans to travel across time and space, the transport themselves and endure horrifyingly dangerous ramifications. Transformed by the experience, they fight to harness their abilities and must work together when one is turned malevolently villainous.The problem with Fantastic Four as a Marvel action film is its structure. It lumbers about in multiple directions without clarity. At first, it invests nearly 40mins in what the screenwriters surely felt was character and plot development but is in fact filler. Filler focusing entirely upon the scientific accomplishment of building the machine which would ultimately transform them. While this tidbit is vital for the narrative, there is no reason for it to take up 30% of the movie and the execution is so poor it fails in that regard anyway. The next 25 minutes is a montage of the characters and their powers, again, necessary but stretched out. The final 30 minutes is a scramble for a climactic build up and conclusion, which is both random and sloppy. Honestly, to say that even that much 'happened' in the film is a gross overstatement.Jeremy Slater, Josh Trank and Simon Kinberg, are all responsible for this abysmal adaptation. Fantastic Four fails at screen writing 101, there is no central conflict, no propelling force that yields an intuitive story for the audience to latch on. Sure sure, some people may say \"hello, Doctor Doom!\" but he is only featured physically and mentioned in passing for about 15 minutes of the first hour. There is the big bad US government, as always, but they are more a passive villain. It's actually offensive that studio executives green-lit the script in the first place.Fantastic Four is a wholly missed opportunity to improve upon the underwhelming original of 2005. The casting was superb and the actors did an adequate job given the material, but the Marvel film was doomed from the start given the script. The first Fantastic Four might have been cheesy and overly saturated but the 2015 version is dull and dreary.Please check out our website for more full reviews of all the recent releases.",

Nothing like the comic book series.Miles Teller is good, but he is the only cast member who gets a chance to do anything. The other three are relegated to support roles.The first two-thirds of the movie are all about research. Seriously.The first action scenes (of The Thing in battle) take place off-screen. Off-screen. Seriously. It's like a cruel joke on the audience. We sat there and watched Reed sit in a lab for over an hour and when the team finally get their powers\u0085 we are told by a secondary character about all the missions that Ben Grimm is going on. And we see the mission footage on a screen, in the background, while he is talking. In a film of bizarre choices, this is surely one of the most odd.The Ben/Johnny relationship - a key element of the FF appeal - is relegated to one throwaway line in the final minute of the film. It is, I think, the only line of dialogue between the characters in the whole film.Reed escapes at the midpoint of the film. He is soon recaptured after a brief (almost-)action sequence. The escape is meaningless. It accomplishes nothing, and adds nothing to the (non-)story in progress.Nothing that Doom says or does in the final minutes makes sense, but this is probably the worse: he walks through the complex killing everybody he meets. And when confronted by Reed and the other three he simply pushes them away. He does not kill them. Yet, as far as we can tell, the only character is truly dislikes is Reed. So, instead of killing him when he can, he knocks him over and pushes he against a wall.Based on this boring film I'm assuming Josh Trank has NEVER read the comic book series which is frequently fun, always has action and story and likable characters.4/10",

            "content": "With such a glut of superhero movies, and so many of them being returned with big profits (and justification for more) by an audience who at the minute can't seem to get enough, it is always good to have a reminder that actually, the mass audience does have some standards. In previous years you may have been reminded of that by Green Lantern for instance, but this summer it was Fantastic Four that serves to remind the studios that this genre is not a license to print money (well, not every time). To be fair to Fantastic Four, it is not as awful as many would have you believe \u2013 there is just too much money and too many genuinely talented people working on it for it to be a massive failure. However, it is also true to say that while not awful, it is consistently not any good.The narrative is familiar as we have the origin story told again. While it is good to have an introduction to any character (superhero or not), even if you have not heard of Fantastic Four, you almost certainly can see what will happen. Just like many other films in the genre, probably these smart people will get powers by virtue of some accident, and probably that really surely kid will become a villain of some sort; it is rarely complex, so what matters less is the specifics but more using that time to get to know the characters, and then doing something with that investment from the audience. In regard to these two things though, this film does neither.In terms of the characters, although the cast has talent, there is really no spark, no chemistry, no real sense of character. Some of the cast lift it a bit, but these could be cardboard cutouts to all intents and purposes. Perhaps it is just as well the film fails to make us like or even care about these characters, because the second thing (paying off that investment) never happens either. As the origin story section comes to an end, there is a very brief scuffle with Doom in an big video game cut-scene moment, and then the film ends. The final line (the moment of coining the team name) must have seemed like a cool way for the film to end; you can imagine that execs would hope that the 'start of a big adventure' feel to the ending would have the crowd cheering and buying advance tickets for the sequel, but of course nothing ahead of that moment makes that likely at all. This feeling of lack of spark and excitement is felt across all aspects of the film, and unsurprisingly it is passed directly to the viewer. The cast have it too. I do not think anyone here is being cynical, but for sure they must have thought this was an open goal franchise. Teller is dull as anything; Mara doesn't connect to anyone (viewer included); Bell appears to have been told his character will be deep, complex, and tragic \u2013 so he goes for that but is let down by the film. Jordan is the one everyone knows due to lots of idiots wringing their hands over his color, or lots of other idiots failing to see why anyone would be upset by a character being a different race; all of that is nonsense and to be fair Jordan yet again shows he is a good presence in a film \u2013 shame his flame effect is just one of many so-so effects. The supporting cast is nicely deep, although nobody has much to do, so at least it is fun to see how many people you recognize and remember from where (its him from House of Cards / Oz / The Wire, or him from Simpsons, or him from Oh Brother.In the end, Fantastic Four is not awful \u2013 it is too bland to be awful. It feels like a simple financial decision \u2013 superhero properties are making billions, they had this property doing nothing, so let's get it out there and make that money. The result is a film that is forgettable and empty, with hardly a park or bit of fun to be had.",

Reed, with the help of his childhood friend Ben Grimm(Jamie Bell), has cracked the code to transport elements to an alternate dimension & successfully bring them back. This impresses Dr. Franklin Storm(Reg E. Cathey) & his daughter, Sue Storm(Kate Mara). Now, along with the help of Johnny Storm(Michael B. Jordan) & Victor Von Doom(Toby Kebbell), Reed & Sue have to create a device that successfully sustains human inter-dimensional travel. After they successfully teleport to an alternate dimension, an accident occurs which causes shocking physical transformations in each of them. Now, they must use their new found powers to protect Earth from an old friend turned foe. Fantastic Four is an extremely disappointing movie. Honestly, the trailers are better than the movie. Due to Fox interfering & director Josh Trank's supposed unruly behavior on set, this film is completely dull. There is just one action set piece in the movie which takes place during the climax. This battle seems rushed & just doesn't make up for the lack of action scenes throughout the movie. Being a comic book movie, there is absolutely zero humor in the film. So many cool sequences from the trailer don't even feature in the movie. For example, The Thing's dive bomb sequence. The special effects team have done a good job with The Thing but, completely ruined Dr. Doom. Dr. Doom's glowing tin man look is cringe worthy. Because Doom looks so terrible, he is the least bit intimidating. The makers seem so intent on setting up a sequel to Fantastic Four, that they just didn't bother to make this reboot good enough. Honestly, I just want the Fantastic Four rights to go back to Marvel Studios. It would be amazing to see Dr. Doom battle the Avengers. Dr. Doom is one of Marvel Comics' best villains & deserves to be portrayed to perfection on the big screen. Tim Story's Fantastic Four(2005) & Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer(2007) are much better than this reboot. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan & Jamie Bell don't share half as much chemistry & bonhomie as Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans & Michael Chiklis from the original movies. Speaking of individual performances, Miles Teller is good as Reed Richards. Kate Mara is adequate as Sue Storm. Michael B. Jordan is just not carefree, fun loving & womanizing enough to be Johnny Storm. I'm not prejudiced by the color of his skin. It's just that, you can't even compare Jordan's portrayal of the Human Torch to Chris Evans' superior portrayal in the previous films. Jamie Bell is impressive as Ben Grimm/The Thing. The only positive of this movie is the friendship shared between Reed & Ben. Toby Kebbell is a disaster, compared to Julian McMahon's Dr. Doom from the previous movies, as Victor Von Doom/Dr. Doom. Reg E. Cathey & Tim Blake Nelson are effective as Dr. Franklin Storm & Dr. Allen respectively. Owen Judge & Evan Hannemann are great as Young Reed & Young Ben respectively. Please don't make the mistake of watching Fantastic Four in the theater. Wait for it to come out on DVD & Blu-Ray or watch it when it comes on TV.",

But F4 are originally from a different age, and I can very well understand how any filmmaker would find it difficult to translate the source material to the big screen in 2015. So, I kept an open mind. And no matter how much hate this movie got during production, I still was looking forward to make up my own opinion on it. Too bad it failed on all levels. The cast is actually very good. So is the director, at least I thought he did a marvelous job on Chronicle. But they all fail miserably here. I cannot evenbegin to wrap my head around how such a talented cast are seemingly so incredibly uninspired. The direction is flat and boring, everything feels extremely one-dimensional and uninspired. Editing was bad, music didn't fit well, script and antagonists were shallow and felt rushed, and even the sound effects, costumes, make-up, and every other single element of this movie failed. How this is possible with such a budget and so much talent is to me, again, an huge mystery. I didn't actually believe that I'd see any superhero movie as bad as the original two F4s again. And, of course, the insanely botched Ghost Rider movies. But this one is right down there with them, if not worse.",

This movie has received lots of \"hate\", mostly unwarranted, it seems from comic book fans who rate this movie \"1\" because it deviates from the comic book stories.I have not read any \"FF\" comic books so all I can do it appreciate it on its own merits. Overall I found it to be an entertaining and enjoyable movie.It starts when the characters are in the 5th grade, about 11 years old. While other students are doing what kids that age do one of them, Reed Richards, was inventing a matter transporter. Without much encouragement from his parents or teachers.Switch to 7 years later when they were Seniors in high school, Miles Teller as Reed Richards is doing his best to demonstrate his transporter when he is confronted by a scientist and his daughter. It seems they had been working on the same thing without complete success. They could not retrieve matter but Reed could. So he was invited to study and work at the prestigious institute.There he worked with the scientist's son, Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm, and daughter (adopted) Kate Mara as Sue Storm. Also Reed's old friend, Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm who was destined to become The Thing. They also found drop-out, Toby Kebbell as Victor Von Doom, who was destined to become Dr. Doom.This is the genesis story for the Fantastic Four, the premise is they get transported not to a different place on Earth, but to a different dimension where they encounter terrain like the Earth must have looked millions of years ago, and with unusual energy fields. Interacting with this environment resulted in the \"super\" powers that each of them gained.Not a great movie by any stretch but a nicely entertaining one. It is all fantasy anyway isn't it?",

            "content": "Looking at how the world of superhero movies today has evolved from it's first steps, the early attempts before cgi like 'Captain America' and the Corman 'Fantastic Four' to the signs of possibility laid out by the first Blade movie (For me the pre-cursor to the modern age of SH franchises) all the way up to the giddy heights of 'The Avengers', 'The Dark Knight' & 'Winter Soldier' pretty much the blueprint that all SH movies should be judged against, it seems strange to me that anybody can walk into Josh Tranks 'Fantastic Four' and come out feeling anything but betrayed. 20th Century Fox's cash grab attempt to hold on to the rights of characters they care nothing for is at best an embarrassment to snigger at when you have had a few & at worst perhaps the most inept movie to come from a big studio since, well..ever! To sum up this movie is almost nie-on impossible in a small review here, it's probably best just to read the spate of negative reviews, The first 10 or so on here should be sufficient enough for you just to get a handle on what Fox has cut & pasted together & called a movie. As a betrayal to loyal comic fans & cinema goers in general, Fox has managed to create a film so bad & so blatantly unforgiving in it's awfulness that anyone with half a cinema brain will simply just be picking there jaw up from the ground after the final painful reel (If you thought the Electro-Spider-man face off in ASM 2 was bad, wait till you see Dr Doom's few scenes in this) Of course the blame game & excuses began even before the first audiences started tearing it a new one. It's all well & good to play around & tinker with characters & stories from an original base but if you are going to do it with characters beloved by millions the world over you better make it fresh & relevant which this new rendition, sadly, is the exact opposite. It's highly unlikely that Trank finished this movie by himself, it does have the feel of 3 or 4 different movies strewn together in the same way young Reed Richards pieces his time displacement device in the opening scenes, a bit of junk from this yard, an old car battery, a line of dialogue from that movie, an idea from that Fox exec etc etc. The end result is like watching tumbleweed, it just goes on & on, never going to any one place, sometimes even travelling without moving. If Chronicle showed us anything it's that Trank has a grasp of this genre & has vision, there is nothing here on show that displays any of this and it's far more believable a story to think that the studio that looks at there comic franchises as green machines only took control of it long before the director had any chance of fully forming his take and as such we will probably never ever really know what this was. Much like Alien 3 and David Fincher, a saga more famous than the film itself, Fantastic Four 2015 will always be remembered as a jumbled mess rather than something great to finally put to rest the old 'They'll never make a good FF movie' myth. No doubt the blame game will continue as much as the bad reviews until it's finally forgotten about and dug up for an Empire magazine dissection 20 years from now. Will Trank be given this kind of opportunity again? or have Fox killed a promising career? the proof is in the final product & if he is given a chance at redemption i sincerely hope he manages to shirk off the negativity that this pile of steaming (insert your own word here) has garnered him. To understand the anger that's directed towards this film one must go back to the first 100 issues of the FF, a run of stories so immaculately formed by Lee & Kirby that reading them today it astounds that no one has had the idea of actually adapting them for a modern audience. My guess is that's the FF movie that everybody wants to watch. Sadly for now it seems the real fantastic is still in the 60's comics rather than anywhere on screen so, 'Will anybody be able to make a good FF movie?' it continues.....",

The budget could have been the GDP of a small country! Saving a film with a bad script is like saving the Titanic with a baby's flotation device. The script was terribly amateurish. Clich\u00e9d, devoid of emotion, generic, uninteresting, and all over the place. The plot was as disorganized as a teenager's bedroom, with the villain appearing an hour later that it should have. The entire script of Fantastic Four yelled, \"Amateur!\". I could write a little book about all of the failures in Fantastic Four's writing. The visuals were dumb and lazy. Good Lord, if your script is going to be flatter than Salar de Uyuni, please have the bloody consideration to invest proper money and time into your CGI! Planet Zero looked like a test demo from an outdated video-game graphics engine. I would end this review with a pun about how not \"fantastic\" this reboot is, but that would be too generous of me. Don't watch this film.",

            "content": "Well what can I say about this film. It was a good film. That's all I can say. It is unfortunate that it has been getting bad reviews etc., Well unfortunately I can agree. Another friend of mine was saying that their's action for about 5mins, how true is that. Great action between Victor/Doom() and the Four, namely: Reed(); Johnny Storm/BABE(Michael Jordan); Ben(Jamie....);Sue(); Great action, that only lasted for about 5 or 10mins if even that. The rest was all about the science aspect and the lead up to the aftermath. Like the original actually dealt with plenny of Action, no doubt, it also dealt with when the Four get infected, how they deal with it, and not only that how the PUBLIC deal with that. This film, ie the Reboot, did not deal with any of that. Its like the Four were in seclusion. One thing that really lacked was COMEDY. Every form of Marvel I have ever known, has always had some form of Comedy. However this one NOT ONE. I was surprised. The film starts off with Young Reed and Young Ben trying to build a Teleporter for a Science Fair. Franklin Storm sees this and he and Sue, daughter of Franklin actually want the idea. So they go ahead. I was a bit lost with the government aspect. So then Reed is introduced to Victor/Doom who is said to have started the whole thing. My precious bundle of joy Johnny Storm(son of Franklin) is out car racing and gets into a car accident. So his father collects him and recruits him into helping the rest of the crew, to build this Teleporter. During a one night drunken encounter, Johnny, Reed and Victor. Ben(whom Reed rings him) go through the teleporter with a view of Going through and back within the night. However things go drastically wrong because Reed sticks his hand in some gueye stuff and it explodes. Everyone gets infected. Johnny has become the Human Fireball, Ben the Rock, Reed the Extender and Sue who discovers their ploy, also gets infected when they arrive back on Earth and it explodes. Sue has Invisibility capability. Reed then disappears claiming he is trying to get back to the way he was and the rest of them for that matter. Sue and Ben are tasked by the government to get Reed back. So afterwards when everyone is together, they now have to face their NOW rival former friend Victor or now known as Doom. Then the Four now need a new place and face the Government. Cleverly done I must say when the Government say \"What happens if we say no\", Ben/The Thing seen as saying I think its best you say Yes and My precious Johnny says\"Just say Yes\".",

I was incredibly disappointed with it and regret paying cinema prices to see it.The film is incredibly unbalanced, with the most of it being dragged down by setting up the characters and plot, leaving very little time at the end for the real action to begin, and so it felt very rushed and was extremely unsatisfying.On top of this, the script was very poor and much of the dialogue was very cheesy and felt scripted, particularly during the action sequences, which made it seem very amateur. The films only redeeming factor is it's cast; Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan were particularly good and gave their characters depth and humanity. Kate Mara and Toby Kebbell were also good in their respective roles, however Jamie Bell was totally lost inside the CG 'Thing' which was a shame because he was so good in the beginning pre- transformation.I really would advise you skip heading out and paying cinema prices to see this film and stay home and pay much less to watch the far superior 2005 Fantastic Four.",

I'm certainly not the first to do this (especially for this movie) but I gave F4 a \"10\" because it absolutely does not deserve the average of \"4\" that it currently holds. My true rating for this flick is a solid \"7\". Yes, the re-shoots are obvious. Yes, there are flow issues with the story line. However, kudos go out for a fresh approach to this well-known story and a movie that delivered solid acting performances overall. I do not regret the money or time spent watching this film, and it will be added to my personal collection. It's a movie worthy of Marvel though admittedly watered down a bit. For all the Fox haters out there, I'll remind you that Fox has done an outstanding job with X-Men overall. The F4 brand is in good hands and, regardless of the box office performance, I'm hopeful of seeing a stronger sequel.This film is worth seeing at least once. The humor was well timed and had me laughing out loud on several occasions, more than Ant-Man did anyway. Oh wait... does that touch a nerve? I know I know... Marvel can do no wrong as long as they stick within the standard MCU that they have created. I can't help but wonder what the naysayers will think of Deadpool.

The end results painfully show what happens when not enough time is put into pre-production. For starters, the script clearly needed some big rewrites. There's WAY too much back story concerning the heroes and the villain. Not only that, when the big crisis FINALLY rears its head, there is only about twenty minutes of the movie left to devote to this threat and how it's handled. Additional script problems include that the characters (both the heroes and the villain) are flatly written at best and fairly stupid at their worst, and NO ONE really gets a moment when they struggle with their new abilities.With such an inadequate script, it seems that anyone connected with the movie was so demoralized, they didn't try to punch things up. The casting is all wrong. I am not a comic book expert, but I believe the characters were all somewhat seasoned ADULTS in the comics, not people barely out of their teens. The direction isn't particularly well done. The movie is not only lacking awe and a sense of wonder, the (very limited) action is not exciting at all.Toss in some cheesy special effect here and there, what the movie ends up being is a real misfire. Based on what 20th Century Fox has done with this franchise to date, I really hope they let their rights to the material expire so that someone else can PROPERLY translate the comic to the silver screen.",

The Fantastic Four don't feel like a family, they barely feel to be even a team or group since all four are not on screen at the same time until the very end. Even the Tim Story movies and the unreleased 1994 film were able to get the family or team part right as all four were on screen at the same time much as necessary. Also it takes an hour for them to get their powers, a whole lot nothing happens as if the second act was missing, and there is only one action scene in the entire movie. This is suppose to be a superhero movies and action scenes are required. They were replaced with unnecessary boring scenes. Also the action scene against Dr. Doom just happens with no build up or reason why Dr. Doom went evil except he is the villain in the comics. Also the editing was horrible, especially Kate Mara's hair/wig. They reshoot many of the scenes as if they didn't care to be consistent with her scenes. If the producers didn't care for the movie, why should we?",

The Thing, Mr. Fantastic, Sue, Johnny, even Doom are totally different than they are from the source material, totally different than they were in any of the movies. It's not just the usual movie deviations, these just aren't the Fantastic Four.Doom is the worst of the bunch. He was sort of a good guy, and then became evil for no describable reason. They sort of glossed over his transformation into the Big Bad with a brief explanation that made little sense on the whole. Just accept it, just say that you understand and get on with the movie.The movie, well, two-thirds of it is a set up and a necessary one. They not only have to set up the characters but take the time to explain how outstandingly different they are from the Fantastic Four everyone knows. It takes up the bulk of the movie.And then the final third rushed in a panicked sort of way. Hey, here is the action, here is the conflict that needs to be resolved, let's do it all as fast as we can.And it's all for a darker feel that fails to be dark and turns into a parody of itself. They did the same thing with a little more success in the Amazing Spider Man reboot, where they turned Peter into a bully rather than a lovable smart alack.In both reboots, it didn't really work, in both films it turned them into a parody of themselves, setting the scene for a lackluster film that audiences hated.And that is after the first two films disappointed audiences.I guess the lesson here is, \"if you aren't going to make it better, don't bother to make it.\"",

Look at all the X-Men movies. Do they even know where they were going? Look what they did with Deadpool in X-men Origins. Horrendous. 20th Century Fox should give up their rights to Disney since the Avenger movies seem to be on the right page. The comics have a wealth of information and stories. Why change it when the comics knew what they were doing? No wonder Fanatic Four wasn't released on normal media outlets like other movies like Ant-Man and Avengers: Age of Ultron, or Captain America: Winter Solider.

There has to be solid effort, I mean, really, indie movies can be more entertaining.I can't say better than how the top reviewers here have said, they got it right:The movie had it, HAD it... right until the big launch. After that it sort of narrowed down to chasing Waldo and then saving the world faster than Superman. But as much as they had it, a lot of stuff was really over-clich\u00e9d. In the long run, it could be forgiven, it's a superhero movie, after all, but with the predictable start and the obvious finale, only one question remains - what the **** have they done to Doom? I thought Malekith was the worst character design, but Doom is one of the most iconic villains in comic history. He has to be something more than... C-3PO. Seriously, 40 years they've done it better.Besides that, Reed was quite likable. Can't say that I like the actor, but he pulled it off. Susan's actress I can't stand after Transcendence. That horse-face just begs to be punched, it feels wrong to see it have emotions... Personal feelings aside, all she did in this movie was being the object of desire. Nothing special in her character was ever discovered, except for maybe her passion for music and patterns.Human Torch... well, that's just wrong. Why not make Ben black? Would suit him perfectly. Or Reed? That would be a laughing stock - intelligent *censored*. But no... you have to torch the black man! Torch the black man! Black people do well with comedy, but... I ain't a comic fan, but Torch is a crazy white trash. White. There's a huge gap in personality, a huge level of crazy and obnoxious that only whites can be... This actor... felt terribly out of place. Let him drive, by all means, gangsta stuff, but believing he is a narcissistic flaming guy? No way...Ben Grimm had spot-on kid actor. And an absolutely unfitting grown-up. Not only unfitting to the growth pattern, but also unfitting to the idea of the character. First we see a tall, chubby narrow-eyed bugger. He grows up to be short, slim, absolutely different-eyed guy? Besides, friendship doesn't work like that. If he and Reed were so close, no friend would just go nuts and say \"I ain't your friend\".Doom was as token as they come. Instead of some believable smart guy who really, really gets screwed big time and now holds endless grudge against all the good - he is a douche who acts like a douche, sorta gets left behind, and... voila, I'm Ultron, I'm building a new world.And how they got their powers... There was \"three\" of them, Susan wasn't really even affected, much less explained, why does she turn invisible. Okay, Ben was crushed by rocks, radiation absorbed them to keep him alive, Reed was probably malformed and that as the only solution the radiation found to keep him up, and the black man was set on fire... *snort* Susan was just knocked unconscious on the site. What, the radiation felt that Susan would be embarrassed? Or she was supposed to hide in fear and save herself from this emerging threat? Anyway, their power attainment was extremely straightforward.After that... they just fast-forwarded through the plot we don't really give two damns about, before pushing that Prometheus-style finale.In conclusion, this is the movie you sort of start to enjoy, giggle, eat some popcorn, relax... then you start to think: \"the ****?\" And before your thought is complete, you see the happy end, wondering... was that some TV series pilot?",

Basically Reed Richards (Whiplash's Miles Teller) and Ben Grimm (Billy Elliot's Jamie Bell) have worked together on a prototype teleporter, at a science fair it attracts the attention of the director of government-sponsored research institute Baxter Foundation, Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey). Reed is recruited to join Storm's children, scientist Sue Storm (127 Hours' Kate Mara) and somewhat reckless technician Johnny Storm (Chronicle's Michael B. Jordan) to complete a \"Quantum Gate\", designed by prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell). The experiment is successful and the gate can transport into a parallel dimension known as \"Planet Zero\", facility supervisor Dr. Allen (Tim Blake Nelson) plans to send NASA scientists through to venture, but Reed, Johnny, Ben and Victor embark on an unsanctioned journey using the Quantum Gate to Planet Zero. On the world filled with otherworldly substances Victor causes the surface to collapse and an eruption, Victor is left behind as the landscapes breaks up, the others make it back to the shuttle, but as Sue helps to bring them back the machine explodes, the bodies of Reed, Johnny, Ben and Sue are altered on a molecular-genetic level. They have gained super-human conditions and abilities beyond their control; Reed can stretch like rubber, Sue can become invisible and generate energy forces fields, Johnny can engulf his body in flames and fly, and Ben has become a bigger rock-like creature, \"The Thing\", with enhanced strength and durability. While Reed blames himself and escapes the facility, to find a cure, the others are held in confinement for study and experimentation on their conditions and abilities, it is a year later that Reed is found as a fugitive and returned. Equipped with specialised suits designed to keep up with the abilities of them, for stabilisation, control and containment, the deal Dr. Allen makes with him is if he opens another portal to Planet Zero, he will help find a cure for their conditions. Arriving in the parallel universe the explorers are shocked to discover that Victor is alive, he has also gained abilities, the power to control the elements and telekinetic abilities, he now dubs himself as \"Doom\" and has become vengeful, deluded and evil as he wants to destroy the Earth and recreate Planet Zero, he starts his rampage killing Dr. Allen and Professor Storm. While in the realm he has built a structure to consume the landscape of Earth, he activates it from Planet Zero, but the reunited team of Reed, Ben, Johnny and Sue confront the antagonist in a destructive battle, Doom is eventually disintegrated in his own machine and the portal is closed. In the end the four Reed, Ben, Johnny and Sue returned to Earth are rewarded for their heroics with a new base for operations by the U.S. military, they decide to use their powers to help people and adopt the name the \"Fantastic Four\". Also starring Mary Rachel Dudley as Mrs. Richards, Chet Hanks as Jimmy Grimm, Mary-Pat Green as Mrs. Grimm and Dan Castellaneta as Mr. Kenny. The four stars cast as the first family of Marvel are reasonably suited, and you cannot deny that the special effects to bring their superpowers and all explosive sequences to life are fantastic, but the biggest problem is that it is full clich\u00e9s and predictability, the story is silly, there are only three of four main locations in total and it is just generally underwhelming, the previous 2005 version is only slightly better than this disappointing only relatively entertaining fantasy action adventure. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture (tied with Fifty Shades of Grey) and Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel, and it was nominated for Worst Screen Combo for Teller, Jordan, Mara and Bell (All Four \"Fantastics\") and Worst Screenplay.

I went on for 3 hours about my undying love (since childhood, I might add once again) I have for these characters that aren't simply characters but people I feel I have known all my life and can relate to. I even went straight to my own personal collection of Fantastic Four comics and explained to Shoko why these stories still spoke to countless adults like me. Like in issue 45 when The Thing gets turned down from a carnival ride because he exceeds the maximum weight requirements due to his heavy, rock formed mutated appearance. I told Shoko countless times how I've been turned down from rides because I weighed over 300 pounds or in Issue 117 when the Human Torch feels even amongst his own teammates that he is alone with his powers and how I connected because I feel the same way when I see a girl walk away from such a nice, caring and respectful individual such as myself only to see her go with the jerk who's only interested in one thing.Shoko agreed with me but she also calmed me down and told me to take a couple of very deep breaths in her bosom while she stroked my brony tail. So I settled down and I waited calmly and quietly using my training as a certified Kenp\u00fb meditation therapist from when I was in my 20's to instill patience. That is until this week... I managed to get tickets for a preview screening for Shoko and I and last night was the night where I would play Judge, Jury and Gentleman. I would try very hard to give this a chance because I was raised to be the polite thinker as opposed to the brutish neanderthal but if push comes to shove my intellect will show its true face.First thing's first, before I left the house I stared ever so thoughtfully into my closet at the various array of Fedora's I own. Each one has its own meaning and ability for different situations. If I am casually strolling the streets of the town square for an afternoon bite to eat at the local Korean owned Sushi spot (Shoryuken makes the best yellowtail btw) and just want to peruse the strip malls I will wear the classic black \"Bogart\" along with my cargo shorts and pin striped button down. It's purely for style reasons since I am casually out and about but also to attract the gazes of the numerous women I see as if to say \"you can look but please, don't touch\". But a real dame would know that. Tonight I decided upon the grey and black sashed \"Elliot Ness\" because I was on my way to do business. I was about to walk into a potentially dangerous situation with what could be the worst film I have ever seen. But this particular Fedora symbolizes tact and intelligence to win battles and so armed with my \"Thinking cap\" and Shoko, always dressed to the nines, I was on my way to the ball.And here we are. I cannot convey more fervent disappointment for something that I hold so dear to my heart. For easily 90% of the movie I rested one of my chins on my palm with my elbow on the armrest analyzing, organizing and processing each and every bit of dialogue and action. This isn't the same Fantastic Four I grew up with, this was for the audience that craves and consumes your typical alpha misogynist \"bang, bang things go boom\" blockbuster with absolutely no respect to the source material. At a certain point I couldn't even be mad anymore because this was all a joke. And so I even started to giggle here and there, very audibly in a snarky tone to show everyone around me that I was smart enough to get the joke that it was so bad. Of course no one else was laughing except for Shoko and I but, like any true man of his word and honor I saw it through to the end. On the way out I expressed to Shoko how all my worst fears had come true and how I would complain no further because even the greatest of Generals in the History of battle admit defeat when they know it has come. Shoko reassured me it was okay and I was still a good husbandu and even though some may see me as judgmental, immature and closed minded like I do my peers, my expectations here were not unrealistic. My waifu told me how my expectations echo a true lost art of being the nice guy and with it comes a superior set of standards when it comes to interests, hobbies and fighting the ever growing problem of men who are jerks and can't see a woman other than an object and only those who are intelligent will be able to see that. I'm glad I have my waifu. She is my idea of the perfect woman. Overall I do not recommend this movie for the true nerds like myself out there. If you have any class at all you will avoid this movie and save yourself the thinking power for when a true conflict arises such as Religion or promiscuity.",

            "content": "FANT4STIC......... Was that supposed to be a Fantastic 4 film? Because i'm pretty sure what i just witnessed was not even 15 minutes of a Fantastic 4 film accompanied by an hour and a half of crap, and not even the kind of crap you can enjoy, just pure \"i can't believe someone thought this was good\" kind of crap. And that is exactly what i was thinking to myself for 90% of this movie, as i sighed and face-palmed in disbelief that someone could get that so bloody wrong. Also, that 15 minutes was still not that good, but was a small step up from the rest. It was incredibly boring and dragged on and on and on until it got to the point where i didn't care what happened in the rest of the film, i just wanted it to be over and to forget about it. And i was actually looking forward to it and was somewhat slightly optimistic that it could be good, and i couldn't be more wrong.It showed a couple of signs early on that it just maybe would start to get good, but whenever it started going in the right direction, it turned around and headed astray. The writers focused an incredible amount of time setting up the characters and their relationships to the point where it became exhausting and boring fairly quickly. Well at least the time they spent focusing on the characters kind of helped later in the film right? WRONG! The actors i liked as their characters, i thought they made interesting characters with personalities that for the most part fit pretty well, but they only needed brief introductions. The interactions and relationships between the characters seemed fake or almost non-existent, except for the relationship between Reed Richards and Benn Grimm, it was the only one i was actually invested in, and the only one the film really focused on. And considering they spent so much damn time on building relationships in the first 3/4 of the film for absolutely no worthwhile outcome was a huge let-down. Now, Victor..... Von........ Doom, more like Victor Von WHO? This was a completely wasted villain who was just incredibly awful. He was so bad i would put him in the same league as the version of 'Deadpool' from 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'. And i don't even want to talk about his design, i was one of those people who wasn't annoyed by his appearance in the trailers, I remained optimistic and wanted to believe that in the film i may actually like the look. But i cannot believe how wrong i was, because he looked hilariously dumb and i could not at all take him seriously. So to avoid spoilers, that is all i will say about him.After witnessing this crap i can see that this film was definitely ONLY made to ensure that Fox kept the rights for these characters from Marvel. So in the end, Michael B. Jordan, Miles Teller, Jamie Bell, Kate Mara, and Toby Kebbell definitely weren't the problems, it was the totally crap writing that reduced this movie to nothing. So yeah, do yourself a favour and skip this one. - 4/10",

            "content": "Fantastic Four is a very dark movie. I mean, really dark. I mean dark, as in, somebody please flip on some lights. That's not a joke; every indoor scene in this movie is so under-lit that you feel like your wearing sunglasses indoors. Every outdoor scene feel you're attending a vampire funeral. It is a funerary tone is unfortunately appropriate because this is a joyless, dead serious movie that rings all of the energy out of something that should be bouncy and fun.This is the fourth failed movie rendition of this property and the fourth time that Hollywood has shown that it doesn't have a clue how to do it right. Roger Corman's legendary 1994 action-comedy was so infamous that it never got released. The 2005 Fantastic Four movie and its sequel Rise of the Silver Surfer, were colorful but featherbrained and forgettable. Yet, they were modern masterpieces compared to Mark Trank's current modernization, a movie so joyless that makes the last hour of Revenge of the Sith feel like Christmas morning.At the beginning of the new Fantastic Four \u2013 or as the poster calls it, 'Fant-4-stic' \u2013 we meet 10 year-old Reed Richards (Owen Judge) who is working on a matter transfer machine. He becomes friends with young Ben Grimm (Evan Hannemann) whose family owns a junkyard and has the parts that Reed needs. They become friends and grow up working together on the project, but years later at their high school science fair, their teacher (Dan Castelanetta) dismisses their amazing discovery as \"a magic show.\" The government is more interested in their discovery and gives them access to work on it \u2013 along with Sue Storm (Kate Mara) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), and a broody drop-out named Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) who is said to be from Latvaria, but has an accent that is true-blue America. The team is given access to The Least Secure Government Research Facility on the Face of the Earth. Seriously, they can go anywhere, do anything, and send out photos of themselves to their buddies without any restrictions what-so-ever.The first test of the matter-transfer machine with a chimp is successful, but Reed (played as an adult by Miles Teller) thinks that he and his team would be perfect for the first human test. The project overseer (Tim Blake Nelson) wants to bring in astronauts, but Reed is undaunted and wants to try it out himself. After hours, he gathers the team for an unauthorized test, but things go wrong and they, of course, find themselves with magical powers. Reed can stretch. Johnny becomes a human torch. Ben turns into a walking, talking chunk of rocks. And, for no reason at all, Sue gets the power to turn invisible, which is a head-scratcher because she didn't go on the mission at all \u2013 she was at the lab computer, so okay.The introduction of these elements make up the movie's first hour. We are laboriously introduced to every single character. Then after the accident, we are laboriously introduced to all of their superpowers. By the time the introductions are over, we have time for a ten minute action scene before the movie abruptly ends. The worse section of the movie are the discovery of the powers. What should be a moment of joy and discovery is a long, sad series of 'what-have-you-done-to-me' scenes that have the same tone as if someone's dog just died.The idea here should yield a movie that is as joyful and fun as last year's Guardians of the Galaxy. Quite the opposite. This is a grim, mean-spirited and broody movie. Instead of a fantasy, we get the approximation of how these events might play out in real life. That's exactly the wrong approach. The characters spend much of the time getting to know each other that you feel like you're watching the pilot to a TV series.The comic books, as I remember them, were colorful and fun. The team felt like a cohesive family unit whose chief quirk is that their differing personalities meant that they were always playfully squabbling with one another \u2013 like a family. Here they seem to have been pulled together from central casting. The actors do what they can, but never at any time are they required to give us any sense of joy or wonderment. What was the thinking here? Why make a summer action movie this gloomy and oppressive? Why spend 90% of the movie on introductions? Why set the entire movie in a lab? Why give it such a mean-spirited tone? Fans of the movie won't recognize the characters. Non-fans will be repelled by the movie's repellant atmosphere. Who was this movie made for? NOTE: There are no credit cookies, midway or at the end. Which is okay, because the less time spent with this mess, the better.",

Hard to identify / find them credible when they look like 30 really. And some actors (the big evil corporation guy especially) were just not good. Special effects were also of another era. My partner described them as 1990s' level, I found them to be direct to video level. And this is supposed to be a summer tentpole, so that's not acceptable. And finally: the story lacks a point. Half the movie setting an origin, another half not going anywhere... Pretty poor in retrospect. As a fan of the source material since my earliest years, the sanction has to be severe - it's simply not good.",

            "content": "I get that it is hard to make a film, i really do. I have made 5 minute long student films that were even hard work so yes i appreciate it isn't easy. What i mean by the title is that is it so hard to read the source material and make a Fantastic Four film? This may sound harsh, but really.. this does not feel like a Fantastic Four at all!First off, if you have seen the trailer you know the plot, and i mean all of the plot. There are no surprises here that we weren't expecting. Miles Teller, bless his soul, clearly tries his best here. He is a brilliant actor as proved by Whiplash. A lot of the time he plays the awkward geeky guy which he does here. What he isn't playing is Reed Richards. Anyway, Reed and his friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell, who also just feels out of place) create an inter dimensional teleporter. Dr. Franklin Storm recruits him to work for the Baxter institution. Along with Johnny Storm and Susan Storm as well as Viktor Von Doom they.. travel to another dimension.. and get powers. Doom becomes evil and tries to destroy the world, they stop him. Seriously, i feel like i was telling you spoilers as that is all the film has going for it literally. From the casting day i wasn't on board, where most people were outraged at a 'black' actor playing Johnny Storm/Human Torch, i wasn't, i was glad Michael B Jordan was taking on the role as i like him as an actor. Out of the whole cast i feel he was still most suited to his role because none of them have chemistry. Are we supposed to believe this Reed Richards and Susan Storm will fall in love. We really don't, probably because Kate Mara was so wooden and dull in her role that we never even connect with her.I like the government element of it all, where these people get powers so are used for publicity. Problem is that this was thrown in our faces within seconds of them getting their powers. I like the look of the Thing, but Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm doesn't feel right. I still don't believe he goes from that to a big rock monster but in terms of design and powers the Thing was the best designed. I loved the idea of the Fantastic 4 feeling these powers are more disabilities than superpowers. It hasn't been seen in the movies before. But it was never actually shown to us. They get these powers, mope about them a little bit, and then are just like 'oh, maybe they're actually good because the script says so'.. So no, this film doesn't even work as a body horror which would have been awesome.The thing that made this movie the disappointment it is though. The whole third act. It starts off sloppy enough but has good moments. The last act was just shocking. First off, Dr. Doom. Viktor felt off to begin with, he is then reborn as Doom out of absolutely nowhere. He appears and all of a sudden just hates everyone and everything and decides that the earth sucks and should be destroyed? What was this performance Toby Kebbel? His design was AWFUL. Metal mask? Nope. THAT IS HIS FACE! Then within 10 minutes of introduction, he is gone again. Talk about wasted villains. I am not joking, the Rhino in the Amazing Spiderman 2 was more faithful to the source material and may as well have had the same amount of screen time. When I start to think of something i like about this film, something negative comes and takes that away from me. The visuals did not look good (with the exception of the Thing as i mentioned). There is no chemistry between the cast, it was dull, the action scenes even felt boring. The powers of the 4 didn't even feel like they were really used. Kate Mara was playing the Invisible Woman. Yeah she has other powers which we saw, was she invisible? Nope. Believe it or not i wanted to like this, but well done Josh Trank you managed to screw these characters up even more than they were before. If set rumours are true then it shows. The film felt rushed and nothing was believable. Ant Man and Guardians of the Galaxy are almost unknown comic book characters. Their films were miles better than this. I can't recommend this to anyone. See Ant Man again.. or Inside Out.. or even the original Fantastic Four. Don't waste time on this film because i don't think even it knows what it is trying to be.",

I liked the idea of the film, but it was just executed badly. The script and the writing was just plain stupid and most of the characters were like robots, they were emotionless.Marvel movies are known for their incredible action sequences, but they obviously failed here. For an action movie, there was a shortage of action. Every action scene was just hilarious. Does Josh Trank want it to be a comedy?The worst part of the film were the special effects, the effects were nearly worse than Sharknado.

Yes I understand that building the teleporter and that they try too control their power is boring for some people but that was that I loved the most. I hope that there will be a part two and I look forward to it. But I think it was very stupid to let Kate Mara cut her hair when they weren't totally finished yet.

I had the mindset to find flaws in this film and criticize them but, you know what? I ended up liking it! I liked the gritty, grounded feel of this film. The powers seemed more real because they are presented in a realistic world. I liked the initial reactions to getting the superpowers which was mostly of fear and concern. This felt real. Interestingly, while the casting of a black person broke the stereotype of a white superhero, it also reinforced another: the stereotype of an angry, rebellious black punk. But this was a minor distraction as the cast on the whole was fine. The Thing was well done as he was portrayed more as a person with a rock-like exterior, rather than some rock monster.Though there wasn't much action, I found myself still engaged. The build-up to getting the superpowers was suspenseful and what little action happened after was interesting. I did enjoy watching Dr. Doom do his damage during the little time he spent on earth. That was pretty cool.Special effects were great. With a backdrop of a realistic world, they looked real, instead of like a cartoon. As far as the film's adherence to the source material, I can't comment on that because I don't read comics. Perhaps this is where the bulk of the negative reviews come from. But as a stand alone film it was entertaining.It's true this film's final act seemed short and rushed. But on the whole, this film was still good. It's better than the cartoony Fantastic Four films of the early 2000s. And it's better than some of the recent comic book films like Iron Man 3 (flying robot parts, wtf?), Thor 2 (another cube/sphere/gas to destroy?), Captain America 2 (no winter soldier and faked death, really?), etc. Perhaps if you keep in mind this film is more a science fiction film than a superhero film, you'd enjoy it more.

            "content": "Well, it's been a decade since Tim Story directed his utterly abominable rendition of Fantastic Four, and after ten years Twentieth Century Fox hasn't learned a damn thing. Fantastic Four is back, and it sucks just as much as it did in 2005.Why? Because, once again, Fox has produced a film that has a promising start and quickly devolves into complete and total drivel. By the time the credits roll (if you haven't walked out of the theater by then), you will understand the breadth of this film's colossal failure.Let me start out by saying that the first half of this film is quite decent. I walked into the theater with very low expectations, and after the first 50 minutes had elapsed, I was mildly impressed with what had transpired. The acting was solid, the dialogue was well written, and the story was building in a direction that I thought was very promising.But, once the third act begins, this movie takes a polarizing turn for the worse. All the acting becomes subnormal, the dialogue turns cheesy, and the story becomes a series of loud noises and flashing lights with no discernible point or purpose. Like the 2005 version, the final battle scene is an embarrassing waste of time that lacks any cohesion or structure. It is the proverbial definition of a train that has officially gone off the rails, fallen off a cliff, sunken into a tar pit, and exploded in an atomic fireball of ruinous failure.But how did Fox mess up, yet again, for the third time in a row? Why was the third time not the charm? Because they didn't learn from their mistakes the first time around. And he who does not learn from his mistakes is doomed to repeat them over and over again. What was the mistake? It was the hiring of an incompetent director.Most comic book movie catastrophes can be traced back to one, inevitable source: a bad director with no vision and no idea of what he/she is doing. Who is the culprit this time around? That would be Josh Trank, a director who has a vast and impressive resume of timeless classics; and by that I mean a director who made Chronicle (a film with an impressive build-up and a horrifyingly awful finale) and nothing else. And guess what? Fantastic Four (2015) is a film with an impressive build-up and a horrifyingly awful finale. Sound familiar?But it's not just Trank; there's an underlying trend to be found here. The 2005 rendition of Fantastic Four (as well as its horrible sequel in 2007) was made by Tim Story, another man with an impressive resume to boast. He created such classics as Barbershop and Taxi, and by 'classics' I mean ridiculous crap-fest films with no positive attributes. See the trend? Bad directors often make bad films. Who would have guessed?Which brings us to the topic of X-Men. Remember how good X-Men and X2 were? They were awesome. That's because they were directed by Bryan Singer, who made The Usual Suspects, which was one of the best films ever made. Remember how nauseatingly awful X-Men: The Last Stand was? That's because it was directed by Brett Ratner, who made Rush Hour, which was a forgettable, mediocre piece of trash. In fact, The Last Stand was so bad that they had to rehire Bryan Singer to direct a movie that completely and totally negated the horrifying events that happened in Ratner's abomination of a film.What I'm trying to say here is that the 'make or break' for most comic book films lies in the director, and if there's one thing Twentieth Century Fox is really good at, it's picking terrible directors for their comic book films (again, with exception to Bryan Singer). Why is Fantastic Four (2015) about as terrible as Fantastic Four (2005)? Because Tim Story and Josh Trank are both in the same boat. They're both terrible directors, and they were both employed by Fox to direct terrible films.The most damning thing about Fantastic Four (2015) is the fact that it suffers from almost every negative aspect of the original (minus the excessive campiness). It has all the same hallmarks: an underdeveloped villain, a lack of structure, and a finale that I could have slept through had I not been tasked with writing this review. Oh, and did I mention the CGI is absolutely awful? It looks like they either made it with a 1 million dollar budget, or it was just simply unfinished. Either way, the graphics are dated, and it doesn't help this film's case.I think now we can officially conclude that Fox is incapable of making a successful Fantastic Four movie. They've had three chances, and they've struck out. I think it's fair to say that they now have two options: either give the rights back to Marvel, or hire Bryan Singer to direct Fantastic Four 2. Otherwise, we're just going to see the same rubbish time and time again.",

            "content": "I thought I knew bad movies. I thought I had been through such a hell before, and things could go up. I thought, in my mind, there was no possible way to top such films in a way of badness. I thought things could only go up from here, and that Hollywood was starting to care for the license of their products, putting time and effort within their movies.That all changed after Fantastic Four.I feel violated. I do feel like I'm violated as a person, a critic, and a fan of the Fantastic Four. NOTHING about this film is at all redeemable! NOTHING! And I swear, if one of these idiots try and defend this film and say it's a better movie then the original two FF Movies, I'M GONNA BLOODY SCREAM!The film, for some reason, wanted to go and take the DC route and make the film all dark and gritty and mature. However, the execution that is seen here makes all of the truly 'Dark' and 'Mature' moments seem more generically and laughably childish. The Fantastic Four, whoever you look at it, can't all be 100% dark and gritty. It's what gave the comic and, to some extent, the original FF movie from 2005 it's charm. The characters within the film are now complete bastardizations of every other incarnation, with a huge lack of chemistry. Johnny and Sue Storm from the 2005 film, while not really that engaging, was at the very least believable, and no, not for the obvious reason seen here. The film wants us to believe that these two are dynamic brother and sister, and it dose not work. Johnny couldn't be any less charming unless they just end up making him a big villain. Instead of being a reckless, but good-hearted, the 2015 Johnny is now just reckless and stubborn. Oh, and you can tell he almost turns into a bad guy, because he supports the Militry and we all know that the Militry is always evil.Sue, by contrast to her 2005 counterpart, has devolved exponentially from a sort of love interest that had some good qualities to her into just another boring love interest that seems even MORE irritating here than before. Every scene she's in just sucks the life out of the audience, like she's just bored to be in this movie. She even takes the fun out of music, saying it's just a way to find out all the blooming patterns and....oh for hell's sake it's bloody music! Enjoy the bloody music like a bloody human being!Ben Grimm at the very least starts off as one of the lesser bastardized characters. That is until after the Four get their powers, where he then becomes a complete CGI monstrosity with rocks all over his body. Then he becomes the Militry's brutish muscle, and once again if movie teaches you anything it's that Militry is bad and irredeemable in everything. It's almost as if both Ben Grimm, the quirky and smart Junkyard Jew, and The Thing, the big rock covered brute are two completely different characters now. Unlike the 2005 version, love it or hate it, where the character is constant, if one could call it that.If there is one part of the film I feel really divided over, it's on Doctor Doom. Now, Victor Von Doom wasn't represented to his full extent in the 2005 version. However, at the very least he LOOKED and ACTED like Doctor Doom! Here, he's a chubby, video game playing Left Winger against the Militry and Government instead of the all powerful, definitive symbol of Fascism and the powers of evil like he was in the comics. However, it is pretty refreshing to see a Left Wing villain, so I'll give the film that. And he even has a lot of cool scenes devoted to him, showing off all that power he has, and by GOD is this great potential for a recurring villain! That is until they kill him off five minutes later.Yeah, I'm not kidding about that, they LITERALLY kill off Doctor Doom, no less then five minutes after he becomes Doctor Doom. Not only that, but it was done in the most clich\u00e9d way possible, with having the four simply combine their unique powers to stop the villain. They axed off one of Marvel's most powerful, most cunning, and most diabolical super villain in the most disrespectful, and most novice way possible. I can't believe I hate a movie like this...well, THIS much. I think the only other movie I hated just as much was Alexander and The Needlessly Long Title. But now, I think that crown has been taken by this horrible excuse for a comic book movie. I hate this film. I hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate it! Hate it! I hate that anyone can be dumb enough to find salvageable things and nicer things to say about it. And guess what, the idiots behind this film still want sequels, spin offs even! From THIS! You just axed off one of the Four's well known recurring menace and you want to milk this sickly cow!? I don't usually like cursing on film reviews to an extreme but...F-yay Fantastic Four 2015! The Final Result for this film is an E-RANKING! AN E! A ONE-HALF STAR! This has got to be, compared to the 2005 film and Rise of The Silver Surfer, the WORST Fantastic Four movie I've had the displeasure of seeing! Don't you even THINK about wasting your money on this, Don't you DARE give 20th Century Fox and Josh Trank your hard earned money! Cause if you do, then more CRAP like this can come out both their asses and onto our favorite superhero team!",

And may I say that all websites are giving 3/5 which isn't bad and on DS they are hating on it but give it 3/5 and they say its awful but they also praised the hell out of MI5 but only gave that 3/5 so it cool to hate this perfectly good film.",

Neither of us could believe that a superhero movie could be so boring. For the first hour, absolutely nothing happened. Most of the time was spent in a dark laboratory. No action, no good dialog, no good characters, nothing.As you know, the characters are NOTHING even remotely resembling the original Fantastic Four. They are all 18-years-old. To get by this huge plot-hole, they say that Reed Richards is a boy-genius. They say he invented an inter-dimensional-traveling rocket when he was in the 5th grade. Stupid, right? Johnny Storm (we all know he's black now) is on the team because he street-races cars and can \"fix anything\". Ben Grimm is Reed's short skinny nerdy friend from 5th grade. Dr. Doom (who shows-up in the last 15 minutes) is a lovesick computer-nerd. Not an iron-fisted ruler of a nation; a lovesick computer-nerd. Geez, no pandering to the audience here!Nothing is explained as to how anyone got their powers. They just went to a planet with green ooze on it, and now they're powered. There's no action, no using of the powers, until the last 15 minutes. Dr. Doom (super-powered) shows up, they fight, and the movie ends. That's it. No explanation for anything. They didn't even explore this planet. They're just in the same spot all the time, and there's nothing there. Very boring.Oh, I guess they did explain why a team so young went on the mission. Because they got drunk and just decided to go. No one else was ever in the building.I was generous and gave it 2 stars. To get 1 star you have to annoy me with a political message or something, in addition to being a terrible movie. At least they didn't do that....although the pandering by the choice of cast came close.",

            "content": "VERY MINOR SPOILER.I am astounded that this movie has been rated so poorly to the point where I felt I needed to create an account to defend it. Firstly, I have not read the comic books so my review will come from experience of the movie alone. If you accept that this film is a complete refreshment of the franchise then you will accept some of the issues that I have noticed previous reviewers seem to have. Honestly, the plot is quite slow paced but that isn't necessarily a bad thing and i personally don't feel it took anything from the film. It introduced a fresh aspect to the comic book movie experience not quite akin to The Dark knight but at a good balance between say that, and the more high octane stuff. With that in mind i think it was at an excellent pace and consistency for such an interesting concept like the fantastic four and the whole \"we need to work together\" idea is really brought through in the movie through the inter-character relationships. Speaking of the characters themselves, it was interesting to see how they were developed and i do not feel like it was rushed. However I see it more as a beginning of something which, as i will explain later, might be the reason why some viewers weren't impressed. Moving on to other aspects, the cinematography was consistently decent and impressive at times, nothing phenomenal but i never found myself thinking something looked unrealistic (apart from a planet of the apes Caesar lookalike).The music score was quite impressive and was worked into the movie well. The costumes are updated and fit well with the slightly more realistic feel which i think the movie pulled off consistently well overall. The film was funny when it needed to be. Enough to remind that it is a comic book story, but nothing to make you howl, as is how it should be.Importantly though, I would like to address one point about chemistry which i feel is being misconstrued by some. One reviewer mentioned that the team felt more like individuals than a team, well, i think that is generally the idea considering towards the climax, the idea that they need to work as a team instead of individually actually begins to kick in. I think it's hogwash to say the actors didn't gel, i jut don't buy it. I think it was intentional to create a rift between them for plot purposes. So for that reason i'm a little confused about where that idea has come from and i think people are forgetting the fact that as an origin installment (which this clearly is) that chemistry, as in real life, needs to be worked on in the beginning, especially considering the characters themselves are all completely different in the first place. With a nerdy Reed Richards, an isolated Sue Storm, a hotheaded Johnny Storm and a tough-as-old boots Ben Grimm, all working together, we must expect difficulties in clear-cut chemistry. And i don't think it is due to a lack of ability on the part of the film makers. Also i can't review the characters and not consider the villain. In this version we can see quite easily the reasons for Doom's downfall to evil, and in fact it is nice to see a character \"gone bad\" that you can actually relate to on some level (To a point of course). And actually, Doom just looks awesome and his powers are phenomenally brutal making him the perfect antithesis of an all-powerful individual to the teamwork aspect of the Four, which was only just touched upon but shown enough to keep me interested. Additionally, i would like to congratulate Toby Kebbel who did a fantastic (Ha!) job and stole more than his fair share of scenes. Just a final point about Michael B. Jordan playing Johnny Storm. As i said i haven't read the comic books so i couldn't care less that the character is supposed to be white. I can see it grating on some so all i will say is that Jordan did perfectly well as The Human Torch and i liked his portrayal.What i will say is that the film has very little actual action but, counter to what others seem to think, it makes up for it with character development and plot even if this is not to an amazingly complex level. This leads me to believe that this film is intended wholeheartedly as an opening to an ongoing franchise, which i would like to see continue,and not a standalone movie by any means. If that is the case then i wouldn't complain about seeing this version of the fantastic four continue and add to the decent beginning we have in this movie. All in all, the film is certainly interesting and worth a watch. Not a chance on Earth does it deserve the 4.1 user rating that it has as i write this review as there are far too many positives. It cannot be taken that low because there are some truly awful movies at that level, and this is not an awful movie, by any means. Did i enjoy the film? Yes. Would i recommend it? Yes.",

            "content": "So I just herd that similar to the Roger Corman's unreleased version of the Fantastic Four, this movie was made so that Fox could hold on to the Marvel Characters, and I assume, just like that movie they rush into production, which is very noticeable.I'm still a champion of casting Micheal B. Jordan as the human Torch. He was the right fit and did great with what he was given, which was not much. With that said, I feel he may have been the first domino knocked over that lead to a series of events that made this far different than the comic book it was based on.I understand the need to update a story written in 1961 for a audience far more knowledgeable about things and that like to see superheroes more grounded to Earth, but what I saw here showed some lack of respect for the World's Greatest Comic Magazine.Miles Teller walked the walked but did not talk the talk. I feel sorry for Jamie Bell because his version of the Thing only proves that Michael Chiklis nailed it in the 2005 adaption of the movie.As a movie, especially a superhero movie, the big problem is that we wait too long for the superheroes to show up and do something. By the time they do show up and do something we lost interest in anything they were doing.I'm... satisfied with the actors in the role, but feel the story does not allow them to be the Fantastic Four. I understand this is an origin story, but even in Iron Man, we knew what type of person Tony Stark was before he put on the suit, and he was an interesting person. With the Fantastic Four, none of these guys could keep my interest for the whole movie, I just stopped caring. The movie feels more like a pilot episode for an upcoming TV show, especially with it's very short running time, which I can't complain about, but I did feel sort of jipped, like I went to a defected theater that accidentally left out a huge chuck of the picture. Dr. Doom now holds the crown as the worse villain in a superhero movie. I known he's the group's archenemy, but his whole appearance feels like they are force feeding him to us for no real reason. It's not uncommon for these marvel movies to have weakly done antagonist, but once again this Dr. Doom shows a complete lack of respect for the original material. I will give the movie credit for it's visual effects. The scene were the team gets their powers is actual really cool. I could feel the pain and discomfort as Reed Richards body stretches for the first time.But overall, I know society still does not view comic books on the level as say a Steven King or JK Rowling Novel, but the reason this movie is so corny is because the filmmakers felt they could do whatever they wanted with these icons and no one would care. Maybe it's not all their fault, this is the third attempt to adapt Marvel's first superhero team, and each time it gets cornier. Third time is not the charm.",

Prior to that, a brief history of some of the characters. The story-line was not great, but it fulfilled most of the basic necessities. Was the acting great, probably not. Could some of the characters have used different actors, well maybe. And the ending.. yes, it absolutely underwhelmed. All in all, every film is going to have some flaw or point that someone will have something negative to say about it.

I got so bored that about midway I paused it and tried taking a nap, because I thought I was tired. But no, I was actually bored! Holy *beep* this was one of the most boring superhero movies I've ever seen--like Hulk-level boring. The main characters...had NO development at all! Sue Storm, what the hell?? To me she was just a character who shows up and says her lines, that was it. I don't remember a single moment where she shows any emotion, or any development whatsoever. I seriously can't think of a single way to describe her, other than she was an attractive blonde girl who can turn invisible and make force fields. Ben Grimm also had just as much development--basically none, except for I guess he's dependent on Reed Richards? Johnny Storm had very little development too; he was a bit of a troublemaker in the beginning and that was just about it. Reed Richards was slightly awkward and nerdy in the beginning but after that--you guessed it--nothing. This movie completely destroyed these characters and gave them no personality, at all. I guess Doom was kinda developed but he had no motive at all for being a villain, and man did he look awful. Not to mention the actors showed no emotion in their performances. They were just so flat and sounded bored, it was almost depressing to listen to them talk. I only remember this movie having one action scene. That's right, one. For a superhero movie, that's abysmal. It should have at least 2 or 3 good action scenes but instead, it has one very short, terrible one at the end. I guess I can't really comment on the CGI since I saw a camera quality of it but the excessively cartoonish last fight looked ridiculous. I just couldn't buy any of it. Did I mention how boring this movie is??? Basically, this movie was dreadful. It did have one good scene, when they go to the other dimension, since there was some element of tension and intensity there, but other than that, NOTHING remotely interesting happens in this. I'm so glad I didn't pay to watch this (and before any of you guys say it, it's actually legal to stream movies online, even if for free). For those of you who haven't seen it, it's just as bad as you know it is. Bland, boring, ZERO character development, and ONE short action scene where you can hardly tell what's going on. I'm beating a dead horse by saying this, but don't even bother to see this movie. Watch the original Fantastic Four with Jessica Alba, it's actually a masterpiece compared to this.",

Initially, there's this vibe that its kind of like the breakfast club. and when one of the plastic man guys invites his friend to go on a space mission leaving THE TORCH back to anchor the rope as they explore...accidents happen. the scenes where the ROCKMAN is left in a cell vs. the scene where plastic man crawls through the vents kind of reflectively brought me back to that scene where I guess the DOCTOR DOOM was in a room waiting to be invited to interact withthe scientists daughter. But all I know is that the ROCKMAN is actually that friend that came along to the mission while DOCTOR DOOM supposedly is resurrected as the guy who fell into an abyss and became as he says NURTERED by that isolated loneliness and abyss before being discovered by the military scientists looking to TURN OVER the project these YOUNG PEOPLE wanted to keep as their own and not have NASA or another GOVERNMENT TEAM of scientists to study. so, thats the first half..and it was totally entertaining but then it fell apart...and alluded to the distress and problems of having people who don't get along try and get along.",

Doom returns only to be defeated in rive or ten minutes. Poor Doom, Who looks Like a cross between a crash test dummy and a Schumacher version of a SM dominator. Ridiculous, like the Thing who wears no pants and has n\u00f4 p#nis ta all... Add to this That the movie so cheap, and that, except Kate Mara, no one looks like the comic books character, and that neither the story nor the tone reminds or the comic, and you have a very generic, bland, \u00e2ne painful movie to watch.

            "content": "Fantastic Four is a reboot of the superhero film series of the same name. Despite being an improvement over the previous two films, this outing felt flat, short and underwhelming. It gives us just barely enough time to get involved with its story and characters before the movie is finished.Reed Richards (Miles Teller) is a child prodigy who invents a teleporter that can send objects to another dimension. After demonstrating his teleporter at his school's science fair, Reed attracts the attention of Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), the director of the Baxter Foundation, a research organisation for intelligent young people, and offers him a job there. Reed accepts and teams up with his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell), Dr. Storm's son Johnny (Michael B. Jordan) and adopted daughter Sue (Kate Mara) and Storm's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Victor Von Doom to try and recreate Reed's teleporter to transport matter to a different dimension. The first teleportation goes wrong and Doom is left stranded in the other dimension while the remaining four are exposed to radiation which gives them all unique powers. One year later, the four of them team up to use their powers to stop Victor Von Doom, who somehow survived (we're never told how) and now wants to combine the new dimension with Earth's.While the action scenes were decent, albeit short, everything else is bland and very forgettable. It just felt like that the film was rushed out to compete with the current, better Marvel films. The cast, while nothing special, was much better than I thought they'd be. I did like this film's incarnation of Doctor Doom compared to the original film's. The movie's biggest problem, in my opinion, is its short running time, just 100 minutes. It feels that the climax was barely 5 minutes long and left me feeling very underwhelmed.I rate it 5/10.",

It also made me feel like this was new and potentially exciting.Unfortunately it never led anywhere. By the time they get their powers little of the film remains, and things after that feel rushed and lack credibility. Reed Richards' character acts particularly odd, specially for those used to the comics. Also, the villain's actions made very little sense to me, as well as his powers. Avoiding spoilers, at one point he is apparently stranded, and the next minute he is basically omnipotent.Sue was the nicest character for me, and much smarter than the comic book version. Ben was alright, as was Johnny. Reed seemed off. Doom, despite being miles away from the comic, was pretty interesting.There's very little action in this film, and the final battle is rushed and uninteresting.

            "content": "As much as there was a huge amount of hype around Batman v Superman, it wasn't too long ago that Fantastic Four was supposed to be the next giant franchise for 20th Century Fox. They got a supposedly visionary director in Josh Trank and Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan were up and coming stars so there was a lot of promise there. But in the months leading up to the release, reports started coming out. Supposedly the studio and Trank couldn't agree on anything, that they had to do massive re-shoots and that Trank buckled under the pressure. Even with all the seething hatred the movie was getting, if it was good, I would say so. But it wasn't and I hate to say it but it probably has set the bar for failure when it comes to big budget comic book adaptations.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We begin the movie with young Reed Richards talking to his elementary school class about the teleporter he plans to build. He's made fun of by his teacher and his peers. We then meet young Ben Grimm who lives with his large lower class family. They own a junk yard and Ben catches Reed scavenging for parts. Instead of getting him in trouble, Reed brings his device to Ben's basement to try to show him what he's working on (the teleporter). Reed decides to test it and they end up blacking out the power of their entire neighbourhood.We then flash ahead to when Reed (Miles Teller) and Ben (Jamie Bell) are in high school. They have done a project for the science fair on their invention (which they have been working on ever since). There are a couple of surprise visitors Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his adopted daughter Sue Storm (Kate Mara). Reed fires up the device and it seems to work until the built up energy destroys part of the gym. Reed and Ben are disqualified but Franklin is impressed and invites Reed to join him at his facility for young prodigies (the Baxter Foundation) as they have been working on something similar for years. Reed is reluctant to leave Ben behind but Ben encourages Reed to go, he was always meant for bigger things. In that spirit Reed leaves and quickly adapts to his new surroundings, helping bring new insight to the project.With movies that I don't end up liking I try to start with the positives. In both of the Tim Story Fantastic Four movies, the biggest focus was on the budding relationship between Reed and Sue. I liked that this movie took a different approach, it's more about the friendship between Ben and Reed (it's a good thing too because Teller and Mara are pretty awkward in their scenes alone together but I digress). I thought a couple of the actors were good, my favourite performance actually was Reg E. Cathey but it's largely wasted by the material. There was also one scene I really liked. When Fantastic Four come back from Planet Zero and they have \"accidentally\" discovered their powers, they cannot control them and they are in agony. I thought that bit was really well done, it was almost like a horror movie and you sympathize with them and Dr. Storm, he's having to watch his kids suffer. Unfortunately, I thought it might turn the movie around but just as they're getting deeper into that, the movie flashes forward and cuts off the momentum.So getting into what didn't work, people talk about Batman v Superman not having any levity or lacking a required amount of fun. I had those complaints too but man is this movie so much worse for those exact same reasons. There are jokes but they are so awkward and poorly done it's embarrassing. The actors have so little chemistry together and because of that the emotional beats outside of that one scene don't sell at all. Character motivations go by the wayside minus Reed trying to take care of Ben (Doom went from more of a disgruntled youth to a mass murderer pretty quickly and on a slightly off topic point, why couldn't they have just transported him back to Planet Zero? What's the downside? Maybe he wouldn't have tried to destroy the world) and the characters make really bad decisions (even though we're on an undiscovered planet and we have no idea how the environment will react to us being there but let's go touch that mysterious glowing green goop). I just found it sad that a movie with so much work put into it could be so fundamentally flawed.I could have tried to look past all that if the movie had offered a payoff at the ending. There's very little action in Fantastic Four, which was disappointing but it's a stylistic choice that I could have understood. But at the end, the Fantastic Four are only an actual team for the last 20 minutes. The ending battle is just plain unimpressive too. The CGI was okay but you would have thought they would have come up with some cool ways to use the heroes' powers and integrate those in but they just don't. Not every superhero movie needs a big action finale but the movie kept teasing you that it was coming and then it just fizzled, I was so let down.I have seen worse films, I just want to make that clear. Even though I've never read the comic, there is a reason these characters are so iconic and I think the movie just missed the boat on why people enjoy this material. I'm glad they scrapped the plans for the sequel, I don't see how they could have recovered it. For all the complaining around some big superhero movies that are mixed bags, this doesn't even hit that level, it's a complete misfire.",

            "content": "Seems like superhero movies are taking over the theaters this year, as we get our third tale of heroic comic book characters in the span of three months. After Marvel's last adventure about three weeks ago, I was hoping for the same type of magic in the latest retelling of the Fantastic Four. The trailers didn't paint a pretty picture, but hope still remained that Marvel had gotten the formula right this time. What was the verdict? As always, please read on to find out.I guess I should start out with the truth, this movie was not that good, and perhaps one of the weaker superhero movies in a while. Let's start with the story. The beginning of the film wasn't too bad, a fun and slightly humorous introduction to our protagonists. The background story was realistic, and had some good team building moments, though it was a bit dull. Then comes the incident. It's been a while since I reviewed the Fantastic Four lore, but this movie centers on the theme of our team set on traversing across the space- time continuum to an alternate dimension. And like always, a sudden, and very conventional set of circumstances happen that leads our team to developing powers. Now I'm not caught up on the dimension thing, but the delivery was horrible as the circumstances suddenly just happen. This hasty mess of loud noises and bright flashes, led to a rapid, chaotic, and rather cheesy transition into their familiar forms. And from there it only got worse, the plot continued to spiral downward as a hasty culmination of shallow plots. To me it seemed like they couldn't settle on where to take the story, and mashed things together to cover their bases and give an excuse for action. It didn't work, the details were all in a frenzy and shallower than a kiddie pool and incredibly disappointing. No training, no coming to grip with powers, not even a legitimate introduction to the villain, only a boring mess of half-hearted scenes whose only use was to show off the special effects.Speaking of special effects, Fantastic Four has some decent CGI work, though nowhere near the best. Our groups powers were nicely animated, each well edited into the real time acting to give a smooth transition from actor to super actor. In particular, the Thing looked much better from the earlier counterpart in the fact that he didn't look like a latex covered linebacker, though he didn't look much better. And Reed Richard's stretch power was a little stiff and exaggerated, but surprisingly some of the best action. Speaking of action, this movie was not that good in the action department either. Sure the animation for the powers was decent, but the action was just as disorganized as the story. Our heroes primarily used their powers in quick shots, often a quick sequence to show the \"struggles\" of training or mindlessly destroying some military equipment. When the epic finale hit, there was not much improvement, with a little strategy amidst the flashy display of computer generated powers. A shame they didn't study the work of previous Marvel movies that were successful.Acting wise the movie isn't that good either, most of the time our group lacks any emotion in their dialogue and when they finally do get emotional they go overboard. Most of it is shouting, or very sad attempts at crying, that tried to show they had a side outside of their intellectual side. Surprisingly the emotion came when they were trying to reason with everyone, which often calls for logic not emotion to be successful. Silly directors. And Doom's character, especially after the event, was very dry, monotone, and much different from the evil genius we have come to know. The best character for this reviewer , was the Dr. Storm (Reg. E. Cathey) who was the best balance of intellect and emotion in the movie, which wasn't hard to do. So what did I actually like from this movie? We start with the musical score, a nice symphony of instruments that helped add a little spark of life to this rather mundane movie. The generic tracks they designed have some emotional drive to them, and I'm always a fan of the scores that represent a new frontier to explore. The second aspect is that they did get the movie done in under two hours and minimized my suffering through this picture, though perhaps this could have been the factor that caused it to be rushed in the first place. Finally the lovely Kate Mara was a good component to this movie, her acting a little awkward at times, but her beauty as a blonde was nice to see on the big screen. Props have to go out to the costume department as well, whose costumes and makeup mostly brought the characters to life. Fantastic Four is a series that struggles to get a real life adaptation. I applaud the team for trying, but Marvel needs to go back to the drawing board for this series. If a sequel is in the works, they need to do some serious homework to right the wrongs they made. This reviewer cannot recommend seeing this installment, and encourages you to check out Antman instead. If you are looking for a movie this weekend, you need to lean towards the Gift or Shaun The Sheep instead, whose reviews are mostly positive. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 5.0 Movie Overall: 4.5",

I would love to see what Netflix could do with this with a 10 hour season.As it becomes clear this movie is going to be one gigantic flop, lets hope the actors of this movie know it's not their fault and that it was doomed from the beginning. Finally SONY, learn a lesson here, we the fans are who you must please,if you are going to take the stories and characters we loved growing up and make them suck the end result will be undeniable.",

The second half of the movie seemed extremely rushed and definitely had issues (plot, motivation, etc.) Maybe if the movie was a little bit longer it could've worked out much better. I think that the movie deserves a sequel in which it will redeem itself and fix the mistakes that this movie had. It was still entertaining and in my opinion is better than 2005's Fantastic Four. Plus, from my 9 year old brothers perspective, the movie was absolutely awesome and a thrilling introduction to the Fantastic Four.",

The dramatic or fight seems in the movie were a bit of a let down. They really just didn't get going for me. And in the main fight scene soon as it started, it seemed to be over just as quick. They needed to go the extra mile with this film 1. To shock you a bit more. 2. To make us feel that we were on there side from the start. 3. To make the bad guys just as bad as DoomThere are a few funny parts in the movie, and the casting was great. All of the specialist effects were spot on. I even enjoyed the story line that took us up to the point were they got there powers. They just need to push the boat out a bit more. Maybe have a little more grit in the script.It may not seem that I liked the film, and I came out of the cinema thinking I would give it a higher rating than I have. It does need an other film to set it back on track if they get the chance. I just wanted to see more bang for my buck.",

Promising, but not delivering, unfortunately. It felt like this movie did not come out of its first act, until the 'big epic fight' that lacked... everything a big epic fight should have. Never before, not even in The Incredible Hulk, did the final fight feel as slapped on and detached from everything else as it did in this movie.Another problem was, that this was not really an FF movie. The Fantastic Four are called the 'first family' of superheroes. A decent FF movie would portray Reed as the father figure, Sue as motherly, Johnny as a child and Ben as a beloved uncle. Instead of the Fantastic Four, we got 'A Bunch Of Teens, Getting Powers That Are Kinda Like Those Of The Fantastic Four'. It also didn't help that the four of them barely worked as a team. I must admit that the way THESE characters behaved, teenagers were the way to go. But if you actually want to make a Fantastic Four movie, Reed should be played by someone from the likes of Peter Galagher or Patrick Dempsey.Then, there is the bad guy... If the script knew what it was doing, they would have left Doom dead in the other dimension (and get him back not before the sequel). Have Tim Blake Nelson's character be the bad guy. Build-up wise, it would make sense, and it would make the ending feel not so detached. Instead, Doom returns from this cosmic accident, like ten minutes before the end of the movie. Apparently, he went to the Ultron-school of 'Hey, I'm the bad guy for some reason', as he tries to kill his former teammates and destroy the world (of course!). I don't consider mentioning this as a spoiler, since it has barely anything to do with the plot - which was more of a long winded study on how the characters come to turn with their powers.A final battle doesn't need to have the world at stake. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man's final battles were mainly about rescueing Mary Jane. The final battle in the first X-Movie revolved around a mutant making machine in the Statue of Liberty's giftshop. Nonetheless, since they build up to that point properly, the audience was involved in the action and stakes. Lesson learned: it's not the biggest stakes that makes for a good finale, it's the best build-up that does. Fant4Stic does build up to something, but NOT to its finale. The something that it actually builds up to, however, never comes...All in all, the movie keeps you entertained or at least interested during its running time, but it leaves you unfulfilled after it.The definitive Fantastic Four movie is yet to be made...",

Josh Trank did a horrible job directing the actors with their emotions and saying their lines without making you cringe. Michael B. Jordan was the worst of the group and his acting was horrible. And, surprisingly, Miles Teller's acting was really weak and I expected a lot more from him. The only person who did decent was Kate Mara. I guess you can say Jamie Bell did good but all he did was mostly a voice over, which was all right for The Thing.The development of them becoming super heroes was really bad. They gained powers and then the screen said \"one year later\" and they were pros with their powers. The film did not even show how they adapted to their powers which is what we all want to see in the first film of a super hero series.The plot was so stupid. First of all the movie was way too short and all they did was spend %90 of the movie making a machine and traveling to another world and gaining powers. Then the villain appears and they have a 10 minute fight scene and the movie is over. This was very frustrating as you only got to see Dr. Doom for like 20 minutes.The action was so lame and there was nothing new and creative in the movie. All we saw was action that was decent for the old Fantastic Four movies.I gave this movie a 2 just because the CGI was alright and because of Mara's acting.If you love Marvel movies, don't go see this disappointing film and save your money.",

            "content": "Reviewed August 8th, 2015 - 1st viewing (Theatrical 2D) Fantastic Failure From the moment I saw the age bracket of the actors cast in the lead roles, I was skeptical at best. Then when I read how they'd butchered the origin story/plot to accommodate, I was even less enthused, and with an announced 1 hr 40 minute run time and no iconic actor playing even a minor role, which in point-of-fact is a first in the history of Marvel films, I had little hope. However, I tried to remain positive, much to my chagrin.Arguably the worst part of this movie is their audacity to lull you into thinking it's going to be decent with the opening sequence with Reed and Ben as kids. It served to show us the characters in a light we'd never seen and made it a bit more intriguing\u2014who doesn't like a good origin story? That being said, I have no clue if any of that is referenced in the comics, so I digress.From there, it all goes south. The characters were neither dynamic nor well-fleshed out, serving to act as stand-in cardboard cutouts. Clich\u00e9s abound\u0085 Reed Richards as a child-prodigy inventor whose parents don't understand him, Ben Grimm as the son of junkyard owner (because otherwise you'd never know who was to be the muscle), Johnny Storm as the 'bad egg' whose walking the wrong path (by racing his Toyota AE86 and sliding into a pole? Really?), Sue who just fades into the background as the adopted daughter of the great Dr. Storm, and Viktor von Doom, a wayward student who thinks he's too good for his britches\u0085 And of course Johnny is angry with his father for caring about him, which serves to set up the inevitable father-son moment after he is mortally wounded... Didn't see THAT one coming. Then they attempt to explain that Sue's brother and father are black because she was adopted from Kosovo, which only serves to leave you rolling your eyes instead of feeling informed.As usual, the main characters are treated as idiotic teens with hormones where their brains should be, choosing to use the machine after hours to cross to another dimension, mind you with absolutely no one at the helm to call them back, but eh\u2014minor details, right? The not-so-fantastic three plus Doom wind up in another dimension and decide that with their vast scientific training at the ripe age of 18 that they're going to explore said planet with NO equipment to extrapolate any data or collect any samples, and then anger the planet by poking it until it consumes one of them, and yet the rest make it back by osmosis. They further insult us by sending the four without Sue, who just so happens to get blasted on the return journey.We find the 'three' now confined in individual rooms and being tested on. Then, when Reed hears Ben calling, he goes from barely being able to move his hand to completely unstretching and escaping, crawling naked no less through an air vent to promise his best friend he will save him and then disappear for an entire year?! It's as if the writer's had no idea how to create the necessary angst and that was the best they could come up with. They have The Thing running around in nothing but rocks, which just seems wrong, doing the government's dirty work as if he never had a brain to begin with.The pace of the film is inconsistent, varying from slow to fast forwarding, leaving the audience feeling as if they've experienced whiplash by the end. The score is mediocre at best, neither serving to drive the plot nor enhance your emotional experience. The computer graphics were laughable, looking like something out of a late 1990s video game. Everything comes off feeling unnatural and forced like you're watching a bad comedy play out that thinks it's a drama.The climax (if you can call it that) left something to be desired, providing no explanation whatsoever for how the life force of the planet now suddenly only existed within Doom, or how he magically manifested a black hood on the barren planet\u2014I guess that's one of his powers? The writers spend twenty minutes trying to establish how impossible it is to kill him because of his strength, and then they just magically do it and come home in a force field bubble? Somebody help me out here\u0085 There is nothing left to do but hand the reigns over to Marvel\u2014this train has been off the tracks since it was conceived. Much like the epic failure of the Not-So-Amazing Spider-man, a third reboot will now be required to undo the catastrophic damage done here. In all seriousness, it would have been better if they'd kept the original cast and had Chris Evans as Cap by day and the Human Torch by night\u2014THAT would have been more believable\u0085 I wish I could get the hour and forty minutes of my life back\u0085 There is nothing left to say except\u0085 THIS FILM IS NOT WORTHY!FINAL VERDICT: Not even worth your time. Go see Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation a second time so that you can spend your hard-earned money on something worthwhile.1.0 of 10.0 NOTE: The first films weren't that bad\u2014you have to keep in mind they were out when only X-Men and Spider-man led them, and they were designed to be more comedic. I laughed out loud, cried, and rooted for them, so they are a success in my opinion. Go back and watch them with an open mind\u2014they are better than you think, and I don't only mean if you compare them to this atrocity.",

Having said that maybe there was still a glimmer of hope given that some of their latest Marvel work have been rather okay. Unfortunately this is not the reboot of the Fantastic Four that I, and a dare say the fans, hoped for.One thing that I do not understand is why the dumbass script writers that Hollywood employs always have to change the basic story of a set of characters that have a solid fan base? There was nothing wrong with the original story, and thus origin, of the Fantastic Four and the source of their powers. Maybe I am just old-fashioned but still.The second gripe I have with this movie is the nonsensical stuff with members of the Fantastic Four, especially Ben, being deployed by the US military. It is just so clich\u00e9. Lazy script writing plain and simple. Unfortunately this also causes the movie to not really feel like it is a Fantastic Four movie. The team is split up and it is not until the very end that they actually become a team, gets a headquarter and so on. Big fail as far as I am concerned.Having said all that, I do not think it is as bad as some people claim. There are some good stuff in there. The story is not all bad after all even though it is not exactly to my liking and the special effects are quite okay. One thing that annoys me with the story is that the role of Reed is really diminished and he is never really allowed to show of his powers. Yes, I know, there are some \"stretching\" moments but, well, meh! To add to the pain the actor cast as Reed is, in my mind, totally unconvincing.The bad guy is also somewhat underwhelming and thoroughly predictable. As I said a classical Hollywood concoction aimed towards the less intelligent viewers. I do not understand why Hollywood seems to be so bent on repeating the same mistakes over and over again? Well, as I wrote, the movie is not as bad as some people claim but it is far from great. Given the abysmal reviews I am afraid that we will not be getting a sequel which is a shame. This is one of the (few) Marvel comics that I read as a kid (in Sweden we did not get treated to that many of these kind of comics) so it is indeed a bit of a disappointment that they managed to screw this movie up\u0085again.",

Nerd goes on to college where, surprise, his work completes a super-secret project the government's NASA/CIA/Area 51 scientists couldn't quite figure out. OK, this works for a comic book.

You know, how some movies are bad enough that you laugh at how bad they are? This casting choice was beyond bad. The \"parallel dimension\" planet looked like a bad imitation of Vulcan, out of Star Trek. Or a bunch of those mashed-potato mountains Richard Dreyfuss carved during dinner in Closer Encounters, with phosphorescent glow-in-the-dark gravy being poured over them.

He lacks the charismatic nerdy charm you expect from Dr. Reed, the roll is just a failure all around. Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm, also did not work. Jamie Bell does pretty good as The Thing, and Kate Mara was decent as Sue. But the overall bottom line, they all come off as way too young to be \"brilliant scientists\". But even if you can look past the casting issues, the plot development was poor, the acting at times was so forced, huge holes in the plot, the only reason I give it 2 stars was for the decent CGI, I thought they did a good job with the special effects, but it's not nearly enough to make this watchable. Make sure to save your time and avoid this movie, it's a waste of 100 minutes and you'll want to go Clobbering Time on your own face if you do watch this.",

If I were you please please wait until it comes out and view it on VUDU to rent and save yourself a ton of money. Don't buy it because it is not worth that much. The movie does have some pretty good visual effects but if your a Marvel fan nothing will make you happy about this film.

Then the three seconds of I miss you brother from Sue to Johnny was like they were just friends and not brother and sister. Then after the accident not one person asked about Victor, it was like oh his gone and was odd so we don't need to talk about him. Then when the get Reed back no one talks about what he can do, just lock him in a room and we have to take care of Victor. It was like go to your room Reed, you have been a bad boy, your grounded.The whole movie was just slow, till the end where the main battle was like oh here is like five minutes to become a team and take down the bad guy. It was just sad that was how it was like we will work with, not for the government or else and here is a big base just for you. Then there was no post credit scene just we worked 15,000 hours or your entertainment and it took a lot of people. It almost felt like you need to like this or else.

The acting is bad and looks forced-the lines are so predictable and hammy that I found myself mouthing along as they say them. There really is no real scientific basis to the 'other dimension'. They don't explain what it is, and why they are so okay with sending people there with barely any research, like if it had oxygen or who knows what else. It's also highly unlikely a child would have been able to build the machine on his own, without help, from spare parts. That's far-fetched, even for Marvel. It also doesn't explain why they'd let Ben Grimm, a normal civilian, into the lab on the basis that he is Reed's friend and is therefore allowed to be there. Victor Von Doom's super-powered look reminds me of a freeze- dried potato wrapped in cellophane that'd been dunked into a vat of Mountain Dew, along with the attitude of a classic 'destroy the earth' super villain with all of the drama and none of the good reasons. The fight lasts barely 8 minutes, and is completely unsatisfying and just plain bad. Can I also mention how disgusting Reed's power is? I don't know why anyone would want to watch his limbs elongate and twitch like an unknown Eldritch horror. It was nasty and I heard girl in the back start retching. Please just rename him the Human Spaghetti. Plus, it has no Stan Lee cameo or any after-credit scenes. I'm only giving this 2 stars because it's a Marvel movie.",

And the movie runtime is approximately 90min which leaves very short time to construct a good phase unless the script and the storyline are done very intelligently. But, I very much enjoyed the efforts and how much careful thought has been put in building up the story. All four characters are detailed extremely well prior to being F4. Action was good but too short too little and feels inadequate. Like I said earlier, if the movie had another 30min more to accommodate the action followed by the detail start of the movie the end result would have been much different. At the end of the movie it felt like taking a quick short break before flick start watching the next F4 movie because this movie was all about setting the start for a series of upcoming movies.I don't blame voters who rate this film low. I get it. It's a Marvel movie and you need freaking action in it. But if you view this movie in a more open eye you can see the details and how the director attempted to make the reboot of F4 different to the let down original F4 series.All and all it was a good movie.

First of all, it has very little to do with the comics, the animated series or anything remotely related to Fantastic 4's success from the past. The cast is atrocious and not because they aren't good actors but because they are totally unsuitable to play those characters. This equals an attempt to make Batman into a teenager and I am sure even that would work better. Lastly, those reboots of something that did not work too well before seem a real desperation move by whoever was stupid enough to invest in them.

So was the chemistry between the characters.People might miss the big laughs, the over the top action scenes or some semi dramatic love story here. And that is actually what I enjoyed, there was nothing or hardly nothing of that here. Story and action wise it was spot on without many flashy distractions.A pity Marvel didn't use any of the characters in the later Avengers movies. As someone who grew up with the comics I am pretty sure Tony would have benefitted from Reed Richards help against Thanos tremendously.So, in the end watch this if you don't want your usual super hero movie.

There is no chemistry between the four of them and that's because there's no arc built for them to come together as a team. This film needed another 30 minutes of fighting another villain so the chemistry could come together because at the end of the film, you're saying to yourself 'I don't want to see a sequel with these four again.'Also, there's no arc for an apology by Reed (Miles Teller) to Ben (Jamie Bell). Yes, Reed apologizes, but Ben never forgives him, but instead, they fight Doom together for 10 minutes and then all of the sudden everything is peachy keen between the two of them. There was never a scene showing the forgiveness. There was never a scene where all four really fight together and become a team, and show the chemistry. There was never really any fun.

And the way the Ben character chews his gum with his mouth open - so super gross - maybe it was to make him appear tough? Anyhow - the money spent on this film is nowhere to be seen - not in the story, effects, or acting. The story is very slow as well - it takes more than half the movie to get to the actual \"creation\" of the FF. The characters have no rapport with each other and seem VERY miscast. Reed is a cross between Peter Parker and Frodo, Ben is a cross between a rock with Down syndrome and a plank of wood (I have never seen a less expressive actor) and Sue (the usually tolerable Kate Mara) is here not as a character but as something for Victor and Reed to squabble over. Victor is brooding, brooding and brooding - and only shows up as the villain in last ten minutes. The climactic action sequence is thrown in just because there HAS to be a climactic action sequence - it actually pits the FF as a whole against Reed! I can't imagine a worse movie if I tried - easily the worst of 2015 to date. When you consider the money spent on this it's laughable. AVOID!",

By some reports, they are among the most popular heroes of the Marvel universe and yet Hollywood still can't provide them with a decent movie, even after three attempts. This one may just be the worse of the bunch. It's not that the acting is bad or the effects are unconvincing. Both are fine. It's just that the writers have failed to provide our heroes with a story that we care about, they haven't created a villain worthy of booing, they haven't created a scenario that has us on the edge of our seats and that we can relate to. Worst of all, they have failed to provide us with heroes we care about and want to cheer for.It's obvious that this movie was planned to be only the first in a franchise and, as such, it's fairly obligatory to include an origin story. Perhaps the failings of this movie would have been rectified in the sequels. Sadly, this movie is done so poorly that I suspect that this will be the last time we see The Fantastic Four on the screen until someone decides to, once again, do a complete reboot.Finally, this movie errs by being pandering to politically correctness. I hate it when writers change established canon by altering a well-known character's gender, race, sexual persuasion or, in fact, any other personal attributes just to score on the politically correct meter. Please don't play with our memories like that.Thankfully, this movies is just over 90 minutes long.

As soon as Victor came back the entire tone changed and the whole banding together to fight felt forced, unexciting and cheesy.Looking through the reviews here I can see I'm in the minority... but another 30 mins and a slower burner in the third act might have done this the world of good.Missed opportunity full of unfulfilled promise.",

The characters are quite \"flat\", the characters motivations for doing what they do and for becoming what they become, are quite thin. The animations and CGI are good work, but that alone can't keep a movie \"alive\". Compared to the prequels' great humour, stories and characters, this one was (at least for me) not worth watching.",

            "content": "For all the power of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, no one has been able to translate the first Marvel superhero film properly to the screen.First there was the 1994 Roger Corman-produced film, one made simply to secure a copyright and never intended to be seen. Then, there were two films made in 2005 and 2007, Fantastic Four and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, that had some star power but ultimately didn't do well. The creators should have taken a note from the cartoon versions, as both the 1994-96 series and the 2006-07 Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes captured much of what makes these heroes so special. Unlike the Avengers, they are two things, a family and also adventure scientists, not truly superheroes.Despite the first two trailers building big excitement for the movie, it failed at the box office, earning only $120 million on a budget of $167.9 million. Why?Well, first off, no one could line up on what movie they were making.Let's start with Josh Trank, who became the youngest director to have a number one at the box office with his first movie, the superhero found footage film Chronicle. He had a fresh new take on heroes and all seemed great.Right?X-Men: First Class was another well-regarded superhero movie and the writers, Zack Stentz and Ashley Edward Miller, started writing the script. Sounds awesome!Right?Except that their script followed Avengers as the way and had Dr. Doom as a herald of Galactus and was very comic book-oriented, which Trank did not like. So he wrote his own script.Remember when comic book movies didn't pay attention to the source material?Trank left Slater out of discussions with Fox Studios and withheld certain studio notes. Slater added \"I never saw 95% of those notes,\" and left after six months and was replaced by Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter writer Seth Grahame-Smith, with a final script written by Dark Phoenix (oh no, I have to watch that one soon, huh?) director Simon Kinberg.And then, some stuff went really wrong.During filming, producers Hutch Parker and Simon Kinberg rewrote Trank's original script and gave the film a different ending. Despite this, execs demanded reshoots, saying that this movie felt more like a sequel to Chronicle than Fantastic Four.To compound matters, Fox ordered their own changes to the film without Trank's supervision, changing and omitting certain major plot points from his movie. Now, that's usually where movies go wrong, but there was also reports that Trank was erratic on set. I tend not to believe these things and then he posted on Twitter days before the release.\"A year ago I had a fantastic version of this. And it would've received great reviews. You'll probably never see it. That's reality though.\"How did a movie with a budget like this one get so far into filming that the studio was blindsided by how dark the film was? How could a movie be that close to release and not have an ending decided on or filmed? How bad was the movie before Avatar editor Stephen E. Rivkin was hired to fix it in post with Trank referring to him as the director of the new cut? Were comic book fans so angry that Johnny Storm was black that they made death threats and Trank had to sleep with a gun under his pillow?Look, I haven't made a big budget Hollywood movie, but I have some theories.Indulge me.The biggest problem is that we've already seen the origin of the Fantastic Four. We want to see them in action, we want to see the drama between Dr. Doom (Tony Kebbell) and Reed Richards (Miles Teller), we want to see the Human Torch (Michael B. Jordan) and the Thing (Jamie Bell) pick at each other, we want to see Sue Storm (Kate Mara) prove that she's the real heart of the team.The original origin of the FF doesn't make sense today, with them needing to go into space before Russia, but that's an easy fix. And as pushed out of the spotlight as Sue was in the 1960s comics, she's not even on their first flight. Doom is. She gets called in at the last minute.In fact, the movie is an hour and twenty minutes past when the conflict between Doom and the heroes kicks off. Until then, we see Reed, Doom and Johnny get drunk and petulant after learning that they won't be the ones going into the Negative Zone - never referred to as such - so they take the trip without telling anyone and chaos (and powers) ensue.Not really the stuff of heroes.You know when a movie is bad? When Marvel kills off its actors - except Michael B. Jordan, who redeemed himself by playing Erik Killmonger in Black Panther - in a comic.You can't really blame Kate Mara. She wanted to read the comics to prepare and Trank explained to the cast that it was unnecessary as the film was an original story not based directly on the comics. Well, at least she met Jamie Bell on set and they got married. She was also allegedly bullied by the director on set, which isn't as bad as getting into a fistfight with him, as Miles Teller discovered.It's sad because this movie had every chance to succeed. I still can't fathom how a script isn't locked down on projects with this much money and so much on the line. But hey - I just write about movies. I don't write movies.",

            "content": "This is an unfortunate film. Unfortunately it was made ($120 million budget), produced and released but to the director's credit I can see what he was trying to achieve. Josh Trank (Chronicle) was given the difficult task of resurrecting the Fantastic Four franchise by giving the audience a far more polished movie than its predecessors by adding grit and realism to the production but the result was a film that lacked emotion, warmth and most important of all, story. It reeked of Generation Y with the characters unable to deliver a believable and engaging performance. Trank was quoted as saying, he had great ideas for this film but there seemed to be interference from the powers above and if that was the case, then the studios only have themselves to blame for delivering the worst Marvel movie in history.Too often the film ran out of ideas and had nowhere to go, then it just ended abruptly. 100 minutes is to short for these types of films but with Fantastic Four being so bad it was actually its only saving grace. It is hard to see that any of the four \"superheroes\" could actually be considered fantastic. I believe Trank was trying to build a story so the studios could release a brilliant sequel by laying down some firm foundations but he was just not able to hit the right note.The film starts by introducing us to a younger version of Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and his best mate Ben (Jamie Bell) that meet in school with Reed already a prodigy in everything science. It's Reed's ability to transport matter to another dimension and then bring it back that grabs the attention of Storm (Reg.E.Cathey) and his adopted daughter Sue (Kate Mara). Reed is given a scholarship in New York and with the help of Sue, her brother Johnny (Michael.B.Jordan) and Victor Von Doom, they make inter-dimensional travel a reality. By acting as the first human guinea pigs, Reed, Johnny, Victor and Ben take a little quantum trip and come back with special abilities. On re-entry they lose Victor and Sue consumes some of the alien energy that gives her special abilities as well.Wow! What a story. Unfortunately it doesn't transfer to the screen very well. There are too many gaps in the storyline where the writers have rushed through the script and run out of ideas. The young cast don't connect with the audience and deliver emotionless characters. Reg.E.Cathey tries his best to give his character some feeling but the script limits his performance and the younger actors miss his on screen presence in the second half of the film.Memorable action scenes never really eventuate with Trank focusing more on the visual abilities of the Fantastic Four. The climax with Doom is slotted into a three to five minute battle that is never spectacular with Doom only really wanting to go back to the other dimension before he is rudely interrupted. Just let him go! Then it just ends......how fantastic.",

Reed, Ben, Johnny and Victor use the transporter to travel to the other dimension, where things go wrong, Victor is lost, and the others are brought back changed (Sue is also altered upon the return of the others). From here the story gets bad really quickly, as the government takes them captive, and some go on the run, and others fight with the army.Suffice it to say, that as bad as the previous film adaptation went, this is much worse, and fails to get a single aspect of the story or the characters right, or even makes an interesting or compelling film for those who don't know the comic book backstory. This flopped hard at the box office, and plans for a series were thankfully scrapped. Also featuring Tim Blake Nelson. Directed by Josh Trank, although many stories of behind-the-scenes chaos and extensive re-shoots draw into question how much was done by whom. From 20th Century Fox.",

His two solo movies were atrocious. Then they put him on a team and all was right with the world. No, Hulk couldn't carry a movie by himself but he could certainly be a strong team member.

This one is closer to my taste, although the Fantastic Four seem younger than their actual age in the comics. I did like the fact that it was kind of darker than the previous one and that it pointed out the emotional roller-coaster and distress of acquiring their powers, whereas in the previous one it was more like \"yeah, we have powers, let's be cool and kick ass\".

It's not X-Men and it will never be, cause it's a different type of movie.

            "content": "Released in 2015, \"Fantastic Four\" (or \"Fant4stic\") tells the story of Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm who acquire super-powers when their experiment to teleport to another dimension goes awry. Reed (Miles Teller) turns into a human rubber band, Sue acquires invisibility and relevant powers, Johnny (Michael B. Jordan) becomes a Human Torch and Ben (Jamie Bell) morphs into a huge rock man Thing. Toby Kebbell plays Victor Von Doom while Reg E. Cathey plays Dr. Storm.This is a reboot of the series after the mediocre \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\" (2007), which definitely had enough good in it to make it worth watching. With this 2015 version, the writers drew from all the Fantastic Four comics, particularly the Ultimate Fantastic Four and the current crop. The main difference is that the team apprehends their powers via a trip to another dimension rather than from cosmic rays from outer space. Another difference is that Johnny Storm and his father are black and Sue was adopted into the family. I don't mind these changes because the idea of transporting to another dimension is more interesting than traveling to the moon; and, since it would be nigh impossible to beat Chris Evan's performance as Johnny in the 2005 version, replacing him with a black dude sorta makes sense, not to mention it gives the film wider appeal. Still, morphing Johnny into a black dude smacks of political correctness and is a turn off. Would they turn Luke Cage, Black Panther, Storm or Cloak into white people? Of course not; it would be outrageous. Speaking of the 2005 movie, I thought it was a good film version of the superhero family, but it fumbled the ball with Dr. Doom and the action-climax could've been better. So how's this newer version compare? Well, it's darker and more serious, which is fine since the more serious the better for me. Unfortunately, the movie has a flat tone from beginning to end and, with the exception of Reed Richards, the characters are a bore. Both Johnny and Ben are distant and lack any defining moments. They're boring, lifeless characters; barely more than names in the script. Furthermore, the naked Thing is dumb; I was surprised we didn't see his rocky Mr. Johnson hanging out. Sue fares better and I prefer Kate Mara to Jessica Alba since she has the intellectual flare necessary for the role. As for Doom, he's more scary and powerful than the character in the 2005 and 2007 films, but he deviates too far from the comic version. He's basically a malevolent version of \"Lucy\" (2014). Lastly, the final action sequence is relatively boring. And that's the main problem with this movie. While the plot of teleporting to a mysterious dimension is interesting (and I couldn't help wondering if the realm is the Negative Zone), the entire movie is plagued by a flat tone from which it never emerges. With the wealth of great material at their disposal from decades of fantastic comics (groan) this is a letdown. It doesn't help that it's a reboot of a franchise from less than ten years ago and so forces the audience to view ANOTHER origin story, which we don't need. The movie runs 100 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles, West Vancouver, BC, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.GRADE: C-",

It's an abomination.The film's plot and dialogue were so bland and the pacing of the movie was just off. Not too much of anything happens in the first three quarters of the story, and then the rest of the film feels extremely rushed... probably because it was. The Fantastic Four don't actually use their powers until the last 30 minutes. The whole film just builds up to the 10 minute fight scene between Doctor Doom and The Fantastic Four. And even that was hugely unsatisfying.Don't forget that the whole film is being supported by probably the worst cast in a marvel film to date. Whoever selected this cast should in fact quit their day job. Reed Richards is not the strong inspiring leader he is supposed to be... and he was just about the only character with any development. Also who was in charge of the costume design? Specifically Doom's costume design?... because that was pretty awful too. It looks like he's got grey, burned flesh all over his body with a potato sack for a hood and cape.The only good thing I can say is that it looked nice. The special effects were just about the only thing that was on par with this film. But that doesn't make up for anything. This movie was a disaster and a disgrace. I strongly urge you to just not watch this. It is a waster of time",

Jordan, Kate Mara, Jamie BellDirector: Josh TrankRelease Date: August 7, 2015Produced by:Marvel EntertainmentMPAA Rating:PG-13One of this years most anticipated movies is finally out, and it looks like it's going to flame out very soon. Fantastic Four is directed by Josh Trank, director of the \"Chronicle\" and others. Even though Fantastic Four boasts a new cast including Academy Award nominated Miles Teller, nothing really seems to work in the movie. This movie has no plot and a honest throwback of a story. The lack of characterization, story, and acting is what really kills the movie. The result is this crazy, stupid, and muddled feeling of a movie. To be short, this movie feels like a teaser to something big, to something that never happens. Noting that this the FOURTH attempt at making a good Fantastic Four movie and also keeping a talented cast, this movie still doesn't click with the franchise. Fan4tastic is trying to do a lot, but ends up doing nothing. After the hype for over 2 years, Marvel still can't make a decent Fantastic movie that keeps up. There is in fact no story in the film, though it is a graphic pleaser. This movie could have ended in many ways and could have progressed in many ways, but instead Fantastic Four goes in the direction the whole franchise went. The only real fight or action in this movie is placed in the last ten minutes. Plot-holes big enough that the \"Thing\" can leap right through. There is no need for a screenplay in this movie since it has a lame convoluted plot. It progresses just like every other brainless movie. Obviously not learning anything from the other Horrible F Four movies, the movie still never progresses. This trailer lasts for around one and half hours and it really stinks. The story isn't put together properly and there's no real knitting. Now, the performances were just OK, Miles Teller was really the best thing that ever happens to the movie (At least that). You could rather put coffee shop music for this rather than action. Honestly, even Miles Teller's comedy doesn't work here. There is no real aim in this movie noting that the villain only shows up in the last fifteen minutes. Many questions still need to be answered. Not development questions, but questions about the shamed plot-holes. The last battle last for TEN whole minutes. Really? Maybe I agree for the Avengers, but for four young kids who want lose their powers throughout the whole movie?!!To those F4 fans, this movie is the most muddled and mired movie in the whole series. It is the worst Marvel movie ever made and god forbid there be another sequel. Ultimately, this movie gave me the thought to watch the other F4 movies, the one where they did Dr. Doom much better. Fantastic Four set out to be a really great franchise, but nothing ever worked for it. This series has always sucked and I think it's about time they let it die, like they should for \"Paranormal Activity\" . If you are going to watch this movie, buy some extra popcorn so you have something to focus on while watching this one and half-hour dumb snooze fest.

To submit my review I have to type at least ten lines but it doesn't take ten lines to express my opinion on how bad this movie really was. I mean really, I can sum up this movie in two words,\"Fantastic Snore\" because I found myself starting to nod off half way into this movie forcing myself to shove unnecessary amounts popcorn into my face just to stay awake, but at least picking the popcorn kernels out of my teeth kept me amused throughout the second half. The first fantastic four left me feeling like I misplaced a $20.00 bill but this piece of garbage left me feeling like I just got robbed at gunpoint.

The part when Ben drops out of the plane in the trailer was so cool and i was waiting the whole time for that part, i heard that there were many scenes that were cut out but not the best part, so for that im very sad. Now the good stuff which is all the movie. Doctor Doom looked so good and did a great job at being a perfect villain. Its makes a lot of sense and shows how the kids get their powers. The thing looked cool and the cinematics was god amazing, especially the shoulder shot when doctor doom was walking down the hall killing everyone with the light flickering oh god that was cool. It all fit together well but the ending felt short even though it was 1 hour and 40 minutes and i actually thought the ending was OK and wasn't that bad. My dad and mom liked and i loved it and like i said i love the movies that everyone hates.",

You want it to get going, it never does, and then it ends. Oh my word, the film was so stultifying that just watching it has made me lose my ability to fully convey in words how bad it was. I feel like I may have actually lost brain cells.

It quickly ends after the defeat of the bad guy. There was not much of a storyline when you compare it to the other Fantastic Four movies. There was more action and more of a story which you could understand. Overall the entire movie is shocking and is a waste of time going to see, even if you a huge Fantastic Four fan. I'm telling you now, you will be very disgusted. Marvel haven't spent enough time focusing on a storyline and more of a connection. The only real thing i believe they have focused on is the fight scenes, the destruction and the special effects that are within the movie. A whole lot more could of been done with $120 million. Don't bother going to the cinema to come out fed up and disappointed. Don't say i didn't warn you.",

My only assumption is that the majority of people who voted are brain dead teenagers who vote negatively on anything that doesn't have lots of explosions in it. If you are looking for 2 hours of fighting with millions of bullets and explosions galore then this is not the movie for you. In defence of the brain dead, I guess fans of the super hero genre expect full on action in their films as it resembles the comics. But I actually fell asleep during the action sequences in both the last Transporters film with Mark Walberg and The Avengers Age of Ultron as 2 hours of constant fighting, to me lacks intelligence and becomes mind numbingly boring. This film however is a much more intellectual and an adult approach to the genre which I found very refreshing. I would also say it was very brave of the director to take this approach as he must have known the teenagers and brain dead would hate it. Another reviewer said he was waiting for it to get bad but it never did and that was my thinking as well. Others have slated the lack of chemistry between the actors but I thought that was deliberate as in reality people like this would be the sort who don't make friends easily. There were some negative points to the film as I agree some of the dialogue was a bit cheesy and the ending seemed very rushed but overall I loved it and will be watching it again soon so all I can say is give it a chance, ignore the haters and make your own mind up.",

            "content": "All through this much-maligned film I kept waiting to hate it. And I just kept waiting. Fantastic Four might not be X2 or Iron Man, but its not generic to a fault and there's even a few specks of inspired goodness inside its hasty 90 minute run.The biggest problem is a complete lack of identity. The reported reshoots and shutting director Josh Trank out of the editing room means that this film has no directorial icon on it. Without any firm directorial hand on the tiller, the film wanders around without any sense of purpose, and its left to dialogue, acting and techs to salvage anything from it. The techs are for the most part quite impressive - I enjoyed the sound editing of the Thing's voice, the visuals were mostly impressive (yes, I said mostly, relax!) and I found the score particularly effective - especially a tingling, horror-tinted moment of reveal for Reed's stretch ability. It was much more effective and a lot less Ioan-Gruffudd-on-the-dance-floor-cheesy.Jamie Bell was my biggest concern going in - how can you replace all around tough guy Michael Chiklis with the kid who played Billy Elliott? But knock me down, Bell ended up being my favourite casting choice of the lot. He was tough and brooding, but there was also hurt there - hurt and horror that I never felt from Chiklis, now that I realise it. Teller, Mara, Jordan, Kebbel and Cathey are all acclaimed actors as well, and whilst they don't have anything particularly memorable to do here, I found that each of them was more than sufficient. Problem is there's literally zero chemistry. For example, I didn't buy for a second that Cathey had raised Mara. She barely interacted with him until his death, which was brushed over quicker than your average Wilhelm screamer. Cathey has one nice scene where he demands to see his children, but the choppy plot never settles long enough for him to flex his acting chops. The script was clearly something quite good until Fox chopped it to pieces. There's some quality dialogue (Kebbel's complaints about Neil Armstrong are particularly good, and Jordan's quip about Instagram made me laugh even if it was stupid), I loved the idea of the kids getting drunk and wanting to go into the dimension, and I really liked the military angle of the story. About the point of the \"1 year later\" is where the story starts noticeably falling apart. Its quite clear that that frame is there to cover a large chunk of movie that was cut from the final product. Plot holes are abundant: - Planet Zero is apparently magic. It can sustain Victor for over a year without any need for food, etc, and has completely breathable oxygen for the final battle. - Reed is completely combat effective and can battle a number of fully trained soldiers with his abilities, despite being a science geek in hiding for all of a year. - Why do they need Reed to rebuild the machine? Don't they have literally any of the notes he would have taken? - Why does Sue get powers if she was just on the computer? - Reed's science teacher at school is literally the worst. He has no interest whatsoever in science, and is probably the biggest caricature I've ever seen.The final confrontation with Doom is utterly ridiculous. Not since X-Men: First Class have I seen such a brainless and pointless massacre of all the film's minor characters and extras, or such an anti-climactic and swift villain demise (though I think First Class was still worse). The film in general suffers from a lack of climax, now that I think of it. But honestly, its not as trash as people make it out to be. I liked the angle, Bell's performance as Grimm, and some of the plot and script choices. Had Trank been allowed to do his thing, I think this would've been really good. As is, I'll tolerate it. Its better than The Incredible Hulk, by a long shot.",

The special effects were good.Bad points: Sue Storms hair colour changed from bright blonde to mousy brown several times throughout the film, displaying zero continuity in the filming process overall. At some points,when it does change to Blonde, it has also changed in size, and is slightly askew, which is a sign of a bad fitting wig, often a sign of a parody for humorous purposes.Although there was a mention of adoption to explain how Johnny & Sue Storm are siblings, some more back story could have been added without increasing any screen time.The Ben Grimm transformation was okay and well, but to go from a puny Jamie Bell to this force to be reckoned with that can throw tanks around like they were sponges, for him to have a voice that sounds like a six-year-old girl completely ruined the movie.In the plot, Reed Richards runs away when they return home with their superpowers and he apologizes to his best friend Ben Grimm, saying \"I'm sorry, I'll fix this\", this guy who is a Scientist and Explorer, decides to run away for a whole year without contact? In my opinion this is completely out of Reed Richards' character and must be some gross mistake on either the writers or studios part. Now I know why the director didn't want to be associated with it, or something like that.I have nothing against any of the actors in this movie and I was looking forward to it, but if you are a marvel fan, for your own, good,pretend it never happened.I am stunned and amazed that there is a sequel planned for this franchise reboot, and I would urge Marvel to deny the permission for this franchise to continue it needs to be stamped out like a weed in a patio.

This is one of the most reviewed films by Internet critics ever created. I think at least eight people have taken a shot at this, even though some of them weren't technically episodes of their show. You knew the Nostalgia Critic would get to it eventually. So why is this film so horrible? It actually repeats a lot of mistakes the other ones did! It has Doctor Doom being jealous with Reed over Sue and the effects are still bad, especially with Reed's arms.The pacing in this film is among the worst I have ever seen in my life. We are so used to live-action superhero movies being two hours long, you know it would fail with this length. I think it's this length simply because 100 (minutes) is a very nice even number. Oh, this is the fourth Fantastic Four movie and still no good ones! It isn't until halfway through the entire movie that the characters get their superpowers. Even after that, it isn't until four fifths in the movie that we actually see the characters all together! I'm serious! The constant use of darkness is so obnoxious. Why is the Thing naked? In fact, why do they not even use their superhero names until the very end? Even then, only half of them use their names. This film is so soulless with no humor at all as at least the other movies had some light hearted moments. The worst line is probably when Doom says, \"There is no Victor. There is only Doom\". Uh...Victor and Doom are the same person. Everything is horribly rushed in such a boring film. Well, this is the last film for Superhero Month and it's sad we ended on such a bad note.

It would have been cool if they'd gone down the grotesque X-Files' Eugene Tooms style route of gross, greasy, sinister hypermobility.The Fantastic Four comics really deserve a high camp, fun for the family treatment, a la Guardians of the Galaxy, to do it justice, not the unhinged ramblings of a 13 year old emo trapped in the body of a director with the budget of a small country.I've read that Tommy Wiseau (The Room) expressed an interest in doing a sequel to this which sounds like it genuinely would be fantastic, heaps of demented Troma type fun and definitely something I'd pay good money to see.",

Cathey) and his adopted daughter (Kate Mara).Together with Sue's brother (Michael B.

The comic's congenial tone is as absent as the chemistry between Reed and Sue and the Thing's pants.

            "content": "It's highly likely that we'll never understand fully just what happened behind the scenes of Fantastic Four to make it the film it is today.It's a film that even the most pessimistic of comic book haters, popcorn disliking, nerd despising, anti-movie fiends couldn't have predicted the amount of hate thrown its way and the ill will that Josh Trank's second feature film received upon release.Box Office receipts were dire, critics tore shreds of a film they labelled \"boring\" or \"to dark\" and many including audiences were bemused at how this supposed comic book film floated by for near on an hour of running time to then descend into a chaotic final act of atrocious CGI and one of modern movie history's most poorly constructed and underdeveloped villains.The mystery surrounding Fantastic Four's failure flows from studio interference, including the studio butchering a rushed re-edit of the film before release, director Josh Trank's bizarre on set behaviours and mismanagement of actors and all manner of script writers for hire coming in and having a go at trying to make something of Trank's clearly going for bleak re-telling of an already previously mismanaged franchise (Silver Surfer anyone?). Considering all the hatred and lacklustre talk surrounding this film, upon reflection on home release, Fantastic Four isn't actually \"that\" bad.It's certainly not a good film, actually it's very far from it but in 2015 there were a lot of seriously bad movies and at least for lack of a better word, Fantastic Four tried. It's not the usual action set piece after action set piece comic book film we've grown to know and love and then grow tired of and Trank and his team clearly had some decent ideas.Bursting onto the scene with his found footage Sci-Fi Chronicle, the once bright career of Trank seems destined to be clouded in controversy after his efforts here but there are moments of genuine cinematic quality. The way in which our fantastic team of unsuspecting super powered humans discover their abilities is effective and the casting seems mainly on point.We all know the talents of Whiplash's Miles Teller, Fruitvale Station's and Creed's Michael B. Jordan and the likes of Jamie Bell, Kate Mara and Toby Kebbell are no slouches but whoever in the end edited, constructed and wrote this film killed Fantastic Four's chances to fly with some of the most poorly designed editing, character development and plot advancements in recent memory and not once do we feel any real connection with these people or believe that they share any form of chemistry whatsoever and the films aforementioned final act is bewilderingly bad, the only excuse it would have would be the studio's so called interference.It's somewhat of a shame we will never get to know just what ruined this glum and often more dramatically natured Fantastic Four outing that at the end of the day has nothing even remotely memorable about it other than the fact it's so downright lacking in energy, humour/lightness and a seemingly lack of effort.The cast was there and no doubt willing but due to a raft of seemingly powerful situations this film ended up being a real non-event, certainly not as unwatchable in its terribleness that many would've had us believe, but certainly a messy, sporadically entertaining attempt at finally making the Fantastic Four a viable big screen staple.2 gum chewing head honchos out of 5",

            "content": "Extra OrdinaryJumping on to the reboot bandwagon, 2015\u2032s Fantastic Four wipes the slate clean of 2005\u2032s harmless puff piece starring Jessica Alba and Chris Evans as it (re)tells the tale of a group of scientists transformed into superheroes after an experiment goes catastrophically awry. At the time, both the 2005 film and its no less silly sequel (Rise of the Silver Surfer) were widely derided. So imagine what it would take to make those look like masterclasses in superhero storytelling. Answer? Fox's latest addition to its muddled back catalogue of Marvel movies. To be fair, F4 starts promisingly. Notwithstanding the predictable outpouring of rage that greeted news that the new quartet would be young, restless and (gasp!) not all white, the casting was bold enough to pique interest. Michael B. Jordan's natural charisma seemed a lock for the swaggering Johnny Storm/Human Torch, while Miles Teller's intense turns in movies like Whiplash signalled an interesting interpretation of obsessive scientist Reed Richards. In a world where you're a failure if you're not a tech billionaire by the time you're 30, it's hardly inconceivable that a motley crew of barely post-pubescent prodigies would be at the vanguard of a once-in-a-generation breakthrough. And it's not a massive leap to think that it would take a young, reckless (and mildly inebriated) group of kids to precipitate the ill-fated mission that forever alters their lives. Throw in Josh Trank (whose freshman effort was 2012\u2032s excellent found footage superhero movie Chronicle) and colour me intrigued. And for a while, it works well.The reboot at its best when its rag tag braniacs are doing their science thing. Sadly, that is a staggeringly low benchmark for a contemporary comic book movie. Despite its length, none of the characters are given room enough to breathe. Fitful attempts at backstory and characterisation all peter out into loose ends rather than being woven into a richer tapestry - Ben Grimm's (Jamie Bell) unlikely friendship with Richards, the weaponisation of The Thing for special ops, the Storm family dynamic - all are picked up and then inexplicably cast aside, seemingly at random. So by the time the faecal matter hits the fan, no wonder it's difficult to care about what happens to anyone on screen (with the possible exception of Reg Cathey's mellifluous patriarch Franklin Storm). But it's the action setpieces that are weakest, Trank's inexperience with big budget pageantry thrown into stark relief by shoddy pacing and anti-climactic showdowns. The portrayal of the fab four's powers is cringeworthy, with lousy physical acting (particularly from Teller and Kate Mara), but the real shocker is a Dr Doom (Toby Kebbell) lumbered with an incarnation even worse than that sported by Patrick McMahon in 2005). It doesn't help that key narrative sequences are also missing - there's no 'learning to use my powers' montage, nor any trial and error adventures as they start to work as a team. In fact, they're kept apart for much of the time until Doom bursts violently - and incongruously - into the movie for reasons that remain at best, inexplicable. By the time F4 slouches towards the finish line, it feels as though the film-makers just want to get to the end as quickly as possible.Which is a real shame. This was clever casting with a bittersweet, reality based grittiness that promised to leaven DC's despondency with some of Marvel's trademark wit. Had Fox invested in a stronger crew with more blockbuster experience (a quick check on IMDb reveals cinematography and second units which are woefully under equipped for this sort of venture) it might have at least delivered on spectacle. Alas, this is a poorly executed adaptation and judging by the critical and box office opprobrium, it's unlikely they'll get another chance to prove themselves - if only Fox would learn their lesson and just hand back the reigns to Marvel.",

            "content": "There are few redeeming qualities in a film like this. Everything from the altered plot line, the characterization, and the lack of any emotional quality, make this possibly the worst Marvel (and cinematic) entry of 2015.I for one, am really tired of writers trying to modernize or change classic comic stories, to better suit the audience. They assume that we want something updated, with lots of CGI, and twists and turns along the way. Simpler is always better. The original stories are classic, and beautiful to begin with. The genius struggle of Richard trying to prevent humanity from destroying itself, and from outside threats. The depth of love Susan has for him and the family they build together. Ben's emotional state when he knows there is no going back to his original body, and of course the positivity that the Human Torch carries for the team even in the heat of battle. They were full of struggle and strife, sacrifice and obsession, and a willingness to do good. This movie brings none of those feelings to the screen. The plot is so terribly altered from the original that it makes no effort to connect to it's origin. Everything falls flat.The actors are so young by comparison to the characters in the comic, that I felt no real empathy towards them. Reed was a genius at birth, but no scene in this film brings about any depth of his intelligence. He's foolish, undramatic, and has very little ability to emote (considering Miles Teller's fantastic performance in Whiplash, I was shocked to say the least). The other characters (2 of which are just CGI) are fairly one dimensional versions of the comic book characters, and lack any real feeling of unity or family, between them as a team.The truth is, this is what happens when you have poor writing, poor direction, poor editing, poor acting, and a large budget. Fox ruined this one from the get go.If you're a fan of the comics (or of superhero movies in general), then avoid this movie like the plague.2/10",

It seems as if there was much editing and scenes cut involved.There isn't much action scenes and the film is quite depressing and just not fun. The original 2005 and its 2007 sequel had a light comedy aspect which made it entertaining- although those weren't necessarily great, both those films were better than this remake, as they didn't take themselves too serious.Another reason is that the villain is brought up until very late and with no build up or establishment and the fight scene did not last long. It was also quite predictable. Then the film just ends abruptly as it was clear a sequel was intended.Perhaps Fantastic Four isn't the worst superhero film but given its budget and the time it was released (during the golden age of superhero films) it is most definitely a big disappointment.",

            "content": "Unless you have been living under a rock these past few months or pay little attention to online chatter, Fantastic Four arrived with the heavy stigma of delays, on-set bust-ups, last minute re-shoots, and overwhelmingly negative reviews from both critics and the few people that actually paid to see it. Sadly, the film is every bit as bad as you've heard. The Fantastic Four have had a troublesome history, with Roger Corman's infamous 1994 film never being released at all and Tim Story's colourful but soulless 2005 effort getting a panning from the critics, and Josh Trank's follow-up to the excellent anti-superhero flick Chronicle (2012) carries on this trend, getting lost amidst a forced darkness and a tug-of-war of control between director and producers.The ambitious Reed Richards (Miles Teller) struggles to get backing for his new teleportation device despite the assistance of his dim but loyal best friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell). At a science fair, he is finally noticed by Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his adopted daughter Sue (Kate Mara), who are also working on a similar device but are struggling to perfect it. Teaming up with rebellious technician Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) and morbid hacker Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell), Reed and his crew set out to develop a 'Quantum Gate' which will transport them to another dimension. Fearing their limelight will be stolen by NASA, Reed, Johnny, Ben and Victor suit up and are travel to a mysterious planet covered by a strange energy source. When they return, they are transformed forever.The young cast do their very best with their often cringe-worthy material, with Teller and Jordan in particular proving charismatic stand-outs. But they are kept apart for the majority of the film and given very little time to bond as a group both before and after the accident that turns them into superheroes. Instead, we get a lot of lonesome brooding and superficial angst during a frustratingly drawn-out build-up, with Mara and Bell given little attention at all. Then the film decides to skip over what is usually the most part of a superhero origin flick - the heroes learning to use their powers - as Reed escapes the compound now controlled by shady supervisor Dr. Allen (Tim Blake Nelson) and the team spending an extended period trying to track him down. After all the procrastinating, the foursome struggle to generate any chemistry at all.The producers were apparently unsatisfied by Trank's final cut and ordered heavy re-shoots for the film's climax. Never has behind-the- scenes tampering been so obvious in a finished product, as we are given a rushed and confused final set-piece and a film that feels somehow overlong despite a slim 90 minute running time. In a hastily deleted tweet, Twank informed fans that there was a final cut that would have garnered good reviews and improved its terrible box- office return, but we will never know if this is true or not. What we are left with is a limping and unnecessarily grim experience that will hopefully allow the film rights to be passed back to Marvel, who seem to be the only company capable of doing their characters justice. Fantastic Four will no doubt be a irremovable stain on the careers of its talented cast and director.",

            "content": "Review: What a load of rubbish! None of the new characters have the screen charisma as the original ones and the whole dark, gloomy feel of the movie, just didn't work. I totally got fed up with the technical jargon, which took up the first hour of the film and the movie seemed to jump from when they got there powers to them being used as weapons by the US government, so you don't see them exploring with there newly found powers. The \"Thing\" looked like a total mess and Doom just looked like a man in a suit with green eyes. The chemistry between the characters was also pretty bad, until they come together at the end and you don't really get to see any detail, because of its dark look. The storyline lacked wit and I got fed up with the stupid teleporting machine, which took up most of the movies concept. I'm glad that I got that off of my chest! Anyway, best friends Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) have been working on a prototype teleporter since childhood and during a demonstration, they get the attention of Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), whose the director of the Bacteria Foundation, a government sponsored research institute for young prodigies. Reed gets invited to join Storms squad, which includes his adopted daughter, Sue Storm (Kate Mara) and his son Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to complete a Quantum Gate, which was originally designed by the wayward Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell). Victor eventually joins the team, especially when he hears that Sue is on board and after a successful experiment, the facilities supervisor Dr. Harvey Allen (Tim Blake Nelson) plans to send a group from NASA to venture into a parallel dimension called Planet Zero. As Reed, Sue, Johnny and Victor came up with the initial idea for the machine, they decide to make the first journey to Planet Zero but Sue decides to stay behind to guide them. Reed recruits his best friend, Ben to join them on the journey and when they reach Planet Zero, they see some weird green lava, which Victor attempts to touch and causes it to erupt. Whilst running for there life's from the green lava, Victor is left behind because of the collapsing landscape and the others are brought back to earth by Sue, who overrides the controls. They then realise that they have super human powers, due to the explosion that happened in there ship while they were trying to escape from the lava and they are placed in government custody for further testing. Reed can stretch like rubber, Sue can become invisible and generate force fields of energy, Johnny can fly and turn into fire and Ben is a giant rock type figure who has amazing strength. Reed escapes from the facility and tries to find a cure for his friends while Johnny Storm is being used as a weapon for the government. After being in hiding for a year, Sue tracks down Reed and Ben is sent to bring him back to the facility. Now, with there new enhanced suits, they head back to Planet Zero to try and find a cure for there powers and they find Victor who has all of there powers along with telekinetic abilities, so they bring him back to facility, only to find out that he wants to destroy earth so he can rebuild Planet Zero in his image. Victor uses his powers to kill scientists and soldiers, including Dr. Allen and Professor Storm and he returns to Planet Zero with the four scientists in pursuit. Now under the name of Doom, Victor activates a portal that begins to consume the landscape of earth. He is then confronted by the four and after getting beaten down by Doom, they join forces and Ben punches Doom into the portals energy beam while Johnny closes the portal. When they return to earth, they are awarded for there heroics, with a huge operational base and they decide to call themselves the Fantastic Four. Sounds good on paper but it was complete rubbish. I must admit, the first franchise was a bit childish, with some unrealistic concepts but it was much better than this. At least they had some decent actors! With all of these studios rebooting there comic book franchises, after the success of the darker Batman, I'm not surprised that they wanted to reboot the Fantastic Four but they made a right shambles of it. Due to hype, it made a decent profit at the box office which proves that a movie doesn't have to be good to make money. Anyway, they really need to go back to the drawing board with this one because the whole thing was a right mess. Awful!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Josh Trank, 31, who brought you Chronicle in 2012. For his second project, I think he took on a franchise that really needed someone with some more experience and he over complicated the storyline when he really didn't have to. Everyone is familiar with the history of the Fantastic Four so he didn't have to come up with a technical reason for there powers. If he does come out with a sequel, he really needs to concentrate on the characters more that the technical references, which are really not that interesting.Budget: $120million Worldwide Gross: $168millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/sci-fi movies starring Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, Jamie Bell, Toby Kebbell, Reg E. Cathey and Tim Blake Nelson. 2/10",

Rushed is an understatement. You don't need to be a film critic or aficionado to notice the abhorrent production issues.

Yet it does not work as a film-Miles Teller isn't particularly suited to Reed and he doesn't have chemistry with any other actor. Bell, Jordan and Mara are generally better but everyone is pretty lackadaisical. The film is just *off* in such a fundamental way that it is not engaging. The 2005 version of the story was better but this was more daring in way.",

            "content": "When transported to an alternate universe, four young outsiders gain superhuman powers which test their relationships.Director Josh Trank's Fantastic Four is dark, oppressive and grim so grim some of the one liners feel out of place. The aesthetics aren't what you'd expect, with major changes and the actors are possibly too young, but previous outings also had this issue. However, the characters are easily identifiable and encompass the essences of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee's creations.Taking its time Trank's offering spends the whole of its running time as an origin story about friendship, war policies and morales with only the last ten minutes to deal with their adversary, Doom. Due to the unorthodox story structure it comes to an abrupt end. Also oddly Fantastic's tone feels more DC than Marvel.Although Lee serves as executive producer (it's in name only as) in terms of look and feel it shares very little with the comics or previous incarnations of the Fantastic Four. Without drawing comparisons to the 1994 Roger Corman (bootleg) version or the recent underrated 2005 and 2007 outings this version is surprisingly drawing. Kate Mara is notable as The Invisible Woman. Jamie Bell's performance as The Thing in the latter half is by design hidden by the effects. Toby Kebbell is excellent but his screen time is limited with the rest of the cast being effective in their respective roles.The music by Marco Beltrami Philip Glass score is exceedingly ominous and compliment the great effects, sterile sets, costume design and performances as they harness their powers.Arguably all the recent superhero adaptations attempts while entertaining never seem to capture their subject matter spirit faithfully coming across as bloated, soulless money makers which try to cash in by appeasing adult fans at the expense of younger children which doesn't always mix and this is no exception. That said, if a slow burning, brooding re-imagining is your thing then this delivers exactly that and to its credit debatably more edgier than its same universe contemporaries despite an anticlimactic rushed showdown.",

Stan lee what hell were you thinking letting them do this??!! I understand taking some artistic liberties and tweaking a story to update it or make it more interesting but all they did was create four characters give them the same names marvel used along with the same attributes (Powers) and slap the Name Fantastic Four on the title.

So when I heard this was getting a remake I was a tad disappointed, and then it starts production and we see nothing, absolutely nothing, not even a logo; months go by and we have no poster, \"first image\" and from what I remember only two secret set pics. It was strange but then I watch that first trailer and my hopes lifted tremendously, that first footage was really good and from then on I was expecting this to be a dark horse, a real good film.And you know what? It was....for the first half. I mean literally, I could pinpoint the scene where it starts going downhill rapidly. But let's focus on the good just for now, I loved the beginning. The set up was so good, we were introduced to these interesting, likable characters; the actors had good chemistry, the script was pretty solid and I was happy with where it was going. The origin was awesome to see, it was tense, horrific and I thought the special effects held up pretty well. Then there was a bit of a jump in the plot and it felt odd... just...odd. The only way I can explain it is that it was like different films, the first half being an origin story and then the latter half acting like it was deep into the franchise and this was happening after a bunch of sequels; imagine watching Iron Man and then Avengers: Age of Ultron without anything in between. Fantastic Four has so much missing in the way of development and narrative flow it just did not work. The climax felt incredibly rushed and they weren't really acting like a team and they spouted out lines as if it was from a cartoon and then you had that giant light going to the sky like every other major film seems to be doing. So plot-wise, 50% good, 50% horrible.The actors themselves did really good in their roles though, Miles Teller is a great Reed Richards and I enjoyed Toby Kebbell as Victor a lot too. That is until he turns into Dr. Doom for.....no reason what-so-ever, with a really bad costume and very undefined powers.In the end, I don't know the specifics of what director Josh Trank was up to on set or what the studio was wanting it to be like, but like it's production, Fantastic Four unfortunately was just weird and disappointing. If you do watch it, stop after the first half.",

            "content": "\"Where'd the rocks come from? From the same place the car went to. Where is that? I don't know yet.\"During my youth I spent many hours next door with the neighbor boy. Not just for having fun or horsing around, but also because in their veranda there was a disused closet with sliding doors where you could always find some old comics lying around. I suppose these were from the older brother who was a real comic fan. Many hours I spent sitting in front of that closet, reading them all. Comics like \"Archie the man of steel\", DC comics and of course Marvel. My favorite was \"The Fantastic Four\". This series I found extremely fascinating and that because it was a collective, consisting of several superheroes with different super powers. They formed a close-knit family and their identity was known to the population so these heroes had a rather family character. Actually, they were a little bit the forerunners of \"The Avengers\" and the figure of \"The Hulk\" resembled that of Ben.Unfortunately, this film is labeled as an unnecessary and worthless reboot. I partially agree with that. The only thing is that I can't judge whether this is an unnecessary reboot or not. I've never seen the previous films made in 1994 and 2005. Saying this is a failure or total disaster though, is something I don't fully agree with. A big part of the film I enjoyed watching and personally I thought it was interesting enough. The introduction of the various members of the unprecedented four was extremely captivating. The beginning showed a young Reed Richards (Judge Owen). A genius who seemed to come from Mars, according to some of his classmates, and who's building a futuristic machine in the garage. A missing component he finds on a junkyard where he bumps into young Ben Grimm (Evan Hannemann). The experiment proves to be a success and things can be materialized to an unknown destination and brought back again. Years later Reed (Miles Teller) and Ben (Jamie Bell) attend a science fair, where they attract the attention of Dr. Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his daughter Sue (Kate Mara). And before they know it, they are in a sophisticated lab rebuilding their invention on a large scale.This introduction was the most successful part for me. It felt like an adventure film in which a boy pursues the realization of a dream. In an amateurish and childish way, the prototype of something big is made out of junk (a bit like in \"Project Almanac\"). Also the introduction to the various members who become part of \"The Fantastic Four\" in the Baxter Foundation, made this film different of other superhero movies. Mostly this part is kept short so they can move on to the action part immediately. The moment things start going wrong with the four noticing something happened to their bodies after they've jumped to the other dimension (while being drunk), it's still interesting enough. You witness how each of them discover their new capacities. But when the action-packed part of the film starts, it's no longer fantastic. It turns into an uninspired, quickly made up heroes-movie. As if they suddenly realized that stuff should be in it too. The visuals of the other dimension are still enjoyable, but the final stage feels rather flat and not very original. And certainly because nowadays as a moviegoer, you're buried under tons of superhero-movies.Ultimately, this film emphasizes the formation of and relationships between the members of \"The Fantastic Four\". The superhero action that you ultimately expect, is fairly limited. A film that takes 90 minutes, with only a demonstration of superpowers and a final clash of fifteen minutes, can hardly be seen as a superhero movie. Perhaps this change was welcome anyway, after all the Marvel releases in recent years. The fatigue comes into play when it's about this genre. Perhaps the final part of the movie wasn't so great, but it wasn't painfully bad either. And now I'll just wait for \"Deadpool\" .... More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",

            "content": "Seeking to take advantage of popular characters in hand and enjoying the success of the Marvel cinematic universe, FOX launches yet another version of one of the most loved groups in the comics, the Fantastic Four. After the release of two films in 2005 and 2007 - both directed by Tim Story - that did not do so well at the box office and that generated mixed reviews from critics and audiences, the new adaptation was in charge of Josh Trank, who had debuted in the direction of a feature film shortly before with the praised Poder Sem Limites (2012), which also dealt with a group of young people with superpowers.Trank, who achieved the feat of being fired for directing one of the films derived from Star Wars (\"Rogue One\") for the behavior in the filming of this new Fantastic Four, whose final product gives the exact measure of turbulent production. The expectation formed around this new version was great and the way this new version would be addressed was the big question. After the first news and images of disclosure with the new cast were being published, the questions began. Later, news emerged that the product did not please the studio and that remakes would be necessary. At this point, it was already certain that the chance of the project sinking was enormous.The film revolves around student Reed Richards (Miles Teller, from Whiplash) and his obsession with creating a teleportation machine. With the help of his best friend, Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell, from The Adventures of Tintin), he succeeds and draws the attention of scientist Franklin Storm (Reg. E. Cathey, from the House of Cards series). Along with Sue (Kate Mara, also from House of Cards) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan, from Fruitvale Station), sons of Dr. Franklin, and the rebel Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebell, from RocknRolla), Reed improves his invention and builds a portal to another dimension, a kind of planet similar to Earth in its early days.The new \"Fantastic Four\" is basically a great introduction. In this sense, some fans must approve the fact that we have more time to identify and get to know the main characters. The origin of the Fantastic Four is practically the same as that of the 2005 film, as is the villain. In fact, this time, many will regret the simplicity of the action and the plot involving the villain Dr. Destino, completely wasted. Obviously, this is an introductory film, but it can't be just that. There must be a history surrounding it that creates a threat to the group that will be formed, something that makes the audience cheer for the heroes, which this script completely fails.\nThis year's adaptation successfully tries to be more serious and realistic than the one from ten years ago, considered silly and childish by most fans. This, however, does not mean that the reboot is better than the previous version. Having the chance to fix mistakes from the first adaptations made for the cinema, Josh Trank misses the chance to thoroughly explore the origin of each of the four members of the group of heroes, ignored in the first adaptation. Despite the film's large number of dialogues, more minutes were spent talking about science than showing Reed's childhood.The script signed by Jeremy Slater, Simon Kinberg and Josh Trank himself makes different options than previous versions for the cinema. It brings the younger group and starting to create bonds between them. To begin with, the film begins by showing friends Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) as children creating their bonds of friendship that would last into adulthood. We can already know from the beginning the problematic families in which friends live, in addition to all the genius of Reed.The option to recreate the origin of the Storm brothers caused controversy for changing Johnny's ethnicity and introducing Sue as his adopted sister / daughter. Nowadays, it seems to be mandatory to want to give representation to minorities in the cinema, even if for that, it is necessary to mischaracterize characters so well known to the comic book audience. The question remains: Is it really necessary to make these unnecessary changes that, invariably, end up displeasing the most fervent comic book fans? These are factors that do not alter the story, except for the fact that he wants to portray a black hero at any cost.Leaving aside these controversial issues, at least we can verify that the couple of brothers Susan and Johnny Storm and their relationship with their father, Dr. Franklin Storm are portrayed in a competent manner. They are still Sue's closest relationship with her father - who work together at the Baxter Foundation - for sharing the same love for science and the most conflicted relationship with Johnny's rebellious and free, who likes to venture out and get in trouble even though he also has a natural aptitude for science. When the worlds meet - and the suspicious Victor Von Doom enters the scene - the gears keep turning without effort. It is a perfectly common environment that has been established.The curious thing about this Josh Trank film is that he dedicates a lot of his time to strengthening the relationship between young scientists. If on the one hand this is good, on the other hand it ends up frustrating the public, which takes almost an hour of projection to see the heroes as the Fantastic Four. We can also see here that the greater focus on family was privileged, both in building the relationship between the members of the Quartet, led by the Storm brothers' father, Dr. Franklin. We can see that the script does not invest in the relationship between Reed and Sue, giving more focus to the Storm brothers and their father. The actor does not go wrong, but he is hampered by all possible mentor clich\u00e9s. At one point, he says: \"Family means taking care of each other.\"\nThe tone of the film after the second dimensional journey also changes. For months there were rumors about reshoots and the studio's order to have \"more Quartet\" in it and the last act seems to confirm that. There is a sudden break in the action and the ease and speed with which the group ends the villain is amazing. Neither the lives of any of the protagonists nor the planet Earth were really at risk. It gives the clear impression that the script finished everything quickly, causing no emotion. We don't even have time to start rooting for our heroes. What the end does manage to provoke is a certain disbelief in the public. Much of this is certainly due to the tight budget of $ 120 million, which also explains the low quantity, quality of effects and creativity to choreograph the action scenes. It should be noted that most of the budget was spent on heroes, damaging everything else.The impression is that the production had everything to work. With a promising director and a cast of talented young people, we were able to enjoy little. The interaction between the characters works to some extent, but the lack of agility, the lack of rhythm, the lack of action and the anticlimax of the last act harm the film as a whole and confirm the tense atmosphere behind the scenes of the production. Once again, the audience will have to wait to have a definitive version of the Fantastic Four on the big screen. The impression that FOX had to produce something to the touch of a box in order not to lose the rights to the characters, is clear.",

            "content": "Abysmal. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed with a film in my life. It was such a disappointment that even its predecessor excelled in entertaining its audience.You would expect that a film of this genre, typically a Marvel film, would have an awesome and visually amazing fight scene between the heroes and the villain, as well as the big build up to it; but this film seriously lacked this. You'd think that at least the last 1/3 of the film would be setting up Doom and the Fantastic 4's plan to stop him, as well as a big epic fight scene; but no not in this film, what you get is a 5 minute fight scene at the end and then it's all over. With the film being a reboot I completely expected the beginning of the film to set up the characters and to show them before they got their powers, but this part takes up about 75% of the film; with a further 15% explaining how they are wanted and are being used by the military. This leaves a flimsy 5% of the film where we finally get to see some action, and the other 5% is where we get to here some incredibly cheesy lines that are so forced its almost embarrassing. It truly feels like the writers and Josh Trank spent so long on the 'beginning' of the film, that they completely forgot about the ending, and upon realisation they quickly wrote an ending up and filmed it over a couple of days, then hoped the special effects would make it seem better than it was, which didn't work; therefore the main attraction of the film only lasted about 5 minutes. Not to mention that the action was the only thing advertised in the trailers \u2013 so we were completely misled.It's such a shame that Trank made such a disaster of a film because all of the actors were in fact fantastic. My 4 stars are not for the film, but they are for the actors and their ability to keep the film afloat. I hope that these actors \u2013 the 4 (Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, & Jamie Bell), Doom (Toby Kebbell), as well as Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), and Dr. Allen (Tim Blake Nelson) do not get a bad rep because of Trank's failure; they were all amazing and were the only thing stopping me from walking out of the cinema before the film had finished. Josh Trank should be ashamed and he should definitely not be called back for the second instalment \u2013 if a second one is even made. And to make it even worse there wasn't even a post credit scene! Call yourself a Marvel film?! I wouldn't recommend wasting your money to go and see this film in the cinema, instead use it to go buy the first Fantastic Four film, it'll keep you more entertained than this reboot will, and it wont leave you as disappointed at the end.",

The movie drags and seems to be a rip off of other comic book movie scenes all mish mashed together.

Reed Richards is brilliant and cracks the code on how to travel between dimensions. Along with some other people he goes to another planet and boom, gets super powers. he can stretch, she can turn invisible, the brother can flame on and the friend is a rock. Someone else went too, he becomes bad because they left him behind. I decided to half ass my write up on the plot because the filmmakers choose to half ass it in making this film. The only interesting aspect feels like it was all left on the cutting room floor. Glossed over by a stupid One Year Later title card. They come back and have these powers, the government instantly experiments on them. There could have been some Cronenberg-esque sequence here and I believe that was Trank's intention. Yet it's all left aside (stuido interference he claims) to jump ahead to the anti-climatic third act that had me playing Eurche on my phone. All the interesting aspects of the film are completely passed over. What was the government doing to these people over the course of the year? What was Richards doing while on the run? The relationship between the Fantastic Four is so utterly paper thin that I felt insulted at times. People know from the source material or even the original films that Johnny Storm aka The Human Torch likes the poke fun at The Thing. This never happens in the film until the last 5 seconds and it comes out of nowhere. It feels like some sort of forced hostile character assassination attempt. Jordan is given very little dialogue, Jamie Bell as well. These two might have a combined screen time of 30 minutes? I'm not sure but it feels like these two are hardly in the film. Zero chemistry between Mara and Teller with cringe-worthy dialogue and acting choices. Teller honestly feels like he's reading off cue cards off camera. He has zero charisma and clearly did this for a quick buck. Kebbell as Dr. Doom is embarrassing. Forced \"tension\", if you can call it that, between him and others is laughable. He's suppose to be brilliant, but we have no picture of that, just his arrogance. The continuity, my god, this could rival The Evil Dead for how hilarious it is. Teller with facial hair in one scene, then clean shaven the next. Mara with an obvious blonde wig that makes it look like a Targaryen in one scene then a normal person the next. These types of inconsistencies you would find in b-movies, not a Hollywood production of a known superhero franchise. The studio has killed their new reboot here. They wanted something out there before the rights reverted back to Marvel and they blew it. This is a mess. Well, congratulations on keeping these characters under your studio for a few more years, it seems like wasted money.",

I have never been a big fan of the Fantastic 4 but I have always loved Dr Doom. I personally feel that Dr Doom was too dark a character to be associated with Fantastic 4. This film was very dark compared to the previous instalments and I don't think it was the right approach to make. I feel that Dr Doom is such a dark character in the comics that the team and he don't really benefit each other in the cinematic world.Visual effects were average. Many people have complained about the appearance of The Thing but I personally quite like his new appearance even though it is completely CGI. However, Reed Richard's flexible and extendable arms look terrible. I thought that area would have improved after the same effects from the previous films were terrible as well. I questioned the cast when I first discovered they were in it. I think Miles Teller is a brilliant actor but I don't think he was right for the role at all. I thought Kate Mara was a good choice and I would have probably cast her in that role if I made it myself. Michael Jordan was not right for Johnny Storm and as much as I like Jamie Bell, I kept thinking of Billy Elliott every time The Thing was on screen. Toby Kebbell was brilliant as Viktor Von Doom. He got his personality right in my eyes and was entertaining to watch. But as Dr Doom I felt he was just too boring. He didn't have the same attitude as he does as Viktor. Overall, I think the story would have been brilliant had it been made to be publicised as a comic. However, film wise, it wasn't so. I did not like the fact Reed abandoned the team. In my views, Reed would never leave his friends for his own benefit. The famous 'Final Fight' in marvel is usually a big and memorable thing in superhero films. I felt the fight was too quick and not so memorable at all and it was too easy for the team to defeat Dr Doom.And then they copy the Age of Ultron ending quote. Just as Reed says \"FANTASTIC-\". I personally find this horrible to watch. I didn't like it at all in the Avengers and it was not good in this film.Overall I wouldn't say don't watch it, however you shouldn't expect much from it. If you want an honest and fair opinion of it just simply watch it yourself.",

            "content": "Oh, man. The Fantastic Four just can't catch a break. First there was the legendary unreleased Roger Corman film hastily thrown together to retain the comic's rights for the studio. Then there were the two regrettable Tim Story films. Now we've got director Josh Trank's vision, and I really hate to say this but those Tim Story movies were somehow more entertaining. I can't remember the last time I've followed a production as problematic and miserable as that of 2015's FANTASTIC FOUR. Sadly, the filmmakers weren't able to pull the nose up on this one before dumping it into theaters with a gut-wrenching score of 9% on Rotten Tomatoes. I knew the news wasn't good with this one, but I did my best to sit down and watch it with an open mind. I want to say I might've even enjoyed it just a tad the first time I watched it but, no, a second viewing rubbed any positive vibes right out. This movie is just depressing. What's it about this time around? The origins of the Fantastic Four. Again. Though slightly different. Reed Richards (Miles Teller, whom I'm sure regrets this whole ordeal following his critical acclaim in WHIPLASH) is a high school genius who has been working with his longtime friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) in perfecting a teleportation device. His project earns some attention at the school science fair from Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his daughter Sue (Kate Mara). Storm realizes that Reed hasn't achieved teleportation but instead inter-dimensional travel, and he brings him aboard his government-funded project where they're developing the same technology. Reed works with Sue, her hot-headed brother Johnny (Michael B. Jordon), and moody young genius Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) to complete a functioning inter-dimensional pod. When the pod is complete and the government moves in to take control, Reed leads a rushed (drunken?) expedition to another dimension, calling in his best bud Ben to join them. One thing leads to another, there's a massive unexplained energy surge and there you go: the Fantastic Four. You surely know them by now.I wanted so badly for this movie to be good. I really dig Josh Trank's CHRONICLE and, while I was a little annoyed at the Fantastic Four being cast so young, I figured this was in Trank's wheelhouse and he'd knock it out of the park. Maybe he would have if the studio hadn't gotten so involved. I don't know. All I know is that the finished product is gloomy, dull, and a real wasted chance. Let's start with the gloom. Everyone in this movie is miserable. Reed is probably the most bright-eyed and hopeful of them all at the start of the movie but that all changes once he leads his mission to the mystery planet. Doom is left for dead and his friends have all developed these life-altering powers, and Reed takes it pretty heavily. Ben Grimm has harbored resentment for his new rocky condition as the Thing in all incarnations of the character but here he's just a big mopey monster. He even turns his back on Reed, his best friend, when Reed escapes from the government facility where they'd been quarantined on return. He spends a good chunk of the movie slouching around with a frown and going on missions for the United States to use his new physique to slaughter enemy soldiers. Sue just seemed to hate everyone from the start and prefers to work alone, listening to music in her earbuds while\u0085searching for patterns in things? I guess that's her specialty. Johnny isn't so much depressed as he is rebellious, acting out against his father and throwing a fit when he's assigned to work on the pod device as punishment for street racing. Just as with the Human Torch from previous movies, he's also the only character to embrace his new powers. Finally, there's Doom. He's just an angry loner, aggravated that he has to work with anyone on his big project. Everyone sort of becomes friendly over the course of the project but not by much. It's still just a bunch of moody not-quite-teenagers and none of them ever really seem to click.Well, the characters are hardly likable. And the plot? Barely exists. It's not until almost an hour into this movie that pod is complete and we can move on to the meat of the film. We wait so long for the Fantastic Four and for what? I swear, nothing interesting happens in that first hour. It's all character establishment (introducing us to each character's individual brand of moodiness). Once it finally kicks in, I get a little hopeful. The reveals for each character's power is pretty cool. As with the tone of the movie, it's a pretty dark sequence. These kids are pulled from the rubble of the pod, warped and nearly dead. When they awake in quarantine, they're terrified and confused. If there's anything positive of note in this whole movie, it's this sequence right here. It's far from fitting with the light-hearted tone we expect from the Fantastic Four, but I liked it. Then the second half of the movie is rebuilding the pod for the government, the discovery of Doom alive on the mystery planet, and the big bombastic battle sequence. It's slightly interesting, visually, but not enough to make it enjoyable. Doom's motivation seems purely to be vengeance for vengeance's sake. I'm not entirely sure how long he was alone on that planet or how he physically survived (I believe he made mention that the planet kept him alive, whatever that means), but now he's determined to draw Earth's energy across the dimensional barrier for whatever reason. It just gives the Fantastic Four a chance to use their powers and beat him as a team. But it's hard to find the will to care about these gloomy characters. Sorry, Fantastic Four. Better luck next time, I guess.",

Although this film gave a slightly different spin on the FF origin story, I thought it was interesting and handled quite well, the script was OK and the cast were largely capable. Miles Teller was good as Reed Richards, and M.B. Jordan was a pretty decent Johnny Storm even though they didn't really give him much to do. Toby Kebbell was a decent Dr Doom, even though he came across like a petulant teenager at times. The end scenes where he breaks free and causes mayhem were dark and unsettling.The negatives are quite damning. The SFX were laughable in places. The Thing in particular was just dreadful. There's a few scenes towards the end where Reed Richards gets to stretch his limbs and it was so bad it made me guffaw. All I could think of was how much I miss my old Stretch Armstrong toy I had back when I was in short trousers. The planet they visit that gives them their strange powers was really bland and unimaginative. There's a huge leap forward in time which deprives us of witnessing them harnessing and learning their powers.The casting is badly flawed. Kate Mara is hopeless as Sue Storm, there's zero chemistry between her and Reed, or between her and her brother for that matter. Reg E Cathey is also miscast as Dr Franklin Storm, he's so intense in every single scene it becomes hilarious every time he appears. Tim Blake Nelson is just as bad, providing a comically bad villain who even chews gum constantly so you know, we realise he's a wrong 'un. This is FF's idea of character development. Jamie Bell is neither good nor bad as Ben Grimm, he's just kind of there, hardly speaking and looking sullen.Tim Story's decade old FF wasn't any great shakes either but it's far superior to this.

This reboot was directed by Josh Trank (CHRONICLE), and he stated during production that this was going to have a horror vibe to it. He (really, I'm assuming it was him) also made the decision to age down the characters significantly. These two aspects are actually fine with me, as I don't read comic books and therefore don't care about strict adherence to what's on the page. What I do care about is an interesting story with well-written characters, and unfortunately, that's where FANTASTIC FOUR fails. Since what I did like takes up less time/space, I'll start there. Given the material, all of the actors involved did give good performances. There was also the sequence right after the group first comes back from Planet Zero, when they discover their powers. That short scene perfectly captured the essence of what I believe Josh Trank had been going for. Sadly, one good sequence doesn't make a good movie. Everything else falls short. The downside of aging the characters down is that you can't short-cut the relationships and personalities involved in making the team. However, the writers decided to cut corners on this anyway and have the personalities already fully formed, and the team coming together just becomes a waiting game. Secondly, just about everything in the plot happens as a result of coincidence or bad decisions, and with little to no motivation (Doom is probably the worst/best example of this). Thirdly (and, for my sake, finally), there is no conflict until 80 minutes in (of a 100-minute movie). I could go on about how the CGI is barely better overall than the previous two cinematic attempts or that the pacing sucks, but I think you get the idea. The only reason Fox made this was to hold onto the rights. Had Josh Trank been given a little more creative freedom, maybe something a little more coherent and tonally balanced could have been made, but we'll never know. There are a few glimmers of what might have been, but that's like looking for diamonds in manure. The only reason to watch this is out of morbid curiosity, and even then I wouldn't advise paying for it.",

The visuals were mediocre, but it was alright overall.",

The idea of going into another dimension, being run by the government, and then becoming a super group is a common idea but not a bad one. The problem is, the characters introductions were forced. It just seemed awkward how all of the fantastic four showed up. And I hated that The Thing and Sue Storm literally never said a word to each other. Not once. They become the fantastic four was very forced. I think had the movie been 30 or 40 minutes longer with some more action thrown in it could have been good.

After going to see it however my mind has changed.The overall story arc of the film is good and it progresses nicely but the main problem for me was the length of the film. At only 100 minutes it didn't feel like the characters really had a chance to connect with the audience in as good a way as some of the more recent marvel movies. If the movie was just maybe another twenty minutes longer I think it would have greatly improved how the story was told.Give more emphasis on certain scenes and allow for the tension to build in the audience before we see how the confrontations will play out. With this time constraint the movie felt rather anti-climactic at times and it seemed almost as if everything just blended together as there wasn't any huge emphasis on certain points.I did enjoy the film and while it wasn't as great as the 2004 version of the film I am looking forward to a sequel and how fox plans to improve upon this not so great showing. As a fan of the first two fantastic films I am interested on how the relationship between them all will change in their new environment and how they plan on facing the Sue and Reed relationship that was so prominent in the first two. Overall it was a good story but I think the short length really hurt it and made it somewhat boring at times.",

I waited almost a week to watch Fan4 so I could let the critics have time to critique it. I went in with low expectations so I could give the film a chance unlike others did. My conclusion is it was one of the worst big budget films I've seen in many years. Problem 1,it was miscast. Miles Teller should have been Johnny Storm because he is known for quick witted,fast talking and comedic dialogue while Michael B. Jordan would've been a perfect fit for Reed Richards because he is well known for more serious roles and has leader-type qualities. That would've made them more relevant, and believe me folks no one is relevant in this film, so much so that the rest of the cast isn't worth mentioning. The cast never really clicked or come of as likable. At times it seemed as if they really didn't care for each other, a total lack of chemistry. The writing was woeful. Every line uttered was generic and seemed forced. The CGI was so bad that it depressed me. With all the tech today you'd figure the human torch would look awesome. Nope! The directing was....well I'm not sure the director was present. The editing was...I don't think they had editing. All in all this movie should have been broadcast on a regular network channel.

They could have focused more on how the characters would have felt with the abnormalities they now had. Secondly, Doom, when he was actually the villain, featured very little in the plot which I feel could have bee incorporated more into the plot. There was no real threat as he defeated within minutes which wasn't quite what I expected to happen. You barely got to know Doom, even before he got trapped on the other planet which could have been included more in the plot. All you see of him is that he gets a bit jealous and has a thing for Susan.It isn't a film I'd watch again but it did have many good elements to it as well.",

It's difficult to make a movie that's worse than the original that was released a decade earlier, but here we are. I understand the need to reboot a franchise so the owners of the rights can continue to hold onto those rights, but this is just a sad excuse for a movie. I only hope-now that Disney owns this franchise-that the next reboot of the Fantastic Four doesn't spend any time on its origin story (which we've seen twice now).While the casting for the main characters was technically proficient, if not a little young, I was stunned to see such wooden and emotionless acting from absolutely every actor on the screen. If I didn't know any better, they replaced these actors with CGI robots who state their lines instead of, you know, acting. Additionally, there didn't seem to be any stakes in this film for the main characters to have any reason to do what they did. Things just happened, and they were merely in the right place at the wrong time.It was also surprising how obvious the CGI was. Certain scenes stuck out as clearly CGI, even if they didn't have to be. Let's not even get into the \"look\" of Doctor Doom (Toby Kebbell). Sure, it had its moments, like the look of Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell), but overall it pulled me out of the story. Of course, I glanced at the clock and found that two-thirds of the film had passed before anything even remotely resembling a conflict emerged. Knowing full well who the villain would be, I had no idea what his motivation was right up until he stated it (basically straight to the camera). Overall, save yourself 100 minutes and don't ever watch this film.A reprehensibly bad reboot, I give Fantastic Four 1.5 stars out of 5.",

Oh wait, Phoenix is taken. Okay, Johnny is still a guy on fire. But IT BURNS! IT BURNS!Seriously, what we need is yet another Fantastic Four origin story, sponsored by Meathead Productions.

It's very fitting, also, regarding what has been done to the characters, both heroes and villain. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those expecting, even hoping, that this movie would suck. I had high hopes that it would work this time. Honestly, it goes decently until the third act. It seems like they made some last minute changes to appease the fans but it was too late. Doom isn't a blogger, nor is called Domashev. But that barely matters, since that character is less Doom than even the previous two movies. Pre- villain Victor Von Doom himself is a pretty nice guy, you can end up even sympathizing with him, but when Dr. Doom is revealed, is almost as if a switch is flipped where the director crumbles under the pressure and decides to rush things out of pettiness, delivering such a half-assed third act that ruins a movie that was OK until then, even with all the flaws. Right to the hot topic: Making Johnny and Sue stepbrothers DID ruined their relationship. It was so badly handed, that the two are barely registered as co-workers. It seems as if they decided that a black guy being overprotective over a white girl would sound too creepy. Another trait that was dumped from comics was Ben and Johnny constant bickering. Half the movie passes until Ben gets to interact with his future team members, and when we finally see Johnny annoying Ben, the movie is ending and feels forced, like something added at the last minute. Several scenes hint to something that'll be important or that'll happen afterwards, but they never pay off. It seems like they left a lot at the cutting room floor, specially because a lot of finished scenes from the trailers never even show up. I believe this time Fox finished ruining FF's chances at being a franchise the public will care about.",

I think it may have been Catwoman, back in 2004, another movie that meant extremely well (and god knows it was trying) but fell flat on its feline face. Well, it happened again, with Fantastic Four, but the sad thing is, it's not for the same reasons - it actually has (had) potential.Somewhere deep inside 2015's reboot of Fantastic Four is the bones of a very good movie that just hasn't been finished the right way, and that's why I almost feel sorry for it. The cast is up there with The Avengers in terms of acting ability, but it strands every single character in a sea of one-dimensional dialogue. It has a plot that's great - but only once it's explained, because the movie itself keeps it so vague at times that there's no real incentive to really care what happens. When it works, it has some fantastic visual ideas - but the CGI job looks average at best, and at worst it looks like it may have been done by work experience students.By far the biggest problem with this movie is the pacing. In the summer where Mad Max: Fury Road came out, this movie had some serious competition, but even in without comparison to that masterclass in action movie pacing, Fantastic Four does a downright awful job. It strands all the dramatics and special effects to the first hour, and only then are we introduced to any action. This could have worked, especially because the slow build of the first hour is actually maddeningly effective despite other flaws. The problem is, the action it rewards us with is some of the lamest I've ever seen. The aforementioned CGI looks awful a lot of the time, and it uses so much of it that it's impossible to pinpoint anything plausible on screen. Add to this the fact that almost all the action is confined to a relatively short coda, and you've got yourself a massive letdown.I've heard that Marvel fans are well and truly PO'd with this movie and I can't say I blame them, but I don't really know who to blame for this its quality, either. The director, Josh Trank, lures some great performances out of his actors here, especially Kate Mara (odd wig aside), but there's reports of him being abusive on set. There's also reports of Fox slicing and dicing the movie down - which may be what killed the pacing and the lopsided drama/action. Then there's the screen writing - writing that never really sinks apart from a few cheesy lines, but never really sparkles either.I think the truth may be realized by looking at the bigger picture - this movie is a failure on nearly every front.",

The 2015 version of the F.F. movie repeated the same critical mistake of the 2005 movie of saving most of the action to the end of the movie. Where as the 2005 movie had comedic undertones, the 2015 movie had a slowly developing serious undertone that was very boring. I had enjoyed the previous movie \"Chronicle\" that the director had previously directed but the director was way out of his depth with this movie. I was disappointed with all of the actors in this movie; Miles Teller was underwhelming as the genius Reed Richards, Jamie Bell was unimpressive as the strong man Ben Grimm and both Kata Mara and Michael B. Jourdan were undeveloped as Sue and Johnny Storm. I had hope having Michael B. Jourdan playing as Johnny Storm would have been a nice touch to the movie but unfortunately, even if Chris Evan had been re-casted as Johnny Storm, the director would still have not had the skill to make this character very interesting. I had tuned out most criticisms of this movie when it first came out in order to see the movie with an open mind but unfortunately, the criticisms against this movie is all true.

If you want a good fantastic four movie than watch the previous two because at least they're more fun, even the 1994 one is better sadly. Don't watch this movie at all",

            "content": "So I finally sat down to watch the Fantastic Four film from last year on DVD thanks to my local public library. Yeah THAT one that became one of 2015's biggest disappointments and has been effectively been given a total write off from fans and critics alike. With a reputation that large hanging over it, coming to the film was difficult without wondering if it would be as bad as both its reputation and critics suggested. So was it?The answer is...sadly yes.Rarely have I see a film with such potential (if one can say that) go to such waste. The film, based more off the Ultimate Fantastic Four run than anything else, manages to utterly mangle the origin story of one of the strongest superhero teams out there. It does so thanks to hackneyed dialogue both between characters and every time someone decided they're going to give a speech (especially Franklin Storm) as well as some major plot holes and failures in logic. Indeed the entire film after its opening five or ten minutes becomes a series of ever compounding issues. Those issues are compounded by disjointed editing that jumps around all over the place with leaps in time that lead to \"telling\" not \"showing\" which leaves actions and events largely unexplained. All that before the film decides that it's going to introduce its villain and big threat with all of maybe a half hour of its running time left. The result is a film where the plot is even more nonsensical that one expects even out of the poorer quality superhero movies of old.It's perhaps possible that if other elements in the film had been strong enough they could have at least partially salvaged the film. Sadly though, the problems only compound from there. The quality of the performances is incredibly variable ranging from decent in the case of Kate Mara's Sue Storm to adequate in the case of Michael B Jordan as Johnny Storm to incredibly wooden in the cases of Miles Teller as Reed Richards. Some of the performances can't rise above the writing and dialogue, such as is the case with Reg E. Cathey and Tim Blake Nelson. Then there's performances which are hard to judge such as Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm who starts off being slightly miscast but whom seems to excel once he becomes his mutated member of the Fantastic Four. Perhaps because of the script and obvious re- shoots (obvious from Mara's changing hair and Teller's facial hair), performances were lost or potential lost but whatever the case the result is incredibly mixed.The same can be said for the film's production values. The film tires so hard from the direction of Josh Trank to the cinematography of Matthew Jensen to be a darker, grittier take on the Fantastic Four as compared with the two films from a decade or so ago. Indeed the visuals remind one of Bryan Singer's earlier X-Men films with a similar color palate but the rest of the film leaves one feeling cold and removed from the action. The special effects are a mixed bag as well ranging from excellent (in the case of The Thing) to iffy (The Human Torch who looks weak compared even to the effects from a decade ago) to laughable (Victor Von Doom and Planet Zero). Backing everything up, or perhaps trying to hold it up, is a strong score from Marco Beltrami and Philip Glass which might well be the best thing to come out of the whole film. Buried in the midst of its 99 minute time are the occasional nuggets in a wasteland such as the score and some of the effects. For all of the good or even decent elements in the film, it seems a shame the rest of the film was a mess of bad scripting, wooden performances and a generally disjointed feel to the whole enterprise. The result isn't so much \"fantastic\" but an utterly mixed bag that's only for die hard fans of the superhero genre...and this would be a hard way to die.",

It's a shame because it did have potential.I will forgo the poor decisions of the director, writers, cast and studio which turned fans off to this movie and judge it based on the finished film alone.GOOD ~The principles all did well with their acting. The guy who played Franklin Storm did well. Kate Mara is a very attractive young woman and tried to communicate subtle attraction to Reed and this worked, as little as it was in the movie. ~Um. The music was heartfelt and carried a tone of optimism in the first half. ~Uhhh... um... Doom was made to be an intellectual equal to Reed which is true to a comics and a great improvement over knock-off Norman Osborn Doom from the Tim Story movie.BAD ~Well, Reed, Franklin and Doom never really sell the idea that they are world-class geniuses. None of their dialogue or mannerisms hint at a restrained genius IQ. We just are told they are geniuses and expected to believe. Sue kind of gets a pass because she says a few brainy things and types fast on a computers while reading IP addresses and binary. Good enough. ~Love triangle. No. Doom should be obsessed with only his work and ambition. I wan a Doom true to the source material for once. A Doom who would mock Reed for such a silly emotion as love. Reed should be more obsessed with his work and lost in his head solving multiple complex projects at once, to the frustration of Sue. ~Doom looked like a garbage bag hobo. ~The conflict between Reed and Ben is never really resolved in a manner which makes sense. It's brushed over in a sentence and suddenly all is forgiven. ~Ben kills people. I know they're terrorists but still. ~The one year time skip. It feels like the second act was skipped over in that one year. The first act introduces the characters, the second act sets up the problems and the third is where they overcome the problem.

Alba is useless & just cannot act, Gruffudd was as wooden as a sideboard dresser, and McMahon's portrayal of Dr Doom was pretty lame to say the least. It was really the action & effects that kept those movies heads above water for me as there wasn't much else going for them.Unfortunately this reboot isn't actually much better than those previous two films, so this ultimately ended up being a big let down too.From what I've read, there was a lot of behind-the-scenes troubles between Josh Trank, the producers, FOX, and the cast which probably contributed to the film bombing and not being as good as what it maybe should have been. Major re-shoots (causing a huge difference in run-time), script changes, disagreements, fights, major differences in film direction...no wonder the film was a bit of a disaster.That aside, though, the film itself still wasn't all that exciting, especially for an Action/Sci-Fi. The film needed to be longer and you see this when the \"main\" fight between Dr Doom and the Four lasts for merely minutes and it takes about an hour for the film to start showing the transformations of the main characters. I understand the need for build up, but when there's too much build up and not enough of anything else, it just feels rushed.Also, why the need (other than political correctness) to cast a black actor for the portrayal of a white character this time I have no idea. Imagine the uproar if a white actor played Muhammad Ali.The film did have a promising start, with some decent build up on how things would pan out, but it never really grabbed you. At least the visual's were good, The Thing was MUCH better this time, and Dr Doom was more sinister looking.That's not enough pluses in a sea of negativity, though.",

But ultimately this is an ... ok movie. I get why peoples have issues with it, i myself had some and i will talk about them a bit, but overall its fine.First issue is Kate Mara's wig wich is indeed distracting at times. The movie had some reshoot so they had her wear a wig that is not the same color as her normal hair in the rest of the movie and the difference is very easy to notice. That is probably the only MAJOR goof about the movie.The other thing is that its true that the movie take a long time to build itself, focussing a lot on Reid Richards, before actually getting the Fantastic 4 while not establishing that much chemistry among all the characters, especially Johnny wich is the least developed of the 4.In this movie instead of a space incident like the Jessica Alba/Chris Evans version, its some kind of other dimension that gives the character their powers and they take a long time to develop that. Its like the movie was gonna be 2h30 so they could focuss a solid 50 minutes building it, but realized half way that they would actually just do a 100 minutes movie and you end up getting the impression that you spend a long time with the characters pre-fantastics while it then almost immediately jump to the climax. That said i did was interested in that initial build, even if ultimately it didn't really lead to match beside a reason for them to have power, wich could had been done in a shorter manner.Some peoples complained about Dr Doom look but personally it didn't really bothered me. I will admit i am not a huge fan of the Fantastic 4. I enjoyed moderately the 2 movies that came before but never read the comic so i am not a huge purist, but in the context of the movie it did made sense. Doom do get a bit of background and he is probably the third character in importance past Reid and Sue but you do get that \"jump to climax in a hurry\" feeling between him being simply Victor and then being Dr Doom.But ultimately whats important is i was not bored with the movie. The first 2 thirds did kept me interesting in discovering that story (even if like i said it didn't ultimately lead to much) and the climax was alright. I seen better action pieces but it was entertaining. Maybe having it simply be 100 minutes did penalize the story telling but at least it didn't overstayed its welcome. I didn't look at my phone, and when it ended i was like \"already?\" so that to me is a good thing in what most movies aim to acomplish wich is just entertain you for a short while. Not every movie need to be that epic Avenger one that you gonna talk for years.So is the bad rep unjustified to me? Yes. Just watch it like you would do a regular VOD action movie and you should have a fun time. Maybe peoples simply had too high expectations for it...",

            "review_title": "Fantastic Flaws",
            "content": "I went to see this movie because I was curious to know exactly why it had been so poorly received by film critics. Basically, the movie has an adequate first act with the introduction of Reed Richards as a brilliant youth and the telling of the events that then led to him and four other humans being given super powers during an ill conceived venture into another dimension. However, once the characters receive their powers, the film's plot essentially collapses with a nearly non-existent middle act and a very brief and incredibly underwhelming final act. The most interesting aspect regarding this movie's performance is the blame game currently taking place with the two main parties receiving blame being director Josh Trank and Fox Studios. After watching the film, it is clear that the blame should fall on whoever was responsible for writing/planning/editing the film's second and final acts and then those who approved those acts. What is most frustrating is that based on the film's first act, it appears that in the beginning, somebody did have the goal of making a good although very different Fantastic 4 movie than we had previously seen. However, at about the time Reed escapes and the moves jumps forward 1 year, any notion of a good film was thrown out the window and instead the movie's only objective became to introduce and defeat the Big Bad (Dr. Doom) in the quickest manner possible and to call it a day.Watching this film is mostly a frustrating experience as it is greatly unfulfilling to watch a talented cast struggle through such a mediocre script barring the film's first act. With a brisk running time of 100 minutes, the film is simply too short to succeed in telling a satisfactory story especially when more than half of that time is spent leading up to the characters receiving their powers. Obviously, the film is only able to achieve its short running time by essentially compressing its middle act into a few scenes that entirely skip over the characters reacting to their new powers and more importantly, ever bonding as a team. In fact, other than Richards, the other 3 Fantastic 4 members hardly every communicate with one another during the entire film. The short running time and the weak script is especially damaging given that it results in a film with essentially no character development between any of the characters and the film's villain which is a problem considering that the film's primary goal is for its characters to become a team and to defeat said villain. It is honestly difficult to judge the 5 main characters' acting performances as they are given so little to do in the movie and there is no point discussing any other actors in the film as they do not even qualify as being 2 dimensional.Overall, it seems that the original goal of the film was to tell a re-imagined grittier and more realistic version of the comic-based characters receiving these incredible powers and then learning to cope with these powers but then at about halfway along the way, somebody (Fox presumably) wanted this movie to be a conventional superhero movie with special effects and a big fight scene but had no clue on how to write and execute such a story from the page to the screen. The end result is a movie with a perfectly enjoyable albeit quiet first act and then a jumble of scenes and a few average special effects that someone thought could be considered the middle and final acts of a movie. I encourage anyone interested in film making to see this film as it will make one appreciate the value of a good script and the importance of proper pacing and character development. A movie without these elements simply feels like a series of disconnected scenes that prevents the viewer from ever becoming engaged with the film's characters and their fates. There were instances of potential throughout the film (Richard and Ben's relationship, Richard meeting Sue and Victor, a couple of funny one-liners, a decent score) but in the end, none of these moments amounted to anything as at a certain point the movie stopped caring about its plot and characters and only cared about reaching the finish line and setting up a sequel that is very unlikely to ever see the light of day.On a final and lighter note, seeing somebody watch a computer monitor is not an action scene despite what this movie would like us to believe.",

            "content": "Fant4stic four reviewMuch has been revealed about the fiasco that was FANTASTIC FOUR 2015. I'll leave the details of the isolationist director, close shaves with angry cast members and a studio's overboard executive meddling for your internet search engines. Let's get down to the movie. Caught in-between the deep and gritty of Warner/DC and then kid friendly comedy of Disney/Marvel, FANT4STIC FOUR (as it is stylised in promotional material) is a curious creature which tried to do both and ended up.......not so successful. It tried to go for the \"grounded fantasy\" of DC, all angsty, deep and tragic, while still wanting to maintain the appeal to youngsters with witty jokes and superficial laughs. Many have slammed this movie for its lack of action and deviation from the explosive norm that has become superhero films. I feel that audience have just become spoiled by the action heavy formula of modern blockbusters. FANT4STIC FOUR is not a superhero movie in that sense. It would be more in line with the \"science gone wrong\" genre of movies that were real big in the late 1980s through 90s. A common complain is that it is too dark but dark can be good if directed and written well.What FF lacks first of all is coherence. The story is a straightforward one: science goes wrong, tragedy strikes, heroes forever changed, then they band together to save the world. Tone wise, The movie's story starts off as a kind of \"science fiction Harry Potter\". It's the story of boy genius Reed Richards getting accepted into an institute of geniuses. Then once an experimental teleporter is completed, Reed and pals boldly go where no man has gone before on to the planet of CGI wonders. From there the tone whiplashes into a Syfy original with the four friends captured and experimented on. Guilt ridden Reed escapes, and we get another tone shift into a fugitive movie with Reed on the run and his former friends trained by the military to take him down. But wait there's more! A new teleporter is completed which brings back a powerful new foe who wants to destroy the world leading up to a climax right out of Dragonball Evolution. You see where this is heading? It's like four different movies cut and pasted into one. FANT4STIC FOUR (FF) had intriguing ideas that I could get behind with enough twists from the original comic to make it fresh. None of those ideas get developed at all! Second big mistake. Sue and Reed being intellectual rivals is something new but it just gets turned into......not even a romance or a friendship for that matter. Johnny not being able to live up to his father's expectations. Yes he acts out, yes he finally gets to step out of daddy's shadow by using his new powers to make a difference to American peace keeping efforts......but that is only implied with some dialogue and never brought up again as if Johnny were a token minority character. Then we got Ben who could have turned out most refreshing. Unlike his comic counterpart who is was a baseball champion, US marine, pilot and an all round big tough guy, Ben in this movie is a scrawny loser picked on by his siblings, living in a junk yard and with little future to look forward to if not for his friendship with Reed. What an intriguing character arc it would have been for Ben who goes from wimp to rock covered Captain America. He becomes a war hero in the service of his nation all the while despising the inhuman Thing he had become. Do we get to explore that internal dissonance? No. His grudge against Reed for turning him into a monster? Forgotten in 5 minutes. Ben who was shown to never hurt a fly has been made to kill for his country, but no single mental ramification at all. No regret? No crisis of conscience? No character development, pure and simple. The 2005 movie, Heck, even the cartoons managed to give Ben Grimm a more developed character than this movie showing him grappling with the loss of his humanity going from all American hero to ugly Monster with all that entails. Mishandled and miscast, Ben Grimm as the Thing looks great in all his motion capture rock encrusted glory. But every time he speaks and that wimpy TinTin voice comes out, it's almost hilarious. Boasting a budget of $120 million, one wonders where all that money went. I've already mentioned how good The Thing looks thanks to the motion capture expertise of Weta digital, the guys behind Lord of the Rings. But everything else looked cheap. From the CGI Baxter building to a CGI monkey likely reused from Dawn of the Planet of The Apes to the entire CGI \"planet zero\" looking like a video game. Throw all that in with a climax that is all to short and sloppily edited and you have FANT4STIC FOUR. The best example of wasted potential in a superhero movie. It had great ideas, bright new concepts open to exploration and development but alas got caught up in all the behind-the-scenes debacles. The drama during production overshadows the lack thereof within the actual movie. Who knows? To recoup on the loss Fox may release \"the making of\" feature and makes tons more money capitalising on the controversies involving director Josh Trank.",

I was going in with the lowest expectations possible, I was thinking I was going to hate myself for being there are giving this movie money, but on the contrary I came out actually pleased. Of course it has its flaws, buy a 9% on rotten tomatoes and a 4,0 on IMDb is totally out of proportion guys, come on. I think too many people just jumped on the band wagon that the internet started and didn't even give this film a chance and I am very saddened by that.I thought that the ridiculous drama that happened behind the scenes for this film was going to pester me throughout the whole duration and surprisingly enough I was only partially bothered. OK, so lets just address the elephant in the room right away, there are no two ways around it: that climax was poor. The whole Dr. Doom stuff happened in the arch of fifteen minutes and was absolutely out of nowhere. By far I will admit the worst part of the film was his arch, his motivations and obviously his design and powers. It was just ridiculous. But you know what? Even then I wasn't hating anything about this and I will explain why later. Just to close the point on the fact of the behind the scenes drama, which, with the exception of that whole climax and some uneven editing that came around every once in a while, I didn't even notice and wouldn't have had I not know beforehand.What ultimately made this movie work for me in almost every scene were the characters. And I will admit it up front, maybe the fact that I am a comic book reader and the fact that I love the Fantastic Four made me fill in the gaps of what wasn't there, but I really, really liked those characters. The actors were all very well cast and gave committed performances too. I was expecting Miles Teller to be phoning it in like in \"Divergent\" (and be it clear: I am a big Teller fan), but he was always convincing as the character. They were likable, there chemistry was on and every time they were in danger I felt true tension. I don't know why, but it's something innate to feel tension or not and I did. The stakes were always there and I was always hooked by them.Furthermore the CGI by all means isn't excellent, but it used when it needs to and en-chances those moments as it should. The Thing looks amazing I will give it that. The powers they have are always used genuinely as anyone would use them and it really elevated some parts. Especially that climax, as I said before I was never despising it and that is because I did have that connection to the characters and because they always felt true. I was excepting this film to collapse miserably at any moment and it never did.Of course I have to address the fact that the film does not have a central story for you to hold your breath for, that it slips a couple too many times in silliness and that it skips some very important story beats that needed to be there. In no way this film doesn't have those flaws. But I wasn't bothered by them as much as I thought I would and ended up having a decent time at the cinema.",

            "content": "So to clear a few things up so haters can direct their hatred to the real culprits.\"Constantin films\" are the company that own the movie rights to the Fantastic four, they made both the previous Fantastic Four movies, with each movie being released through 20th Century Fox, the parent company, Marvel Studios only had a small consultancy role in all 3 movies which is also the same with all Marvel properties whose cinematic & TV rights are held by other company's.This particular movie was a \"rush job\" with Constantin Films only having 28 days left in which to have the movie finished & released before the rights were legally returned to Marvel Studios.So just to be clear, this movie is a Constantin Films/20th Century Fox release NOT a Marvel Studios release.Unfortunately with a lack of decent writing talent the producers chose to do a reboot of their 2005 movie, big mistake, poor casting choices & lacklustre script together with low budget cgi saw the movie barely break even with its $100 million dollar budget & fall short of the box office takings of both previous movies in 2005 & 2007.Changing the characters was a big risk & a bad mistake, choosing to use a darker retelling of the origin rather than using a new story was a bad mistake, something Sony has learned from with Spiderman, omitting the superhero aspect of the Fantastic Four was a huge mistake, all in all its a watchable film for a straight to video release or a sci-fi channel movie but its full of bad choices & ultimately its a huge mistake.Hopefully once Marvel make room for it in the MCU they will do justice to The Fantastic Four.Fun fact : this is actually the fourth FF movie, with the 1st being a TV movie straight to video release that actually didn't get released, at least I've not been able to find any copy's, there was a screenshot of the cast in full costume that was released.I get that these studios want to do contemporary story's of these characters so they can be brought up to date & be more relevant but there is no need with the Fantastic Four, stick to the original source material, set the origin of these characters in the 60s & build the story from there, stop trying to rewrite these characters for the modern age.",

Wonder what's going wrong...? Sure, THE FANTASTIC FOUR was \"just a comic book,\" but it was one of THE all-time Great Comic Books and Kirby's run of 100 consecutive issues the stuff of Legend to those of us who grew up loving comics. The first attempt at a live-action FANTASTIC FOUR was so financially challenged (much of it was shot in darkness, for obvious reasons) that it was shelved so fast that it never saw the light of day (except on YOUTUBE, of course, which is where I saw it); the second and third attempts weren't much better, despite the fact that they had money enough to do the entire 100 issue run by Kirby (with enough left over for a large, buttered popcorn and a Cherry Coke)... and now, this. To be fair, this movie's not badly directed (in fact, it's VERY well directed; I was genuinely surprised, expecting something akin to the previous abortive attempts) and some of the fx are truly outstanding (truly). The biggest problem lies with the WRITING. Had this one been written HALF as well as it was directed, this could've been The One. As it is, it's just boring- again.",

I liked how the tone was darker than the average comic book movie. The beginning starts out promising. Then the minutes start to go by and little to nothing happens. The characters were flat and boring, and so was the acting. I'd be OK with that as long as the film had something else going for it, but it didn't. It was just focusing on these characters who had no chemistry together, who didn't seem like friends, just like actors pretending to be friends. None of the relationships had any depth. Reed and Ben are supposed to be great friends, yet Ben seems indifferent to Reed. There's a quasi-romantic subplot that's given barely any airtime. Maybe that's for the best because it was really forced. Then, a hour in I might add, they get their powers and cut to: \"one year later\" Why??!! So dumb. We don't get to see enough of what any of them can do. The special effects are.... passable at times, but not great. The CGI monkey looked really fake. It was only on screen for like a few seconds. Couldn't they have gotten a real monkey? When Reed stretched his face it looked like something out a Doctor Who episode. The classic series. You can tell that Miles Teller actually thought he was in a good movie in the first twenty minutes or so. Then later on, he looks like he just wants to get his scenes over so he can go back to his trailer. The visual effect/action scenes involve a lot of looking at tennis balls on poles, while in front of a greenscreen. There's not much art to it. The last fight scene feels tacked on and pointless, the stakes don't feel high. And how the Fantastic Four come together in the end is so anti-climatic. There's no \"Yes! Let's do this!\" moment, just a lot of unhappy looking actors saying their poorly written lines. And that last scene, where they're all joking around, completely undermines the darker tone they were kind of trying for. Though the movie has something going for it: The scene where Doom walks through the hallway and makes peoples' heads explode was amazing. That's one of the most memorable scenes I've seen in a movie this year. I'm not kidding. And the music behind it was like a dissonant pounding. I loved it. That element of horror really worked. They should have expanded on that. But nope, here we have a movie that basically exists to set-up another movie that no one will want to see. So, to summarize, the characters sucked, the special effects and action scenes were mediocre, barely anything happened, but there was one awesome scene.",

I'm just going to be frank on this with anyone that is reading this review. This movie is completely boring and terrible at the highest level possible. Its more boring then Ang Lee's Hulk movie back in 2003 and even that movie had a bit more action and better acting in then this movie does that FOX has released to the public. The whole time that you watch this movie it will keep wondering when will the action start and it doesn't start until 1 hours and 20 mins into the movie where a fight scene happens. It is the only one major fight scene in this poor excuse of a movie where it involves the Fantastic Four and Doom fighting each other which is just awful. The fight does not add anything in this movie at all. Though-out the whole movie nothing amazing happens. Most of the time characters just working around talking to each other and doing nothing interesting at all. The people acting in this movie just come across as if they're drugged and just bored with being in the movie. It makes Kristen Steward's acting in the Twilight movies look more life-like which is funny because she barely shows any form acting or emotion in any of her movies but that is a different story.The SFX are nothing special or awe inspiring like other successful comic book movies out there so don't go thinking that your mind will be blown away because it won't. The story is nothing special which makes it even more boring and dull to watch. The actors neither act or even look like the characters from the Fantastic Four. They have zero chemistry and don't even act like a family like they're suppose in the comic books. Dr. Doom is neither menacing or come across as a real threat as he is suppose to like in the comic books. Plus, he looks nothing Dr. Doom, he just look likes a green glowing crash dummy instead of Dr. Doom from the comic books. Worse, this movie also tries so hard to be like Nolan's Batman movie only for it to just fall flat on its face trying to do so. It tries to put in the dark, gloomy and realistic elements of Nolan's Batman movies but at the process of taking away the fun elements from the Fantastic Four comic books. What is worse is that the actors involved in the movie were told to not even read the comic books to become familiar with the role. Why is that? In the modern era of comic book movie, almost every movie actor has been told to read the comic books to understand the characters. Why did Fox and the director did the opposite and tell their cast to not read the comic books? It makes no sense at all.This whole movie was just a Fantastic Four In Name Only Movie. Nothing more and nothing less. I agree with the majority of fans, critics and movie-goers out there. FOX studios only made this movie to keep the Fantastic Four movie rights from Marvel Studios and now is blowing up in their faces big time! The movie on Rotten Tomates has a lower rating then Batman and Robin (1997) and that is suppose to be the worse comic book movie ever to be made. Funny thing is as terrible as Batman and Robin was I found it to be a more entertaining then this movie. At least I could laugh at how stupid Batman and Robin was but this movie just wants to put me to sleep. I had to push myself to finish watching this movie. This new Fantastic Four movie is in a league of its own when it comes to be a terrible comic book movie or just a movie in general. It will not be long before it becomes the worst comic book movie of all time. I honestly hope that the movie rights goes back to Marvel Studios because FOX cannot be trust with the franchise. They multiple chances to get it right and they have failed each time because they purposely wanted to ruin the franchise. FOX and Josh Trank (Director of Fantastic Four 2015) have only themselves to blame for this movie that is flopping badly for all the right reasons. In conclusion, don't waste your money on this movie. Either see it for free or wait for it to be released at the 99 cent store. Don't torture yourself trying to spend money on it unless you want to cure yourself from insomnia but that is another story. This movie is just dull, boring and just totally lifeless movie. It offers nothing to the Fantastic Four franchise and it doesn't do it any justice at all. It is the ultimate failure as a comic book movie and it won't be long before people consider this movie as easily one of the many worse movies ever made.1 out of 5 stars",

The retelling lacks the essence of what made the Fantastic Four so great in comics\u2014a sense of family.There is absolutely zero chemistry between the 4 main characters (or actors, for that matter). Despite the furtive glances and lingering camera shots, there's zero romantic chemistry between Reed and Sue (nor is there any sizzle in the longing glances from Victor to Sue.) There's no sibling \u0085anything\u0085 between Johnny and Sue to indicate they grew up in the same household. One lame attempt at kid rivalry between Johnny and Ben. And it's so hard to believe that Reed and Ben are best friends (the young kids do a better job at making us believe the mismatched pair are besties).You know it's coming, but the third act fight scene still manages to feel disjointed and unlike the first two acts. Not only does it come across disjointed, the third act is so ham-handed and rushed. The dialogue is stilted, the acting is worse, and some of the fight scenes border on ridiculous. And they never follow up on the redemption that's supposed to bring them all together.But most unforgivable for this reboot are the laughable special effects.The Human Torch effects looked better in 2005 and 2007 (given the technology at the time) that in this movie. And you almost wish they'd just used the bubble from The Wizard of Oz to depict Sue Storm's force field rather than the neon blue mess they decided on. They gave elastic fighting a decent attempt, but it fails.But most awful is the final look they landed on for Dr. Doom. Just\u0085no. It's like they ran out of time.One thing this new film does better than the previous two is the special effects for The Thing; definitely a great effort (though, you kind of wish they'd put pants or shorts on him). It's unsettling that he's all Ken-doll down there.Considering how good Ant-Man is, Fantastic Four is a let-down.If you're stuck on an airplane for many hours and have exhausted all the other entertainment options, put this on. It'll keep you mildly occupied for 100 minutes.",

There are so many good ideas for movies out there so in my opinion they should not make reboots anyway. A movie should get one chance to be the best it can be so if it sucked don't remake it. If the original is awesome then that's even more reason not to remake at the risk of making a lesser version which is what happens 9 times out of 10.",

His only directing credit is a dark and twisty science fiction movie like CHRONICLE. It was very grounded and solid at least to me. Not great. Not \"fantastic.\" But a solid movie nonetheless.

I mean come on, let's be serious, which movie takes 70% of it's time just to introduce 2 characters and nothing else? Especially when i think it's an action movie, oh it was so boring and bad. The cgi wasn't that great, the stone guy was really bad, too much detailing, the young inventor was too young obviously and why the father had to die right at the end?

With this being a well known fact \u2013 the question looming on most everyone's mind regarding this film: 'Is Fantastic Four..well..Fantastic?' With only a few ups and many downs, the answer sadly is no. How you ask can this happen? Well oddly enough it's the sheer lack of an exciting story.We open on brilliant child scientist Reed Richards, (Miles Teller) who is on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and then bring it back though they don't know where it goes or comes back from. Jump to a few years later at his high school science fair and he and the project while being dis-qualified from the fair are being recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey).With this Reed is given the resources and help by Storm's children, the brother & sister team of Sue Storm (Kate Mara) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) along with Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell), to finish what he started all those years ago in his garage. When they finally crack inter-dimensional travel, Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to travel to the other dimension/world along with him and the team. An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness and use their powers and work as a team to stop Von Doom who is now hell bent on destroying Earth.You would think this could all be exciting right? Well it's actually a rather dull and plodding affair which was surprising as with most of the cast here notably Teller, Jordan, Bell and especially Toby Kebbell are all actors who have had some damned notable roles in their perspective careers.While I could have used more Von Doom, it probably still wouldn't have saved this lifeless movie as the whole storyline is just weak with a finale that will impress no one.

            "content": "Going into the latest attempt at Fantastic Four, it was impossible for me not to be aware of all the production troubles: altercations between the director and cast, unnecessary studio involvement, last minute re-shoots, etc... However, many films in the past have succeeded despite troubled production, Jaws, Star Wars, to name 2 of the top of my head, so I was able to watch this with an open mind. Unfortunately, what I ended up with is what most feared: a Fantastic Four film doing the absolute minimum to be considered a film (so that Fox can retain the rights to the characters) and very little else. The Good: The first half of this movie came across as \"pretty bad\", which is a compliment relative to what I could say about the second half. It sets the film up for what could have been very interesting takes on these characters. For comic book readers, the setup is more close to the \"Ultimate Fantastic Four\" series than anything else. It has a somewhat \"sci-fi\" setting with some \"Cronenberg-ian\" elements mixed in. The Bad: Well, on a superficial level, the special effects look surprisingly dated, especially when held to the standard of other superhero films of today. The characters never feel like characters, they just feel like actors taking turns saying expository dialogue to move the plot forward until the end. Motivations just seem to pop out of thin air, and Dr. Doom is somehow done much worse than in previous entries. It's very unfortunate we can't get a decent Dr. Doom, he's not that hard of character to \"get right\". If Marvel can pull off \"Rocket Raccoon\", Dr. Doom should be a walk in the park. My biggest disappointment is that in the end, the film is just bad. Not a \"so bad its fun\" kind of bad, but just plain bad. Who I recommend it for: Just about no one, even the most hardcore of comic book fans. If you're really curious as to how poor this project turned out, and have been asking yourself \"how bad is it?\" then knock yourself out :)",

Everybody knows the Fantastic 4 and everybody wanted to see a reboot because the previous movie also sucked. This decade is a time that super hero films have a very large fan group and every movie is anticipated with enthusiasm.The latest installment of Fantastic 4 did everything wrong. Starting with the duration, 100' is way too short for a reboot. They probably had a very low budget, considering the fact that many of the trailer scenes were deleted from the final outcome. The heroes are presented with the minimum background given, they tell us almost nothing about their personality and they are immediately put together as a team at a very expensive government project without anyone knowing anything about them. The Doom villain is one of the most powerful bad guys in the Marvel Universe and they defeat him in a 5 minute battle.That being said and with those thoughts in mind, I left the theater very disappointed and suggested others not to bother watching the movie because its probably one of the worst they would have ever seen.Do not watch this film if you are a hero fan!",

Fox themselves have set the bar so high with the success of Deadpool, that making a comic book movie \"work\" (even if it's a bit plodding or messy, I'm looking at you Batman v Superman) shouldn't be all that much of a struggle anymore.What can be said about it that hasn't already been said? The plot: threadbare and so dreadfully \"by the numbers\" that it's insulting to the audience's intelligence. The pacing: not just uneven, but utterly dull. The characters: poorly written and deviating so far from their comic book source material (and I'm not talking about the non-issue of the Human Torch being black), that they're unrecognizable. The writing: far too cringe-worthy and inconsistent within itself to create enough of a framework for any concept, bit of action, or line of dialogue to be successful.

I enjoyed it way more than all the spider-man films, the avengers films, the previous fantastic 4 films and the 2nd and 3rd Iron man movies (loved the 1st iron man - this film is on par with that).If you like action movies with lots of special effects then this is for you.If you're a purest comic book fan with no space in your tiny little mind for an evolution of ideas then you probably already gave this a totally undeserved scathing review.Watch it and make up your own minds people :)",

            "content": "Despite all the negative reviews, the 3.9 on IMDb and just 9% on Rotten Tomatoes, I still went to see this to be able to see for myself if it really was the disaster everyone says it is. And although it is a flawed film, it really does not deserve the harsh reception it has been given. The fault really lies, not with the film itself, but with a skewered perception by modern day viewers of what a comic book film should be based upon what Marvel Studio themselves have created in the 'MCU'. But first of all, regarding the MCU, lets have a reality check. Fans have become so blinkered into believing that that whatever Marvel Studios touch is going to turn to gold, they cannot see the wood for the trees and will defend their films to the hilt. Iron Man 2. It was clearly a rushed film to promote the up and coming Avengers. There was hardly and plot and the villain was made up, a mish mash of two other villains from the comics. The build to the finale was so very slow and after a truly embarrassing drunken party scene we had a blink and you miss it fight at the end. Iron Man 3. Right, any criticism of Fantastic Four not being true to comics stops here. The Mandarin. Do I need to say anymore? The film is also full of plot holes big enough to drop a space armada through. Killian \"I am the Mandarin\" doesn't get killed by being trapped in the iron man suit and it blowing up, but a small rocket drop kicked to the face by a super powered pepper pots can finish him off? Thor 2. I can't even remember what happened I this film it made that much of an impression on me. Avengers Age of Ultron. A classic case of more is not always better. Age of Ultron bludgeoned the audience with non-stop CGI and endless wise cracks. They ruined a great comic book villain by turning him into the comic relief with zero sense of threat. Hulk Buster can take out the Hulk with one punch to the face? And they killed off a character that should easily be able to dodge bullets by getting shot. Oh, and why was Tony Stark back as iron man exactly? Didn't he quit and destroy all his drones in iron man 3?So you see, not everything Marvel Studios has done is good. Iron Man, Thor, Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy are great films. Ant man is good and Incredible Hulk is okay. (Real shame we wont be seeing Tim Blake Nelsons 'The Leader' anytime soon). It also seems the MCU has free reign to mix up some of its own comic book lore. And yet here we are, with people saying this is not 'their' Fantastic Four. Hang on, really? Lets take a look at the synopsis for Marvels own 'The Ultimate Fantastic Four'. I have taken this from Wikipedia.'While the characters may bear resemblance to their normal Marvel Universe counterparts, they differ in many aspects. The origin of their powers is different and the team is much younger. The series revolves around the adventures of Reed Richards, Ben Grimm, and siblings Susan and Johnny Storm, who get engulfed in a malfunctioned teleporter experiment and get superpowers... Reed is a child genius who displayed his curiosity from the day he was born. At the age of 11, following a demonstration of his research on the field of teleportation at a school science fair, Reed was recruited for a government program which sponsors young geniuses' research. He continued his research at the government research facility located in Manhattan's Baxter Building. At the age of 21 his research was realized as he and several others attempted to teleport organic material through an alternate plane of existence called the N-Zone. The experiment went awry giving Reed and several others superpowers.' This is the exact same story in the film! And on Doctor Doom who has been getting a fair amount of criticism, this is what Marvel themselves did to the Character.'Victor Van Damme (yes that's right, Van Damme) was also a member of the youth research project that recruited Reed and Susan, and sees science as an art as opposed to Reed's view of it as a system... Van Damme worked with Richards on his device to teleport organic matter to the N- Zone. ..the experiment resulted in the accident that created the Fantastic Four. Van Damme was also affected by the experiment: Most of his body was transformed into metal, his legs were reshaped into cloven hooves and his internal organs were converted into a toxic substance. So you see, they have simply lifted he story arc from the Ultimate version and they did quite a good job of it too. But it seems fairly clear based on the evidence that film is itself is paced somewhat erratically towards the end, and certainly after director Josh Trank's recent tweet about it not being the film he had a year ago, that the studio did not have the courage to see the creative process through, and caved in to endless fan boy complaints, making changes and ending up with a film doesn't satisfactorily deliver on it original vision. And that's a shame as there is some good stuff here. I liked the build up, the first trip was well done, the first time we see their transformation was intriguing and I actually liked Doom, but he was wasted. I would like to have seen what the original version would have been. I enjoyed watching this more than the MCU films I have already brought to task and hope that FOX have the courage to release a directors cut on BLU-RAY.",

I almost decided I would never give it a watch purely based on the amount of negative reviews of this Film. I'm also happy to say how glad I am that against all previous judgements I decided to give it a watch. I can tell you right now that it is not the best superhero film I have ever watched but it never lost me for a minute. The plot is great, the anticipation is good, the acting is good, and the special effects are very good. It is well worth a watch and you should not let yourself be put off by bad reviews. When I see someone has given it a one then for me that person should not be allowed to continue to give reviews on IMDb as in my opinion they have been lazy and irresponsible. Fantastic Four has all the events of a good superhero film but it is not as grandiose as a lot of the other Marvel and DC movies. For me it is not always a bad thing to be a little more understated as long as the story is good which it is in this case. For me a good example would be Superman Returns which was grandiose and boring and lacked any imagination or heart. Fantastic Four has plenty of heart and sometimes people are so quick to judge a film based on all the little boxes they feel it should tick that they lose sight of the fact that a film made with heart will still shine through regardless of whether it conforms to the typical stereotype of the genre. All in all this has felt more like a rant than a review but my message is, don't be put off by the 4 rating, watch it and see for yourself!!",

            "content": "I truly believe that if no one had ever heard of the Fantastic Four, this would've been a success. Like are you telling me you didn't think the first half of this movie was intriguing at all? Because I think everyone was really enjoying this movie until they botched the last half of it. Majority of the hate is from people trying to trend and over exaggerating. If I had to compare this to anything, I think it closely resembles the structure of Batman V Superman. It's full of well directed and scripted scenes in the first acts but leaves something to be desired as it progresses. This is the result of trying to build a group of characters from the ground up, and then forcing in a conflict capable of being in an entirely separate movie. For Batman V Superman, it was Doomsday. For Fantastic Four, it was Dr. Doom. I really don't think it was enough to ruin the movie. It just keeps it from being perfect. Audiences are so quick to jump to trends. Like in B. V. S., everyone was hating on that movie for the first few weeks of its release, then all of the sudden, the merchandise sells out like crazy and everyone boards the trend of Ben Affleck's Batman being the greatest. It's the same thing with Fantastic Four. It was given hate during its initial release except it never got bigger given it's relevancy to the MCU died instantaneously being as it was Sony rather than Disney where as Batman V Superman was a starter for the Justice League universe. Also the Fantastic Four isn't nearly as popular as Batman or Superman despite being extremely well known.Without a doubt, this certainly had a darker tone than the previous Fantastic Four films and even the comics. Personally I liked the changes they made. The Thing and The Human Torch working as government assassins made them more interesting in my opinion. Same with Susan and Johnny being able to do hands on work with Reed Richards. It adds more to their personalities and gives them more to do then just following Mr. Fantastic and adding comic relief when need be. It just works better with a more modern audience.I think you should give this a shot if you found this movie even moderately intriguing. It's not a complete train reck like the critics are making it out to be. Also the MCU definitely stole Thing's design for Korg in Thor. Both Korg and Thing are designed differently in the comics but the MCU straight up took the Sony Thing's design. I don't know why no one mentions this.",

Or so I hope... To think this was created intentionally would be an embarrassment to every other Marvel movie and the Fantastic Four franchise. The pacing of this movie is horrible and not well thought out. It could metaphorically be compared to starting at Monday, waiting for the weekend, getting knocked out on Friday night, and waking up at 11:58pm on Sunday night. The amount of time wasted in this movie to get to Friday night (the major plot line) was incredibly boring and didn't contribute to character development or important story aspects at all. The movie could have literally started at Friday night and nothing else would change! When we do get to Friday night, the climatic weekend doesn't exist and you get the shortest boss fight in Marvel history at 11:58pm on Sunday night (because the weekend was a bunch of boring mush). Finally you leave the movie feeling like it's Monday again. This movie was also lamer than this metaphor. There was zero character development. There were hints there may be some relationships forming, but the writers wasted there time because they couldn't be bothered developing these hints to \"go\" anywhere. As insulting as this may sound, Twilight for once was a better love story! And yes, this movie was lamer than Twilight. The actors and actresses were completely wasted in their potential. Their characters lightened up during these brief moments that went know where, but it didn't take long for them to return to a state more jaded than Daria, but without her great anti-social and sarcastic finesse! I hope their careers aren't ruined because of a terrible script that didn't give them opportunity. The main characters were also pushed aside in the movie to create room for fitting in stupid, nameless characters with no common sense we love to hate. With the first Fantastic Four movies, as much as you love or hate them, there were at least focuses on the major Heros. There were zero connections to these characters in this version as the writers, to put simply, offered no opportunity. To summarise, this is the word Marvel movie in history, it's ruined everyone involved, it's not worth seeing, and you'll be better off staying at home with your cat who might do something interesting and become an Internet sensation. An Internet sensation that will earn more views on YouTube than the gross profit of this terrible movie. A movie lamer than this review!",

It's entertaining enough for a family weekend movie at the cinema.Marvel movies have evolved where not necessary every superhero movie must have great special effects, popular casts, non-stop action etc. Ant-Man is a very welcomed change to Marvel movies with plenty of humor blended into action.Watching Fantastic Four is like watching Stand By Me of the 70s. It's not about awesome fighting scenes or explosive special effects. Just watch it with an open mind and do not give a single thought that this reboot must be better than the original and you will not end up disappointed.Ignore what the critics say as there are no more trustworthy reviews online. As you may have known, if the reviewers are so good at criticizing then why are they not film directors or producers? Why don't they unite their talent and help produce blockbuster movies every month? Even if they think they achieved success with their own production, how would they feel if we were to criticize them and compare their work with the 'Greats'? I believe it's long overdue that IMDb has to change it's User Review policy by only allowing positive reviews to be published. Leave the negative reviews to a sister-site to separate the visitors interest.By doing so using the most popular Movie Review Website, all those who are involved in the production of the movie at least have a consolation to see their effort being appreciated by a certain few.Trust me, Life would be even more 'bored' without them.",

Absolutely nothing fits together or makes sense in this half baked, poorly stitched together flop of a film.First things first: stop rushing things.

The scenes kind of haphazardly jumped from one thing to another without a viable segue. And unknown to me how they did it, they managed to have the entire film moving at a glacial pace story wise and still felt like it was speeding towards the climactic ending that was, in actuality, rather anticlimactic. Also the actors had NO CHEMISTRY which is rather ironic as they were playing scientist and a few of them had acted together before. Their scenes were devoid of any real passion for the subjects they were discussing or each other. You would cringe as they tried to laugh at a joke they made or at the awkwardness they brought out in each other. It was just overall hard to watch.But the real demon in this drudgery was the fact that the film didn't explain anything. Absolutely nothing gets spelled out for you in any way, shape or form and you are expected to just accept the blatant pseudo science that they peddle out to you as if we don't know better. Well newsflash Trank, we do know better. We do. And we don't like your treating us as if we were stupid.

And during the 90 minutes I found myself enjoying every second of the film.

I hope you enjoy it all the same.Will 20th Century Fox ever learn? So this is the third or fourth attempt depending on how you count at a fantastic four film. It remains hilarious that Roger Corman's poorly filmed nineties entry is the best of the series and now Josh Trank's 2015 reboot is the worst. Before we get started I want to make it clear that this was my most anticipated superhero film of the year. The very first trailer had me hooked. It felt fresh, new, and inventive. The tone felt right. I started comparing it to The Dark Knight Rises. I told anyone who would listen that the franchise was in good hands. Josh Trank would not let us down. How wrong I was.Although this film is a travesty, it does have one thing going for it; the story is different than the other Fantastic Four films; which is either a blessing or a curse depending on how devoted you are to the original Marvel comics series. Five teenagers create their own teleportation device, don't worry I will skim over this part, like the movie does. Just don't ask how they ever created it in the first place. The writers have no idea, that and they are desperately trying to erase this film from their portfolios. Who can blame them?Four of the teenagers; Reed, Johnny, Ben and Victor use the teleportation devices to transport themselves to a different world which they can discover. The last teenager Sue stays behind, the men do all the dirty work and Sue is presumably making them cups of tea. But things go awry. The planet collapses and Victor is lost in the ensuing chaos. The four remaining teenagers gain powers, some good, some bad and ugly. You may be wondering why I haven't summed up the characters traits. That's because they don't exhibit any. They are merely character a, b, c, d and e. At this point I'm wondering whether I should even care, when a film is made this haphazardly and well, terribly for that matter. There's no one to latch onto. No emotion. No heart. No soul. Even films that dealt with darkness and the loss of a person's soul had something to cling to. Fant4stic doesn't care that you don't know who's who and you can't tell them apart. Want to know why? Because it's a money making scheme. Attract big stars, an up and coming director, the marvel brand and it's a sure fire winner right? Wrong. Fant4stic was a flop critically and financially, receiving worse reviews than the previous films and less hard earned cash. Fox might want to rethink their technique; they don't have a clue what they are doing.After they receive their powers, the teenagers then spend a year brooding. Then some guy in a comic con mask shows up and does a bad impression of Bane. Queue atrocious dialogue, naff special effects and battles so short you'll swear you played the film in fast forward mode. They groan, moan and sulk a little more. Then Reed says he's thought up a name for them \"We'll call ourselves The Fantastic\u0085.\" Cut to black. You are left with a feeling of emptiness and pure hatred. You scream and cry. How can a film that's directed by Josh Trank be this dire and mind numbingly clich\u00e9d? Well he only directed half of it. The producers finished the film and the re-shoots are blatantly obvious \u2013 look at Kate Mara's blonde wig for further proof. Still not convinced? Well as soon as a queue card comes on the screen that reads \"one year later\" it marks the departure of Josh Trank; the only person in the film, well alongside Kate Mara, Michael B Jordan and Miles Teller who actually cared. But it doesn't matter. They're signed on for bigger and better things. I applaud them for moving on. But what about Josh Trank? Star Wars rejected him on the grounds that he would not be a suitable director for their project and now he's nothing. That's show biz. I can imagine him crying in a corner, alone and confused. Someone needs to give him a hug. I want to be the person that does.D+",

The only real good thing about this film is the special effects (6/10), maybe Fox should have spent less time on effects and more time on the story line. The idea is great and really deserves a well made movie. I also enjoyed who they had cast for each role, but what they where given annoys me. Personally I think Marvel should have taken Fantastic Four back from Fox like they did with Spider-Man. If they do go ahead with the second film I won't be watching it. If you haven't seen this film already just putting it simply don't bother.",

The leading fight was a huge disappointment that ended much too quickly.This was definitely a major disappointment, and I found myself finding the last two Fantastic Four films (which were bombs as well) much more enjoyable than this film.

It only makes sense if the series is continued. That way there is less of it in future movies and there is more of a story to it instead.Dr. Doom was pretty intense, but there was barely any of him in it. Both before and after he had his powers, there was not much of him at all. But when he finally made an appearance with his powers, he was powerful in his ability. He was much stronger than what Dr. Doom has ever been. His suit was magnificent. His evil was pure.

That's how abrupt and short this movie was. There were too many gaps, not enough development, unlike the first Fantastic 4. John Trank, you could have done better.

This movie had a whole lot of build up for a whole lot of nothing by the end of it. You rarely see the Fantastic Four's powers in full combat besides maybe the last ten minutes and even in the last ten minutes that was the final fight, this fight was garbage. The end fight was brief and was ultimately a giant let down. The whole movie was mostly back story and the construction of the research project. It has zero to some similarity to the comics we all know and love, and the writing, oh my, like a friend of mine said was \"something you would've heard out of Captain Planet\". I give respect to the idea that it was a younger and \"modern\" cast and Michael B. Jordan, Miles Teller, and Kate Mara are respectable individuals in their own right but not even their acting ability could save this film. Miles needs to call up Scorsese and have their movie pushed up a little bit to give Miles his respect back that many may lose in him after his hit Whiplash. So in conclusion, this was a sad adaptation, ladies and gentleman. You wait and wait for the action and the kick-ass moments we all know and love in comic book movies just to see practically nothing memorable.",

Also it was comical to pass these characters as 18 with the actors that portrayed them as they clearly looked in their mid twenties. Regardless, the first half of the movie was focusing on developing the sense of comraderie between the team and them after the accident it almost becomes horror like briefly with their powers and pain in isolation.

Was it as bad of a movie as critics have been saying? No but it was pretty meh 4.5 out of 10 for me. Despite all the bad reviews on this movie, i have to admit throughout this film it had great potential to be one of the better Marvel films but just kept falling short time after time. Miles Teller was really good in this movie as well as Kate Mara but the rest of the cast which on paper should have been amazing fell very short, i really didn't like Michael B Jordon who missed all his moments, but by far the worst performance even worse the the terrible acting of Tim Blake Nelson was.... Reg E. Cathey who plays Dr.Franklin Storm the father Sue And Johnny he had way to much screen time in which i felt he was just reading off a piece of paper he was holding. Had Samuel L. Jackson not been already signed by Marvel i would have said he would be perfect for this role as well as maybe Morgan Freeman. The Graphics in this movie are cheap i don't understand why, despite that i really like how the Thing looked and i liked the really the how true it was to the Ultimate Fantastic Four comic. I feel a lot of critics don't read comics to see how they almost page for page drawing for drawing used the comic to make this movie which gave it a plus in my book its probably one of the truest to the comic superhero movies we have seen so far, and i personally don't like the Fantastic Four what so ever. I went into this movie with no expectations at all just hoping for something better then the last two and i almost got that, i guess. I did like the dark tone of the movie that was different, but i hate how it doesn't connect with the X-Men/Deadpool universe. I left my chair with two good thoughts after this movie. 1. They laid the ground for a potentially great sequel from seeing what this movie could have been and wasn't to the way they set up for the sequel, even though it probably wont happen. 2. I really like the realistic tone and science behind the whole thing in conclusion this movie suffered from forced acting, un-spontaneous scenes which seemed also forced (eg. when they find Reed Richards at a science fair for a high school in the middle of no where just by chance because two scientist happen to be there looking for the answer to inter dimensional travel.... are you kidding me, god fox try harder), slow pacing and little to no action at all with a lack luster 3rd act. All of this because of being rushed to make a movie just to keep the rights (see Jurassic World, Terminator Genisys, Punisher, Ghost Rider, A Good Day To Die Hard) i just felt like no one cared except Kate Mara and Miles Teller, Josh Trank had a vision which he wasn't allowed to execute due to rich old men who don't know what we as fans want I'm honestly getting tired of Hollywood bull s***. All of the credit i give to this movies is based on small moments of greatness and potential of what could have been. At Least Its Watchable unlike some other comic movies. if your a superhero movie fan i say this is a must watch at least once and would compare it to Green Lantern. watchable but nothing great.",

It may work for darker characters like Batman and even Wolverine, but Fantastic four isn't supposed to be dark. It may be based on the ultimate comic run, but it just shouldn't have been dark.-All of the Sets, and costumes were uninspired and dull.-The acting wasn't good. Most of the cast came as unlikeable. With maybe the exception of Michael B Jordan's Johnny Storm.-I honestly think that This Movie's failure is the reason that Michael B Jordan became more wiser in his Movie role choices and ever since then he starred in better movies (Creed and Black Panther)-Dr. Doom was done horribly. He was also killed which I didn't like.-Josh Trank's vision just didn't work for me. The movie was full boring and I wanted it to end.In Conclusion: This movie was just screaming \"Let's Make it so We can keep the rights.

There is no Stan Lee cameo or post credit scene (so if you are going to waste your money on seeing it don't bother waiting through the credits) which is very un-marvel. 2. the movie has very little action for a superhero film. It spends pretty much the whole movie showing the origin. The action only really starts in the last 10 minutes or so. 3. THE THING HAS NO PANTS!!!!!!. 4. The writing and acting is terrible. A special Ed class could write better dialogue. And after watching Whiplash, I though Miles teller was a good actor but this movie changed my mind. Also I found that the effects weren't very good either (COME ON, ITS 2015). 5. It's just plain old boring. If you like movies, don't see this one, it isn't very fantastic",

Doctor Who fans are in for a treat, as this has all the ingredients that have made all the recent Doctors a hit with the fans; humour, adventure, bonkers science fiction, a leading lady, and an evil nemesis. Okay, Doctor Who is primarily aimed at older children and young teens, with a niche adult fan-base as well. However, the fans of that series know what to expect and as such have rated it 8.8 on IMDb. In that regard, given this movie has most of the same ingredients, perhaps if it were put into a similar genre and fan-base as Doctor Who then this movie would not suffer from the harsh reviews it has.I enjoyed the film, as I had not expectations and definitely found it entertaining. Would I go and see it in the cinema? No, I wouldn't waste my money; but then I would only watch Doctor Who on the TV if there was nothing else to watch. The point here being, know what to expect and you'll be pleasantly surprised and entertained. The current rating, at time of writing, is 4.8/10 which seems a bit unfair.Also you get to see Kate Mara in a latex suit, which may or may not be your thing - but lets look for positives here lol!",

As Lee once said most teams were just that Teams. but we wanted ours to be a Family with the dynamic of a family that acted like real families do.That was the heart and soul of the Fantastic four. a superhero team that was emotional and dysfunctional as a real family. Reed Richards the stern father type wanted to build a rocket to take us to the moon first. To beat the Commies. Sue Storm the rich socialite who funded the Richards Rocket and who was in love with Reed. Her Younger brother Johnny a 16 year old car jockey. Johnny could fix or build anything. And Finally Ben Grimm Reed's best friend. Ben is the greatest pilot alive he can fly anything. When the Rocket takes off the four are subjected to the cosmic rays which transforms them. Reed becomes Mr. Fantastic Sue the Invisible Girl Johnny the Human torch and Ben becomes The Thing . together they face menaces that want to destroy or rule the Earth.The Comics were exciting They had heart and soul and a lot of humor. As well as tragic stories . The Comics made you feel for the heroes and made you feel sorry for the Thing. Now Flash forward. to 2015. Josh Trank is given the job to reboot the Fantastic Four. He pays attention to the Ultimate Fantastic Four series from Marvel. A drastic mistake as the ultimate Fantastic Four was no where as good as the original and made a mess out of their origins and Doctor Doom's . Not to mention the film is all over the place. IT doesn't feel like they're trying to tell a story but are undecided as to what comes next. The heroes act out of established character. And things just don't ring true. It seems forced. Almost like Trank didn't know anything about the Fantastic four to begin with. Michael B. Jordan was cast as the Human Torch early on and the fans revolted. And Jordan didn't disappoint. His Johnny is so smug arrogant and childish that I wanted to slap him. Miles Teller fared no better as Reed Richards . Kate Mera offers nothing to her role as Sue Storm. And Doctor Doom was forgettable. The only dim light here was Jamie Bell's performance as Ben Grimm The Thing. He made Grimm's agony shine thru. And you felt the pathos in him. Other then that the film looks good but has nothing to offer. Its like a beautiful 67 Chevy Impala with no engine. you can look at it all you want. but you are not going anywhere.",

            "content": "I was presented with the \"fantastic\" opportunity to go see this movie in theatres one week before it officially hit the big screens, a decision I still regret. One of my biggest issues with the movie is the fact that the Fantastic 4 are never really a \"team\", Johnny is only there because he's being punished and the Thing only goes because Reed is drunk and thinks it'd be fun if Ben came with him. Also it seems like the producers shot the scene where they visit the other dimension and then said \"Oops, we forgot about Sue\" and they then make a blast that inexplicably hits her and gives her powers. Also after learning of his powers and what has happened to his friends, Reed (the one who is always cast as the leader) just decides to abandon them all and hide. Now lets move on to Dr. Doom, I don't have much to say that's positive, he looked nothing like he has in previous films or any of the comic books and he looked like an absolute joke of a villain. The one good scene he was involved in was when he walked through killing everybody in his way, but even that had it flaws as he was using powers that were never explained! His powers are never even mentioned throughout the whole film. Also after demonstrating his impressive power he is killed by a single punch in a fight scene that lasts less than 15 minutes, that's right, one of the most iconic villains in history is only hit once, and it is what ends up killing him, on the other hand this is the only time when the \"Fantastic 4\" work together as a team... in the whole movie. During the punch \"The Thing\" uses his iconic line \"Its hammer time\" which I liked in the past but in this edition, he gets the line from his abusive older brother, which just seems off to me. that being said the Thing does look pretty good (I still think he'd look better with pants). In summary doom is defeated in a single blow in a 10 minute fight scenes where a unbonded \"team\" of superheroes get along for one scene in the film.",

This morning before going to the theater, I saw the director Josh Trank was already blaming the studio for the crappy reviews the movie got. This is happening the very first day the movie is out. Even so, I decided to watch it anyways. The only thing similar to the comics is the name, and that there are 4 individuals that have powers. Reeds and Sue have no chemistry, and there's no sign of romance at all. Johnny and Ben only talk to each other the last minute of the movie, and it's the human torch who \"cracks\" a joke at the thing, that sounds mean spirited and not funny at all. Reed leaves his friends for a year, and becomes fugitive, and when they find him all is forgotten (by the military and the research founders) in less than a minute. Doom is presented to be almost omnipotent, and is taken down by four kids that have no fighting experience (except the thing) in 3 minutes. This movie makes no sense, the plot is flat and unoriginal, the cast is too young, and it feels more like the story of Reed Richards than that of the team. Sue's hair is something that should not distract me, but it did. You can tell which scenes were a re-shoot just by looking at her wig. Johnny is portrayed as a bad boy with daddy issues, not funny and almost mean spirited. Ben Grimm is the smallest of the four, even Sue. Reed is an introvert that can't lead his own life, let alone a team.I really wanted to like this movie, since I've read lots of comics in my time, and I always welcome a movie adaptation of the genre, but this movie tries really hard to be disliked, and it's the only thing that it's good at.",

Reed Richards (Miles Teller) can now stretch and twist his body at will. His best friend Ben Grimm (Jaime Bell) has gained immense strength. Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) can control and project fire. His sister, Sue Storm (Kate Mara) can manipulate light to become invisible and has telekinetic abilities. Together, they must come together to battle a former friend Doctor Victor Van Doom (Toby Kebbell) who now poses a threat to Earth.I have never seen any of the previous Fantastic Four films beforehand but I was aware of how they were received. I will just come out right now and say it, this film is not very good. I was surprised by how boring it was. Nothing really happens until near the end which is too late because you'll probably just not care by then. I understand that this film is a reboot but you shouldn't spend most of the time doing the rebooting. Most of the time was spent setting up things for the end. Unfortunately the setup here is all bad as the four main actors have no chemistry whatsoever. They never quite spend anytime with one another or even really interact with one another at all as most of this is done off-screen. You're never able to get emotionally invested in any of them. Kate and Johnny have few scenes together and when they do, their interactions imply nothing more than a friendly relationship. I did not buy Reed and Ben being friends either. Ben only comes on late so he does not have too much interaction with the rest of the team and he never really spoke with anyone other than Reed. Because of this lack of bond or chemistry between the actors/characters, the final act becomes void of any emotional depth and you don't get much of a sense of accomplishment. The special effects don't represent a film in 2015 either but I'll let you see those for yourselves. The main villain of the film Van Doom is silly looking with powers that defy all realms of sense because he could simply do anything. His plan just came off as random because we did not get to know to learn too much about him since he is absent for the majority of the movie. This was a shame because I actually liked him and I wish I could have seen him a little more. Perceptive viewers will notice subtle differences during the film's final act as it was reshot so little continuity errors will be evident and what also made it obvious that it was reshot was how it did not fit with the rest of the movie tone-wise. What disappointed me was that I felt the actors just didn't try and that came across while watching it. I heard that the only reason this film was made was so Fox could retain their film rights to the Fantastic Four before they returned to Marvel in 2016.

            "content": "Strangely enough, this is the fourth movie of the ill-fated franchise that is simply known as the Fantastic Four. The one that came out during the 2000's is one of my least favorite super hero movies I've even seen. I will say that while the new one is an improvement, it's not saying that much. Fantastic Four is an origin story of our lead heroes as they try to do some interdimensional traveling and they get superpowers from the result of it. I will give it this, in the first half of the movie, I was actually pretty invested in the story. I especially liked Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan's characters as Reed Richards and Johnny Storm. There is some intrigue about the characters and what's going on with them. There are some things in the beginning that I felt could be done better (Sue Storm came off just a little bit weird), but overall, I thought it was pretty good. While the first half I don't have too many problems with, it's the second half that I feel that the movie just deconstructed itself into nothing. It kind of shocked me that when I think about what happens in the middle of the movie, do I realize that almost nothing happens. I mean, there are some concepts in the second half that sounds interesting, but because of the way that it told its story, it felt like the filmmakers wasn't really trying. It just feel bland, generic, and nothing of interest really happen. It doesn't really help that the climax of the movie is one of the most boring climaxes I think I've ever seen in a long while. it just doesn't felt like that there's anything at stake is going on. The action is about as underwhelming that you could possibly imagine and the effects were cheaply made. It also doesn't help that Dr. Doom was wearing one of the worst costumes I've seen in recent memories. So in the end, the last twenty minutes of the movie was terrible but it's hard for me to damn the whole movie just because of the last half. Like I said, I think the first half was actually pretty good but it felt like that the people behind it just gave up in the second half and considering the production problems that it had, I could easily see why. Overall, while I do think it's not a good superhero movie, I don't think it's one of the worst. There's not much to recommend unless if you're curious about the movie but, overall, it's definitely worth the skip.",

I don't usually hate films or trash on them, this is mostly a bad/mixed review. Yes, for me it still somewhat entertained me; even though everything about it was dull and boring. I just enjoy movies that much that honestly not very many are truly boring for me. First off, this has got to be one of the most wasted films of the year. It had great potential, a set of good actors, and they could do anything with the story. The worst thing about this film though is that just about none of it was that interesting. Everything was way too predictable and nothing new was put in. The performances the actors gave gave a sense of dullness and \"I don't want to be here.\" Okay, these next parts are based off of heard rumors or my own predictions. Rumors had it that the director Josh Trank came to set drunk out of his mind, so if that is true then, most of the blame has got to go to him. If you told somebody that just got done watching this film that the director was drunk while filming they'd would agree and could see that possibility. Also, I think that the big movie studios that only care about the money sort of ruined this. The story had some promise in it in near about halfway through, but I'm sure some studio officials had it changed for some reason. In the end bad plot, dull characters, dull mood, and boringness overall bring this film down.",

            "content": "Miraculously, despite this movie's unutterably poor reception, it still managed to...well, disappoint me. How did it pull off such a seemingly impossible feat? Simply put, this film had many, MANY glimpses of potential throughout its run time. There are so many partially-realized ideas in this film that could actually be really amazing if they were really fleshed out. But that's the problem: nothing is fleshed out.For example, there are so many hints of characterization and character relationships here that make me genuinely interested in the characters, but at the end of the day, they aren't really developed into something that feels in the slightest bit \"full\" and realized. There's so much that not only could have been done, but NEEDED to be done, that just simply wasn't. It's not enough to touch on a few basic aspects of a personality, or establish that a certain relationship between two characters exists. I want to know more about who Reed is apart from knowing he's just a typical nerdy child genius, and I want to see more in-depth Ben and Reed's friendship and how it developed, I want to know and \"feel\" more about all the characters and their relationships. This movie gave me enough hints to make me thirsty to know these characters better, but it simply didn't deliver the goods, leaving me feeling very dissatisfied.I could say the same thing about the powers, too. I think they actually had a pretty interesting angle on superheroes. It's more inherently cynical, I suppose, and I can certainly see why some wouldn't like that, but personally I thought it was a pretty worthy concept to explore. But in the end, the fact that the movie did a poor job of truly fleshing out the characters and connecting you to them really lessened the psychological impact I should've been feeling at the \"body horror\" superpowers, or the fact that they were being weaponized. Plus, the powers themselves were literally just not shown enough, much less used in enough cool and visually engaging ways. Seriously, Invisible Girl barely even turns invisible! As many others have mentioned, the bizarre pacing in this movie, combined with its short run time, is a huge problem. It's hard to describe just how rushed and unfulfilling the final conflict is, and even though the rest of the movie before that was basically dedicated to setting everything up, somehow it still feels so underdeveloped.Overall, there's really only one word I can use to describe this movie - empty. I won't say it was devoid of entertainment value or interesting concepts, or that I think watching it was a waste of time. But it wasn't a good movie, either, and I wouldn't recommend it unless you're just plain curious. Not only is it not very good, it's not even bad in a good way. It just feels like the lifeless corpse of what could've been a good movie but wasn't. It's not a movie that contains a lot of bad stuff so much as a movie that's severely lacking in \"good stuff\", and in many ways that's worse.",

Discovering his potential, Dr. Franklin Storm offers him a scholarship, putting him together with his daughter Susan Storm and fellow young scientist Victor von Doom, to harness this new discovery. We meet Dr. Storm's son Johnny Storm, as well as Reed's best friend, Ben Grimm. One night, these young scientists embark on a mission of their own. But after something goes horribly wrong, they discover they have been given superhuman abilities. It's up to them to master their new abilities, and defeat a final threat that's a blast from the past.That's about it; the story is clunky as all hell. Dialogue is fine, actings OK, definitely not their A game. I do like Miles Teller as Reed Richards, but honestly I thought Ioan Gruffudd in the 2005 film fit the character perfectly. Kate Mara is fine as Sue Storm, and I liked Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm, but even then I don't think any of the FF movies had the definitive portrayal. I actually liked Michael B. Jordan. As the portrayals go he does showcase the kinda immature, bratty, hot headed personality Johnny is meant to have, and can have his more serious moments. The CGI is fine and I liked that we had an actual CGI Thing this time around. Looks great. The visuals are interesting to look at and the music wasn't distracting or painful to listen to.That being said this movie was just a mess. The story dragged on and by this point. Treat it how you'd treat a future Batman movie, or a Spider-Man movies; ditch the origin story, we know how they become the Fantastic Four. And if you do have to put one in, don't put us through it over half way through the film. The villain is bye the numbers, spewing the same worthless garbage we were given Batman v Superman from Lex, and he's a throwaway villain; the worst part being he's meant to be DR. DOOM! Four times, they've used him in these adaptations and they've failed. Everything about the look of the film is just bland. I guess Trank was going for the Christopher Nolan \"dark and edgy\" tone but does he have to make it look depressing too?As for Josh Trank and the studio, I'll address the studio first. I don't know what was going through their heads, cause it just feels like they made this to either just keep the rights, or make a quick buck, or both. And if that was the case, why not just hire some low key director instead of Trank? Last time I checked, Chronicle wasn't successful because he was getting beaten to a pulp with mandates and studio interference; it was successful because he was able to have creative control. No one thought the first Iron Man would be a success, but because they gave Favreau creative control, it turned into one. I could tell almost near the end this was crapped out into theaters simply to keep the rights; they knew they messed up. If Fox can't just trust creative directors with their properties, then don't hire them in the first place; just get Brett Ratner instead.I don't know exactly what Fox is even doing with the Fantastic Four rights these days. If they're keeping them simply to make a quick buck every ten years then whatever, I'd expect nothing less. But if they have the intention on making an interesting film, with \"heart, and passion, and breathtaking\" moments, they've screwed the pooch far to many times now.I'm giving Fant4Stic a 4 out of 10. I just hope the next Fantastic Four movie has the words MCU plastered on top. And yes, I've heard about the new idea for the FF, about them as kids or something. Not a fan and it comes off as desperate to me.",

Mostly in the action and also the fact that this is something different as to what we've seen before, and we briefly get glimpses of something that could have been great for this franchise, but as I said, it is brief and only a glimpse. there is a difference between potential and reality, and this movie had potential to be great, but in reality this is an awful installment to an already incredibly underwhelming set of movies.I'll keep it short, as its really not worth delving into something that clearly had very little effort put into it. Almost nothing works in this movie. Comedy is atrocious, the drama is boring, the characters at some point in the movie do something completely uncharacteristic of what has been built up. The CGI is even appalling, no wonder Fox didn't release the official budget of the movie to the public! It's laughable. I will not spoil anything but Doom is possibly the worst villain I have ever seen in my life, yes I am aware Mr Freeze exists, and Jim Carreys riddler. In total this movie has very little to offer and it shouldn't be a first priority of viewing this weekend, with such gems in theaters at the moment that would be much more entertaining. 3/10",

The thing with no \"thing\" is ridiculous, the effects look cheap for nowadays standards. Just don't waste your money and time giving this a chance, if something tells the ratings is that if a movie is any good it gets good reviews if it is awful it gets what it deserves from the critics, that's all; some people that live in constant negation think on conspiracy theories to explain low ratings.

I am not sure how I feel about breaking well established clich\u00e9 that Sue and Joe are twins and fact that Human Torch is black man but it worked well in the movie, personal problems with aside.This is the best movie for FF4 up to date, let's not kid ourselves, that previous movies are better.They league away from it, in fact they are plain terrible.This movie is superior to previous movie both in acting and plot, it takes the best from comics and it's own script and turns it into very decent movie.Now negative feedback comes mostly from, unsatisfied comic fans, who are mad that movie doesn't follow comic lore to the letter.Well let me tell you little secret, FF in MU (marvel universe) is second rate group of heroes, they were never main cannon and in fact those comic series had very few memorable issues/ arcs.Further on subject FF received so many comic reboots and it never lasted long, so to fans of series, I have to say this, chill for the love of god and stop acting unreasonably.Film has issues, it's not error free.First it tries to be a bit more than it should for a new entry or fresh reboot.It can get a bit tedious at some parts and there wasn't much room for character development, still there were some memorable moments.My verdict is that this movie did great job into breathing fresh life to already mediocre heroes and it opened new opportunities.Comic fans will mostly hate it,some like me will love it but don't let their clouded judgment decide for you, while new comers who never read comics or heard about FF4 before will like it.",

            "content": "The saddest thing about Fantastic Four is that there is nothing especially awful about it. In fact, there are some technical aspects which, while completely butchering any potential exuberance the film might have had, look quite nice. It's only when you take all the numerous parts and consider their emergent properties that you realize how much of a painful waste of time it truly was. Fantastic Four begins in a tired fashion. A boy genius befriends another not-so-genius boy who lives in a junkyard after the junkyard boy helps the genius make an interdimensional teleportation device. Yes, I know how ridiculous that sounds. But trust me, it's no more ridiculous than any of the other unbelievable stuff that Marvel asks us to blindly accept. Of course, time goes by and the genius boy is discovered at a science fair and given a \"full scholarship\" to a fancy science institute that specializes in -- what else? -- interdimensional transport.Eventually, after way too much exposition, introductions and factory-farmed dialogue, they get their superpowers in a sequence that is actually surprisingly entertaining. But as the film goes on, Trank eschews entertainment in favour of more morose dialogue. By now, we're dangerously far into the running time without any more action, humour, or even a little -- just a LITTLE -- streak of life. Anyone who's been to the movies probably knows that this isn't good. And it isn't even clever, or unique. It's just boring.Somebody at the studio must have realized this, because all of a sudden, the film's remarkably slow pacing is shattered by the most random action scene of all time. It's almost as if they threw it in there as an afterthought (\"Oh wait a minute, this movie has no action! Better bring back Dr. Doom!\"), and it's as ridiculous and unexpected as one could hope. Doom's malice seems to have come out of thin air, his character completely unrecognizable. The scene itself is incoherent and packed with grating CGI that together take a significant toll on the senses, and it is remarkably short for a climactic battle.Sadly, Fantastic Four is a film that has potential, but all the potential it has is crushed under a mountain of awful pacing, CGI, and unnecessary solemnity. It seems only right that this film gets a 4/10.",

There are lots of movies that get slated in top reviews and I love them, but was this going to be one of those movies? I'm afraid not.There is so much material they could have used to create an amazing movie, but they did so little with the writing and that's odd when you look at the fact that they credit a group of people as the writers? all they created was a movie that will need to be rebooted again by someone who can actually write a story. I'm sure the script for this movie would have gotten a failing grade from any English teacher worth their salt.I'll make this easy for people who are not sure. The movie takes 90 minutes to get to the credits. They must have been drooling about all the sequels they would be able to do in the future and forgot to actually write a plot, character development or even something as simple as cheeky banter?

There has been some complains from the director itself that he didn't agree with this story and that his version of the comic adaptation was going to be different and therefore better. According to 20th Century Fox, the attitude of Josh Trank was not what they were expecting because he isolated himself to much and didn't gave good instructions to the crew. So they changed the script and storyline. But if you have seen the movie, you know that that wasn't the only thing wrong about it.Upcoming actors like Miles Teller (Divergent) and Kate Mara (House of Cards) already proved that they have proper acting skills. Although it seems like they forgot many basic rules when this movie was shot. Overacting or just not convincingly enough.But in my opinion, the previous marvel movies where the biggest reason for this abomination. because they were really good. And all of them lived up to the expectations. So the bar was pretty high on this one. And if it doesn't live up to the rest, it only makes it look more bad then it actually is.

Which would be almost OK or understandable if they had built the movie for a wider fan base than comic fans, but they didn't even do that. The movie contained less than 10 minutes of action (Thing throws 1 real punch in the entire movie). Dr. Doom's character was stripped from a grumpy, sorcery and technology infused dictator that's trying to \"Save\" the world in a not so nice fashion, to an angsty console gaming teen that's in the \"the gov'meant is evil\" phase. The movie is full of teen angst, exchanged between 30 year old actors playing 17 year old kids. Ben Grimm is a tough guy with a rigid (no) personality. By the time he says his catch phrase you don't even want to hear it, because you know there's going to be no heart behind it.Reed Richards is a smart guy with a rigid (no) personality. Except for the first time he tries to get Sue Storm to see how long he can stretch, he shows almost no heart in anything... Sue Storm is a smart lady with a rigid (no) personality. She has to have ear buds in at all times, because that's what kids are doing now days.Johnny Storm is the \"wild\" card with a tiny bit of personality, but as progressive as turning him black was, the decision quickly loses any and all merit on that front by making him utter blackenized \"DAYUMS!\" Victor Von Doom is another smart guy with a rigid (no) personality, other than that one time he tried to show Sue Storm how hard his steel shaft can get. Doom (Not Doctor Doom) Is a single minded tortured soul that's been twisted to think he should just destroy earth because someone threw a Butterfingers wrapper in the ditch one time, so if we are going to destroy the planet anyways, he'll just help us out. As opposed to his...every other counterpart, wanting to save the planet/humanity from external threat...but only under his rule does he foresee this.....This movie was created by 40-50 year olds that were trying their best to come up with the things \"Kids like these days\", and then just shoveled half formed thoughts into an under budgeted, undirected pile of Skrull sh*t.I give it 1 out of 5 stars, and unfortunately even that star is a crappy barely formed brown dwarf, that no one can or should see...

            "content": "Let me start by saying I disagree with people a lot on movies, there's a lot of movies people criticized but I liked. Two of them are the original fantastic four movies with Jessica alba and Micheal Chiklas. So I'm going to compare those films with this one even if it might be a little unfair to compare two different takes on the four. I wanted to see the movie for myself but I was hesitant because there's so much negativity surrounding this film. But now it's time for me to give my opinion on the film. I thought on one hand the movie did work well as a sci-fi/horror film but on the other hand it never really felt like a fantastic four film. I like how the movie began showing Reed and Ben as kids meeting each other, I thought that was a good way to start the movie. If you took away the title fantastic four and just looked at this movie as a sci-fi horror movie it kind of works in that respect. I liked the special effects in the film, I thought they did a great job at bringing to life the powers of the four. The human torch looked great! He really looked like a man on fire. The effects on the invisible woman looked great I love how her force fields looked. I love when Reed was strapped to a table and his body was stretched, the effects on his body looked really good, it didn't look cgi and I liked how rock like the thing looked. The up close shots of the thing looked really good but some of the scenes where we see him walking with the team he didn't look as good. I just like the element of horror and sci-fi in this film. However the bad thing for me about this film is that it never really felt like a fantastic four film. The tone felt too dark for the four. I feel like the four should be more like the avengers in tone, very light and humorous. So in that regard I thought the two other previous FF did a really good job at capturing the right tone for the characters. I think the four should have a lot of humor like in the avengers when Iron man mocks Cap' for saying \"language\" and I think FF should have similar humor but in this movie there's no real humor to speak of and that's another thing I like about the previous FF film where there was a lot of good humor especially between the human torch and the thing. But the main problem with the movie for me is that there was just no chemistry between the five characters. The actors didn't do a bad job but the script and the director didn't develop the characters or their relationships that well. That's the most important thing about the FF. They just felt like collages, no deep relationships between them. Even after showing Ben and Grimm becoming friends from child hood I never felt any chemistry between them. Sue and Johnny are brother and sister but I never felt any real relationship between. I think the guy playing the human torch did a good job but wasn't given much. The guy playing the villain Dr. Doom before he went evil was the most interesting character but he wasn't explained very well. He's a smart guy who's good on computers, I guess? When he became the supervillian I didn't understand his transformation, I liked the Julian McMahan Dr. Doom in the two other FF films, he was a little one dimensional but he did feel like the Dr. Doom from the comics. I don't understand why every FF film seems to be afraid to have Doom as the ruler/dictator of Latvira. But there was just no meaningful relationship between the five main characters. So I like the previous two FF films because I felt they captured the spirit of the FF. So overall a good sci-fi/ horror movie but it never really captured the essence of the Fantastic four",

I didn't understood the proposal of the director to change that way the origins of team members. As a fan of comics, this did not pleased me after all. The visual proposal of the movie is quite interesting, but, unfortunately boring and simplistic. There are nothing on the clothes that can be called \"fantastic\"; there are no identity on them.

Nope, that's not meant to happen, it was like they didn't even have to put up a fight. Stupid.The 3/10 is for the actors, I thought the acting was good and there were some well known names involved in the film, which I was pleased about.",

The film was setting up for a very long time which would have been acceptable had this film of been much longer. But for a film which lasted 1 hour and 40 minutes there was too much set up leaving us viewers with about 20 minutes of action. The action itself was quite entertaining which is why it got my rating of '4' however it just took too long to get there with a quite quick ending. In my opinion, a film named 'Fantastic Four'should have cut too the chase much quicker and have been filled with non-stop action and tension to grip us instead of making us wish we hadn't started watched. It began a film with so much potential but ended as a film that had no effect on me at the end.",

My wife (not a FF fan) saw the film yesterday with me & even she thought that it was a shambles, \"not a patch on the first two movies\" was her comment. I've rated this film at 2/10, it was going to be 1/10 but I gave it an extra point because I thought the portrayal of Ben Grimms THING was excellent. In fact, I may of given the movie 3/10 if they had given the THING some shorts, \"I mean - what's that all about\"???????? Conclusion - a boring dirge of a movie with about 20 minutes of action, a poor plot and a 50 plus year work of genius ruined. Jack Kirby must be glad that he's not here to witness what has happened. Stan Lee, if you've got any influence with the studios PLEASE get them to cancel the proposed sequel or at least \"re-imagine\" the FF back to the original classic that is loved by millions, the FANTASTIC FOUR.

            "content": "Before i went to see this film, i saw all of the negative reviews and the shocking 3.2 rating on IMDb... So i went there to see what was so wrong with the film.Fantastic Four, is an underrated comic universe movie, that does not deserve so much negativity. F4 has a an interesting take on the origins of the F4 team, and probably one of the most complicated and relatable villains in Comic-book universe, but apparently no one saw that. So, we have Iron man 3's Aldrich Killian who is just a nerd, that becomes a super villain because he got stood up by Tony, Avengers 2 Ultron, is just a robot, that wants to destroy the world because humans don't have the capacity to live together, but instead of creating chaos through his ability to manipulate any and all software he decides to take a village far enough into the sky to drop it. I guess all of the Nukes that Russia, U.S.A, China, North Korea and other countries isn't enough. F4 villain is Victor Von Doom, while the 2005 was a clich\u00e9 Rich guy out looking for revenge because he didn't get the world. This Victor Von Doom, is against Corporation corruption, societies lack of empathy for destroying our own planet, and Government manipulation. If you break down his character he actually becomes a anti hero and a villain per-say. He only tries to destroy Earth after the Corporation makes the deal with the government to try and create bunch of super soldiers and exploit the 4th dimension, and killing that planet. Victor was never shown as a simple bad guy out for revenge, instead he always expressed his concern and his hatred for corruption, pollution and people being used. So in terms of the Villains F4 did a great job.Now the only sort of negative thing i can say about the film, or agree with others, is that the chemistry just wasn't there between the actors, and the origins of some of the characters was bad. Johnny Storm felt completely out of tune with the rest of them, so did Ben Grimm. Victor and Reed had the best chemistry by far. So those are my only two criticisms about the film, the origins and exploration of some of the characters and actors chemistry on screen. I can also throw in there, the \"How they got their powers\" thing. It was kinda lame, but F4 is the much more out there comic series. I think this movie got such a low review, because it was serious and that made it seem out of place. People are now use to having Marvel films make fun of themselves, having inside jokes about their own existence, where F4 took more of a DC road. F4 was presented as a more serious and dark toned comic book film.",

It's so BAD! Almost everything in here sucks!\nThe acting was also one of the problems that turned Fant4stic into a...Fantastic Four parody starring Miles Teller as Reed Richards, Kate Mara as Sue Storm, Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm, Michael B. Jordan as Human Torch? I mean that character in this movie was nothing like in the comics. Blonde hair, white skin but in here black hair and black skin. You got the wrong cast! Also Victor Von Doom looked like a piece of turd. He was more like a parody character and spoke like a character in a parody. Everything he did was funny. His hood and cape made him a bigger turd. He looked completely worse than Dr. Doom in Fant4stic (2005).\nThe plot was a complete MESS! People didn't want to spoil plots to others but the thing is this movie doesn't have anything to spoil! The Fant4stic got their powers, Dr. Doom came and created his new universe and they had to stop them which they succeeded. This plot was almost the worst of the worsts. There were more significant stuffs from the comics that they didn't take: humor, joy,... I barely laughed at this movie, like there's nothing funny at all. I only laughed at the terrible CGI they had done.\nThe visual effects was thought to be the best of the movie but then it was opposite. It was also one of the worsts about this movie. The background's okay but the CGI was quite cheesy. I mean look what they had done to Reed's arm when he stretched it. It looked so bad (as bad as a movie from the 90s trying to use CGI that wasn't invented yet like The Mummy Returns (the Scorpion King looked like something we wanted to laugh at, not to fear)). Even though thi movie was owned by FOX, nothing could be done greatly.\nI really wanted to like the movie, but there was nothing to like, nothing to be impressed. We are talking about superheroes, not science projects and this movie, it took most of the minutes about science projects here and science projects there. There's too much. The superheroes time was so short like only half an hour when Doom came back and the Fant4stic tried to stop him. It was a terrible idea to add too much of science in this movie but anyway, it was already bad. This is one superhero movie nobody wanted to see.Points: 2.4/10",

The plot was vague, the action was nonexistent, and the graphics were that of Yoshi's Island for the Nintendo DS. On top of that, there was a lack of characterization and a bigger lack of any substance or consequences for actions. For example, after launching a fireball at his sister's face, the Human Torch looked at her and quietly said, \"My bad.\" They then continued to \"fight crime\" as if nothing happened. Another example- Ben and Reed have a huge fight, which ends with Ben declaring he is no longer Reed's friend, but that he is something different altogether. After ten minutes, during which the rest of the movie happened and no conversation took place, they were suddenly, once again, the best of friends. Another massive issue with the film is its slow moving introduction, rushed climax, and nonexistent conclusion. After about an hour, the main characters have yet to receive their powers. It is around this time that the victim (viewer) realizes the movie is like a chocolate easter bunny. It's completely hollow, cheap, and makes you extremely sick. After this hour of pre-superpowers, the team gains their powers. After another thirty minutes of a \"woe is me\" attitude from the characters, the villain shows up. He then demonstrates his god-like powers, and it seems nothing can stop yet. He then travels to his home, where he suddenly sinks down to the level of four teenagers who barely understand how to use their powers.

Even Captain America would balk at this act of wanton imperialism (he balks at a lot of things his government wants him to do, which is one reason that the Captain America films are the best superhero films ever), but the planting of the flag marks a blindness to the implications of power that is one of this film's weaknesses; along with its incessant darkness. No one is having any fun, except in the expository chapters that bring young Reed and Ben together with the Storm family; these episodes are the best part of the film, except for their excessive length. Once the team gain their super-powers, Fantastic Four starts to pick up again, but then after a quickly staged battle on the mystery planet/dimension, it's all over. Do film makers always think a superhero film is going to be easy and then find, to their surprise, that it is not? The Tim Story films got it right with the cast and the mise en scene\u2014an attractive mix of characters in the brightly-lit streets of New York City\u2014but the writers could never figure out the tone; were the Four a joke, or not?--and the narrative device of pitting the Fantastic Four against Doctor Doom (although Trank and Toby Kebbell do much better with the Doom persona than the shrieky guy in the Story films) got old very fast. In the comics, the Four had a lot of gravitas: Reed Richards was dead serious about everything, constantly worried about putting his girlfriend/wife in danger, and burdened with guilt for making a monster out of his best friend; the Human Torch was always getting in over his head; the Thing was inclined to lose his temper, etc. They also got to pit their powers against a wide range of villains. In the movies, the Story films as well as Trank's, the Fantastic Four quite happily live in their dark laboratory until Doctor Doom comes along to be vanquished. Where are the legions of alien invaders and mad scientists who made the comics so much fun? Where are the Inhumans, not to mention the mole people, the Skrulls, Namor the Submariner lusting after Sue Storm, the other superheroes dropping by for a quickly-resolved dustup?

            "content": "The few people who wasted 100 minutes and valuable popcorn dollars on this $120 million sleeping pill already know just how bad this anomaly is, it's my desire here to warn all the others before they suffer the same fate. Just where did that $120 million production budget go? The effects were extremely lackluster, the script was woefully amateurish, and the acting was I suppose, about the best you can expect when you are handed garbage like this. What you end up with is a terribly uninteresting and excruciatingly slow ride with zero payoff. At least the previous 2 films (flawed as they were) had a discernible plot, and a spirit of fun. Imagine this movie as a very very long walk down a dark hallway. You reach a room at the end, only to flip on the light switch and find it empty. Pathetic.As a long-time fan of these characters I can say without hesitation that these four characters (five if you count Doom) resemble the comic book characters only on a superficial level. If Fox (or later Marvel, let's hope!) wants a profitable and entertaining franchise they need to go to the source material that made these characters great to begin with. Luckily I can help them right here. What you want is a trilogy of films. The first feature, running about 2.5 hours would adapt the actual back stories of Doom and the FF found in the following comics, Fantastic Four (1961) #1 and 11 (origin portions only), the Doom back-up origin story in FF Annual 2. Any competent screenwriter would be able to tweak or update what's lacking in these early books. The second half of this movie could then adapt FF 39-40, a critically acclaimed classic. As for the sequel you need look no further than the \"Unthinkable\" storyline from FF 496-502. Finally, the last film in the trilogy would give us a faithful adaptation of the Galactus / Silver Surfer trilogy found in FF 48-50. This last one would then also give the filmmakers an opportunity to spin-off a series of Surfer movies starting with adapting Steve Englehart's great take on the character from 1987's Silver Surfer #1. The comics referenced above are classics which have stood the test of time, and if adapted wisely would practically guarantee success.",

            "content": "I didn't expect much and wasn't overly excited to see this, but I thought the trailers made it look cool and I go for the dark, brooding style over the more colorful, hyper style of something like Avengers. Another caveat is that I'm not a comic book purist by any means. If you can stick to the source material and make it good, awesome. But I also fully believe that not everything good in comic form (or any written material) makes a good transfer to film, and even if it's good, some change can make it better. So they made the human torch dude black, or altered this or that event in the storyline. Big f'ing deal, you gd children. It's a comic book - chill. Take all that into consideration I guess when I tell you I'm absolutely stunned at the level of vitriol heaped upon this film. It wasn't great, sure. But I truly have never seen a movie more undeserving of it horrid reputation. Yes, the ending was rushed and you could tell that, yet again, a bunch of studio suits and hacks thought they could put together a film better than real filmmakers. I do believe that Trank's original vision would likely have been great, from what I've heard and from what made it on screen. Even with the studio butchery though, it was more than passably entertaining. Actors were all fine, effects were up to snuff - even the Thing. Story-wise it was the first in a presumed series, so yeah, you expect a lot of set-up - giving back stories, bringing the team together, etc. It's really too bad that there won't be a second. I think what you have here mostly is a case Asperger/Autistic/Borderline Personality Disorder obsessives that have freaked out because it didn't adhere to the source material to the letter, so they complain and then make up all kinds of other invalid reasons to hate it on top of that. I don't care enough to be bogged down by that kind of bs, so I enjoyed it.",

The four must learn to harness their new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy.Fox should have sold the film rights back to Disney before making this movie. Yes, that's how I feel about this film. Yes, I didn't mind the 2005 film; it wasn't great but I liked the campieness and how ridiculous it was. I liked the Things practical costume it gave homage to the Roger Corman film. That being said, this new Fantastic Four movie has an updated and darker tone; on paper the film should awesome, but it's not.This cast should be awesome but I felt no chemistry between them. You think putting a younger group of actors together would give this film a fresh take, it didn't. Not for one minute did I believed that any of the cast were the Fantastic Four. The Thing looks good but the voice doesn't fit and the one design that I couldn't stand was Dr. DOOM (never named Dr. Doom in this film). Instead of a mask we get a C.G. face which makes him look like a metal faced incredible crash dummy.This retelling of the classic comic book franchise is BORING! I struggled to get through this film and when I got to the end the payoff was not worth the 1 hour and 40 minutes of boredom I went through. To top it off, it wraps up so quick I should of just read the comics and I would of got more joy from it. That being said this is a origin story but we needed another one; although they leave it open for a sequel, which if there is I hope it is done by Disney. I tried to enjoy the film but the only thing I didn't hate was the C.G. (beside Dr.Doom). This movie wasn't worth the time I spent trying to watch it.

Now that I have seen it, I feel that it didn't fall to short of my expectations. In this 20th Century Fox version of the popular Marvel Comic super hero team. We follow young genius Reed Richards (Miles Miller) and his child hood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell), working together to create the first teleporter. Ben unlike most versions of the character was not the jock, who protected Reed, but a kid who lived in a junkyard with his mother and his elder brother who picked on him. Reed as per usual, is a prodigy. When they take Reeds design for a teleporter to their school science fair, that's when the meet Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his adopted daughter Susan Storm (Kate Mara). He takes Reed to his think tank at the Baxter Building in New York City. Enter the villain Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell). A trouble maker and obsessed with fixing the world, by destroying it. Next we meet Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) Franklins rebellious son who has a chip on his shoulder when it comes to his father. The quartet of young adults work tirelessly to create an inter-dimensional transporter, which would allow them to visit this new dimension. As is typical, enter the corrupt, businessman and the military. Who attempt to take away the honor of the first people to travel to the new dimension? Well kids will be kids and without permission, Reed, Johnny, Ben and Victor take it upon themselves to take back their glory. It doesn't go well and it leaves one of the four \"Doomed\", and the other three forever changed. Oh and don't forget about Sue who brings the three back and altered herself.Though I did enjoy watching this movie, I found it to be a let down. The ending seemed to feel like it was rushed. I have mixed feelings on the choice of cast. For one, Bell did not do Ben Grimm very well. Kate did a good job as Susan Storm while Jordan, after some bad hype about him being African American Johnny Storm, did a wonderful job as Johnny. It is not the first time that a Marvel character changed race, dare I mention Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, also an Ultimate Marvel change. Miller was also a good choice as Reed Richards. I give this movie a 3 out of 5. I would suggest you see this in theaters only if you're a die hard fan of the Ultimate FF comic series, other then that just wait tell it comes out to DVD.",

I really did not want to watch this film in the cinema so waited for it to be available on Netflix and thank god I didn't waste \u00a38 on a movie ticket. I only wasted 1 hour and 39 minutes of my life which is much more expendable. Anyway let's get down to the meat and potatoes of this film then.The film starts off really poorly with the worst scene in this film. The school career day scene that makes no sense!! Reed Richards stands at the front of the class and says that he wants to be the first person to invent teleportation. For some reason this really angers his teacher who starts berating him in front of his class (who all look to be different ages and sitting in the exact same position at their desks for some reason). This is something a teacher would never do in a class room and this scene sets the movie up for more fails. The plot is very BORING with nothing exciting happening for 2/3 of the film! In a superhero movie you want the powers to be gained in the first 1/4 not have to sit through 50 minutes of filler until we get to something. The film feels it has to explain everything before we get to the action of the film which is at the far back end of the movie. The plot pacing is all over the place with scenes being rushed forward at inconvenient times to make way for some of the worst character development I have ever seen.The characters in this film have no development what so ever. No one learns anything, the four of them do not even become a proper team that work together and they have no real back and forth with each other. Ben Grimm is thrown into the mix when he is essentially written out of the plot half way through. Sue storm is played by a terrible actress. Kate Mara's performance is flat and she only uses two facial expressions in the entire film (one of them whilst in her force bubble thing). What's more in this film sue storm is adopted and we are told that she is originally from Kosovo or some place? I mention this point because it has sweet FA to do with her characters story arc, her emotional blueprint or anything else. It was just a useless bit of info that we did not need to be explained.Miles Teller was great in whiplash but here he is not helped by a flat, BORING script which gives him nothing to work with and not much character background to feed off. As I said before there is not one single joke between the characters and everyone is so serious (WHY SO SERIOUS??). Even the human torch, who is supposed to be the comic relief, is flat and always seems to be angry at life for some reason. Honestly after watching this movie I sat back thinking that I should cancel my Netflix subscription, the film was that frustrating.The music, cinematography and all other technical things I look for were all lost as I was just distracted by how boring and nonsensical the plot was. I guess if the sound and colour were really bad it would have registered with me but the sound and colour are just like elevator music it just is so unimportant that you don't notice it. Poor writing is what kills this movie for me. Nothing about this films plot is interesting or exciting but at least it doesn't fail on a technical aspect like suicide Squad. This is easily the worst Marvel movie of the 2010's so if I were you I'd give it a miss and watch Avengers instead.",

However, this movie describing the origins of the team, which includes Mr. Fantastic (Miles Teller), Invisible Girl (Kate Mara), Human Torch (Michael B. Jordan) and Thing (Jamie Bell), and their plot to defeat the evil Dr. Doom (Toby Kebell) had been critically thrashed, warranting a 5% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Well, after seeing this, part of me can see why, but on the other hand, on the other perspective, it's not exactly worthy of a low rating. The story splits into two segments: Reed Richards building the dimensional transporter and the four superheroes fighting Von Doom. Although the story takes itself way too seriously, most of the movie is shot in the dark, and the most of the action happens in the background, Josh Trank's Fantastic Four is competent on visual effects, the musical score by Marco Beltrami and Philip Glass, and the performances by Teller, Mara, Jordan and Bell. Most of the faults in the movie come from producer and co-writer Simon Kinberg, who wanted to capitalize on the success on The Avengers and X-Men and make a realistic version of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee's story. His obsession with dimming the lights and desaturating every scene makes a chuck of the movie unwatchable and drab. On top of everything else, Trank tweeted that he wanted to be faithful to the source material except with a body count, resulting in a drastic tug of war game between him and Marvel. Despite the messy storyline and blatant studio intervention, Fantastic Four wasn't a good movie, but I'm glad I saw it. (2 \u00bd Black Hole Sky Portals out of 5)",

The thing was that the trailer actually made the movie look not too bad but in fact it was all a trick to make its money back. Miles Teller was never really the right choice and poorly acted as the super smart Reed Richards. The villain was also extremely unconvincing and while the actor wasn't terrible, the character just didn't really fit into the movie very well. Lets just hope that Fox decide to sell these characters back to Marvel since they are the only ones who seem to know what to do with their characters. One good note about the movie was there was no after credits scene so it is possible they might decide to not go on and make a terrible sequel (Maybe they might think about teaming up with Marvel like Spider-man has.",

I have no idea why Stan Lee would permit his name to appear with a project that missed the mark so badly.Reed Richards, with Ben Grimm, is found at a science fair, coincidentally have the answer for a project of Franklin Storm. And I almost turned off the movie at that point. Sadly when you destroy the backstory of all the characters, you waste the audience's energies on who the characters are. The stories I enjoyed were about adults: Reed completed multiple education degrees by the time he was 20; Susan meet Reed first when she was 17, and Johnny was here little brother. But they known each other a long time, and the Storm's father isn't project leader/hero either.This movie flops at every level, unless you like watching crappy teenage drama ... and that may well be the trend of recent years; nothing but young people and their world's being soooo dramatic.When I felt the accident in this story being from a world of different dimension, I was hopeful of some interesting science-fiction, but all I received was disappointment. In the end, I just wanted the movie to be over, and was grateful that It didn't cost me anything to watch it.",

No I don't, but then I don't interpret this film as a typical superhero movie and neither should you. Instead, this film should be interpreted as a crossover between a Marvel production and a standalone Sci-fi movie which focuses on the concept of inter-dimensional travel, not just the fight between good and evil.I would've awarded it with 8 stars if the showdown with Victor Von Doom near the end had more detail instead of feeling rather rushed. However, I certainly feel that Fantastic Four is worthy of 7 stars and I suggest for people who like Sci-fi Movies to watch this with an open mind and ignore the low ratings.",

            "content": "My main question after watching this $230 million film was:whose fault was it? How could i come out of the theater so frustrated?Let me start from the beginning: Coming in with no expectations what-so-ever and even looking past all the basic differences this film had compare to the comic books. I was surprisingly satisfied with the first part - otherwise known as \"the endless intro\". But that didn't bother me. Naaah, not as much as the writing afterward did. Suddenly our heroes got their powers and hundreds of problems where popping up for them making it really hard for me to relate after \"bonding\" with them that much in the first act. It just felt like 20 people had all suck their ideas into the directors face and he lost track of what was important.First major issue, government was a dick. sure they got what they deserved in the end, but destroyed the main characters friendship's to a point of no return, and basically.. made you hate some of them.secondly, the \"one year later\"... Why skip the best part of the previous film!?? if you ask me now, all i can remember of the 2005 film is the amazing scene where they learn how to use their abilities, and the famous \"flame on\" that totally died in this film ( i know he said it, but it was just sad.) Also! What was Reed Richards building for a year? sure, we can assume he made a suit for him self and some other quantum machines from what we get to see, but \"poof\" its all irrelevant 2 minutes later, now his best friend Ben is a rock...DRAMA!!...third problem, the rushed ending. i would much rather have the dr doom battle in the second film if that meant having more time for the fantastic four to actually become the fantastic four!. Here's a solution for you!: call it \"origins\"or something, sick in a small- time battle and a few more classic \"getting famous\" superhero scenes that we all love and you're done BOOM! that simple. But nooo they had to awkwardly fight their way to \"friendship\" in the last ten minutes of the film...(Sidenote: feels like they still kind of hate each other at the end of the film).And now here are some things i liked! I enjoyed miles teller in this film a lot! especially with his scruffy look, you could see he had done some research on his character, and i would have loved to see more of that. I loooooooved the Dr doom scene! awesome effects! amazing powers! and finally some vengeance on the government dicks!!.Finally I also feel like I cant really hate on the director because i loved his two previous films A LOT.In a tweed this week, defending him self, he said his original version would have been a lot better. Even though some of my problems with the film are quite big to fix with a \"directors cut\". I have to say that I my self, came out of the theater today thinking 'this film has gone through some really obvious \"censorship\", And i do not mean typical censorship, I mean the classic Hollywood tweaks and changes of a directors original vision Censorship.' And that is a shame So i want to believe that it is not his fault, and i am obviously still looking forward to his next film. Which brings me back to the beginning, still wondering.. \"whose fault was it?thanks for reading :) Kay.",

Granted I had, had a wee tipple of sherry (yes I drink sherry) at the time but it still doesn't deserve all the hateIll try to keep this spoiler free as much as I can but SPOILER ALERT!The biggest problem was the ending which seemed to just wizz by at the end of the film which could have easily been solved by, I dunno? Making the film longer guys? It was frustratingly close to good yet choked right near the end. There wasn't tonnes of action scenes which I can see would frustrate a lot of you. But I still didn't get bored. Im not the type of person who gets excited at meaningless fight scenes. Unfortunately the final battle is pretty much that, and only lasts about 5mins. There were one or two moments when I thought \"that scene happened quick!\" Yet I never didn't know what was happening. And throughout the film I felt invested in our main characters and found myself in their shoes, feeling what they were going through. Simply put they should of just made the film longer, that would have solved most problems with this movie.Perhaps my view is slanted slightly. Iv made the effort to endure genuinely bad movies like Birdemic and Plan 9 from outer space, Movies so bad they help you appreciate anything after watching them. This certainly isn't like them.Iv heard a few complain that it wasn't completely true to the comics, but the truth is that studios aren't going to put the massive amounts of money that they do into making these films for comic book lovers which are a small population of people. They have to consider the general audience to make a profit so that argument ain't doing it for me.I should also explain that Im not particularly a fan of superhero movies, AKA Im not a mindless fan boy giving this film a pass because FANTASTIC 4 BABY YEAH! I have absolutely no bias towards this filmTo conclude I wanted to hate this movie. No I really did want to hate this movie! Me and my brother were genuinely going to ceremonially burn the disk in our garden and put the video on Instagram after watching it! My mental issues aside, I have to be fair when judging this movie, and from where I am, it doesn't deserve all the hate and gets a solid pass.",

            "review_title": "Marvel's New Film Not Fantastic, But It's No Failure",
            "content": "Note: My thoughts on this film have changed dramatically since this review. Today, I completely agree with the majority opinion: the characters are weak, the tone is overly dour, and the film completely lacks a second act due to studio meddling. Today, my score would probably be 1.5 out of 5 (one of the worst of the year). I don't know what possessed me to give this a decent review in 2015, but please enjoy my faint praise below:2.5 out of 5 stars (decent)Marvel's newest, non-Avengers offering: Fantastic Four is not what you think it is. The marketing for this made it look overly dark and contemplative for a film of its type, leading me to believe it would be a serious character study that would bore me to sleep. The reviews thus far have said that this movie is dull, overly dark, and anticlimactic. I wholly disagree. Though it is noticeably flawed, Fantastic Four is a fun, decently entertaining sci-fi action film with some good humor and likable characters.Reed Richards (Miles Teller of the Divergent series and Whiplash) is a misunderstood genius who has been building a machine that would allow interdimensional travel with his best friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell of 2005's King Kong) since the 5th grade. Now a senior in high school, Reed displays his machine for a science fair, only to have his teacher to laugh it off.Reeds' luck changes when he is given the opportunity by scientist Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey of The Wire) to get his machine up and running. Reed will work with Franklin's children, hothead Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), his adopted daughter Sue (Kate Mara), and Frank's old colleague Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) to achieve this. The quartet eventually makes their dreams come true, but that comes at a price that none of them could have ever seen coming.I understand that my plot description seems a bit rote, but I cannot tell you anymore of the story without spoiling it. I can assure you it is worth it.The cast is fine in their respected roles. Miles Teller and Kate Mara are believable as nerds, and Toby Kebbell does fine with what he is given. Michael B. Jordan provides good comic relief, but he isn't very interesting. Jamie Bell gets the short end of the stick, as he doesn't have enough to do in the film, and disappears for some of the first act, only appearing when the plot needs him to. Because of this, I didn't have a strong connection with the character, something that the last set of films (yes, this is a reboot) nailed.Action-wise, it's good when it's there. There's one action sequence at the beginning, a very short one in the middle, and one at the end. They are intense, well-shot, and don't go on too long (In fact, I wouldn't have minded if the climax was a bit longer, but it's good as is). Josh Trank (who co-wrote the script) confidently directs the action, but he could improve in directing his actors.In my review of Ant Man, I mentioned the good chemistry between the actors. Fantastic Four is the exact opposite. The actors don't have consistent chemistry with each other, making many of the scenes awkward to watch. I understand that Reed and Sue aren't going to be like Buffy and Willow right away, but Reed's chemistry with Ben is so bad that it's nearly laughable. On the bright side, Franklin and Johnny work passably off of each other, but only passably. This is not the script's fault (though it is far from a perfect gem), it's the fault of Josh Trank. This is only his second film, and I feel it was a mistake to give a big project like this to someone who isn't experienced enough to handle the pressures of it.My final complaint is the amount of profanity in the movie. I normally have no issue with it, but Marvel doesn't have a lot of bad language in their movies, and this one had much more than I expected. I have seen lots of kids in Marvel theaters throughout the years, and this movie alienates that audience segment by inserting the profanity. Kids beg for the merchandise for these movies, so putting in profanity only prevents them from being able to see it. Those kids might be a saving grace for the movie, given its current projected box office returns.Fantastic Four is not Marvel's best by any means, but it certainly not its worst either. The individual actors are good and the humor is appropriately placed. When present, the action sequences are intense and decently exciting, and the script is mostly sound (despite a few over-the-top lines and catchphrases at the end, but they are forgivable.) See Fantastic Four at the $2.00 Theater, and you should be decently entertained.Rated PG-13 for Sci-Fi Action Violence and Language",

            "content": "Im going to be honest, i grew up with the original fantastic four from 2005 when i was 5-6 and enjoyed it but when i grew up i realized it was not that great and it was followed with the god awful sequel rise of the silver surfer in 2007. So when i heard there were making a new fantastic four i was like '' this can be interesting or not\" and when i heard that Josh Trank was helm to direct i was excited cause i loved what he did with Chronicle (2012), i thought that was a ''fantastic film'' sorry i had too. Then the cast was announced and i was on board with them, Loved Miles Teller in Whiplash (2014), Michael B Jordan is one of the most underrated actor, Kate Mara ,Jamie Bell who is also great and finally Tobey Kebbell who owned it in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) as Koba and was the redeeming quality of Wrath of the Titans (2012) However there were rumors that a troubled me that director Josh Trank was having being trouble on set and the production was not the best.The reviews came in wow were they bad and i almost did not see it but my good friend drag me to it and i thought even if its not the best i will still try to have a good time cause my friends were coming so though i will try. And for the first 30 minutes of the movie i was like \" hey i really like this actually\" but when the 2 half stared i was started to understand why the movie was not getting great reviews and movie went down hill real fast. So the plot (sorry i took so long its my first review) there is not much really bunch of really talented smart young people go on a expensive science experiment , accident happens, they get powers and they fight at the end ( if you can call it that) So I'm going have to spoil to get in detail but then again there is not much to spoil so here it comes. Positive: First act, Cast, interesting ideas So like i said the first 20 minutes of the film were really good and was a great set up, i though the cast really worked well and played each character nicely and even some of the dialog at the beginning was not half bad, the scene when they arrive back home thats some good creepy imagery, later there were some good ideas like the idea that when they get there powers there are devastate and think of it as a disability that was kinda new.Negative: Everything else!! Like I said the first act was enjoyable but exactly when they got there to the dimension and you see the bad special effects from a small town school in the middle of nowhere computer class would have from the early 90s but thats just special effects. When they got come and the government came in and the 2act started i was like \" Son of a B*ch when well i learned!!\" and everything falls apart. everything becomes a mess when the 1 year came you knew something was wrong with the production the re shoots were plain obvious and it felt like 20th century fox did the wolverine origins trick on us when the studio has to intervene with the director and there are like '' hey director want to make your film, F**k You we own you!'' ( and takes a dump all over the director's vision) i know studio has to intervene time to time cause there are putting the money into it and hell i don't think Fox is a bad company at all i really like what they been doing with other properties, I loved what they did with the Planet of the Apes franchise lately, X-Men, The Maze Runner and even the new Agent 47 which looks like a bunch of stupid Fun!! But here just too much and i heard Trank was kicked out of editing room maybe cause of his behavior but he posted on twitter that he made a good version of this and he knows this one is not great so i kinda feel it was the studio's fault but i might be wrong who knows. So then the actors just started to loose their steam and stop giving a sh*t and their is guy at they end how was their old friend victor that supposed died and came back and looks like a reject from the phantom menace our a Saturday morning cartoon and some people say its Dr.Doom and their are right but i just can't call him that cause its so awful his character calling him that would be a disparate. Then a the dad/ Mentor dies of Jonny Storm and Sue but they seem to care and then go to dimension Tobey Kebbell in his plastic costume walk like a jackass and says \" Im going to destroy the world and stuff\" thats literally what he said. In some movie this is called a climax but its so poorly directed that no just no. Jamie Bell as the thing forcefully says his line '' its clobbering time\" they all can't seem to fight him and i think Jonny says \"he is stronger than any of us\" and Reed says \" He is not stronger than any of us\" Well no sh*t smart ass.So back to the climax There is one of the most lines ever put on film, Victor to Reed \"Im smarted then you\" Reed ''no I'm started then you'' something like that and I'm not trolling with. In the end this is another waste of potential but then again its better than the 3 ones we got before, this one is worth a rent if you really want to see but i recommend skipping it.",

Could have definitely been longer as well, which could've helped a lot I think.But overall its pretty entertaining just for some popcorn fun, which really is all these movies are ever going to be.Rabid fanboys are so lame. For real, what is the point of all the hate? Even if you did hate it, just STFU and move on to another movie to watch because no one cares about your opinions. Seriously, 4.3 is ridiculously low.

            "content": "It's been a year and a half since the movie was released and I only watched it recently. The reason I did not watch it when it was initially released in cinemas was due to the backlash of reviews having nothing but criticism to say about the film. While I still had some interest, as I like most superhero flicks, I didn't want to because I learned to expect to be disappointed by many comic book movies that were released prior: Hulk (2003), Superman Returns (2006), X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) for example. Judging from the amount of reviews, it may have had the largest amount of negative reviews in history. By that, I mean the ratio.But having finally seen the film, I must say it is really not as bad as many people made it out to be and I did enjoy it for what it was, but ultimately, I think it still deserves its reception. When I first saw the teaser, unlike most people, I thought it looked like a fresh and original take on the comic, but a serious version, and I was excited and very optimistic. There were no suits, but I thought it might be a more original take like the X- Men series. Then the new trailers came out, while it still looked separate from the original films, it didn't look like it had that much action, but I still wanted to give it a shot. It looked like it had story.The casting and acting I thought were good except maybe Von Doom...while this version of the characters are way younger than its predecessors, I was fine with it, but as for the actor playing the Doom--not that I didn't enjoy his performance in the beginning, and I thought it was good, but it was more like a teen-aged version. His jealously and motivations makes sense somewhat but isn't fulfilled in the story. As Dr. Doom however, it wasn't believable but I will get to that later.Chemistry between most of the characters is good but there wasn't enough. The story managed to be strongly separate from the originals which was somewhat of an advantage. Most reboots I watch tend to have some boring bits that are very reminiscent of the originals like The Amazing Spider-Man and some parts of Man of Steel.The dialogue wasn't corny. There weren't too many moments that made me roll my eyes which was good. I was enjoying the movie for what it was despite the film not spending too much time outside the lab. The team spends most of their time at the lab testing their powers, and I would have been able to tolerate that if only the final act didn't feel so rushed and if they had more scenes outside the lab.All the way through, the film has potential even though I might agree that it is a little boring, but not terrible. But where the film ultimately hits the shark is in the sudden climax.Doom, whom we last saw an hour and a half ago in the movie returns as Dr. Doom, and the film ultimately fails for so many reasons. Suddenly, it feels as though that the film wants to wrap itself up so abruptly and it felt to me like they gave up. The film reaches the point when it lets the audience know that this is the climax. Unfortunately this is the first time we see the Fantastic Four use all their powers together at once to fight the villain who doesn't show up until the end of the movie. And as for the look of the character, that's another story...The Thing looked pretty decent enough. Despite the characters not wearing the costumes, the characters as a whole were more important, but with Doom, he has to wear a costume...and my lord, does it look terrible. The face...the green...volcanic lines. He doesn't look scary at all. This is by far the sh**est looking villain design in all of movie history. Even saying that does not justify how bad it is, but let me raise the steaks. Some of the first released images you see of character in an upcoming superhero movie look bad and you get a pretty bad impression. Sometimes trailers change your mind once you see the characters in motion. But this character looks just as bad as he does in a still photo as he does in motion. It's so dreadful looking, that this is half the reason why this movie gets such a low rating. Everything is so rushed and makes no sense at all. The team already decides their destiny and Dr. Doom being vengeful and angry makes no sense. Why does he suddenly hate them and want ultimate power and see the world burn? WTF? It was until this point when the film lost all its effort to tell a story. So...Doom is destroying the universe, or Earth through...portals....and...it's not very explanatory at all unlike it was in the first two acts...it's like The Avengers and other alien invasion movies mixed together in one movie.There's a nice moment when we see the team all together at the end, but none after that. This is it, that's the ending, when there could have been so much more. I think had the film just extended itself to another half hour, giving us 2 more sequences with F4 in action before the climax, and taking time out of the lab. And if they completely changed Dr. Doom's look, then the film might have worked.It's not as terrible as people made it out to be. It had potential, but ultimately the climax and Dr. Doom destroyed everything. I doubt a sequel will be made. It's a shame we won't be seeing another F4 movie for some time.3/10.",

Maybe had the ending been a little more epic, they could have gotten away with it, but it wasn't. It seemed to skip progress, a lot. Things that likely would have happened in a three hour movie just sort of randomly happened as if there was something leading up to it. They tried to fix the slow pacing multiple times throughout the movie, and it was far too obvious. All in all, if it comes out with a sequel, I'll give it a second chance. They'd better impress me this time because most people, just like me, aren't exactly \"three strikes, you're out!\"",

            "content": "(TBH this movie deserves a 6/7 rating, but not the 9% it has on RT and 4/10 here on IMDb) I have seen a handful of the marvel franchise movies, and I have to say Guardians of the Galaxy was my favorite so far. I'm a big fan of Chris Pratt, that being said I'm also a big fan of Miles Teller (If you haven't seen Whiplash, do yourselves a favor and see it)Now to review this movie. Fantastic 4 was not overly fantastic, but it was a good movie. It had all the elements in the story, and a very strong cast that needed some better direction on screen. It felt like a lot of the lines or scenes fell flat, because of bad direction, not necessarily bad acting. There was a hint of chemistry between the main cast, but I never really felt connected to the group as a whole. While they did do some work to establish some of the relationships, a lot of it was just done with exposition; which is lazy. --Spoiler Maybe?--- I'm not sure if this is a spoiler, because we all know there will be a fight scene with Doom. While this scene was executed well, it felt horribly rushed. I feel like we spent 3/4 of the movie setting up this scene that felt like it lasted 5 minutes. Also there wasn't any satisfaction from the fight scene, it felt like they overcame him way way to easily. This has got to be the thing that upset me most about this movie, when I see a fight scene that we have been waiting for the entire movie, I really want to see my protagonist characters put every bit of their effort into beating the antagonist. That being said, the 5 - 10 minutes of fight scene that was there, was pretty visually stunning. However, I had some mixed feelings about who I should be rooting for. I mean in one hand they set up Doom in a way you feel sympathy for him, and they show him as \"weak\" to start, but then out of nowhere Doom is the bad ass we were expecting, with a mission to destroy Earth to save his planet. I just felt like they could have done a little more to set up \"Dooms\" character and his objective. Now the moral of Fantastic 4 is \"Team Work\" and this is something else that was sporadically set up throughout the movie, but was not executed well at the end. You'll see for yourself if you decide to see it. This movie is worthy of a Redbox rental, but he had the potential to be one of the greatest Marvel movies to date. I think this is why so many people are upset and being so harsh on the movie, because it had so much potential and fell pretty flat. 4/10 Directing by Trank was lazy, and this can be seen in the acting, and execution of important scenes. 4/10 Writing was not strong. It felt rushed, it felt like ideas where there, but didn't have time to get flushed out and put together properly. 5/10 Acting, what a great cast, and such amazing potential. However, the cast did not end up working, and I feel like the bad chemistry or lack of chemistry we saw on screen has to do with bad directing, and one overly confusing script. 10/10 Sound track, cinematography, and visual effects. The real heroes of this movie are the ones behind the scenes. The DP, the VFX supervisor, the artist, the editors. They put together some stunning visuals, some amazing lighting, beautiful sets, and overall deserve much praise for the great job they did here. To bad it was wasted on a unfinished script, horrible directing, and a talented cast that just didn't have it all together.",

Aside from a nonsensical plot, the performances from the cast consisting of Miles Teller (Andrew - Whiplash), Jamie Bell (Tintin - The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn), Kate Mara (Zoe Barnes - House of Cards), Michael B. Jordan (Steve Montogmery - Chronicle) and Toby Kebbell (Koba - Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) are passable, but the characters, err...Following this, Toby Kebbell's performance of Doctor Doom was passable, but the character was far off from the comics (I mean really, immediate kills from five feet away, come on!).I'm sorry, Josh Trank.

            "content": "The movie started off well but declined so terribly midway and ended abruptly. I have two major negative points: *SPOILERS AHEAD* 1. There was only one big fight scene. Usually when heroes first attain their super abilities there is a 'practice' fight scene when the hero(es) exercise their powers and discovers strengths, weaknesses, limits, etc. and also struggle to function properly as a team. After the battle the team should bond and/or come to terms with their powers better. Then there should be a second fight scene when the heroes exhibit new confidence and strength as a whole. None of this happened in the movie. In fact there was very little bonding and character development fullstop. Yes there was a bit of struggle but any strife between characters was forgotten entirely by the end without much resolution. 2. Susan Storm's wig. Her hair seemed to change colour every scene and varied throughout the film from blond dyed hair to a wig. I have a huge problem with this not only because I found her wig(s) distracting but the fact that it was necessary for her character to have blond hair at all made me angry. The male characters in the film don't seem dependent on any physical features - black hair, red hair, tall, short, black, white - none of it seems to matter. But it is inconceivable to recreate a Susan Storm sans blond hair. It seems to me that producers think the audience simply won't be able to recognise her unless they paint her exactly as she was originally created... like as if female characters are never to be listened to or understood. They're just there to be looked at.",

That is my first problem, the other problems are as follows: Nothing happened in the film it literally a trailer for the equal, \"Doom\" was laughably horrible and his motives where like \"You left me in the Negative Zone and you want to use that to help earth?!\" Nope just nope. The \"love triangle\" was completely forced, this CGI was laughed at when i saw it, NO ONE TALKED ABOUT ANYTHING!!!!!!!! This movie is the worst flop ever and made me want to kill Fox so that the rights go back to Marvel and yet there planing a squeal???! With a cast that don't talk to each other???! Don't give Fox your money, don't even let your friends pay for you... only see it if its free just to see how Fox screwed the Fantastic Four! AGAIN!!!!!!!",

This take on Fantastic four is better than the others. That said, it didn't have to try hard in order to do that. The plot, for Fantastic Four (2015) is lacking in so many areas. It really feels like they used the chicken scratch left on a napkin during the concept stage. Character development takes way to long in this film. Out of 106 minutes to this film, 40 minutes are dedicated to character back story. Yes back story. It's not until almost 50 minutes into the film that they actually get their powers. You can start this movie up from about the 50 minute mark and never miss 1 piece of important information.The visuals for the movie looked great. Sadly even this is held off until after the first half of the movie. They actually did a decent job on the Thing this time around. Previous visions of the Thing outside the comic books were always lacking.Something else I found a bit strange. The movie held a really dark undertone. I guess it's a good thing the plot never fully developed that.The acting is solid. Is it award wining, no. 5 of 10. It's worth the watch at least once.",

First of all, this is not a prequel which is what I first thought since it's based on the same four people (different actors) as young adults in college, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm, Reed Richards, and Ben Grimm. This movie is another telling of the first Fantastic Four made in 2005 and has nothing to do with that movie or the second one Silver Surfer. Based on that alone I'm sure there will be a second one with these same actors but there's no relation between this and the 2005 movie of the same name. If you liked the first Fantastic Four movie you should like this too as it's just another version with different actors.

I mean, can you believe the government did that to them!? Now let's talk about Dr. Doom - man, he's pure evil! What a great villain. At first we thought there was no way the Fantastic Four would be able to stop him, but were literally cheering out loud when the new superheroes banded together to defeat that monster from destroying Earth. What a thrill. Such a great ending... Afterwards I went on to IMDB to check out the film details and couldnt believe the reviews for this movie! I honestly don't get it.

I'm not sure if the dialogues were just terrible, or it just lacked chemistry between actor and character. And between the 4 of them. They didn't really fit.

It's not the FF story I wanted, but it works. Certainly it works better than the nightmare the previous 3 movies were (apart from the comic relief of Roger Corman's version and Michael Chiklis' performance as The Thing.)The main problem I saw was that it needed more development, specifically in the 2nd and 3rd acts; it feels cut down to me. I honestly thought it could have been a half-hour longer. If they'd done that, they could have developed the \"body horror\" of transformation, given us more on the development of their powers, developed Doom's character and return, his \"plot\", and the actual ending far more. Overall, however, I was surprisingly entertained. The cast all did admirably. No one suffered from overacting, the characters felt good, the dialogue wasn't stiff (the scientific writing and premises were bad, but you have to expect that), directing is firm. The development was a little lacking here and there, but I think they took advantage of the fact that we all know who these guys are for the most part.Not brilliant, but definitely entertaining.

I never do, I simply watch or I do not, based on the title and what type of movie I expect it will be, and sit back and relax and try to enjoy it, which after all, isn't that what movies are all about ? You can argue, oh NOT another sequel , and yes it is that, but judging it solely on that, or the ineffective acting because they aren't well known entities, or some other 'expectation' is just a bad way to go at movie going, and insufficient respect to hard work.You don't have to love the support actors or every moment of the script or visuals, but you owe it to the hard work of everyone involved, to do what most of us do at movies, go in expecting what you get based only on what you likely know you'll see, which is exactly what I always do, and everyone should.I have no patience for anyone who gives a movie a '1' rating ( or similarly childish like 'fantastic FLOP'), because they aren't here to critique anything, just hear themselves think and attempt to make a 'name' for themselves at the price of hard work, even if you think all involved were overpaid for what you got.People forget, not everyone can 'act', it takes a mindset and a willingness to take the subject serious enough to put yourself IN the shoes of who you are playing so the audience is catapulted into a state of belief in what they are seeing, and have a good time.I always do that unlike some other hate filled posts here and we always get them, and knowing full well what to expect, I enjoyed it , from beginning to end and look forward to a sequel with the came cast.I review a movie based on my feelings about the acting, script, production , visuals and score, but most of all, was I 'entertained' enough to suspend my reality and come out of it thinking about the universe I and everyone else are part of, and dream of more and better things.I got that from this movie, and if you didn't, well this type of movie wasn't for you.Before I came to review Fantastic 4 2015, I looked at both of the prior movies, and they too , though not quite as bad as this one, similarly were given awful ratings , and I can't help but wonder, by who, what did they go into the movies expecting, and what precisely did they not feel they got, enough to mark a movie well enough done to remove their reality for a couple hours, sufficient to mark it that low.Everyone wants to be a critique, but you can't effectively do that, never, unless you put on your objective hat, and agree to immerse yourself into the movies reality.Yes, I felt some of the acting was a bit unconvincing, but that might be me expecting the same from a different set of actors, versus what we had from the 2 prior movies, and that's not really fair, but by the end of the movie I was losing that slight skew for their acting performances and just let myself settle into a new team of 4.Some argue movie took too long to get going, but I couldn't disagree more, as I wanted a different back story, something different from the prior releases, and we got it.The visuals were just as good as anything that's come before it if you want to compare it to the other movies, 1 and 2.Yes it was another fantastic 4 movie, but I enjoyed it not because of its faults, but because I felt 'entertained' enough to keep watching.That to me means the movie was a success.I'm not won over easily, but if suspension of reality takes hold of me and lets go only till the movie is over, then I'm good.If you are into the Sci-fi genre, and if you like the Fantastic 4 enough to detach yourself from the other movies and enjoy a new '4' team for what it is, entertaining, and aren't someone who is 'super critical', then head out and buy your tickets because you will be entertained just as I was.",

I am a true comic book fan who loves movies that are like around 90% perfect; for example, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, by far the best Marvel movie ever made but this one is the worst comic book movie I have ever seen in my life since Ghost Rider 2: Spirit of Vengeance. I'm just glad I didn't waste my money by going to the cinemas because I watched this movie online.Now secondly what I want to talk about is the movie; the dialogue, the script, the storyline, the cast, they are horrible. The only thing I only enjoyed that was decent were the action and the design of the Thing. With the script, it's all terrible, the humour Fox put in the script is not funny at all. They think they can put in better humour in the script than the original Fantastic Four movie back in 2005, unfortunately that's a failure. I really don't like what Fox did to the storyline, they think it is okay to change the story to make something new for the comic fans to love. Well guess what, it failed! Instead of going out of space and then get powers, they go to another dimension on another planet and then they get powers. At first, it looks okay to go to another planet and get powers which is kind of decent but it is still a terrible story.And now the cast. What should I say about the cast? Oh yeah, worst cast ever! (But don't get me wrong, they are good actors in other movies though). Fox casted a bunch of college looking actors when the actual Fantastic 4 characters are adults. I don't mean to be racist or anything, but I seriously don't like the cast of Johnny Storm/Human Torch as a black guy. They even cast an actor who is not even tough and bulky for Ben Grimm/The Thing. Miles Teller is a good actor, don't get me wrong, but the only problem is that he can't do Reed Richards/Mr Fantastic right. Kate Mara is a good actress, I like her but she also couldn't entirely do Susan Storm/Invisible Woman right either. But he comes the worst part, Fox even made Susan adopted to Johnny Storm, not blood related siblings. Not a great cast for Victor Von Doom though but he was OK (slightly), but I was horrified for what they did to Doctor Doom. They made him look like C-3PO on drugs, like crystal meth or something. Just horrible.Have the cast even read the comics or has Fox forgot to read the comics? Seriously! Watching this movie felt like I was being punched in the stomach by Fox. I almost blamed director Josh Trank for the Fantastic Four failure until I realized from what I saw online that it wasn't his fault, it was Fox who f**ked up the movie.Fox!

But when Victor reentered the picture that's when it took the nose dive.

I'm not going to bother with a plot synopsis since I don't remember most of the details any more (even though I just watched the movie), and don't want to bother looking them up.Considering this is an origin story, none of the characters are well-developed at all, even the one given the most background and screen time (Reed Richards, the stretchy guy.) Most of the characters come across as rather pouty and petulant. I think the characters had potential but spend most of the movie reacting to everyone/everything around them, rather than doing/choosing anything on their own (individually or collectively as a group), and as a result seem undeverdeveoped and not very well characterized. At one point Reed Richards disappears for a year, we never actually learn what he is doing during that time. Weird.The most egregious error is that so much time is (ineffectually) spent during the build-up, there is no time to establish the antagonist, and instead of a satisfying finally third of the movie we get a really quick battle scene to end the movie. I have read about problems between the director and the studio, but given how weak the final movie was I doubt a much better version could have been assembled during editing.Many have criticized the movie as being too dark in tone. I actually don't mind the darker tone of the movie at all, in fact a different direction gives a superhero movie new possibilities and directions to explore. Too bad none of them were realized.",

We read these because we were conned into wasting our time, want to share our disdain, and possibly squeeze SOME entertainment from this train wreck. So let the bashing begin.Choose a direction Josh Trank. Or Fox. Or someone. The film is a tasteless stew, made up of leftover cliches, and spoiled by too many cooks. Add 20 minutes dull, joyless, and amazingly-monotoned John Hughes film. Mix in a low-rent Fast and Furious, because Johnny (Michael B Jordan) is a rebellious engineer. Then a few mins of Project Almanac, add in Avengers (cause teammates gotta fight), and bring to a boil with a 10 minute head-popping snuff film (because evil guy is evil). Garnish with a half-hour, unintelligible, third act calamity and serve with a ham-handed denouement complete with humorless-jokes.Was there ANYTHING of value in this dumpster fire? Well, far and away the best ingredient of this bland mess was about 7 minutes of a body-horror film, which did show true promise. It was an intriguing take on the superhero genre, but ultimately only served to highlight how uninspired the remainder of this \"film\" was. Still, that earned it an extra Star... bringing it to 2/10.Now, every movie has problems. But Fantastic Four takes that idea to a new level, let's name just A FEW: No character has steady motivation. Supposed genius-level intellects that never make a good decision. There are better forums for a potentially world-ending device than a high-school science fair. Don't \"check out\" the glowing cracks of energy without equipment. Or tools. Or while drunk. And certainly don't touch it.Don't initiate 'manual override' for rogue scientists in an unknown danger, on an unknown planet, contaminated with who knows what. Stop \"routing emails through a relay\" while on the run, Reed. WHO ARE YOU EMAILING?!! Why would a \"red-alert\" emergency in a top secret facility inexplicably open all the doors? (Because when something goes wrong here, it's probably just a fire drill.) The limitless, undefined, god-like powers that Dr. Doom has. Dialogue like: \"He is stronger than any of them... Not stronger than all of them.\" Good one, Fox. And needlessly choking the hero, just so he can monologue like a good villain. It was a 100-minute trailer for a never-to-be-made sequel.I could go on.

But it's not good either.Based on the reviews I've seen, I was expecting Fantastic Four to be laughably bad, but most of its flaws are based on what it lacks. The first third of the story actually not bad. The story is paced decently, all of the characters are introduced well, and their personalities are developed nicely as well. The last two acts are where everything pretty much falls apart. The story begins to feel rushed, none of the relationships between the characters are developed enough, the dialogue in many instances sounds cheesy, and the action sequences are pretty boring. It's hard to really care about the characters and their relationships with one another. Due to this, the conflict doesn't quite draw the viewer in enough. And due to the excessively fast pacing of the last two acts, the main conflict is introduced so late in the story that the resolution is way too short and feels extremely anti-climatic. In regards to the other aspects of the movie, they are nothing special either. The acting is fine but nothing impressive, the casting choices are okay but no one really seems to fit their roles completely, and the story isn't too interesting. Overall, Fantastic Four is a tad boring with not many redeeming qualities but it's probably not as bad as many reviews are making it out to be. It's still at least watchable.",

However, the characters were fun, I enjoyed the use of youth over the \"rich scientist\" line from the earlier movies. It was really a DIY low tech fantastic four with true angst and almost dare I say it, believable to the performances. Dr Doom was poorly executed but was in line with the relative powers of the 4. So it stepped a long way from the spandex clad comic characters but to be honest that isn't a bad thing at all for me. Some great moments, I loved the Thing who really looked alive and rocky rather than orange and rubbery. The ending wasn't as explosive as other super hero movies but again, is that a bad thing ? does it always have to be a massive climax? So on the whole it worked as a fun 90 minutes, it wasn't the disaster many claim it to be as a movie anyway",

Then I heard about the reboot, I saw the hype, the pictures, the posters etc. etc.. I'm not going to get into the Human Torch still managing to be Sue Storm's brother but managing to be a completely different ethnicity (the adopted Balkan war orphan explanation was one of the things that really killed the film for me) too much. To be honest it would have made more sense (and been a little braver) to have made Sue black as well - I would have respected that decision.I'm also not going to say much about the slew of high ratings that have appeared on here for this tripe besides using it as proof that there are people who do give high ratings for cash.The thing you need to know before considering watching this ... it is a very, very bad superhero movie. This isn't the charming bad where some well meaning geeks put something together on a shoestring (see most Australian horror movies). There might have been some chance if this had the feel of the comics (light-hearted, group dynamic based action) or if the characters even slightly resonated with the originals. One of the reasons why the Spidey movies worked is because they used Peter Parker well - they drew on back story already there to act as a foundation for rote character development. DC manage the same thing in the Superman movies. Nolan broke the mold with the Batman trilogy but most of these franchises have two dimensional characters everyone forgives because the comics give them depth. In this movie they managed to kill that - you end up with what I thought was impossible - a 1 dimensional set of characters.People blame Trask, say the script was no good, etc etc etc. Honestly - this is so awful everyone involved should hang their heads in shame. Things this awful aren't created by one person messing up - this takes a special team effort.",

With all its flaws, it is actually not as bad as what the critics says, heck, I'll say a movie without a main part is better than the Fantastic Four from 2005.The movie gave me the same feeling as when I suffered a mean case of food poisoning during the screening of Terminator Salvation and had to run to the toilet, missing out on some important sections of the movie. I felt the same way here (without the food poisoning),like somebody took out major parts of the movie and I just got to see a too long intro, a very short Victor von Doom arc and a very abrupt and quick conclusion the last 15 minutes of the movie. Actually I found the prolonged intro very intriguing. The character and story build-up was actually interesting. The post-accident and ensuing hardships was... kinda interesting, although not thoroughly fleshed out, still interesting. Trask did something bold here (other than making the Human Torch black), it did not have the formula Marvel feel over it. Fantastic Four felt somewhat invested in telling something new. When Doom appears on screen and retaliates, it is actually menacing, although only for a short moment. I am not defending Trank, but there was something there.All in all, somebody tampered with the movie, whether it was Trank's fault in not following through with the movie, studio intervention or revisions far too late, it is hard to tell. But somebody sabotaged this movie beyond saving.",

The writing, the tone, the special effects, and the directing all contribute to the downfall of a once beloved group of characters. In fact, the only reason I gave this film TWO out of ten stars instead of one is because of the performances. You can almost feel the potential of the film coming from the young cast; Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara and Jamie Bell all give decent performances, but that aspect of the film is quickly bogged down by the atrocious writing. What were the screenwriters thinking? None of the characters have any depth and the tone is all over the place. That still isn't the worst of it though...the villain is one of the most laughable, clich\u00e9d, over-the-top characters you will ever see on the big screen. He's right up there with Arnold's Mr. Freeze and Jamie Foxx's Electro as one of the worst movie villains of all-time.In conclusion, you should not even consider watching this movie. Even if it's a rainy day and you think you've seen just about every other movie out there, re-watch one of them instead. 'Fantastic Four' is one of the worst superhero films ever made, although at least the heroes' performances are good...that's aimed at you, 'Batman & Robin'.",

I really disliked how they developed the characters from the moment they showed their grown up scenes. When they were kids they had more development with those scenes. When they got to the other world to get their powers it was really stupid. How Susan got her powers was completely stupid as well. If i recall in the comics Susan went to the other world but in this one she some how gets her powers from a shock wave which goes everywhere and somehow she's the only one effected? How does that make sense? Then they somehow need their suits now to control their powers? There is almost no training to get use to their powers this time around. The over all premise of the F4 working for the government is not shown unlike in the trailers where they are shown going on missions, that is all cut from the movie and lost. What made this worse was that Reed left his team for a year and then somehow everyone is magically okay with it and happy when he is brought back? How is that at all something to be okay with? Then Dr. Doom is somehow alive in the other world for over a year with nothing at all shown how he survived? How did he survive? His powers make no sense, he can stare at people and they blow up but when he does his big fight he has to point in a direction to fight and somehow lost the ability to make people explode? If he can blow up people while walking then he can blow up the really useless F4. Over all this movie was really really shitty and I hope that they don't go through with their plans on a sequel and cross-over with X-Men.",

            "content": "Reboot of original series was too hypedHear that? It's the sound of the third theatrical Fantastic Four film distributed by 20th Century Fox, failing to meet the high expectations created from the trailers. The film performed disastrously, expecting audiences to follow an incoherent narrative involving underdeveloped characters. The 100 minute film apparently required $120 million but the end result says otherwise. Methodical and geeky Reed Richards (Miles Teller), and supportive best friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) presents a prototype teleporter at a science fair, capturing the attention of father-figure Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathy). Professor Storm works for the Baxter Foundation, a government- sponsored research institute. Professor Storm recruits Richards to work with intuitive Sue Storm (Kate Mara) and hot-headed Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) in order to complete the Quantum Gate designed by troublesome Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell). Though reluctant at first, the four pull it together and soon, facility supervisor Dr. Allen (Tim Blake Nelson) manages to send a group of astronauts to another dimension nicknamed Planet Zero. Richards, Johnny Storm, Grimm and von Doom decide to secretly teleport to Planet Zero with the help of Sue Storm, after blatantly being denied an expedition. Things go haywire when the energy of the terrain is disturbed and an emergency return is initiated. The exposure to the unusual energy of Planet Zero leaves each individual with a unique ability although how they use it is their own decision. After a less than thrilling turn of events, four must unite against one in a battle that's not of the ages. Although the plot may be easy to sum up in a paragraph, a lot of the details the audience needs in order to fully comprehend what's going on are left out. The audience doesn't even know why the young students are so hard at work in a lab until the finished product comes out. That's another problem; up until the creation of the Quantum Gate, the movie is almost stalling, taking too long to explain the back story. Flash forward to the battle scene, and the skills the Fantastic Four demonstrate seem way too advanced compared to 20 minutes earlier. That's because one year has gone by and you can barely tell. Thus the film barely builds any action or suspense and leaves viewers feeling like the whole thing was stuck in its first act. The actors also fail to put on a performance worth witnessing. That's not to say they're bad actors; for one, Teller has been a successful supportive character in recent years during the remake of Footloose and the Divergent series. But as a whole, they fail to develop real on-screen connections to each other, and as a result, the plot doesn't seem to move. The lack of teamwork offsets almost every chance the film has to really reel in the audience emotionally. There are moments where the conversations between the Fantastic Four have potential to liven up the blandness but are then ruined by clich\u00e9s and other cringe-worthy quotes, such as \"It's clobberin' time\". Aside from Teller as Richards, almost every other actor seems to be miscast. He's the only one that manages to make some scenes tolerable enough despite a horrid script. While quite a box office failure, \"Fantastic Four\" hasn't completely flopped. Some of the special effects seen throughout the film are worth applauding because of their believability. When Johnny Storm becomes the Human Torch, he really becomes the Human Torch. But the best work is seen when a massacre occurs inside a facility where the Fantastic Four are being held. From the gory deaths to the aftermath of the battle, not a penny was spared in order to create these realistic and somewhat unforgettable effects. Matthew Jensen's cinematography also manages to breathe life into a movie that lacks good pacing. The variety of shots used throughout every scene is probably the only thing that makes watching the film easy. Besides that, continuity errors with Teller's facial hair and Mara's hair styles, the pitiful lack of chemistry between the main cast and the extra long back story completely ruins any chance the movie has of being the reboot the series has long-needed.Josh Trank may be a director and screenwriter but it seems like he literally put all he had into his directorial debut, 2012 science fiction film \"Chronicle\". While \"Chronicle\" is a commercial and box office success, \"Fantastic Four\" is being almost universally criticized for its failure to deliver. But in Trank's defense, he stated a year ago that he had a fantastic vision for the film which was subsequently ruined, presumably by Fox. The tweet has since been deleted. \"Fantastic Four\" is riddled with nonsensical dialogue and a muddling mess of a narrative. It's yet another foundering attempt by Fox to make the best out of one of Marvel's greatest group of superheroes. While the movie does have its memorable parts, how its sequel has already been scheduled for release on June 9, 2017, the world may never know.",

My hopes were not particularly high beforehand, whispers of a nervous studio and on-set disputes gave the impression that this was going to be another mediocre superhero reboot that came too soon. Those expectations of mediocrity however, for all the wrong reasons, were greatly exceeded. At best this film was chronically boring, at worst it was straight up laughable. Throughout the film I was in a state of disbelief, disbelief at how unconvincing and cringeworthy the dialogue was between Miles Teller and the rest of the cast. One of the things I really enjoyed about the 2005 film was the whimsical relationship between Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis, who played The Human Torch and The Thing respectively. Any humour of this kind was completely lost on the current crop unfortunately. To be fair to them, their task was helped in no part by a plot that was rushed and lacked any sort of coherence. This was rounded off by one of the worst thought-out finales imaginable. It was as if the writers had forgotten they had a movie script to write, and hurriedly scribbled it down on the back of an envelope 10 minutes before their deadline. It got to that peculiar situation where it is so bad it starts to become amusing - similar to the Sharknado franchise. All in all, if you like wasting your time watching atrocious movies, Fantastic Four is for you. If not, best to give this one a swerve. Will be interesting to see if the sequels go ahead, I would be surprised.",

The characters acted like socially awkward weirdos you'd see in a Roland Emmerich or Jeff Goldblum movie. It's so poorly acted I just laughed a lot during this movie. Miles Teller, however, is a pretty good actor, I will say.Also, I know they change things up by having Reed Richards, Johnny Storm, Ben Grimm, and Victor von Doom go to Space without Sue Richards, which is very different, but I didn't really care; at least Sue Richards still became part of the team anyway! Plus, taking von Doom up there and leaving him behind makes his motivation for being the bad guy good, no? I will also give this movie credit for not being kid-friendly and having the money be mostly spent on childish jokes that only 6-year-olds would find funny.Speaking of Dr. Doom, I think he makes for a very good intimidating villain. He looked different, yes, but in his defense, he is so intimidating, it almost makes you wonder how the Fantastic Four, or anybody for that matter, could possibly defeat him. He's basically an evil Lucy (2014).So overall, Fantastic Four is really not that bad. It's not a good movie, but it's worth viewing just to see how silly and poorly acted it is. To sum it up, it's bad acting, but superb action and good atmosphere/detail. Let's hope the sequel can be twice as cheesy.",

We all are big Marvel/Dc fans, we where looking forward to this, but we looked and read some reviews before we went, and there wasn't a single good one. I totally agree. I thought this film was a massive let down, there wasn't anything behind the characters. You got to learn some information behind them, in the originals, but in this one, you only learnt a small tiny bit about Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) and basically nothing about the rest of the characters, so if you haven't seen the originals, you're basically screwed, because you wont learn anything... I'm going to keep this short. I would of asked for a refund, but I didn't know what they would think. If id did ask, but I had a good day out with all my friends and that's all that matters. Last of all, if you go into cinemas expecting some good action, don't. The fight you wait for is a massive let down and literally lasts 50 seconds. very disappointed.. I hope this review helps.",

Now lets say your bad in bed, if you were able to do foreplay as long as the build-up and \"character building\" to this movie you would be undoubtedly the best sex beast in the world. But if your cunnilingus lasted as long as the movies \"climax\" then you would have lost all credibility. Now if you were to say the movie is okay at best you would also have to say the holocaust was alright, no exaggeration at all. As you have noticed above character building and climax were in inverted commas. I say that with great emphasis because honestly it just didn't exist. First ill start with the shiniest of two turds, the climax of the movie. The climax was the worst thing since the black plague swept through Europe. There was a lot of build-up for absolutely no point and the fighting was shorter than the verdict for guilty for a minority at a court trial. Honestly i'm not for prostitution but i could get screwed better for my money by a heroin addicted truckie named Jim for the same price of this movie ticket. Now we're onto the character building. Now it might have had some credibility if the movie actually had good acting and a good plot line. I've seen better plot lines at a overbooked cemetery for ugly people. The character building just was about as existent as Denis Ferguson life as a free man. It just wasn't going to happen and at about half way through the movie i thought i might go and get electron therapy to erase this disgrace of a comic-book movie from my mind.If Stan Lee even is ashamed to make his usual cameo in the movie then you should get the message that you shouldn't watch it. I still love comic-book based movies and i have high hopes for the rest to come, at least this has set the base so low that even watching two girls one cup seems like a better idea for a night. So high hopes for more marvel movies to come!!!",

I went to see it cuz I love superhero movies and was excited to see it even though I knew it was tanking but whatever wasted 9 bucks but ate some quality Moe's nachos.OK let me start off by saying I only gave this movie a 4/10 because one of the only good things about it were the actors (Miles Teller, Michael B Jordan and Kate Mara and whoever played Dr Doom) who are amazing actors but couldn't even lift the movie to anything over the line of \"worth wasting money on.\" I went and saw this with my cousin and brother who I see every superhero/marvel avengers movie with. let me say it was god awful. the thing (lol get it) that bothered me the most was the one part of the trailer that got me pumped to see this was the part where they drop The Thing from a plane and he falls from the sky in that cool like superman looking way. guess what. it doesn't happen. and there are no action or fight scenes. a superhero movie without fight scenes? here are their \"versions\" of fight scenes: The Thing punches a tree, Mr Fantastic slaps a couple dudes, and at the so- called climatic ending which was anything but climatic, while the F4 are trying to stop Doom from doing whatever the hell he was doing, he like just pushes them away. then the movie kinda just ends. it was a HUGE disappointment. when this trailer was released I was like \"ya I guess this looks pretty good it's got a pretty good cast and Doom looks really cool.\" well the only good parts of this movie were the following: 1. Doom looks pretty cool 2. the cast 3. Reed and Ben's (hardly developed) relationship (but it was still OK) 4. the origin was very cool and how they got their powers was creative I will admit but that's it. 5. Doom makes people's heads explode 6. how they thought of the name was OKAY. 7. Reed shape shifts... once... but I'm happy he actually does that in the movies nownow here's everything that sucked: 1. no fight scenes 2. human torch CLICKS A BUTTON TO TURN FIREY. like really?!?! all he's supposed to do is say flame on!!!! 3. they were locked in a facility for a year to learn their powers like really 4. the \"they belong to the government\" aspect 5. the stuff from the trailer doesn't happen like the Thing scene I mentioned earlier and the part where Reed asks Doom what's coming and he says \"answers\" or \"doom\" or whatever it varies through trailers but who gives a crap cuz it doesn't happen 6. the ugly guy who plays Dr Allen whatever he's AWFUL but Doon kills him at the end so I was minorly satisfied 7. every part of the trailer you thought was exciting is actually dumb in the actual movie 8. hate to be that guy but avengers movies are the best aka marvel studios movies I live by them, and this wasn't one, so there's a problem right off the bat 9. the tag line was \"change is coming.\" ya nice tag line 10. the suits. don't even get me started 11. The Thing is naked 12. the fact that I'm still writing about what I didn't like 13. the review from Hollywood reporter or whatever said it was a \"100 minute trailer for a movie that never happens\" and that I agree with 14. no climax. at least what they tried to put as a climax could've been used as like a halfway point for the movie that's how stupid it was 15. why was Doom evil? who knows 16. it was not exciting at all. I sat there eating Moe's chips and queso the whole time 17. no end credit scene. not that it really matters but the movie was awful at least give us SOMETHING to look forward to for the next movie that hopefully is not a bust like this one 18. the pace is way too slow like stuff will happen then it goes back to nothing 19. all the F4 movies have been about was \"how are we supposed to fix ourselves?\" how bout instead of worrying about that for 100 minutes you just be superheroes? 20. Reed shouldn't have been disqualified from the science fair. just saying. 21. oh yay Baxter building! oh wait the movie takes place in some unknown area we couldn't care less about where nothing happens. 22. Johnny and Dr Storm playing the blame game come on get over it 23. I really don't know what else I can say. it was just not goodthe movie in general was terrible. to bring in an old non-marvel marvel movie, I liked Spider-Man 3 but I hated one part of it when Tobey turned all emo and annoying and walked down the street with unwanted swagger. I hated that part. that's like this movie. except it happens THE whole entire time. it's really bad. and the director can say whatever he wants about how he planned to have tons of action and his version of the movie was better ya BS if that's what happened then sue Fox. I'm just waiting for Deadpool and Civil War.thank you for your time. Fox, I hope you read this. thanks for nothing. thank you for disappointment. this film had so much potential. you're like Tim Riggins from Friday night lights. honestly.",

The Third Act of the movie was like some mini boss, sad for a villain that is one of the most powerful in the marvel universe. If you've seen trailers or the movie, you've probably seen the Robo-Freddy Kruger thing that they call \"Dr.Doom\", and it just sucks. It looks like they took a third-graders concept art for a super villain, and said 'sure, why not, looks good!'I have no idea where that money went considering the atrocious CG on Mr.Fantastic, the obvious use of teen-aged Caesar for the test ape, the lack of action, and the heroes BARELY showing their powers.*Sigh* So, in conclusion, this film is worthless and I only hope Fox doesn't do this with the next fant4stic , X-men: Apocalypse, and dear god don't do this this with Deadpool.",

This would explain why Kate Mara is more likely to shine in scenes that Trank clearly had nothing to do with.That's not to say the movie's inability to develop characters properly ends there. Not when Reed Richards is a loner to the point where Ben Grimm is almost his only ally. Ben's reason for it seems to be on account of the break he gets from a stereotypical big brother bully played by Tom Hanks' son, Chet. As for the scene that features Chet, I don't think Rita Wilson's entire screen time in Jingle All the Way is quite as mean spirited and unwatchable.Not even a blissfully ignorant teacher saying \"Take your magic trick to Vegas, you disqualified dimwit\" is enough for me to feel bad for Reed, due to the excuse said teacher was probably using to make Reed pay for damage at a science fair. Reed Richards even causes more extensive damage to New York City when he and a few buddies fiddle with a teleportation device that clearly was not made for him or his overgrown spoiled brat of an associate Victor, whose later role as a villain is way too forced.To make Richards even less relatable than I'd find him in the other media I've seen so far, Miles Teller deliberately phones in his acting left and right while Michael B. Jordan, Reg Carthey, and Tim Blake Nelson at least seem like they're trying to shine.",

If I can be entertained on my own, I will say to the naysayers, \"Screw you then! I'll watch me some Freddy Got Fingered!\"Fant4stic is something I've been wanting to watch for a really long time. I keep hearing it's really bad and I needed to see just how bad it was. And was it as bad as everyone says it is?yes. its really that badHere are the reason why this movie is terrible: (also i cant say spoiler alert because there's literally nothing to spoil) 1) The pacing: The entire movie is just build up, but it never stops the build up. I was forty minutes into the movie and I wondered when it was going to start. They build a portal thing to another dimension, get powers, and out of nowhere, the government is using them as weapons a year after they have powers. It just jumps from nothing happening, to everything happening, to nothing happening again. Nothing happens in this movie. Nothing action packed, nothing exciting, nothing terrifying, just nothing at all.2) The characters: How can you make Michael B. Jordan so boring? The Human Torch is supposed to be a wise cracking, impetuous member of the team, but in this movie, he ended up being too serious and not funny at all. Reed Richards is just so boring. He has nothing relatable going on with his personality. He is just smart and knows things. That's it about his character. Ben Grimm is just there. Sue Storm is the stereotypical female character that doesn't like fun and wants to do her work. I don't remember anything about any of these characters. Victor Von Doom has the most interesting character in the film, but the film is never consistent with how he is supposed to act. He's supposed to be the evil genius with a plan up his sleeve, but he ended up genuinely becoming friends with his colleagues and just becomes evil out of nowhere.3) Dr. Doom: He sounds evil. He looks menacing. He acts like he's dangerous. Yet, the film never establishes why he's like this. He becomes evil out of nowhere. They never explain why he's doing the things he's doing. They never explain what kind of powers he has. They never explained why he hated the Fant4stic so much. And they just kill him off in a really anti-climactic battle. They wasted Dr. Doom. They wasted a scary and evil villain to make something that looks like a mannequin. 4) Only one action scene. The final battle.5) There are actually good things about the movie. This is a problem because I really like how they changed it up. They tried to make the chemistry between everyone real. They tried to explain why the Thing says \"It's clobbering time.\" They try to make the government use them as weapons. They try to make everyone get together to make a giant climactic battle between differences in beliefs. But the thing is, the negative things about the movie immediately contradicts these good things. Everything good is then taken away by a bad decision in the movie that makes the good things bad. The chemistry ended up being forced. The Thing barely says his catchphrase. The government spends a whole year off-screen making them into weapons. The battle was terrible. Absolutely nothing works in this movie.6) Boring: This is just it. It's so boring. Nothing is happening. The characters do nothing. The movie ends when it just begins. The jokes are lazy. The effects are terrible. The logic makes no sense. And throughout the entire movie, I even forgot I was watching a movie about Marvel's Fantastic Four instead of a crappy sci-fi movie.Fant4stic is amazing. Never have I seen a movie go from 0 to 100 in terribleness. It is truly an epic fail. and not even a stan lee cameo",

I've seen a lot of films but this is one of the worst I've ever wasted time on watching, like a knock off of the original, which was awesome. This 2015 film has bad actors and the storyline is stupid. Most people in the world hate it. It's not often that a film gives me the idea that the directors were just trying to make a quick buck. Probably meant for the really young audience of under 13, as if I was only 16 I would probably want to get a refund. Is there anything good about this film, it gave people working on it jobs and income, raised some revenue tax for the nation and the special effects were OK. This isn't the 1st film to turn crap with the newest issue, like Spider-Man 2 (2014). As if the same stupid director made both of these waste of time to watch films. What idiot made this 2015 crap? Who cares right, well need to know what films to not waste time on.",

            "content": "Nowadays, we are getting lots of fantastic superhero flicks. (No pun intended) Like Iron Man, The Dark Knight, and Guardians of the Galaxy. And, we always think that we might never get another superhero movie that is atrocious like Batman & Robin and Superman IV. Unfortunately, for most people, they were wrong. I mean, DEAD wrong. The reboot of Fantastic Four here was torn into BILLIONS of pieces by critics and audiences alike. But, to be honest, I DON'T think this movie is as terrible as everyone thinks it is but I don't wan't to praise this movie too much because if I do, I will be hated by millions. Anyway, let's start from the beginning. The very beginning.When I first saw the trailers for Fantastic Four, I thought this was going to be a GOOD movie. Why? Because two reasons. One: the film is directed by Josh Trank who directed a movie I clearly enjoy, Chronicle. And two: the cast is pretty well-picked. We got Miles Teller from the masterpiece Whiplash and Michael B. Jordan from Chronicle. I was very optimistic about this film ever since. When it came out, I was in the biggest shock of my movie life when this was panned with lots and lots of criticism! When I was about to watch this movie, I was extremely nervous that I will waste 100 minutes watching this film, but in the end, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Was it disappointing? Absolutely. Is it terrible? Not even close, by surprise.I'll start off by bashing the pacing of the film. Good gosh, it's so slow! I mean, it's so slow that the main characters didn't get their powers until we're like HALFWAY through the movie! After that, the film speeds up a bit too much. But, here's a fine thing about it, it keeps me from being bored in some parts with it's important plot point entries. Of course, some parts without important plot points are boring. My thoughts on the visual effects is polarized. Some are good and some are... meh. Not all visual effects in this movie are good like the flames of the Human Torch and the Thing and *sighs* Do I even have to mention the disgusting look of Dr. Doom?! The visual effects that I DO like is the powers of the Invisible Women and the world-building of another dimension. Or is it a planet or... nevermind.That's pretty much it I can say about Fantastic Four. It's not good but not terrible either. Don't bother watching this film, anyway. It doesn't suit your time. Go watch Ant-Man, Minions, Mission: Impossible or even Kingsman. We have learned that not every superhero movie today can entertain us after all.Film Score: 4/10 - Underwhelming (Still no pun intended)",

            "content": "For fans of the comic team Fantastic Four, it's easy to see how this disappoints. Dr. Doom is nothing like the comic version, and the origin story of the team is changed so much as to be basically completely re-written.I am often the guy among my friends who likes everything, except that on the rare occasion when I do NOT like something it is usually something that most people DO. Examples: Blade Runner puts me to sleep. Joker I HATED for creating absolutely no empathy at all for the character, merely contempt. I kept wanting Batman to time travel back and squash him like the useless bumbling contemptible emo bug he was, and by the time his childhood abuse was revealed it was FAR too late to feel sorry for him; the die had been cast. And even if I had felt sorry for him it would have been the kind of sympathy one has for a mad dog. It is sad it has happened, but it still must be put down. Star Trek - I'm a huge life long fan and have liked every series EXCEPT Lower Decks, which it seems all other fans like and I find completely un-watchable. There are a few more but this review isn't about those. (I even like the Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern. I don't LOVE it, but I like it - but I'm a huge GL fan.)The older 2005 FF is admittedly a lot better, at least if you can overlook The Thing just being the actor in a rubber suit which I can, but I think the FF origin story needs a bit of an update and I like how that was done in this one, in general at least. It has a Lovecraftian spin to it that I really enjoyed. I relate to Reed as a young boy as I was something like that with my ham radio and electronics hobby among other scientific and technical interests, though my radio and electronics hobby was the one that had my room looking like a much lower budget version of young Reed's. ;) My family was nothing like the train wreck young Richards had to endure but otherwise that was very relatable to me.I thought it really sort of finished showing a lot of promise for a second movie, but of course the horrible reviews and reception killed that. I understand why it wasn't a big hit, but I don't really understand why it's considered so awful. Bottom line - don't assume that because nearly everyone else hated it you will. You might like it; a few of us do.",

They do kick off in a high school so you sort of have to assume that no self respecting actor will take acting roles with FOX anymore, and they are horribly exploiting child labor in Hollywood so they can keep churning out this garbage.I'm a huge Marvel fan and have been soaking up everything that Disney & Marvel have been doing with utter admiration, even Ant Man was better than I had originally thought. SO I decided that F4 deserved a chance and maybe, just maybe they had just missed the mark with the trailers for this movie, but...Sadly the trailers tell you everything that is going on, before you have even bothered to hand over your money at the cinema counter and stuff your face with Popcorn. Obviously I'm not going to write spoilers here, but even if I wanted to, I couldn't because there is not a single thing I could take from having watched the full 100 minute movie and expose it here.From the trailer you know the villain, it's Doom, you know the event that causes their super powers, inter dimensional travel plus explosion. And beyond this, you are better off staying at home, because absolutely nothing else happens! F4 honestly spends 100 minutes trying to stitch 5 or 6 characters together who have zero ability to do anything other than overact all their scenes, into a thinly driven story with no arcs that succeeds utterly at failing to have any flair or even remotely interesting set pieces where the main characters could possibly be seen doing anything other than sitting around being mopey about their lot in life.The character relationships from the comics were only ever briefly hinted at, catch phrases OMG don't even start me. This movie was not funny, it was not sad, it was not action packed, it was not smart, it wasn't even dumb. It was just nothing, nothing but a thin attempt at masking profiting off of the Marvel name and the IP that FOX will hopefully one day forget they own.",

It starts off a mess and ends even messier. We have the typical \"origin\" story where two of the friends are in grade school and create a science project type experiment pretty much for kicks. They make a teleporting device out of spare game and car parts. Yes, that is true. Skip some years, Ben Grimm is forgotten, people do stupid crap that has little to do with the story.

This film could of been so much more its sets the scene and the plot, the character of doom could have been one of the best villains due to his powers and background but is it completely wasted, for him to appear after what's happened in the film to an almighty climax of a 10min show! This film really does feel rushed followed by some cheesy lines at the end of the film and no spoiler after the credits like pretty much all marvel films. If there was another hour added to the film and the action was dragged out a bit more this could have been so much better. But saying this people will still watch this due to the franchise so i suppose the film makers is in pocket, even tho too watch its a rushed film with a disappointing ending.",

            "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, I had huge hopes for this movie. I personally love the lead roles (until you go outside the fantastic four), I think that they have had great young careers and they show huge amounts of promise. I think that someday in the future they will all be even bigger stars than they currently are, and are becoming, but I think all of them will look back and realize that this was a poor investment of their time, because this movie is a total bust.Now, I understand that there are a plethora of movies that are around 100 mins long, but for this type of superhero movie, where you had to establish a past, acknowledge the general issue to be addressed by the movie, and still have time for the rest of the plot and the decent ending, it doesn't work. By about 40 mins in they were just beginning to get some of their powers. That leaves them with an hour to deal with the rest of the movie, which is not enough, again.I didn't like the first movie, I thought it was way too targeted at a very young audience, and I thought that this would be much better because it seemed to have more of a darker side to it, but the first one at least gave you the entire story. There are plot holes galore in this one.For instance, they rode the tail of a worm hole back to earth. And then just left it there, like it was no big deal, they didn't finish the ending, they didn't describe any back lash, they didn't do anything with the ending. Instead, after Von Doom almost destroys the world after they just reopened a portal to \"Planet Zero\", they get a big government contract and a huge lab, seemingly just because. Now I understand that one wasn't the worst but it bothered me so I had to get it off my chest.Second, what was the energy on \"Planet Zero.\" was it radioactive, did it change their DNA, what did it do... Oh that's right, they were just concerned with going back.Third, the fight scene, are you kidding me, there are about 50 different things wrong with it, like how did Reed magically gain the strength to decompress his arm back to normal size, how did Johnny break out of his rocky prison, none of it really makes any sense. Then to top it off, it took maybe 10 mins and then it was done, left incomplete, like this movie should have been.Fourth, the script. These writers can't honestly believe that these lines are good enough for this style of movie. They probably told each other to look into their eyes a total of about 20 times collectively throughout the movie. And I understand there are likely other major issues with the script, but seeing it just once (likely the only time I will see it) this stood out to me the most.Fifth, the year break. There is a part in the movie where the characters go about their lives with their powers for a year without showing a single second. During which, initially you had no clue what was going on, and after they described what was going on, you regretted why you wondered at all.I'm just going to end this here because I really can't stand thinking about it. I am only giving this a 4 because of the actors, they actually didn't do too terribly although it still was not my favorite showing for any of them. But Miles Teller will be a lead in other bigger movies, Kate Mara has displayed her abilities multiple times now, and Michael B. Jordan is an incredibly dynamic actor so I guarantee he will do big things in the future.All I am saying is that I heard that there was going to be a sequel to this movie, and to the writers, producers, and any one else that has to do with it, if you are going to make it like you made this one, don't.",

The Fantastic Four get powers (this time through a dimensional portal) and fight Doom. Doom is actually missing for most of the movie, and the climax isn't satisfying. In fact, Doom seems to be all-powerful at the beginning of the climax in HIS dimension... then The Thing punches him and he seems to lose any ability to defend himself. Really?I can't even figure out how all of these characters even got together. All of them are supposedly intelligent (except maybe Grimm) but nothing they do on screen makes any of them appear to be a genius. Sorry, it seems like all they did was engineer it and there's no real explanation to how they do it. Fine, that makes you smart... but they don't USE it in any intelligent way, just travel through it.Characters - The ONLY character that had any development and you might care about is Father Storm. 1. Reed - Supposedly intelligent but all of the intelligence is off-screen, simply working on the teleporter. Nothing that he does in interacting with the other characters or reacting to events convinces me that he's a genius. 2. Sue Storm - The fact that she's adopted doesn't really mean much or help the plot in anyway except to allow them to have a white female with a black father/son. 3. Johnny Storm - Not as much the smart ass/daredevil as previous incarnations. The first time we meet him, he's redlining and then crashing his car. Without some other basis to believe he's actually GOOD at racing, not a good start. Then throughout the movie, he doesn't do much in terms of action. 4. Grimm/Thing - Appears at the beginning to help Reed, but there's absolutely NO development of what he does, other than bring spare parts for Reed to use on his teleporter v1.0. And his brother uses the 'Clobberin time' line for almost no reason. He's also missing for about half of the movie, and the 'tension' they try to create between Reed and Grimm/Thing is just not believable. He headbutts Reed once (after Reed had just avoided a punch)... and then all seems to be forgiven. Really? This might be more due to the 1.5 hr runtime, maybe they planned to make the tension more interesting in an earlier release. We'll probably never know.After all of the good superhero movies we've had recently, this just makes no sense. Who green-lighted this garbage? They need to be fired.

Johnny had a huge chip on his shoulder, genius mechanic but doesn't wanna go to a school where he can build to his hearts content? That his dad basically runs? OOOOOK. As a black man, I'm telling you there was no point in changing one of the Storm siblings black and.. SPOILER although who cares.. the other one adopted. This was never explained, it would've taken 1 minute of screen time with Sue... \"My parents were lifelong friends with the Storms, and Johnny's always been like a brother to me. When they died, the Storms took me in.\" Done. I just made a simple backstory for the siblings in 8 seconds. Bad CGI, sorry but it's true. Human Torch looked good, especially in close ups. The Thing was good, you could always tell it was CG, but it was good enough, only took you out of the movie when it was a close up of him with a human character. Sue Storm effects were decent, a bit too cartoony. Her powers looked better in the 2005-7 versions. Mr. Fantastics though were HORRENDOUS. Bad CG to the max, didn't even remotely show the versatility in his powers. Dr. Doom was wasted. He showed up on screen, and 12 minutes... literally, about 12 minutes later, the movie ended.. What the s***?? They find him, he goes on this 2 minute murder walk (which was arguably the coolest looking scene in the movie unfortunately), the team comes up with a random plan that basically involves Doom getting uppercutted, and then they win. And the movie is over. GAHHHHHHH I'm so frustrated with this movie I swear. The cast gave it their all, but there's nothing they can do. Fox screwed the pooch hard with this. I just can't believe this is Josh Tranks work, I honestly believe the studio savaged this. You can't go from a great movie like Chronicle to making trash like this. Even a casual movie goer could point out the mistakes in this. The only reason I'm giving this a 4 is because the build up was pretty nice... Actually the movie itself was pretty decent up until legit RIGHT after they got their abilities. Then the movie just went off the deep end. Hard. Like face plant hard. Sell the rights back to people that know what to do with them Fox.",

It is the single worst superhero film ever made and the single worst film of 2015.To be true, the popcorn interested me more than watching this film and within half an hour, it became a painful experience. Having to wait for nearly the whole movie for the heroes to become heroes and the whole movie for the villain to become the villain and then to have him get killed within five minutes- sorry not my type.The movie is a failure of fantastic proportions that succeeds in boring you till you think why they had to remake the film. For me, this film was just made so that Chris Evans did not play two Marvel Heroes at the same time and has no other point to prove whatsoever.Watch this movie if you think that superhero movies are always entertaining and four superheroes in one movie will blow your mind.I guarantee you this movie will change that line of thought.

The first fantastic four movie from the 80's or 90's is better then this rubbish. go watch ant-man instead that's great.Overall there were some enjoyable parts but not enough to get me to like the film as much as i wanted to. i was looking forward to this movie so much but now i am the most disappointed fan of them all. 1/10",

            "content": "Other than Toby Kebbell and Tim Blake Nelson, the performances are all great and it also has great special effects and captures the body horror very well but the good points pretty much end there.The movie wastes time by including unnecessary scenes of Reed and Ben's childhood, even if Owen Judge was great as a young Miles Teller. Had the movie started with the science fair (which was also lame) we'd have still been able to understand Reed was trying to invent a teleporter. It was also hard to believe that a kid as smart as Reed would still be in public school. And the technology such as 90s computers was way out of date for 2007. The depiction of Ben Grimm's brother was all wrong. He was not abusive in the comics. And if Ben was born in 1986, wouldn't he have been 21 years old in 2007?They should have just started with Reed being accepted to the Baxter Foundation. It was hard to believe Reed's 5th grade teacher was still around and it made no sense for him to be disqualified for a working teleporter or for it to not be considered real science.Sue's Doctor Doom line was cringeworthy. It was pretty obvious that the line was written in a version of the script where Doom was called Victor Domashev and it would have served a nod to the comics but in the finished film it doesn't work so well. Apart from Kate Mara's wig, they did do quiet well with the reshoots.The team getting drunk (a ripoff of the Fly) and deciding to go into the other dimension themselves was dumb. Doom's speech about how the people who built the Apollo spacecraft didn't get any glory was all wrong. In real life, Wernher Von Braun, a key figure that made the Apollo 11 mission possible was very famous at the time, making appearances on television during the 50s, 60s and 70s. Apollo 11 was also built by thousands of scientists, not four teens, hence why the astronauts got most of the fame and the astronauts were very vocal about how grateful they were to the scientists for keeping them alive during their journey. And since Reed and Victor are both scientists, they should have known this. Another problem is the company would be unlikely to even acknowledge them as being the ones to go through and they would likely be fired or possibly even go to jail. And they should have bought Sue along with them, it made little sense for her to somehow get powers without going with them and if feels wrong to not have all the Fantastic Four going to them when she went with them in the comics (instead of Doctor Doom). It also takes a whole hour just for the Fantastic Four to get their superpowers. This should have happened during the first 15-25 minutes of the movie.Cutting to a year later was another mistake as we don't get to see how the group cope with their powers or see them actually learning how to use them. They put in unnecessary childhood scenes but left out the part where they test out their powers. The anger Ben feels to Reed is also not really resolved. Well Miles Teller and Kata Mara play their parts well, they both lack chemistry for their relationship. Reg E. Cathey gave the best performance in the movie.Michael B Jordan does the best he can but Johnny Storm was poorly developed. It makes no sense for him to blame his dad when the group were the ones who got drunk and use and used an untested machine for the sake of artificial glory. He also suddenly starts acting like a jerk to Ben for no reason at the end. It just comes out of nowhere and feels artificial rather than him being a likable jerk who does care about his friends. In fact, the Fantastic Four all appear to hate each other with only Ben having any finish to be angry at Reed.Making the Storm siblings an adopted pair made up of two different ethnicities was progressive in showing a multi-racial family but making it so that the Caucasian Sue is the studious, responsible sibling in contrast to the African-American Johnny's delinquent characterization feels like a step backwards.The weakest aspect was Doctor Doom. His reasons are not really explained beyond thinking everything on Earth is horrible and he just loves the desolate world of Planet Zero for some reason. It doesn't help that the main villain does not show up (I'm not counting his pre- supervillain identity) until the last twenty minutes. They should have brought him back during the first act. He was also too overpowered and his defeat relies on him forgetting he can just push people back and explode their heads Scanners style. While the last act has amazing visuals it takes way too long to get to this point. The big energy beam are also ripped off the Avengers and the end scene was ripped off Avengers: Age of Ultron.Basically, the whole movie was just a first act in case it was popular enough to get a sequel that isn't happening. We get brief glimpses of what this movie could have been but the studio screwed it up. I probably would have given the sequel (or a crossover with the Avengers) a chance but thanks to the scripting problems, chances are they'll just reboot in four years time.",

This movie is 100 minutes long and for about 92 minutes of it, it was getting ready for this \"big\" fight. Instead, you get around 8 minutes of Dr. Doom throwing rocks at people.I will admit, some parts in the storyline were interesting, but it wasn't near enough to block out all the boredom. What I did like about the Fantastic Four movies made in 2005 and 2007, is that they actually felt like a TEAM. Which I'm pretty sure is a major part in the Fantastic Four universe. I didn't really feel a connection to them in the movie.I left the theater disappointed, they just made some really BIG and stupid mistakes and decisions that dragged the movie down a lot.

Personally, I feel these scenes were extended just to make the movie longer.I will admit I enjoyed the bit with Dr. Doom walking through the hall, it was super bad-boy and very well done. That scene is definitely one to watch again - if you have not seen the film due to poor reviews, I highly recommend you watch that bit.The dialogue in 'Fantastic Four' could be compared by one made in middle school. I was literally covering my face in my hands in a few scenes. It was impossible to like/hate the characters when everything they say feels fake. This is evident in the scene when they explore the 'other dimension'. When Victor Doom falls in the green liquid, I did not flinch a muscle. I did not say 'Oh no! Not Victor!' like the filmmakers expected me to. And it was all due to the (very) poor dialogue. But nothing beats the ending:'That's fantastic.' 'Say that again.' 'That's fantastic.'

The movie didn't quite do enough to build him up, and the final battle scene was just too short and, again, anti-climactic. And I do want to mention one point here. The scene where they pulled Doom from the other dimension and they had him strapped to that table............... A little too REVENGE OF THE SITH for me (when Anakin first put on the suit) I have to ask, did anyone else get that feeling??

The illusion that science will somehow fix all our woes (climate change the worst amongst them) is dangerous because it moves our focus away from the reality that we need to fix climate change by stopping using fossil fuels.

Such a pretty woman, with a beautiful smile.I see there are a lot of negative reviews for this film. I thought that the film was overall OK. It seems that the main issue was that they spent so much time developing the idea of the film, that the point of it and the action stuff was squeezed towards the end and somewhat rushed. Had the film been longer, the people who mainly expect to see much more of the usual smashing and murder would probably have been more satisfied (however that isn't my kind of thing).6.5/10 for the film. 10/10 for Kate (kiss kiss - even though her acting in this film was average, that didn't matter too much ;-)Summary: watch it if you also admire Kate. :-)",

I have to bite my lip so frequently with Superhero movies, because the movie adaptions always seem to make incredibly weird and stupid changes to the stories and/or character. I'm still weirded out by a Superman in Man of Steel, who allows his Pa to sacrifice himself to save a dog so he could keep his powers a secret, and doesn't lure enemies away from populated areas, so they can remain safe!? ...and what about Iron Man accidentally creating Ultron, while in the comics Antman created Ultron on purpose for his science projects. in that same movie quicksilver dies - so how is he ever gonna stand up to his daddy, Magneto in future movies!?. It all makes me feel like movie writers do not trust the 60 years of insight and experience of comic writers - are they really dim enough to believe that they can fix within a year what took comic writers decades to create and improve!?In this case there was a lot less to break my teeth on - the only real disappointment i found is actually a repeat mistake. Again, the movie Dr Doom is an independent villain without any support and a very direct and maniacal approach, while in the Comics he is the archetypical master villain with lackeys and minions in the form of Latveria (the Country he rules with an iron fist) and Doombots (Robots build with the same tech as his armor), always busy setting ingenious longterm plans in motion to get more powerful. ...And really, the writers couldn't be bothered to give doom his own separate origin (like in the comics, where he is more like an evil Ironman, rather than a mutant, like the Fantastic 4)!?Although there were some other changes made to the story, as whole these have little impact on the overall plot line or characters ('Going into space and getting hit with cosmic radiation' really isn't all that different than 'traveling to an alternate dimension and getting hit by a blast of alien energy').Even though i like the 2005 version a lot better (and not just because of Jessica Alba), i think its still a good movie and definitely worth the time of comic fans and movie buffs alike.",

            "content": "Let's be honest; All the hype this movie had disappears completely. It suffers from the overused 'generic origin story' clich\u00e9, there's surprisingly little chemistry between the characters for a movie about one of Marvel's most tightly-knit families, and they kill off one of Marvel's most well loved villains (for the third flipping time!!!!). Not only that, Fox has said that this movie and its sequel would take place within their X-men universe, but there's no reference to mutants or anything that has happened in that universe. That being said, the movie does have a few things going for it. The cast selection is excellent, with Miles Teller doing a great job as the scientific genius, Mr. Fantastic. There are some good homages to the comics, such as Invisible Woman's force field bubble she uses and Mr. Fantastic's shape shifting abilities (although I would have preferred he shifted his hands into weapons instead of him changing his appearance), heck, you could argue that the Human Torch using the suit to activate his powers is homage to the original Human Torch from the comics. Also, if you compare it to 2005's dismal attempt, its better as far as tone and scientific accuracy (I'll take teleportation to another dimension over gamma induced space clouds any day). Despite what the critics say about this movie, I think it does deserve a sequel, at least so they can fix what they didn't do well in this movie. It's also a great chance to explore some of Marvel Comics' other Fantastic Four villains. The first thing they would have to do is change the name of that planet in the other dimension from 'planet zero' to 'The Negative Zone', which in the comics, serves as the location of the Marvel heroes' max security prison for villains as well as home to Annihilus, who controls what's called 'the Annihilation Wave'. This would also be a perfect opportunity to introduce the Alien nation of the Skrull to cinema, which Would basically serve the same purpose as Marvel's Kree alien nation; a nation of aliens to show that the characters we know are not the only ones in the universe. This would also help introduce one of Marvel's most creative villains in my opinion; The Super Skrull, a Skrull leader who has all the powers of the Fantastic Four (for more information on these classic Marvel creations, just use google/bing/marvel database). Bottom line, the movie is trying to popularize 'Marvel's First Family' during a time when Marvel movies are all the rage now. However its flaws and critical panning might prevent that. But if it does overcome that hump, then the franchise does have potential to become decent. Sony tried To make a franchise twice with Spider-Man before letting him join the MCU. Fox gets one more crack at the Fantastic Four, but if that doesn't work, Fox better work something out with Marvel before the fans make them.",

            "content": "After reading and watching so many viciously negative reviews online for Fantastic Four, I was intrigued to check it out just to see how bad it can really be. And you know what? I actually quite enjoyed this movie!Lowered expectations might have played into this but I think the movie has so many elements that make it interesting. Some critics have compared this to Batman and Robin and Superman IV but I honestly do not consider this movie in their league. I distinctively remember watching Batman and Robin in theater and people literally started walking out. I stayed for the whole show just because I paid for it. But this movie, I was actually drawn to it by its own merits. First of all, I am not a fantastic four comic book fan. But I am a fan of sci-fi movies and Josh Trank seems to have designed it to be a kind of sci-fi horror like The Fly. The first two acts played like those sci-fi horror films where in this case kids play with some untested invention and suffer horrific consequences. When you approach Fantastic Four from this angle, it becomes a movie about dealing with these horrific transformations. I like that Reed Richard's stretchy powers are not ridiculously silly like the earlier versions of F4 but rather they are gross to look at. And the same goes for the other members of F4. In this regard, Fantastic Four is a big budget version of Josh Trank's previous film, Chronicle. Chronicle succeeded because it took a realistic approach to the superhero origin story and how normal high school kids would deal with the newly gained power. When Fox hired Josh Trank for Fantastic Four, they must've known that he was going to take F4 on a similar path. The third act of the movie is where one can spot the studio interference. It feels truncated and rushed and does not tie up what was set up in the first two acts. It feels like Fox panicked at what they saw and tried to inject more mainstream superhero sequences. I'm curious where Josh Trank would've taken it were he not shortchanged. Anyway, this is not a great movie but it's not a horrible one either. If you are drawn to sci-fi films, this is quite enjoyable. I feel like if people watched this before the era of the internet, there would've been more positive reactions. Some of these angry negative reviews from online critics seem to just feed off each other.",

            "content": "KIDS FIRST! \"Fantastic Four\" Reviewed by Keefer C.BlakesleeA disappointing film that had a riveting first half but a rushed and forced seconded half. 4 young minds create a machine that transports them into a alternate universe. Once they come back they have acquired unique powers that they need to control.The first half looks promising. The pacing, character development, and story are engaging. The darker direction they're going with the story makes it enjoyable. My favorite scene is when the 4 discover their abilities. There's a sense of fear, tragedy, and betrayal with the characters. It started out as another successful origin story, then it felt like the editors pressed the fast-foreword button once it stared getting interesting. The second half felt like a long sneak peek for the next Fantastic 4 film. It had a great head start but it left me wanting more in a negative way. There was enough 4, but lacked fantastic. The updated special effects are one of the redeeming qualities of this film. The presentation of each power is stunning. The impressive design of Ben Grimm/The Thing (Jamie Bell) and fluent stretching effects of Mister Fantastic gives this film an updated edge. At first there is a connection among the characters; both with each other and the audience. The actors pull this off seamlessly and you are sincerely captivated with their goals and struggles. However, they suffer during the second half as all their hard work is painfully rushed. My favorite character is Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic (Miles Teller). Richards is one of the people who help build the machine. He ends up getting the ability of an elastic body,, which means he can stretch any part of his anatomy. Miles Teller has been on a roll with his career and for good reasons. He's a talented actor who dives deeply into the characters he plays. This part is no exception.The moral of the film, though a bit forced, is like Abraham Lincoln's saying, \"A house dived against itself cannot stand\". The 4 heroes face Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and attack him individually. Soon they realize, that together, they are stronger.I give this 4 out of 10 stars and recommend this to 10 through 18 years of age. There's some dark material and language that younger audiences may not be able to handle. This film has some saving aspects but it sadly does not recover the whole film. In theaters August 7thKeefer C.Blakeslee, Age 15, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",

He had great potential to be a good baddie but was wasted by having a short role in the movie AND HE WAS THE Villain! And to end it all a 4 minute fight scene that made me feel nothing at all.

I remembered Reed being older and it didn't click to me immediately that Johnny is going to be different and Sue is not American? I thought the dialogue was a bit too simple. But past all that, I couldn't stop watching the movie (and stopped my workout instead). The simple scenes like Johnny and Reed's failed fist bump or Reed ignoring Victor's accusations of love in the office, show Reed's character. How the characters were feeling when the transformation took place were quite real. It wasn't something they would immediately embrace but need to go through some training.

In fact...I could've easily handled the fact the whole movie was just an origin story and brought in the action that all these comicbook fans demand into the sequel, instead of just throwing in the tiny action sequence at the end like they did. But why was it so tiny? The movie's only 90 odd minutes long. They could've made it so much more.Anyways...I'm guessing my opinion's gonna be as unpopular as the movie itself.

Those films had problems which made it easy to comprehend why they didn't have much box office success. So along comes this reboot. And you would expect they learned from the mistakes from the previous films and made changes and improvements. Changes? Yes. Improvements?...What this movie does well is reinvent the characters while still holding true to the \"dogma\" and legacy of the FF. The special effects are also improved from the previous installments. The story provides strong character backstory to all of the principal characters. They're better developed compared to the previous FF movies. You get a good sense of who these characters are on the inside, and what motivates them and what they're challenges are. It's also worth mentioning that they did good job at conveying the relationship dynamics between all the group.However, backstory makes up the vast bulk of the movie's story! And it exhausted most of the movie. The classic protagonist/antagonist confrontation feels rushed, like a footnote to the entire movie. It almost seems like this movie is supposed to be a prequel to future installments that would be action packed blockbusters. So we could sit back and watch nonstop action and already be emotionally invested in the characters without spending any time on that. So unless you're totally entertained by the backstory, you're left feeling totally shortchanged. I'm adding a point in my rating because of the quality of the backstory, but I still have to rate it low; and label it a disappointment!",

Unfortunately, the other cast seemed very emotionless in most of their scenes to me. And nobody had any chemistry together.The whole Ben and Reed story they were trying to do could have been great if the actors had more chemistry and it didn't feel so, again, emotionless.One thing I will say I appreciate they tried doing is showing the struggle they had after just transforming and being locked up; but even then they rushed those scenes along with the rest of the movie. The rushed fight against Victor made no sense because they did a terrible job building his relationship with the others unlike the previous installment. I was lost by the story half of the time and I don't think that went away by the end either. It was rushed and all over the place, it makes me sad because they could have done so much with this movie, maybe with a better script and some of the cast replaced it could have been better than first movies (that I personality enjoyed).",

So just like all GOOD superhero movies they extend and concentrate on the origins of their super- human abilities, and not just a quick lab accident and move on with a non related reason for them to defeat the evil villain.Also, who says they can't be older in the next film (Mr. Fantastic with gray hair and all) as so many have complained as well.But unfortunately because of people complaining on how 'bad' this movie was... Marvel won't be doing any more Fantastic 4 movies. But for so many of you who didn't like this film, at least this movie was way better that the original 2 garbage (specially \"Rise of the Silver Surfer\").",

It became one of my worst movie this 2015.My Love for the FF comics kept my rating up, but if this is the first time I see the movie it's a 1/10 for me.

I only vaguely remember the previous Tim Story directed films, and that's about it. I gotta say, for a property that prides itself as being \"Marvel's First Family\", the Fantastic Four doesn't seem to be as well regarded as, say, anything else Marvel cranks out. Heck, shortly before the release of this movie, Marvel canceled their current run of Fantastic Four comics, and the sales of that last issue only solidifies that decision. So what's the deal? Why is Fantastic Four so ill-regarded in the eyes of Marvel and it's fans? Is it because of the movies? Maybe the comics are great, I don't know, but I certainly don't want to read them after not just one or two bad movies, but also a third one. And this version of the Fantastic Four is the most ill-received out of all of them, scoring a whooping 9% on Rotten Tomatoes compared to the low 20's and 30's percents the other two movies managed to get. (I'm purposely leaving the 1994 Roger Corman flick out of this because I haven't seen it, but if Fox really refuses to release it, then I think that says everything.) This version of the Fantastic Four is by far the darkest in terms of tone and mood, but it is also the most lifeless and bland. At a scant 99 minutes, I was also expecting a tighter pace, but that was only wishful thinking. The first half of this movie is very slow; they don't even get their powers until about halfway through. Honestly, I actually kinda liked the first half for what it's worth. All the setup and introductions to our characters was very well done. We got to see what everyone does and how they contribute to the group, it just goes on for way too long, and the dialogue is simply atrocious. The second half is where the movie completely derails. The pacing is manic and relentless, as if the movie itself obtained the power of super speed and is making up for lost time spent on too much buildup. The final confrontation with Doctor Doom is over and done before I even knew it was happening. I still have no idea how they actually defeated him, he just kinda disappears. No doubt it's in the second half where Fox demanded most of the re-shoots take place.Director Josh Trank blamed studio interference by Fox on the lackluster quality of the movie. Is that really true? Why did Fox demand re-shoots? I have a hard time believing the same studio that okays an R-rated Deadpool movie would have any problem with a decent Fantastic Four movie. But from what I've seen in the first half (albeit all it's problems), it looked like Trank had a good idea of what he wanted to do, but his behavior on set was reportedly awful. Was the pressure of a big studio project simply too much for him? Whatever the case with this movie was, I think it's safe to assume that we will never see another Fantastic Four movie in theaters for a very very long time.",

Poor CGI; the CGI in the first two movies from 2005 and 2007 was much smoother and better in terms of relevance and application. 2. Short battle scene at the end that poorly shows the powers of the 4. 3. Doctor doom looks like a robot painted with hydro-dipping. 4. The actor for Sue Storm does not look good with blonde hair. 5. Johnny Storm and his father is 'African American' and sue is 'Caucasian' (sure they can be adopted) but that is not how it is in the comic (f.y.i. all 3 are Caucasian). 6. The Thing (Ben) is more naturally rock looking compared to the older movie version, but the face is not right and lop sided. 7.

I wasn't overly impressed with the younger cast but thought maybe they would take a different aspect on the film. I was also keen on how Dr. Doom would be portrayed and how he would influence the film as a villain. I couldn't be more wrong. -There was limited character back-story on the Fan 4 -There was no middle just a five minute climax at the end that was hardly gripping -The cringe-worthy quotes towards the end of the film were just punishing to watch -Dr. Doom looks like a Droid and goes completely insane over a minor issue and the movie doesn't quite explain why - Dr. Doom is also meant to be one of the most O.P characters in the comics but yet he seems to drop down to the levels of the Fan 4 in the final battle which previously you saw him destroy anything in his path previously. -Whats the go with Tim Nelson being in this movie seriously can they stop regurgitating actors from previously failed ' marvel ' movies and maybe have a fresh start for some characters, especially for someone with a mediocre role as he had - Not really a huge issue but very disappointingly no after credits scenes which are signature to marvel based moves ( even though it is owned by FOX ) The only reason I have given it a 3 is the visual effects, only for one character though. The Thing looked insane compared to the 2005 version, only problem was due to the short length of the movie he got limited time and whipped out some really punishing quotes towards the end of the movie. Also I did like Franklin Storm in this film, he was a breathe of fresh air...but again wasn't perfected pulling out some pretty cheesy lines.So overall it was a total dud, no background characterisation on the characters, if there was it was limited and to go along with the short running time, it was hard to watch. Dialogue was just really, really average and I spent a lot of time watching the movie with my hands on my head in agony.",

            "content": "I liked the movie. I know it's a bit blasphemous to state in the general fan community, but I certainly didn't hate it, and I certainly don't think that it deserves the amount of vitriol that is being throw at it both in the media and from comic \"fans.\" Just from reading over the comments here and elsewhere it is clear that many (not all) don't understand that this is clearly based on the Ultimate version (Marvel's reboot) of the comic that was launched in the early 2000's (or whenever). When I learned this was the case, I quickly read the first 2 collected graphic novels just to see where this was going. I understand most people see F4 as the 1960s, gee- wiz group that is considered Marvel's first family, but in fact, the Ultimate version is a very different idea indeed, and to be fair, the movie \"mostly\" follows the blueprint from that version, particularly the first third (and in my opinion) the best part of the released film, including the teleportation (kids and science fair), and Doom being part of the experiment. That's not to say that there aren't problems (Clobbering time, how they get to the other dimension, etc) but for the most part, it's there. It's funny though that I never really intended to see this after the initial reviews hit saying it was so horrible, but I went just to see if I could see the behind-the-scenes-mess that occurred in its creation. Therefore, I subconsciously played, \"spot the wig\" throughout the film, just to see if I could get a sense of the movie Trank wanted to make, and what the studio seemingly insisted be re- shot/added. What I found was this:Trank's scenes (what I'm assuming are Sue's real hair) are part of a reasonably well-done Sci-Fi take on the Ultimate comic F4. These are by far the best scenes in the film. They are darker, more serious in tone, and much better acted than other portions of the film. There's almost a sense of Sci-Fi horror to what he seemed to be going for that I was really digging. Again, all seemingly Act I. When Act II hits (One Year Later), this seems to be an amalgamation of Trank and studio meddling. It should have been longer, more fleshed out, and (in light of today's reports around the net) desperately needed that scene where Ben was wrecking stuff to solidify the changes over the time passed; likewise, I would have like to have seen more of Ben's pursuit of Reed and the emotional breakdown the should have happened as well, not just their conversation of the return trip. The wig shows up in this portion of the film, and then disappears quite often. What I also began to notice how different Miles Teller's take on Reed was. Under Trank, (again, what I assume was Trank's direction) he seemed much more invested and emotionally driven; however, any scene in which he appeared that wreaked of meddling, his forced heroic delivery took me right out of his portrayal of the character. There also seemed to be far too much unneeded plot downloading about powers and training with Sue and Johnny (which I thought Jordan did fine with what he was given btw) that could have been more focused on Reed's return and how these characters reacted to his presence. Apparently, a year is no big deal, not even for Doom.I wish they would have spent more time with Doom. Trailers and (again) internet babble indicate there was at least a scene where Reed confronted him prior to him busting heads \u2013 which, I though was pretty great and seemed to be filmed more in the style of Trank's original vision than what it eventually leads to. And while this original scene probably would have fell into the trope of the villain telegraphing his plan to the heroes, it felt it would have at least made the payoff worth it. The payoff we get, meanwhile, is pretty terrible. Act III: Forced dialog, missing villain motivation, questionable Mr. Fantastic effects, and that damn wig. I don't know if Trank actually filmed an ending or not, but clearly this was all done in re-shoots, and it kinda sucks. It just felt like they were trying far too hard to take the hard tone of the first hour (which, in my mind is not something I would not show a 10-year-old) and turn it into the Fox version of Avengers (safe for all ages). Kinsberg should be ashamed if he truly is responsible for this ending. If anything, I would at least want to know what the original plan was for the final battle of this movie was, filmed or not.I like the epilogue with the smash cut to the name. Strangely enough, some of these scenes feature Sue's real hair. Overall, I would give it a 6.5 out of 10. Definite potential, but squandered through (what I perceive) as meddling. I do want to see Trank's original vision, whatever is salvageable, and I would hope, to at least regain something financially, the studio would offer this on DVD \u2013 though I doubt it, because Fox is a pain. After all, I waited nearly 15 years to get a solid extended cut of Alien 3. I also think this is salvageable; if they find a decent writer with the correct handle of tone, I think they can mine a good sequel from this. I like each of the actors, but they need a better story and execution to work with, including more inter-play between the characters, which I did miss, especially between Johnny and Ben. I think overall, the best chance they have at this is to form a partnership with Marvel (like Sony and Spider-Man), but not re-cast, just move forward.",

(I didn't read the comics but it didn't sound like something I had heard about before.)And that is exactly what's wrong with this movie. I had so much potential!!!The start was so good, and the exposition felt alright. Like I said, filled with clich\u00e9s, but still very enjoyable.And then right after the introduction is done, you look at the time and remember the runtime and think, well what the hell is going to happen in so little time. Turns out, not much... You get this dumbed down action that's not really clear or makes a lot of sense. They weren't clear enough about Doom's intentions. It feels like he's bad, because, yeah he's a pretentious asshole and very bad... Just go with it...This movie's pacing changed too drastically, to the point in which you suddenly have absolutely no idea what's going on. That's the problem. They were afraid of the movie running for too long, felt solid about the start and kept it that way (which is fine), and shortened everything else (not fine).I could talk about the dialogue that felt stupid at times, but that's not really what I though about after the movie.

But I was determined to watch it. Even after the terrible reviews, I still wanted to see it for myself. And I have to say that\u0085 it's not horrible.The first, say, 50 minutes of the movie are actually pretty good. You get to know most of these characters and their motivations. I especially liked the friendship between Reed and Ben. I also liked how Dr. Storm took in these kids and mentored them. When we were seeing that, the movie made a lot of sense. And then\u0085 1 year later. That's when things start to fall apart. From that point on, the movie just rushed through the story and it had no interest whatsoever in making us care about these characters or anything that was happening. It seemed like there were parts of the story missing. That wasn't a team, or a family or\u0085 anything, really.The villain here is just terrible. Doom has no development, no motivation and his look is just laughable. One of the greatest villains in comics was turned into a pathetic shadow of himself. Toby Kebbell is a very good actor, but he is so wasted here! In fact, all actors are. Teller, Mara, Jordan and Bell do their best, but when you have nothing to work with, even that might not be enough.A lot has been said about Josh Trank's relationship with the studio: was it his fault, was it Fox's fault? I don't know. But it's clear that something happened. This is not the movie we were meant to have. I feel like there's a good movie somewhere in there. It's a shame we didn't get to see it.Now, what should Fox do with the F4? The way I see it, there are six possible solutions:1- Do a sequel. I think that would be a big mistake. Even if they could take the good stuff in this movie and go with it, who would see the sequel? After the big flop this will become, who would even want it? 2- Try again in a few years. That would also be a mistake. They tried three times and it failed. Why would the fourth time be different? 3- Incorporate these characters in the X-Men movies. That would be disastrous. Fox is actually doing a good job with the X-Men. To bring the characters from a failed movie into a franchise that is actually doing quite well, would destroy them both completely. It has disaster written all over it.4- Do a Sony-type deal with Marvel. Because Sony did a deal with Marvel, we get to have Spiderman in the MCU. Sony still owns the movie rights to him, but they now sort of share him with Marvel. Many fans proposed something like this. I'm not sure I like it. This would mean that Fox would still have control over the movies. And while Sony has actually done decent Spiderman movies, Fox didn't do one F4 movie that can even be considered good. They have failed. They should have no say whatsoever in a movie about these characters.5- Sell them back to Marvel. I would like to see this happening, I really would. But I doubt that it will. Marvel doesn't need the F4. They have a successful cinematic universe without them. Would they like to have them back? I'm sure they would. But they're not going to pay millions of dollars for them. And Fox wouldn't want to sell them either. That would the same as admitting they have failed. And they won't do that.6- Do nothing. This is what I think will happen. Fox will put the F4 in a corner and simply not use them for anything. After a few years without using them, the movie rights will come back to Marvel. That's what happened with Daredevil and I'm pretty sure that's what will happen to the F4.",

It barely has a structure, the cinematography is so lackluster and boring, the effects range from pretty good to downright terrible, the cast is sadly misused, and the villain literally doesn't show up until there are 20 minutes left in the movie.The characters are flat and boring, to the point that Reed's offhand comment to Susan about music being \"her thing\" was actually accurate. everyone has one character trait that they're stuck to for the runtime. Reed's the nerd who doesn't have friends; Ben's the tough, angry one; Johnny's the cool badass who breaks the rules; Susan likes music and patterns; and Victor is just edgy Reed until he's evil out of nowhere 3/4 of the way through the movie because the filmmakers remembered that they needed to check the villain box for their superhero flick.While I'd recommend movies like Daredevil, Batman & Robin, and Catwoman for the ironic enjoyment, I wouldn't force my worst enemies to watch this movie. It's so dull, to the point that half the action and all the \"character development\" is talked about rather than ever shown.The dialog makes me cringe so hard. No one interacts naturally, to the point that a major character death has no real emotional weight. The whole movie is just one long series of characters saying stuff that sounds dumb.The casting was actually kind of exciting to me. I thought they all would actually do a good job with what they were given, but it's clear the on-set issues led to the actors not giving a damn. Mara and Teller aren't even close to having a tiny bit of chemistry, and Jordan and Bell are clearly phoning in their performances. Kebbell also obviously doesn't care, but he's not in a lot of the movie.The effects are passable by 2015 standards for the most part. The render on The Thing is actually pretty solid. That part was actually good. Doom doesn't look absolutely terrible (I mean his design is crap, but his effects aren't too bad). Mr. Fantastic is occasionally uncanny, but his power is stretching so that's not unexpected. The Human Torch effects are easily the worst in the movie. They look just as bad as the effects on Chris Evans from 2005.Overall, I give the movie 2/5 stars because at least the effects aren't terrible. This is also not the worst movie I've ever seen, even if it's in the running for worst superhero movie.Fingers crossed Marvel Studios will make the first really good Fantastic 4 movie.",

Why wouldn't you make the whole family black if the father and son were both black actors? Also when they threw in that one second \"I'm adopted\" line to explain it all away and without any other backstory for why Sue would be adopted really highlighted the fact that the producers just wanted a white actress in the lead role.I should have stopped watching there but decided to keep going because I was interested in this new storyline about how the Fantastic Four became who they are and how they got their powers. However, this new backstory just didn't add up. It was dumb that Sue got powers even though she didn't go to the other dimension and in the end Doom comes back with a vengeance to destroy the world for no reason and then after a five minute fight scene all is good and the movie is over.",

I'm pretty sure that, the general populace(non-comic book reader) remembers the first FF4 movies, then there's the comic book readers who think everything needs to follow the books and then there's the true blue comic book followers, that know, anything can happen and/or change from issue to issue. This movie was a good restart for the FF4. Yes, it doesn't follow the original start of the FF4, but as far as a fresh start for them, this isn't bad. Here's the thing with Disney/Marvel, they already know where they're going with their story. Spider-man just happen to work out, to where they could work him in(it's not like he has a base of operations and such). The way things are right now is to look at all of them being in different realities, just waiting to be combined. This FF4 is a a new start for them and they're young(most of the characters they(FF4, X-men and Avengers) are playing, have been around for the last 50+ years and yet(for the most part) they are portrayed by the same actor. None of the actors who are portraying the characters they are now(except the younger actors, like in X-men or The FF4) will be able to portray them in 5 or more years. We have a new Professor X and Magneto(out Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. Plus Hugh Jackman and Robert Downey Jr. are done with their rolls). So let's look at what we have here, The Avengers(Spider-man), Shield, and the Inhumans. The Fantastic Four and all the mutants. We have a FF4 that can open a door to another reality, same as the agents of Shield and the Asgardians. We also have a Quicksilver and Scarlet Which(in two realities). Once the Infinity War is done(Disney/Marvel) and then the X-men: Age of Apocalypses(Fox/Marvel), they will probably be looking for a way to restart everything(including the FF4). Perfect time to have the FF4 connect realities with the Avengers reality and then have there be a House of M(non comic book readers need to look that up). The Scarlet Which in Fox's X-men(I know she's not there yet, but she will be) snaps and changes all of reality and BAM!, you have the new Marvel Universe. Some of the actors we have now(to tie things together) and new actors for other things. Just like \"Star Wars\", the cannon you know don't mean s@#t. There will be new ways to do things and new stories. If things were just like the way they were written in a novel or in a comic book, things would be really boring, since you'd know how everything was going to happen. Sometimes that's cool, like LOTR or Harry Potter, because you get to see on screen all that you imagined and more, but a comic book is already visual and they've done so many story lines that it's cool to see somethings you know, but even better to see something new.",

The character building is nonexistent and no real love of the characters is formed.

The writers, obviously assuming, that seasoned fantastic four fans could fill in the enormous plot and character flaws/holes of this movie and might enjoy it. Whereas beginners would simply be in such a state of boredom pillows would have been handed out to them at the cinema. The old movies weren't great but the dialogue, (funny, cocky and sexy) characters were much better than this one.

I understand the criticisms that the film felt rushed and had little to no action in it, but people seem to be ignoring the good things that the film did. For one, I thought the four main actors did a great job with their roles and were completely believable as their characters, especially Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm, who completely owned his character. I thought that the character of Doom could have been developed more and had more screen time, but I thought he was cool whenever he was on screen.While the action was lacking at times, Doom's escape from the facility looked great and was one of the highlights of the film. Also, I don't understand people's criticisms of the effects looking fake. I thought they looked cool, but that's just me. I also actually liked this origin story a lot more than the original (sue me). It was more grounded and had a bigger sense of suspense. Plus, there was a legitimate friendship between the four main characters.I won't get into the flaws of this film, because I think everyone knows what they are. Overall, this movie isn't perfect but was a lot of fun to watch. I'd recommend that people ignore the critics on this one and go check it out.",

The best aspect of the Fantastic Four is it's cast, everyone was the best choice for their role, especially Miles Teller.There where a lot of complaints of the movie being dull and boring, but to be honest, I was really invested in the storyline and I wanted to know what was going to happen next and see the characters come out okay. Unfortunately the climax was a let down, incredibly rushed, and Doom, talk about a missed opportunity. I actually liked where Victor began, this angry young man who in his own way wants to improve the situation on earth. As soon as he reappeared as Dr. Doom, he became such a generic bad guy. Also, while I liked Jamie Bell, overall he had very little to do both as Ben Grimm and The Thing, which is a shame.I am one of those people who want to see Marvel Studios get all their character back, I want to see Dr. Doom fight the Avengers, I want to see the Silver Surfer and Galactus realized to their full potential, sadly it looks like the rights won't be going back to Marvel anytime soon. For a movie that was only made so the rights wouldn't revert back, I quite enjoyed the film and I'm not ashamed to say it. Is it perfect? no, but I will happily buy it when it comes out on blu-ray.",

            "content": "No chemistry between the characters. Not a real story behind it. A lack-luster \"Super-Hero\" movie. There are several factors as to why this film IS so bad. Firstly, you can say they were trying to diverge from the original story to create something different, something new. Secondly, the film needed to be longer. There needed to be more back story, more character, more chemistry. And lastly, the set up of the film was wrong. The whole cast and crew needs re-shuffling. Now that is nothing personal against the actors, because each of the four leads have all been brilliant in other films... Just not together in this one. Now that can be blamed on the rush in production with no real time to connect and through poor direction. This film could have been great under the same premise, but it was not meant to be. This now makes me appreciate the old Fantastic Four movies. I blame 20th Century Fox for this one, purely trying to keep rights to make more money. Reminiscing in Sony's methods for The Amazing Spider-Man. It could work against them, but who knows they could hopefully surprise us in 2017 with the sequel.",

However, when I did watch this film it fortunately wasn't too bad (that doesn't mean it was great). One good thing about this Fantastic four was that it tried to focus more on the characters' back story before they got their powers, but the movie got carried away with that and we didn't get to see enough of the Fantastic Four with their powers. The cast also wasn't bad, but Jamie Bell as the Thing? This movie also had a darker tone as compared to the previous Fantastic Fours but like I said the movie got carried away and it felt too dark. There really wasn't anything emotional in the movie either, no-one you could really feel for or sympathize with.The movie also felt clich\u00e9d at some parts, especially Doom who wasn't really convincing as a villain and his funny green mask didn't help. The climax was really short and although it had some good parts ('it's clobbering time') it felt very predictable and cartoon like. Overall I think this movie had potential and some good ideas but they didn't nail it, the movie should have and could have been so much better, it was a good attempt though and it could maybe have a good sequel that is if there are any plans of a sequel.",

Jordan is definitely a less obnoxious human torch which is a major plus but everyone else is worse than the 05' version which is saying something. This also has no humor in it and makes things extremely boring. The cinematography is the worst part of this film, it is horrible. I'd say about 85-90% of this film is so dark you can't even make out half the shot. This is Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight's Night Scenes on Crack. When you and what you can see is really boring to look at with basic camerawork and very lifeless locations and average CGI. Nothing pops in this at all. the music is the best part, it is ok and generic and forgettable. The editing is subpar. While the first half is actually not that bad after they get their powers it feels very underdeveloped and jumpy, like its trying to hit these story marks as quick as possible to overcorrect for spending too much time on the boing stuff in the first half. This leads to not very good pacing overall as the first half is boring and the second is underwhelming and rushed. What's bizarre is this is a very short film to begin with. I hate to say it....but the 2005 one at least you could see and had some color and bad humor and that was a mess. This isn't so much a mess as its lifeless and rushed at points. I can't really recommend this to anyone. Skip It. Huge disappointment once again for the Fantastic Four.",

In the age where giant 1 hour long CGI 3rd act battles are huge in superhero films, it's nice to have a change of pace. I had this same liking for the Loki series in that regard.\n\nDoom is very intimidating, much more so than the 2005 Doom. The action, while in short spouts, is pretty good. The CGI has some moments where it's REALLY bad, but they're short. and the rest of the CG is pretty good. Also I love Doom's design and the F4 suits. \n\nThis movie does however suffer from having a (short) final battle that is in a dark dimension that has horrible lighting so you can't see a lot of stuff. This happened in Thor: The Dark World (which is a MUCH worse movie) too. \n\nI kept waiting for this movie to get really bad, but this is just a decent superhero movie.

I kept waiting for it to get to the team bonding and ass kicking, so much so that the movie actually went by pretty fast? We finally got to the action and it was like wait, it's over? Not sure if there's a sequel, I'll probably never watch it, but here are some things I'd personally like to see explored: (1) Dr. Doom said the other dimension kept him alive, took care of him. I feel like this implies a level of sentience. Does the other dimension love him? Has it been lonely, a lifeless reflection of it's sister planet? Has Dr. Doom come to love this alternate dimension planet? (2) I need the Rock Guy to get some loving. Even in this shitty ass movie his loneliness was palpable. Seems like he's coming from a home with a lot of fighting, has gotten turned into an ugly ass rock guy because he trusted his best friend, and then turned into a killing machine by the government while they room him in some dank basement. Like damn he deserved better. I mean why did they make him stay in a windowless, prison-esque, absolutely barren room?? All while sending him out to do their dirty work in other countries. And now that I type this out it's really feeling like a direct metaphor to how the US military treats our veterans. (3) Just some good old fashioned found family bonding. Where was the banter? The friendship? The love??? Such an empty movie :((.\n\nAnyways, here are the people I'd fuck in this movie:\nMichael B. Jordan: The obvious choice. He's just so cute! And the fact that he could \"flame on\" while inside me and burn me alive at any moment would give me that kind of fear rush, but at the same time I would have complete trust in him to never do that, real sweet spot of good vulnerability. plus I think Michael B. would be a very attentive lover :)\nSue: She seems like a real stick in the mud but I've always been kind of into that with women? I had the weirdest crush my senior year of high school on this JROTC girl who (if my memory stands) always wore the same (ugly) pair of jeans, boots and crew neck sweatshirt, talked in the most matter of fact way, and literally reminded our teacher she hadn't collected the homework multiple times. So annoying you know any high schooler that does that has confidence coming out the ass. Can't deny I used to dream of sneaking away during class and kissing her in the girls bathroom with the weird ass short stalls. Erin, if you're out there, I may or may not still be in love with you.\nThe Rock/The Boulder: I just want to make him feel loved and beautiful. Not a pity fuck, but to remind him that he's human in the most primal way. I think it would be beautiful and tender and we would both cry.\nDr. Doom: But ONLY in the very first scene where he has longer hair and is all depressed and living in a dark, grungy room. He got like 75% less hot after the hair cut (in my personal and professional opinion). We would smoke weed and play our respective video games in the dark (sims 4 for me, animal crossing for him) and the sex would be good enough that I don't realize what a toxic, shitty relationship it is for at least 3 months.",

This reboot recycles most things not to say everything from the 2005 movie and adds new, lazy and boring dialogues, bad casting with terrible performance, there is no character development and in the end the movie doesn't seem to follow a next story line as there is no cliffhanger like a postcredit scene like in every other Marvel movie.

            "content": "For all the power of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, no one has been able to translate the first Marvel superhero film properly to the screen.\n\nFirst there was the 1994 Roger Corman-produced film, one made simply to secure a copyright and never intended to be seen. Then, there were two films made in 2005 and 2007, Fantastic Four and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, that had some star power but ultimately didn't do well. The creators should have taken a note from the cartoon versions, as both the 1994-96 series and the 2006-07 Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes captured much of what makes these heroes so special. Unlike the Avengers, they are two things, a family and also adventure scientists, not truly superheroes.\n\nDespite the first two trailers building big excitement for the movie, it failed at the box office, earning only $120 million on a budget of $167.9 million. Why?\n\nWell, first off, no one could line up on what movie they were making.\n\nLet's start with Josh Trank, who became the youngest director to have a number one at the box office with his first movie, the superhero found footage film Chronicle. He had a fresh new take on heroes and all seemed great.\n\nRight?\n\nX-Men: First Class was another well-regarded superhero movie and the writers, Zack Stentz and Ashley Edward Miller, started writing the script. Sounds awesome!\n\nRight?\n\nExcept that their script followed Avengers as the way and had Dr. Doom as a herald of Galactus and was very comic book-oriented, which Trank did not like. So he wrote his own script.\n\nRemember when comic book movies didn't pay attention to the source material?\n\nTrank left Slater out of discussions with Fox Studios and withheld certain studio notes. Slater added \"I never saw 95% of those notes,\" and left after six months and was replaced by Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter writer Seth Grahame-Smith, with a final script written by Dark Phoenix (oh no, I have to watch that one soon, huh?) director Simon Kinberg.\n\nAnd then, some stuff went really wrong.\n\nDuring filming, producers Hutch Parker and Simon Kinberg rewrote Trank's original script and gave the film a different ending. Despite this, execs demanded reshoots, saying that this movie felt more like a sequel to Chronicle than Fantastic Four.\n\nTo compound matters, Fox ordered their own changes to the film without Trank's supervision, changing and omitting certain major plot points from his movie. Now, that's usually where movies go wrong, but there was also reports that Trank was erratic on set. I tend not to believe these things and then he posted on Twitter days before the release.\n\n\"A year ago I had a fantastic version of this. And it would've received great reviews. You'll probably never see it. That's reality though.\"\n\nHow did a movie with a budget like this one get so far into filming that the studio was blindsided by how dark the film was? How could a movie be that close to release and not have an ending decided on or filmed? How bad was the movie before Avatar editor Stephen E. Rivkin was hired to fix it in post with Trank referring to him as the director of the new cut? Were comic book fans so angry that Johnny Storm was black that they made death threats and Trank had to sleep with a gun under his pillow?\n\nLook, I haven't made a big budget Hollywood movie, but I have some theories.\n\nIndulge me.\n\nThe biggest problem is that we've already seen the origin of the Fantastic Four. We want to see them in action, we want to see the drama between Dr. Doom (Tony Kebbell) and Reed Richards (Miles Teller), we want to see the Human Torch (Michael B. Jordan) and the Thing (Jamie Bell) pick at each other, we want to see Sue Storm (Kate Mara) prove that she's the real heart of the team.\n\nThe original origin of the FF doesn't make sense today, with them needing to go into space before Russia, but that's an easy fix. And as pushed out of the spotlight as Sue was in the 1960s comics, she's not even on their first flight. Doom is. She gets called in at the last minute.\n\nIn fact, the movie is an hour and twenty minutes past when the conflict between Doom and the heroes kicks off. Until then, we see Reed, Doom and Johnny get drunk and petulant after learning that they won't be the ones going into the Negative Zone \u2014 never referred to as such \u2014 so they take the trip without telling anyone and chaos (and powers) ensue.\n\nNot really the stuff of heroes.\n\nYou know when a movie is bad? When Marvel kills off its actors \u2014 except Michael B. Jordan, who redeemed himself by playing Erik Killmonger in Black Panther \u2014 in a comic.\n\nYou can't really blame Kate Mara. She wanted to read the comics to prepare and Trank explained to the cast that it was unnecessary as the film was an original story not based directly on the comics. Well, at least she met Jamie Bell on set and they got married. She was also allegedly bullied by the director on set, which isn't as bad as getting into a fistfight with him, as Miles Teller discovered.\n\nIt's sad because this movie had every chance to succeed. I still can't fathom how a script isn't locked down on projects with this much money and so much on the line. But hey \u2014 I just write about movies. I don't write movies.",

The Fantastic Four, along with a ton of other Marvel charaters, were drastically changed in the Ultimate comics, such as a different, more complex origin, which takes the movie what feels like an hour to complete. The movie also applies this dark, realistic tone that just doesn't fit the Fantastic Four.

It should start with the fantastic four being bad ass, do brief visual flashbacks or short dialogue to explain who they are, then go back to action/plot etc and use flashbacks to show bits of how they used to be. Otherwise it is like reading fantastic four comic #1 over and over for 90 minutes. The pros of the movie are its cast are strong, they make a decent representation of a young F4, I actually liked Doom once he went full homicidal maniac it was a good costume acting job etc.  The final fight ends too simply. Ben was pretty good too. needed better writing and story structure + ending. It is watchable unless you only like watching movies you love, I am ok with average",

The F4 we have here get their powers from their own stupidity, as well. And the final battle is five minutes long? FIVE MINUTES?! Is that all they could do after all that buildup? And is that why the movie's only 100 minutes long? I'll let you guess if that's true, but my other problems with the film are still there.

            "content": "The problem with this film is the fact that he tried to establish itself completely distinctive from the previous two films. I think that's where it fails. It's overkill at best because not only is the cast chosen against type, but it's done so in all the wrong ways possible. I'm not saying that the decision to have an interracial family regarding Sue and Johnny was wrong and not contemporary. But things really go wrong with the casting choices and characterization of both been Grimm and Victor Von Doom. It starts out solid based upon the beginning of Brian Michael Bendis's first issue of ultimate fantastic four, showing Reed and Ben in their childhood. Hell, there's even an allusion to what will become the Fantasticar in the first scene. You see these two kids who are outcasts right off the bat; Richards is the boy genius whose parents don't understand him, and Ben is the younger brother living in his family's scrapyard and picked on by his older brother Daniel. But then you cut to the high school scene and it's Billy Elliot as Ben Grimm. This guy is supposed to be Reed's protector and best friend and you don't get that vibe. The kid is athletic, but those scenes are cut and you only see his background in the trailers. Plus Ben has a very deep tragic background; his brother was killed in a gang war. It could've gone into that, the desire to get strength back and be tough because you have to be tough to survive. Ultimately these character traits almost influence his mutation later on in the film. Then of course there is Victor, whose background is again fucked up beyond any recognition at all. He is supposed to be European and yet they make him again American and this time a recluse. The foundation does not hold up after his transformation which again takes reference from a poor choice that WASNT Bendis's call which was organic armor. There is nothing wrong with Michael B Jordan's portrayal of Johnny; he only service from the bad script. The fast and furious angle works, but there is zero familiarity beyond that. Johnny is immature and the fact that he tries too hard and gets upset too easily. And he does so because he knows either his sister or his dad will bail him out of trouble. And let's not get started on the CGI thing. Put some fucking pants on him for god sake. He looks good, but the fact that you keep him naked throughout the entire film separates him even more so from humanity and that's a mistake. The reshoots are evident through the different tones of blonde for Kate Mara's hair. The comic worked because the first bad guy they go up against is the mole man who starts out as a professor. This fails because, as mentioned by a previous reviewer on YouTube, it becomes a body horror tale. It rushes the plot too quickly and the climax does not hold up. The team has no chemistry whatsoever. There is no chance to bond after the transformation, and the subplots get buried. This is a horrible misfire that could've been great if the writers and the Director were both not interfered with by the studio and had taken the time to develop it further.",

Origins still hurts me more than this one did and that\u2019s coming from a diehard comic book fan.. I also don\u2019t think this is as bad as some other comic book movies that have come out before. I think the cast was amazing here and it\u2019s a shame because they really could have pulled off something great. I feel like after the origin, when there is a time jump, at that point the movie just felt forced and was a completely different tone shift than what the first half was setting up. Essentially it was a setup with no payoff... I think they did a very bad job with Dr. Doom, nothing against Toby\u2019s performance but just in general Dr. Doom is one of the best marvel villains to ever exist and they made him look like a freaking robotic crash test dummy... I think in terms of the origin they did a rlly good job, other than the fact that Sue got her powers without even going to space smh... but I actually somewhat enjoyed the first half of the movie and enjoyed the star studded cast well enough to tolerate the second half of the film as much as I possibly could\u2019ve, given how painful it was. I feel like Josh Trank had a vision and that vision was seen before the movie had a time jump, everything before it was good for me, but I feel like after the time jump it felt like another example of forced studio interference... it was almost like Fox was saying you better keep this at a 1hr 40min runtime at all costs... this movie would\u2019ve been better off with a runtime 30-35 min longer so that these characters could have had a proper setup and execution and I truly believe if that happened we\u2019d have a better movie and not a film that was only subpar and half well done. Now this isn\u2019t the worst superhero movie, but it\u2019s definitely a missed opportunity especially when it had the elements to be good. It just felt like Fox threw its own script off a cliff and rushed it. Michael B Jordan and Miles Teller are unbelievably amazing actors and I honestly wish the studio didn\u2019t interfere and that the movie was good FOR THEM as well as the marvel comic book fanbase which I\u2019ve been a loyal member of since I was 5. Overall this movie was decent enough to keep me alright up until it became a dumpster fire after the unwanted and ridiculously forced time jump... the final battle was terrible and parts of the dialogue were super super cringe... it was just hard for me to accept how the movie shot itself in the foot and just crumpled because the first half of the movie layed a groundwork for a potentially better finished product! Thanks for interfering Fox... (2.5/5)",

            "content": "If film history of the past 25 years is any indication, there doesn't seem to be a successful way of making a Fantastic Four movie. The low-budget one from 1994 isn't worthwhile beyond being unintentionally funny, and the hokeyness level of the two Chris Evans and Jessica Alba ones makes them not much better. Try to approach it as a weird science movie with body horror elements reminiscent of David Cronenberg's classic films, and the studio will panic and ruin everything by ordering reshoots so it can be closer to a Marvel movie, then dump it into theaters while everyone watches it flop horribly. The filmmakers behind this latest entry went for that wholly different approach that, while perhaps seeming valiant and provocative in theory, falls totally flat for a Fantastic Four movie.\n\nDespite director Josh Trank's apparently obnoxious behavior during the making of it (showing up to work drunk, trashing his living space, and hiding in a tent during shooting), I actually feel a bit sorry for him. Trank, known for his great found footage sci-fi movie Chronicle, seemed to want to do a fresh spin on the F4, but just chose the wrong subject matter to focus his ideas and fell victim to the studios that ruined it. What resulted isn't a complete failure, but it also doesn't work as a finished movie or seem to be aimed at any audience in particular either.\n\nThere are no Avengers style heroics or light-hearted banter to be found, instead wallowing in a dull slog and never even getting going with a plot by the time the climax rolls around. The protagonists don't get their superpowers until the halfway point after numerous scenes of disposable dialogue and hardly any character development to be found. There're some weird sequences of the characters escaping captivity after their transformations, along with Dr. Doom's return, that all evoke the dark horror elements from The Fly and Videodrome that Trank was going for. These are the most interesting parts, along with the scenes at the otherworldly planet where they get their powers. The climax when the Fantastic Four finally come together to fight Dr. Doom and let their abilities loose lasts only about seven minutes, and feels obligatory more than anything else.\n\nWhile focusing on the mutations of the characters is more appropriate in a realistic tone than them going out and saving people like Superman, the F4 not interacting with anyone outside the science lab makes the movie feel isolated and small. The strange body mutations that happen and the scary, unknown feeling that would give one in that situation evokes Cronengerg as opposed to a fun comic book movie. With a completely different plot that had nothing to do with the Fantastic Four, these elements could have been interesting, but the context they're in largely deflates the impact.\n\nThis movie is too dark and boring for children, doesn't have enough of a story or ideas to engage adults, and is not consistently scary enough for horror fans. The visual style and special effects are effective, but none of it is in service to anything worthwhile. With four attempts now at making a Fantastic Four movie, none of them succeed despite each one being notably different from each other. With the rights now being in the hands of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we shall see if they're able to salvage the Fantastic Four in the future. Until then, stick with Cronenberg's movies for body horror and The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy for fun comic book team-up movies.",

However, this movie describing the origins of the team, which includes Mr. Fantastic (Miles Teller), Invisible Girl (Kate Mara), Human Torch (Michael B. Jordan) and Thing (Jamie Bell), and their plot to defeat the evil Dr. Doom (Toby Kebell) had been critically thrashed, warranting a 5% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Well, after seeing this, part of me can see why, but on the other hand, on the other perspective, it's not exactly worthy of a low rating. The story splits into two segments: Reed Richards building the dimensional transporter and the four superheroes fighting Von Doom. Although the story takes itself way too seriously, most of the movie is shot in the dark, and the most of the action happens in the background, Josh Trank's Fantastic Four is competent on visual effects, the musical score by Marco Beltrami and Philip Glass, and the performances by Teller, Mara, Jordan and Bell. Most of the faults in the movie come from producer and co-writer Simon Kinberg, who wanted to capitalize on the success on The Avengers and X-Men and make a realistic version of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee's story. His obsession with dimming the lights and desaturating every scene makes a chuck of the movie unwatchable and drab. On top of everything else, Trank tweeted that he wanted to be faithful to the source material except with a body count, resulting in a drastic tug of war game between him and Marvel. Despite the messy storyline and blatant studio intervention, Fantastic Four wasn't a good movie, but I'm glad I saw it. (2 \u00bd Black Hole Sky Portals out of 5)",

They even took Ben's mechanic abilities away.\n\nThey also dehumanize Doom, completing changing who he is, his powers, his motivations, and even his classic look: which cosplayers have shown works in real life, they just had to tweak it.\n\nI'll maintain, pre-disney, there hasn't been a good F4 movie.

Miles Teller is painfully awkward and not in an endearing way and the only intense thing in this film is how pathetic his facial hair is - those face pubes should never been allowed to happen, let alone be filmed. They are all written and act like a bunch of whining tweens. Which they seem too old for and isn't great entertainment. There's also barely a story and Dr. Doom - the group's big nemesis is vanquished so quickly I didn't think that could possibly be it. The visual effects are decent and Michael B. Jordan is the only one seeming to have any fun (in a superhero popcorn flick...) and he's way better off in Black Panther - even if that didn't turn out so well for his character.

In fact, I actually quite liked it!\nchronicle is one of my favorite superhero flicks ever, the gritty style that trank did with it was so unique at the time and he doesn't stray too far from it here. From the get go it's a very serious and dark film with most of it either taking place in labs or on Planet Zero. This is where most of the criticism takes shape where people argued they didn't get their powers into an hour in but I found the development refreshing, nowadays we are so used to seeing the heroes become their counterparts so quickly we skim over some pretty good material. Seeing Reed and Ben form their friendship in the beginning was great, Sue and him occasionally flirting: hinting at their future relationship. As for Michael B. Jordon I found him to be a great Johnny Storm! Doom of course is in it but barely but when he shows up towards the end man is it awesome, you can tell there Trank was going for something different and the studio clearly didn't support his original vision. I'm sure somewhere on the cutting room floor is a really great film but for the one we got I found it be a compelling small scaled origin story.

Shoddy screenplay coupled with poor character writing makes this one of the worst movies of all time. Dr. Doom is an egotistical tyrant who views himself as beyond everyone and the film depicts the exact opposite. Michael B. Jordan does the best with what he has been given and even that is atrocious. There have been many stabs at a successful spider-man movie and it has been done with Tom Holland and the Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 but apparently Hollywood has trouble with Fantastic 4. Kate Mara also does the same as Jordan but none of these arcs even makes sense as portrayed in film. Doom's motivations seem really stupid as he is trying to get back to the world where they accidentally found their powers and it is a complete backward approach for his character. Overall, really terrible can't even believe that the pitch for this film made it passed the studio executives.    ",

Doctor doom's motivations remain unclear other than that he is tired of Earth and wants to create a new world. The way he looks is a comedy and in the comic Dr. Doom is one of the toughest, arrogant, narcissistic villains and this one simply wants to destroy Earth because he is \"tired\" of it.

            "content": "Fant4stic is an absolute train wreck of a movie. The first half contains some good performances, notably by Michael B Jordan, and some well developed characters, even if it feels dull due to the lack of chemistry. I thought Michael B Jordan done a great job as Human Torch even if he doesn't even use his powers that much. But I actually thought the movie was pretty decent up until the point when they get their powers. And strangely enough, this is supposed to be the turning point of an origin story. When the protagonist (or protagonists) gets their powers it is too be expected that there will be big, explosive and intense action scenes that will ultimately make the film more entertaining. But funnily enough, Fant4stic's script only with holds one action scene, but is horribly contrived by clich\u00c3 (C)s and a really bad villain. From the trailers, this fight looked like it would be a dangerous and emotional confrontation, due to the footage shown in the trailers, but it wasn't! So Fant4stic is the first, and probably only, superhero origin movie where once the heroes suit up, the picture falls into an abyss. \n\nTo be honest, I was actually fairly excited for this film because the trailers looked absolutely amazing but the one clip that got me pumped was the final big action scene that was shown in almost every single trailer and TV spot. The mini clip involves Ben Grimm (more commonly known as the Thing) dropping from an airplane and landing right on a Humvee and destroying it; it conveyed that he's an indestructible rock man and that he is totally unfazed and the clip ended with an extremely badass hero shot, which shows Ben walking towards the camera whilst he is being shot at, however all the bullets bounce off his rocky facade. I loved the design of him, the rock textures looked great and the CGi model looked like how I always envisioned his character to appear like on the big screen. I waited in anticipation throughout the entire runtime for this one action scene to come on, for it too blow everyone away and to level up with Marvel's current standards. But, this sequence wasn't included in the film. In fact, the only action sequence in the film is the boring and anticlimactic final fight which sucks every emotion out of it because these character aren't developed as superheroes because the movie skips through it all. When they get their powers the movie jumps ahead a whole year, where snippets of action segments are only merely seen on TV's, which are being watched by politicians. By the way, there is one character (played by Tim Blake Nelson) who, annoyingly, chews gum in every scene he is featured in for literally no reason, it is cringe worthily dumb. Also, we never see them fully use their powers and the movie never express interest in showing us them. The Four are never utilized as a team before the climax and we never see them use their powers together because for most of the film, between the aftermath of the accident and the climax, there are just uninteresting conversations in dark rooms. \n\nDid I mention the costume design is extremely bland and Von Doom's make up is laughable bad, Mr Freeze and the Batman suit from Batman and Robin looks masterful when compared to this. The villain is just atrocious in this movie, his arc is extremely messy and he can somehow graphically blow someone's head of. There are scenes with Victor where he is walking down a corridor and he is randomly blowing people's brains out, however, I kind of expected it as the whole movie has a seriously dark tone. And there is not really much else to say except this movie could of been brilliant but wasn't. The CGi is mostly laughable, the villain is disposable and the stakes and violence feel more nonexistent than the chemistry between these characters. I wanted a Fantastic Four movie that included unbelievable action sequences, a great plot and visuals and, from the trailers, it looked like we would get that - even director Josh Trank's vision was to make a brilliant Fantastic Four and this guy can clearly show that he is a great filmmaker. It isn't Josh's fault that this movie is bad, his version would of been great but it's disappointing that the studio cut in. Overall, and unfortunately, we are left with a disastrous movie that crumbles as it progresses, that just wants to make a seriously dark Fantastic Four feature instead of a joyous and enjoyable new superhero blockbuster, but, at best, the film has a few redeeming qualities within the first act and Michael B Jordan's performance isn't half bad but c'mon, B Jordan is one of the best actors working today. Fant4stic isn't the worst comic book movie: Hulk 2003 still holds that record.",

Jordan was an amazing Human Torch. As you know it may not be a comic book like but does that matter that much. Also, it helps to show that Johnny and Susan are not apart of the same biological family. In the old one, it was harder to get that across. As well as loving this one's Human Torch, I also love The Thing. I prefer this character to the old version since its more comic book accurate, more stronger, and his rock texture is super cool. The CGI way is the way to go. I didn't like Kate Mara who played Invisible Girl. I believe she has great acting skills and she had a great opportunity to show it in this film as she goes through Inhuman changes but she doesn't. She says, \"I refuse to see this film, it's terrible.\". Terrible is a big word for this film. But I won't lie, it's no cinematic masterpiece. Luckily for her, the special effects made up for her effortless acting. Now onto - unfortunately - this Fantastic Fours' Mr. Fantastic is very, very bad. The way he projected his words was great but everything else about him is trash. His facial expressions are bad, his special effects aren't up to standards for 2015, and the actor (Miles Teller) looks way to young for the role.\n\nIn this film they show flashbacks of Mr. Fantastic and The Thing as they build the portal for which were they got their abilities from. Miles Teller plays 16 years old him from the flashbacks, which is fine when you add some makeup or some sort of special effect usage. But they didn't make him look the same age in the present. I just didn't like the young Mr. Fantastic. The film wasn't stretched but the timeline was. This film seemed to take place over years and years. Also, there are many plot holes. Stan Lee didn't have a cameo in here. So that sucked. I believe they could of have done better with Doctor Doom abilities because he's quite overpowered. It seemed easy for him to win in seconds. I would not recommend this. I would age this 12 for gore, bad language, and violence.\n\nGrade: B",

The story they added about sue storm being adopted into a black family, was actually a very good story that wasn't in the comics. What I didn't like about Sue Storm's character is that she had to listen to music on her earphones so she was able to work, WHY!!! The Doctor Doom that we received was horrid because is costume design was terrible, his death was one of the worst things that i've seen in a movie, and he also went way over the top because he started to blow up people's head. I didn't think that Jamie Bell was bad as the thing and the CGI they used for him was better than the 2005 version of Fantastic Four.\n\nI found the subplot about Reed Richards going on the run really stupid and it also wasn't comic book accurate.

The movie didn't even get Doctor Doom's real name right. In this movie his real name is Victor Domashev. His name is supposed to be Victor Von Doom, not Victor Domashev! Von Doom is Doctor Doom's last name in the comics. This was the worst live-action version of Doctor Doom, even worse than all of his other live-action incarnations. Toby Kebbell was miscast as Doctor Doom. Doctor Doom was nothing like the real Doctor Doom from the comic books. The CGI is awful. The runtime is too short. The plot makes no sense. The tone is all wrong for this movie. A Fantastic Four film should always be fun, light, bright, colorful, cheerful, and humorous, This movie was the EXACT OPPOSITE of that. Fant4stic was boring, dull, lifeless, joyless, humorless, dark, and gritty. The reshoots were painfully obvious in the editing of this film. The casting is horrible. The four lead actors were all severely miscast in their titular roles. This movie sucks on so many levels. I hope someday Marvel Studios reboots the Fantastic Four so we can get a legit Fantastic Four film for once.\n\nRating: 0.9/10",

The story charts dangerous territory from the beginning by messing with a famed and popular origin story, though presenting itself well enough, but even where it was good it somehow contrived to be bad; failing to properly develop all of the characters, stereotyping to save time on explanations, and then inexplicably forcing them into life changing situations only to see them react in ways we don't quite understand given the lack of depth and background provided - not to mention the mad rush to end the film as they seemingly ran out of money. This really was a diabolical attempt at filmmaking, eschewing the necessary aspects required to form a blockbuster. For whatever @marvel 's failings have been with Disney restraining many of the films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to fit their PG-13 covenant, they cannot be faulted for storytelling, character development, representation of source material, and fun factor. Fantastic Four had none of this. A dismal turn, for the third time, surely @marvel has all the ammunition they need to negotiate the title back to their Marvel/Disney coalition and away from Fox. The film simply attempted to do so many good things and failed at nearly all of them, rounding up as many plot lines as possible in too short a time, whilst leaving others dangling but without the proverbial cliffhanger. Poor from, and far from \"fantastic\".",

Jordan (Johnny Storm/Human Torch), Kate Mara (Sue Storm/Invisible Woman), and Miles Teller (Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic) are all great. They aren't at their best here, but they do give a decent effort. \n\nWeaknesses: Literally everything else. The screenplay is abysmal, giving almost no depth to any of these characters and being so dreary it was nothing like the fun source material. The special effects are almost as bad. Everything looks cheesy and fake. Toby Kebbell (Victor Von Doom/Dr. Doom) was way over the top with his acting and \"menacing\" stuff. He tried too hard. Like the 2005 Fantastic Four movie, this took way too long to get going. It's nearly an hour before they're even in the alternate world, meaning there's little time for action. And that would be okay if the stuff before they got their powers was even remotely interesting. Instead, it's just dull. It's as if the people behind this had never paid attention to anything Fantastic Four related, because this was missing everything that made that work.\n\nOverall: I thought there was no way this would be worse than the first two Fantastic Four films. The cast was too good for that. Yet, they managed to do it. The production issues are evident as this movie is a total mess. A giant waste of potential.",

Blame for this lies with the writers who fail to create a storyline or characters that allow the audience to care about what is happening on-screen.

            "content": "Ripping the latest Fantastic Four reboot seems to be the sport du jour. While the news about the impending negativity this movie would spark has been circling the media for nearly a year, my inherent fandom of comics in general made this a necessary film for me to see. While not a huge fan of the previous two movies (I've never seen the bootleg from the early 90s), generally speaking, Fantastic Four is a difficult story to interestingly bring to the screen. It's very cosmic in nature, has a long history of some very strange villains and story lines, and can be kind of boring. In the 2005 initial outing, the good things included a very good origin story, representation of Ben Grimm as a pilot and a perfect Johnny Storm. However, Dr. Doom was horrible. Not representative of the comic version at all. Jessica Alba's ethnicity came across strangely as a blonde woman. And, while looking like the very early 60's Thing, the orange suit was...just bad. The second movie, centering around Silver Surfer was a much better representation of the comics, in spite of the weird Galactus. The stories overall were very weak and too goofy. When I heard they were going to reboot it, I was ok with it, for the recasting of Dr. Doom alone. Fast forward to the introduction of Josh Trank as the director. Someone who had done ONE film. Yes, it was a decent film, but given that he was handed the keys to the FF reboot AND a Star Wars film, I was confused. So...fast forward again to nearly a year ago when word came out that the movie was in trouble. Josh was acting erratic. He had destroyed the house he was staying in while shooting in Louisiana. Fox secretly told Disney that Josh would be a bad idea to keep on staff for the Star Wars movie. Then suddenly, Josh was off the Star Wars film while rumors were abound that he had abandoned the final steps in FF post-production. The studio had come in and held reshoots and was completely in control of editing. So much bad press that nearly no one was looking forward to this movie coming out. Marvel was grinning like a cheshire cat wanting to get the rights to making FF back in the House of the Mouse. Then word came that an embargo was being put on all screenings and release of critical reviews until 2 days prior to opening day, always the kiss of death to a film. Then...3 days ago, the embargo broke and the messages were loud and clear. This movie was horrendous. I still planned on seeing the movie, but after Sony destroyed anything interesting about Ghost Rider...twice...I wasn't feeling good. Expectations were in the toilet. So, this morning, as I'm making my way through the surprisingly short (one hour, forty minutes) reboot, I was pleasantly surprised. The acting, even from the kids at the beginning, was very strong. The characters were coming together well. While the origin was different and the inclusion of Franklin Storm, Sr. and a mixed-race Storm clan was...well, unnecessary, it worked. I was buying it. Then they got their powers. From this point forward, it's like a completely different director and/or editor ran the film. There was essentially only ONE action scene. The end. And it lasted mere minutes. Without spoiling what led up to that one action scene, I will simply say that Doom was introduced. A very good Dr. Doom. Character and actor-wise, I very much like this flavor of Fantastic Four. And the tweaked origin introduces the potential for much more cosmic inclusion. The potential is exciting to this comic fanboy. The problem is, from the point where they go their powers, which was on a planet that required CGI and special effects, I was confused as to where the budget went. The effects were some of the worst I've ever seen. Just awful. So many story points were shortened, sped up and left to the viewers interpretation and assumption. Weird considering how well-paced the story had been until this point and how well-developed the characters had been. For the final 40 minutes, character development evaporated. The effects were horrible. There was no story. Just...scenes. Leading up to a very short and shallow action scene. Then...it just ended. A short, quick wrap-up, not to mention dumb, especially considering how strong the film had been the first hour. I simply couldn't understand why the film shifted tone and pace so quickly. As a result, I couldn't give it more than 2 stars. I believe Fox should give the rights back to Marvel or, at the very least, allow this film to have a sequel with a PROVEN director.",

It does feel refreshing not to suffer from the same juvenile MCU Disney humour recent superheroes have been afflicted with though, with once scene during Doctor Doom's battle having me expect a one-liner, which didn't come to fruition. It is however ironic one of the few comicbook characters that eschew this could have gotten away with using it. \nAs I say, I like the more real world feel of this one, although that's probably my personal taste coming into play there. Fant4stic Is not a terrible film, if nothing else it kept my attention and fairly invested in the movie.

The main heroes are solid and likeable, I really enjoyed the main villian, and the story is a pretty decent retelling of the origin of the fantastic four. I really do not get how this movie is superman 4 or batman and robin levels of bad. Yeah, it isn't perfect. The bonding between the members of the fantastic four does feel somewhat rushed, and while I think the action sequences are pretty good, there not very many of them, and considering this is a superhero movie, thats a bit odd. But these points are not enough to drag the film down to this degree, at least in my opinion. Its not for everyone, I'll say that much. But its still far from as terrible as most people are saying it is. So when you have the time, give it watch, and see what you think.",

No really love the updated more realistic story, the development of their powers, sue and jonny..yeah no problem liked Michael b Jordan almost as much as i liked him as kill monger (black panther) sue is exactly what she needed to be, reed and Ben's relationship is great including ben hunting him down etc love how reed and sue didn't have the soppy romantic coconnection, the world getting sucked into another.. great. Even Victor...the only thing about him is he seems like more of a earth bender from avatar the dr doom but hey whatever still i good fight just wish it lasted longer, but all in all it was really good would love see a 2nd or it to join the mcu if that put a stark poster display cabinet with the other science articles at the school but i know that can't happen now because of Michael but yeah don't know why everyone complained about it \"too much computer scrrens\" \"jonny and sue being different skin colours\" oh and that \"they're a lesser marvel team\"? Like what i knew fantastic 4 and X-Men were the only 2 teams i knew when i was younger back when iron man, thor, spider man, cap, hulk etc were all doing their own sole things.  and everything else they have a problem with, and....and its not all bright like the first 2, and the naming of the team was a great ending wish it had a post or mid credit scene but i really loved it, sum it up it may not be the best marvel movie but it is far far from the worst.",

One of my biggest problems with all of the Fantastic 4 movies is the fact that they have messed up one of Marvel's biggest and best villains in the comics every time, this time it was the worst. This movie honestly should have been the start of a new era of superhero movies but it was just disappointing. If you are a Marvel fan, a Fantastic 4 fan, a comic book fan, comic book movie fan, or hell just a film fan don't even waist your time with this film.

            "content": "Yikes.\n \nThis is one royal mess of a film.  The problems have been well-documented since its release, with director Josh Trank blaming changes made by the studio.  However, my guess is it runs deeper than that as this one seems to be flawed on a basic story level.  Simply put, \"Fantastic Four\" is one of the least enjoyable comic book movies I've ever seen.  It's not even remotely fun, and I suspect that this was (at least party) by design.\n \nTo me, this comes off as another attempt to add a real-world dose of grit to characters in which this shouldn't be applied.  There's something that's just kind of inherently silly about the Fantastic Four, and I'm just not sure how seriously we're supposed to take a story in which one character becomes a human rubber band.  I haven't seen the previous \"Fantastic Four\" films directed by Tim Story, but from what I understand, for all their flaws, they at least understood that.  There's a goofy sense of comic book-inspired fun underlying the proceedings.\n \nWith this reboot, I'm not even entirely certain the filmmakers set out to make a comic book film at all; it has more of a dark, sci-fi vibe to it, which isn't a bad thing in and of itself.  But if you're going to participate in a bit of genre mashing, you better know what you're doing.  There's not even a perfunctory explanation as to how Reed Richards (Miles Teller), Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell), Sue Storm (Kate Mara), and her brother, Johnny (Michael B. Jordan) acquired their special powers.  They just briefly travel into a dank, ugly dimension and something comes out of the ground there and that's it.  And I have absolutely no idea what happens in the climax, when the four of them square off against Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbel).\n \nPlease understand, I'm not looking for real-life science accuracy here, or even pseudo-accuracy.  You might recall how I similarly wasn't quite certain as to what was going on during the climax of \"Thor: The Dark World\" either.  But in that movie, it didn't bother me because at least it was crazy and entertaining, and the rest of the movie had been fun leading up to that too.\n \nBut in \"Fantastic Four,\" there's no sense of fun whatsoever.  The four \"heroes\" barely even use their superpowers.  They don't fight bad guys, they don't save innocent civilians, and the only time they even get to work as a unit is in their final confrontation with Doom.  They spend more time under observation in a laboratory than they do out in the world doing superhero stuff.  You can try and explain this away as its an origin story and therefore they had to get expository stuff out of the way first, but I'll still call bullshit as any other origin story will still feature the hero learning to use his/her powers by stopping evildoers.  I didn't turn on a movie entitled \"Fantastic Four\" to watch four super-powered people not do fantastic things.\n \nSo we then roll back around to my earlier thought, which is that this isn't supposed to be a superhero movie.  Fine.  Maybe it's not.  But it's still poorly written, no matter what genre it's supposed to be.  There's the problems I mentioned earlier regarding the movie barely touching on some of its science.  But it goes deeper than that.  After they receive their powers, a rift develops between Richards and Grimm, with the latter holding the former responsible for what happened to them.  This rift is never resolved, and by the end of the movie, suddenly it seems like they're cool again.  What exactly happened there?\n \nRemember how, after the lukewarm reception to \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2,\" Sony decided to essentially share the character with Marvel Studios in the hopes of bringing him back to his former glory?  I think that's something that 20th Century Fox should consider with the Fantastic Four.  One thing I'm confident of: there's no way in hell Marvel would muck up one of their properties in this way.  This \"Fantastic Four\" might as well be a DC film, in both tone and quality.  Very, very non-fantastic.",

The scenes with the actors are cold, and lifeless. Everything has a serious tone and almost feels completely robotic even when the scene seems to call for some semblance of emotion. Possibly the worst transgression made by the films creators is taking what should be one of the films bright spots, it's villain, Dr. Doom and turning him to some sort of extra-dimensional eco-terrorist with a school yard crush. Even the designs for the costumes and make up/cgi effects are listless. If this is the best the creators of this film can do with a large budget perhaps it's time to seek a new line of work.",

            "content": "When I first laid eyes on the trailer for the upcoming Fantastic Four movie, I remember loving it, going for a style and tone that is similar to Interstellar. From the initial trailer, it looked like the stakes would be high, and there would be finally a good Fantastic Four film, after three failures. I also remember the dreadful complaints from fanboys about the trailer and their claims that \"the movie is going to suck!\" Most of the complaints were of the casting of Michael B. Jordan, a black man, as Johnny Storm aka Human Torch, and how this is not a movie from Marvel Studios. My reaction was strong disagreement, as we should be used to characters being portrayed by actors of different color (it is not big deal) and Marvel Studios is not the only production studio capable of making a good superhero movie. I sincerely hoped, and thought that Fantastic Four would be good, proving fans wrong. Not being a fan of Fantastic Four, I hoped that the movie would be good enough that it would get me interested in superhero group and show why I should like them. I especially had confidence because it would be directed by Josh Trank, who directed Chronicle, one of my favorite films of all time for its beautiful use of \"found footage\" and an unique character driven story that instead of the usual \"where did the powers come from?\"\n\nWhy am I going into how hyped I was for this movie instead of diving right into the review? I wanted to express my great disappointment on how this movie flopped after the great deal of promise it showed. So, what made Fantastic Four the worst reviewed Marvel film of all time? What did Fantastic Four do to have the claim to fame for being worse than Howard the Duck? To summarize the main issue of this film in one statement is difficult, but it would probably be something like that the movie lacked any attachment and cared little for the characters nor the events happening in the world that its trying to establish.\n\nWhen I describe the lack of attachment and not caring a bit about development, I mean is that film presents itself as this contemporary take on a classic team of superheroes that shows the trials they go through (similar to Christopher Nolan's take in The Dark Knight trilogy), yet there is little stakes shown because all we are shown is secret labs and there is little depth in the relationships between characters. For example, when the five main characters are exposed to the radiation that gave them their powers, Reid runs away from the military base that was holding him and the other Fantastic Four members. In running away, he abandoned his friend, Ben, aka The Thing. There is little to know actual consequences for the abandonment. Ben is angry, but there is nothing the Reid does to redeem himself. At the end, he takes charge when Doom is attacking the planet, but it felt so rushed, so phony. There was no development that led Reid to summoning any kind of courage, nor to prove that he was a loyal team member. Other plot points such as the exaggeration of military that make them look like villains by weaponizing the three super-powered people who remained at the base without any questioning in the story nor consequences or the lack of interaction among the teammates left me feel detached, not really caring for anyone nor anything that is at stake in the story. Yet, with all of the detachment, the film has the nerve to act like that the characters are now a united team that overcame its problems.\n\nTo compensate for the lack of investment in development and chemistry, the film uses empty cliches to cue us when there is a supposed development. For example, in the final battle, Ben tells Reid that \"this is what I do\", referring Ben's battling enemies with his brute strength. The line was supposed to signify his acceptance of his new life and how things will never be the same. The issue is that there is no build up. \"This is what I do\" is said randomly, came off as out-of-place. A scene or two before, Ben is still upset at Reid. The film never explores the implications of his changed body and how he is forced to work for the military. Another example is the mentioned instance of Reid \"taking charge\". It's cliche, or least usually used as an effective trope, to cue the audience that the journey to leadership is complete. Films like Guardians of the Galaxy use this trope effectively as the film shows that Peter Quill does truly care for the galaxy, and that someone needs to take leadership because he witnesses his team not getting along. When Quill, aka Starlord, takes the reins, the scene holds weight. When Reid did it here, it was a worthless cliche.\n\nOther complaints that I have are the one that most reviewers addressed. The effects at times were horrendous. At times, the effects looked like they were from Spy Kids 3-D from 2004, which had effects equivalent to the Nintendo 64, a console made 19 years before the Fantastic Four reboot. Obviously the lack of action is a problem, especially when this is a superhero movie. The other complaint is there is little showing of the world around the Fantastic Four. When Doom is destroying it, I wonder why should we care. We never saw it all. We were confined to the labs the entire time.\n\nThe actors in general were fine. I believe that issues fell with the horrid writing as I just talked about, the lack of good direction. It appears that one or so takes were done, and not enough time was put into perfecting the delivery of each line. As a result, the dialogue is awkward to watch. Many complain about Toby Kebbell's portrayal as Dr. Doom, but again, I liked his voice. Cliches like Dr. Doom randomly saying he's \"doom\" are the problem. Bad writing, once again, is the main issue. The film shows no good reason why he became a villain. In my opinion, Kebbell had little to work with. One other positive aspect of the film I found is the deign for The Thing. I liked the natural look of actual rocks instead of the fake costume of the 2005 movie.\n\nI give the 2015 Fantastic Four movie a not fantastic F. Most say the film failed because it tried to be dark, but it came off as depressing, and I disagree. In a previous article, a good movie does not come from focusing on the tone, but on crafting a cohesive story. Fantastic Four obviously botched at creating any kind of story. I can see a good Fantastic Four movie being dark. I'm interested in seeing a new take, but a successful take should rely on tropes of dark movie. A successful movie should show major stakes, and the heroes taking on those stakes, with a plot that makes us care about the heroes. Like most fans, I hope Marvel Studios gets the rights back and does Fantastic Four justice. I hope I can see a great FF team along with the other great heroes of Marvel. It's a shame to see such potential wasted.",

With logic being thrown out the window in the first 30 min of the film, while it's trying to be a more \"realistic\" version of the fantastic 4, it fails miserably. Honestly the first films were better than this one. The acting is awful. The characters are unlikable one-dimensional idiots, although I do not blame the actors for this as I like them all, but the writing was so awful that I think nobody could've portrayed the characters correctly.  A villain whose motivation makes some sense, in the end he's just another villain who wants to destroy the world. This doesn't even work as a superhero movie, because they're only 2 fight scenes in this movie, one in the middle which lasts 30 seconds, and one at the end between the main characters and the main villain which lasts a minute. This movie proved to me that either A) the fantastic 4 are just shitty characters, that's why their movie sucks or B) Fox is so incompetent that they can't make a single good movie with these characters after trying three times.",

But it was sadly a huge mistake. The saddest part is that when I first saw this film in theaters 2 years ago, I kept trying to force myself to find ways to make Fantasic Four actually a good movie but upon watching it a second time a few weeks later, I came to the conclusion that this film is just completely terrible. So terrible in fact that even the stars of the film don't stand behind it anymore. I never plan to watch this movie again unless it's for the purpose of a \"Bad Movie Day\". Fantastic Four is a disappointment of a film, and I'm actually more relieved than anything that Fox was smart enough to cancel the two or three sequels they had planned. Seeing as it was solely 20th Century Fox's fault that this film became such a disaster, all I have to say is... Look what you did to such a potentially great movie Fox, you turned it into the equivalent of getting kicked in the testicles with a steel toed boot.

However it seems that the studio decided after 90 or 100 % of the way through filming, that they actually wanted to make this film to be like Avengers Assemble and nothing like Chronicle. There are lots of good Josh Trank scenes left behind, they just don't fit together anymore. The film has possibly the worst pacing of any film ever. On top of this the studio decided to literally name the Dr Doom character \"Victor Von Doom\". They also seem to have added in an unnecessary big battle with him after the film has essentially already ended- including large amounts of flying debris and a *very original* apocalypse inducing skybeam.\n\nThe saddest thing is the complete waste of the acting talent, which is incredible. Michael B. Jordan and Toby Kebbell are excellent in everything, while Miles Teller recently had an impressive breakout performance in Whiplash. Kate Mara and Jamie Bell are also very solid and this is really a group of some of the best young talent in hollywood. And while none of them are bad in this movie, none get the chance to shine. It would have been \"fantastic\" to see this cast through several sequels drawing from the beloved comic series, but due to a complete and utter studio fumble, this may now never come to pass.",

While the news about the impending negativity this movie would spark has been circling the media for nearly a year, my inherent fandom of comics in general made this a necessary film for me to see. While not a huge fan of the previous two movies (I've never seen the bootleg from the early 90s), generally speaking, Fantastic Four is a difficult story to interestingly bring to the screen. It's very cosmic in nature, has a long history of some very strange villains and story lines, and can be kind of boring. In the 2005 initial outing, the good things included a very good origin story, representation of Ben Grimm as a pilot and a perfect Johnny Storm. However, Dr. Doom was horrible. Not representative of the comic version at all. Jessica Alba's ethnicity came across strangely as a blonde woman. And, while looking like the very early 60's Thing, the orange suit was...just bad. The second movie, centering around Silver Surfer was a much better representation of the comics, in spite of the weird Galactus. The stories overall were very weak and too goofy. When I heard they were going to reboot it, I was ok with it, for the recasting of Dr. Doom alone. Fast forward to the introduction of Josh Trank as the director. Someone who had done ONE film. Yes, it was a decent film, but given that he was handed the keys to the FF reboot AND a Star Wars film, I was confused. So...fast forward again to nearly a year ago when word came out that the movie was in trouble. Josh was acting erratic. He had destroyed the house he was staying in while shooting in Louisiana. Fox secretly told Disney that Josh would be a bad idea to keep on staff for the Star Wars movie. Then suddenly, Josh was off the Star Wars film while rumors were abound that he had abandoned the final steps in FF post-production. The studio had come in and held reshoots and was completely in control of editing. So much bad press that nearly no one was looking forward to this movie coming out. Marvel was grinning like a cheshire cat wanting to get the rights to making FF back in the House of the Mouse. Then word came that an embargo was being put on all screenings and release of critical reviews until 2 days prior to opening day, always the kiss of death to a film. Then...3 days ago, the embargo broke and the messages were loud and clear. This movie was horrendous. I still planned on seeing the movie, but after Sony destroyed anything interesting about Ghost Rider...twice...I wasn't feeling good. Expectations were in the toilet. So, this morning, as I'm making my way through the surprisingly short (one hour, forty minutes) reboot, I was pleasantly surprised. The acting, even from the kids at the beginning, was very strong. The characters were coming together well. While the origin was different and the inclusion of Franklin Storm, Sr. and a mixed-race Storm clan was...well, unnecessary, it worked. I was buying it. Then they got their powers. From this point forward, it's like a completely different director and/or editor ran the film. There was essentially only ONE action scene. The end. And it lasted mere minutes. Without spoiling what led up to that one action scene, I will simply say that Doom was introduced. A very good Dr. Doom. Character and actor-wise, I very much like this flavor of Fantastic Four. And the tweaked origin introduces the potential for much more cosmic inclusion. The potential is exciting to this comic fanboy. The problem is, from the point where they go their powers, which was on a planet that required CGI and special effects, I was confused as to where the budget went. The effects were some of the worst I've ever seen. Just awful. So many story points were shortened, sped up and left to the viewers interpretation and assumption. Weird considering how well-paced the story had been until this point and how well-developed the characters had been. For the final 40 minutes, character development evaporated. The effects were horrible. There was no story. Just...scenes. Leading up to a very short and shallow action scene. Then...it just ended. A short, quick wrap-up, not to mention dumb, especially considering how strong the film had been the first hour. I simply couldn't understand why the film shifted tone and pace so quickly. As a result, I couldn't give it more than 2 stars. I believe Fox should give the rights back to Marvel or, at the very least, allow this film to have a sequel with a PROVEN director.",

Cathey, Chet Hanks, and Tim Heidecker\nDirected By: Josh Trank\nReview\nCHANGE IS COMING.\nWhen I was a little boy around the time when I saw Spider-Man the movie from 2002 I also watched the 90s cartoon of Spider-Man on Jetex. Along with two other Marvel properties The Incredible Hulk cartoon and Fantastic Four. I was a big fan of that show I haven't seen it in a long time. But when they made the 2005 movie and I saw the trailer on the official website of the movie I got excited, saw the movie and I loved it as a kid and I still do. The sequel however the only good thing I could say for it at the time was Laurence Fishburne. I mean I know it was kind of hard to make a fantastic four movie with Galactus but ugh I just couldn't fathom what they did to him.\nComic book movies are booming these days and it's a damn shame that this is the most recent entire to Marvel's first family. I like the 2005 movie but it's doesn't feel as Fantastic as the cartoon did. I have three perfect Spider-Man movies, I have five perfect Batman movie, I have four perfect Superman movies, I have three perfect X-Men movies, I have at least one perfect Hulk movie. But not one for Marvel's first family. What the hell?!\nFour young outsiders teleport to a dangerous universe, which alters their physical form in shocking ways. Their lives irrevocably upended, the team must learn to harness their daunting new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy.\nThey use their origins from the Ultimate line of comics and you know something Kate Mara was actually going to read the comics to learn about her character but a FOX executive said \"No don't worry where going to use only the origin from the ultimate line, not any of the character aspect\" yeah actors who want to be in comic book movies if a studio executive says that to you get out of the project because they're not like Kevin Feige where they are a walking encyclopedia on Marvel or a person who gives a crap about the movie, if they don't care why should you.\nIn this movie their is a scene where Reed Richards one of the smartest minds in the Marvel universe who while may take an obsession in his work abandons Ben, Sue, and Johnny in the facility where they are being kept. Reed would never do that especially to Sue or Ben! Victor Von Doom one of Marvels most feared and powerful villains looks like absolute crap! His character is absolutely horrible as well he's an emo punk who's a stalker for Sue. But the thing that really grinds about this movie is the one thing that they had in the Tim Story movies they completely ignored in this film, do you want to know what makes the Fantastic Four standout in the Marvel universe aside from their villains, forget their villains for a minute, the most important thing they forgot about the fantastic four is.............\nTHEY ARE A FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SCREW THIS MOVIE,IT IS THE WORST COMIC BOOK MOVIE AND ADAPTION I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!",

            "content": "After watching \"Captain America: Civil War\" I went home as was in the superhero mood. So I decided I would catch up on the superhero movies so I picked \"Fantastic Four.\" And the movie lives up to the negative reception I have been reading. This review should be taken as a warning of what you might see, and you might wanna save your money if you are thinking about renting this. \n  The movie is about Reed Richards (Miles Teller) who is made a  teleporter machine when he is young. His friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) helps him along the way. Eventually, they become teenagers and enter their teleporter in a science fair where they are recognized by Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey). He invites them to work for him making a teleporter to another dimension. There they meet his son Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), Susan Storm (Kate Mara), and Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell). They make the machine and decide to travel to the other dimension, which is a wasteland with green goo. They get in some trouble and lose Victor Von Doom as they try to escape back to out dimension. When they come back, they find themselves in different rooms with powers.\n  The movie is worse than clich\u00e9 when it comes to superhero films. There's so much wrong here for this to even be mediocre. To me, mediocre is \"Man of Steel\" or even \"Fantastic Four\" from 2005. I didn't even really wanna write this but I felt people should know what there getting into. So I will tell you the five things that are wrong with this movie that are not so fantastic.\n1.\tThe movie is way too dark and gritty. This is usually an upgrade when it comes to the superhero genre, but here it's so overly serious it lacks all humor. The fact that Ben (The Thing) got his toughness from his brother who beats him and even gets the phrase \"It's clobbering time!\" from him is just downright depressing.  Although the small amount of humor we do get is from Johnny (The Human Torch) who is played by Michael B. Jordan. Which is the only character with the character if you get what I mean.\n2.\tThe lack of character development and chemistry is horrible. They all feel cardboard, except for Michael B. Jordan, but the real problem is the relationship between each other. Not once did Susan talk to Ben. They all were separated and only appeared together at the end. There was no real communication or emotions between them. Even when Franklin died, his son Johnny didn't even grieve. After he died that was it. As if they didn't care for him. They are the worst team I have seen in any film.\n3.\tThe villain is Victor Von Doom, who is supposed to be Fantastic Four's biggest enemy. We see him as a human who seems selfish and a jerk and when we see him as a villain in the last 30 minutes he is a joke. His costume isn't scary or believable. He looks like a walking mannequin. He just comes to the conclusion that people invaded his world and they want to destroy it, so that makes him wanna eliminate all life on earth! He is the worst villain I have seen in a movie, seriously he is that bad.\n4.\tThe special effects and action are lacking. The Thing and Planet Zero are the only convincing special effects I have seen. The rest seem very cheap. There is a scene where Mister Fantastic is punching soldiers in the forest and his arms are stretching. It looks laughably fake. \n5.\tThe action doesn't happen much. Once when the team goes into another dimension, then extremely briefly when Mister Fantastic is running in the woods, and at the end when they battle Dr. Doom. They are very brief and lack to fun thrills. As if they had to cut down on action to make this 100 minutes. The last battle happened so fast, I said to myself \"Is that it?\". Was Dr. Doom even a threat? Was there even a reason for this movie to be made?\" \n  So in conclusion, Fantastic Four is a crappy film and is a disappointment when it comes to superhero movies or any movie for that matter. It seems that this franchise is just not meant to be. Who knows. I can't blame it all on Director Josh Trank. I know on a small scale he is great like when he made \"Chronicle\". It was probably the large budget and pressure from movie executives. Either way, I suggest you stay away from this one. Almost all other superhero films are better.",

There is absolutely nothing redeeming about the first half hour of this movie. The reason I give this 1 1/2 stars and almost considered giving it 2 stars is that it definitely had potential. I don't think the choice to give Fantastic Four a darker tone was necessarily a bad idea. The problem was that when the movie tried to be funny it was so cringeworthy, people came away forgetting the movie did at least attempt to mix in some light-heartedness. The chemistry between the actors also hinders any attempt this movie makes in making its characters seem human. Seeing as every actor in this film is critically acclaimed in something else, I believe the blame lies with director Josh Trank. I don't think Josh Trank spends a lot of time around other people because he definitely doesn't know how they talk or how a relationship between two or more people works. It is almost eerie how inhuman these characters act throughout the movie. Anyway, although the movie sucked, there were a few good things I took away from it. The CGI was fine (which kind of worries me as the budget for this film couldn't have been extremely low). Also, and this might be my favorite thing (which is not saying much) about this film, I thought the tone from the lab exploding upon their return/new powers to them in government control (half unconscious/half terrified) was right on the mark. I'm sure people will disagree with me but if the first 30 minutes at all had you emotionally invested in the film, I believe that those dark scenes would have had a much bigger impact and I like knowing that there was at least some vision in this movie. Furthermore, although many had problems with the way Dr. Doom looked, I (not being a fan of the comic) thought he looked much better than his comic version and the scene where he is walking down those hallways bursting peoples' heads open with his mind is honestly pretty cool and you're just lying to yourself if you didn't think so too. Unfortunately, the ending of this film takes any promise this film had and completely destroys it with one of the worst endings of any film I've ever seen. It didn't make sense, it felt incredibly forced, and it was so anticlimactic. Why the fuck was Dr Doom randomly limping when they found him? Why the fuck did he want to destroy Earth when he had literally no motivation to do so? Why the fuck does this all-powerful villain get physically outmatched by fucking Reed Richards? While we're at it, who the fuck thought Reed Richards was a good character to begin with? He is in a group of superheroes who are all essentially invincible and his power is that he's stretchy. He's basically fucking Gumby and now I'm just getting angry thinking about how goddamn stupid Reed Richards is. In summation, this movie started off with the worst 30 minutes of any movie ever made, showed moments of promise and intrigue in the middle, and finished with one of the most shoehorned, anticlimactic, illogical endings in film history.",

Those begging for the light-hearted, tongue in cheek approach of most other Marvel movies will understandably be disappointed and perhaps rightfully claim it is disloyal to the comics. In my opinion, this serious sci-fi themed reboot works. It fleshes out the origin story and conveys a more humanistic interpretation of the superhero team. Human Torch is no longer an American jock stereotype but remains flawed with naivety while The Thing is developed from simply being the big, dumb comic relief. This 'Fantastic Four' re-imagining also shows that superhero films don't have to be overloaded with action in order to be entertaining. Albeit there is less 'fun' to be had since you do have to wait a while before their powers are used and in the end the conflict with Dr Doom does rely on contrived elements but I can't say I found any particular part dull. I recommend the rest of you ignore the masses, take a break from these standard Marvel/wannabe comedy films and give the new 'Fantastic Four' a chance.",

The characters costumes looked cheap and lazy, no iconic matching jumpsuits with the four logo on, the thing was just naked and dr doom looked like a melted candle. The film takes way too long to get going and the climatic battle with dr doom lasts literally only 5 minutes so we couldn't get a feel of doom's evilness. There was no humour added like the banter between the human torch and the thing. This film literally brought nothing to the superhero genre and should be buried and instantly forgotten, a load of tripe.",

I liked the cast (I'm a big fan of all 4 leads), and they seemed to be having fun during the first 50 minutes. I understand this was a troubled production and I can see why the majority of people hated it. It completely falls apart in the third act and nothing in the film makes sense (e.g. Why are they doing this inter-dimension travel thing in the first place? Why is earth dying?) I felt that a lot of things were cut out from the original cut, and the studio's interference ultimately killed the film. That said, this is not the worst superhero film ever made.

I've seen it twice already and would like to go again.  The problem I see with Warcraft is that the lore has been fleshed out majorly and there is tons of it.  Parallel story lines snake through it on multiple continents and planets.  Lord of the Rings had a lot of characters, but they seemed to going in the same direction.  By the time the Peter Jackson's version screened it had already been attempted as a movie.  Even Leonard Nimoy had done a song about it.  Warcraft is exciting and well paced.  They don't spend time on ten minute fight scenes between two characters and spend it advancing the story instead.  And there is plenty of that to cover.  A lot of these reviewers don't get it.

Oh, and while we're on the subject, I thought Toby Kebbell as Pre-Dr. Doom was great. I even had to IMDB him to figure out who the heck he was. I could imagine him as a GoT character for some reason, don't ask why.\n\nThe latter half of the movie feels very rushed, and this is where the problem lies. It could have been, at the least, on the level of those Andrew Garfield Spider-man movies had they just fleshed the character's out a little more. The last 30 minutes are so rushed, it reminded me of the pilot for another CW superhero TV series. I can't help but feel all the rumors about FOX meddling with the production are true, because you really have to stretch to make some of the scenes make sense. \n\nA couple more of my opinions on the movie. \n\n1. The scene with Doom breaking out of the facility was kick ass. \n2. Final fight was lame city. \n3. I hated The Thing's voice.\n4. They needed to give Mara and Teller better lines. Great talent wasted here. \n5. The pre-fantastic versions of Ben and Victor made me hate the fantastic versions even more. These guys are fantastic actors and I've never even heard of them. \n6.

Even though the cast is good and I can tell they are trying the things they are saying just don't work and the jokes don't hit!\n\n2. The tone; this film takes itself way too seriously. The jokes (if there are any!) don't hit at all, this film is so uninspired, it makes the previous Fantastic Four movies look good, because at least you kind of laugh at how bad they are but this film takes itself too seriously. Serious tones only work for certain films like The Dark Knight, but it doesn't work here!\n\n3. The villain; what happened!? Victor von Doom is a joke in this film, not only is he weak but he has no motivation. He is just a bad guy and he looks horrible! At least in the 2005 Fantastic Four they atleast got Dr. Doom's costume right, here they attempt to translate him on the big screen but they do it completely wrong! Dr. Doom is one of the most badass villains and they took a complete dump all over him!\n\n4. The final battle is atrocious, this whole film is boring lacking any action. Now we finally get an action scene but it is terrible and forgettable. One punch and Dr. Doom is defeated. No epic showdown, nothing! Good job guys....\n\nOverall:\nThis might actually be my least favourite comic book film. Don't watch this movie, don't even watch it on Netflix like I did. Poor Josh Trank, he was treated like an animal by 20th Century Fox. I'm just waiting until Fox gives Fantastic Four back to Marvel. All of those positives I listed aren't enough to be redeeming qualities. Absolutely disappointing excuse of a film.",

Generally the special effects were good, and there were a few moments after they had gotten their powers where I found myself enjoying it. The first half was a lot better than the second half. The main problems were the horrible, stilted, dialogue, mainly during the second half of the movie, and two very bad casting choices.  Miles Teller was great in Whiplash, but really miscast in this. He simply doesn't have the weight or projected maturity to carry off the role of Reed Richards. Also, Michael B. Jordan just was not suited to his role as the Human Torch...his comedic timing was horrible. Too bad Chris Evans is now Captain America. His Human Torch in the previous Fantastic Four attempts was the best thing about those movies. Kate Mara was fine, and actually Jamie Bell was really good as Ben Grimm. Anyway, if they are going to attempt a sequel, they need to replace Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan, and find a writer who knows how to write dialog for these types of superhero movies. Anyway, if you have an afternoon without anything else to do, this is worth watching, otherwise I wouldn't go out of my way.",

Second of all i hate the characters, inviseble woman or whatever the fuck here name is cant stop complaining about here powers and constantly keeps trying to find s cure for here powers. Human torch is just \nirritating, the Thing and Mr.Fantastic are just okay nothing wrong with them. And then we have Doctor Doom, i think he doesnt realy look like him. Wel i dont want to talk about him but i ques i have to, Hid costume sucks, it takes like 1 hour and 30 minutes for him to appear on screne, I do not know what  his purpose is to destroy the world, he just does with no reason. And the story, its fucking retarded. Basically the young  Reed Richards try's to build a portal with his friend Ben Grimm (The Thing) and succeed doing so, years later they show the portal at their schools science fair and they lose the science fair beqause the teacher thinks its fake then Franklin Storm shows up (for some reason i dont what the fuck he is doing at a school science fair) and says the portal brings them to other dimension and wants to build a bigger portal or humans to go to that other dimension. They build the portal go to that other dimension Victor van Doom stays in the dimension and al of them get superpowers. O yeah and the action sucks in this movie.

Chronicle was a complete re-imagining of the superhero genre, Josh Trank and writer Max Landis created something cool, new and fresh to the genre and so I was very much hoping the rules learnt in Chronicle would be applied here.  Sadly this was not to be, whether this is down to the absence of Landis or studio meddling is debatable but the film was quite a mess.\nThe was a substantial set up before we see the Fantastic Four in action which I don't mind if it is done well but I felt the actors weren't quite right for the roles and the dialogue was very messy.  On a positive point I thought the transformation scenes would done quite well and rested more in the body horror genre than the superhero genre.  Well, this is true with the exception of Victor Doom who looked ridiculous, like a failed idea from Doctor Who :o(\nThe first half of the film was entertaining enough to keep me watching but disappointingly it was once they became the superheroes that I started to lose interest.  The film was leading up to a battle with Doom which took place for 10 mins at the end on another planet and was fairly uneventful, this made the 2nd half of the film even more disappointing and then we have the final line of the movie and the origin of the superhero teams name which was so cringey it made my skin hurt.\nTo be fair, the Fantastic Four is a difficult concept to bring to the big screen.  The Human Torch and Invisible Woman are fairly simple ideas but the Thing often comes across as looking too cartoon like and Mr Fantastic is just a live action version of Stretch Armstrong.  They need to forget trying to adapt the exact visual concepts from the comic book and reinvent The Thing and Fantastic for the big screen.  Time to hand the rights back to Marvel, hopefully they can fix this mess.",

The acting isn't too bad, the effects are nothing special but not horrible, and it does eventually get to the point. I didn't like Dr. Doom's design personally (many can agree with that one) but it puts a spin on the villain we originally knew. Now is this movie what I hoped for? No, but it gave me something to be entertained with, I mean I find it better than those other Fantastic 4 movies.",

The critics were right.\n\nYet another version of the Fantastic Four, while the early 2000s version wasn't bad, it never really caught on. Let's not talk about the 1990s version. Reed is a high school science wiz who catches the eye of a researcher who brings them in to work for them. The actors are way too old to be roughly high school/college age so that's the first knock. The actor who plays Reed Richards is also miscast as he feels more like a sidekick at best than the eventually leader. Michael B. Jordan is probably the best actor here and is barely used at all. Kate Mara lives up to her moniker as the Invisible Woman since you often forget about her as she is just sitting at computers most of the time. The Thing also just feels like a waste.\n\nIt doesn't help that they whole crew isn't brought together until about 1/3 of the way through, then they spend the next 1/3 wondering why they have super powers, then the next 1/3 battling the bad guy who just gets introduced in the last 20 minutes and they finally become a team with 5 seconds to go. It's horribly paced. It'd needed to combine the first two acts into one and make the third act longer. \n\nThere are elements of this movie that could have been good, it needed a better cast and the editing needed to be better. The villain was excellent, but he is only in the film for a few minutes. The dark tone works in spots, but I feel this franchise more than most is generally very cheery and family friendly and they went the dark and gritty which tonally didn't work like it should. A second installment might fix a lot of the issues, but I'm not sure I'd be interested in seeing it at this point barring another major reboot.",

This is an excellent FF origin story, and over all a much better film the the two previous attempts. Trank, Slater & Kinberg have created a very modern story here that brings four victims of circumstance together with a common goal, even while at odds with one another. The acting & visuals are top-notch. My only concern with the story is the mishandling of Doctor Doom. It's almost as if they used the 2005 film as the basis for Victor instead of diving into the source material. Even with that, though, there is much much worse out there (see BvS).

Even thought that aspect took over an hour, you still did not feel connected to the characters and it was a long drawn out process.  Once things finally got going there were a couple fun action scenes that were over much to quickly.  It all felt rushed at the end and it was not a fulfilling ending at all.

Put it this way, if Captain America: Civil War is your most favorite pie (mine is French Silk pie) this movie is just the pie crust.  No filling, no remnants of what was there.  Just the crust.  Perhaps there are people out there who love flavorless pie crust.  I don't.  I sat there watching and wishing there was more to this pie than just the crust.  I was waiting and waiting but.....nothing.  Right off the bat people were freaking out about Johnny Storm being black.  That was such a non-issue as Michael B. Jordan is a fine actor (go watch Creed if you haven't already).  Out of the four he did the best acting.  I really enjoyed the Fantastic Four movie in 2005.  It wasn't perfect by any means and the special effects were poor but that cast was far more likable.  I'm sure all of these young actors are good actors but their direction was terrible, especially Jamie Bell's performance of Ben Grimm.  Michael Chiklis was 100x better.

Considering all the hatred and\nlacklustre talk surrounding this film, upon reflection on home release,\nFantastic Four isn't actually \"that\" bad.\n\nIt's certainly not a good film, actually it's very far from it but in\n2015 there were a lot of seriously bad movies and at least for lack of\na better word, Fantastic Four tried. It's not the usual action set\npiece after action set piece comic book film we've grown to know and\nlove and then grow tired of and Trank and his team clearly had some\ndecent ideas.\n\nBursting onto the scene with his found footage Sci-Fi Chronicle, the\nonce bright career of Trank seems destined to be clouded in controversy\nafter his efforts here but there are moments of genuine cinematic\nquality. The way in which our fantastic team of unsuspecting super\npowered humans discover their abilities is effective and the casting\nseems mainly on point.\n\nWe all know the talents of Whiplash's Miles Teller, Fruitvale Station's\nand Creed's Michael B. Jordan and the likes of Jamie Bell, Kate Mara\nand Toby Kebbell are no slouches but whoever in the end edited,\nconstructed and wrote this film killed Fantastic Four's chances to fly\nwith some of the most poorly designed editing, character development\nand plot advancements in recent memory and not once do we feel any real\nconnection with these people or believe that they share any form of\nchemistry whatsoever and the films aforementioned final act is\nbewilderingly bad, the only excuse it would have would be the studio's\nso called interference.\n\nIt's somewhat of a shame we will never get to know just what ruined\nthis glum and often more dramatically natured Fantastic Four outing\nthat at the end of the day has nothing even remotely memorable about it\nother than the fact it's so downright lacking in energy,\nhumour/lightness and a seemingly lack of effort.\n\nThe cast was there and no doubt willing but due to a raft of seemingly\npowerful situations this film ended up being a real non-event,\ncertainly not as unwatchable in its terribleness that many would've had\nus believe, but certainly a messy, sporadically entertaining attempt at\nfinally making the Fantastic Four a viable big screen staple.\n\n2 gum chewing head honchos out of 5\n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

The flow feels dull and boring, and takes too long to get into exciting action. It doesn't really need another reimagined origin story, and should have focused more on the dynamic between the characters. Very underwhelming action scenes, with weak CGI. What a waste of Doom, this is the 2nd time FOX can't get the famous supervillain correctly, this time turning him into a lame weird looking alien instead of the ruthless dictator genius he should have been. Such a waste of talents too, considering the actors are rising star with proven acting chops.

This segment isn't necessarily horrendously written or poorly acted, it's just unnecessarily long and covers ground that could probably be covered in 10-15 minutes of a more efficient and interesting movie. \n\nAnd then...the movie goes off the rails in a major way. After trudging through the intro, the film hits the gas pedal for what ends up being an equal amount of time of sloppy storytelling, cliche action, and laughable dialogue. With the film's villain not really showing up until the final 20ish minutes one can only wonder at the thought process that led to this final piece of work. Or maybe there wasn't any thought at all.

Everything from the altered plot line, the characterization, and the lack of any emotional quality, makes this possibly the worst Marvel (and cinematic) entry of 2015.\n\nI for one, am really tired of writers trying to modernize or change classic comic stories, to better suit the audience. They assume that we want something updated, with lots of CGI, and twists and turns along the way. Simpler is always better. The original stories are classic, and beautiful to begin with. The genius struggle of Richard trying to prevent humanity from destroying itself, and from outside threats. The depth of love Susan has for him and the family they build together. Ben's emotional state when he knows there is no going back to his original body, and of course the positvity that the Human Torch carries for the team even in the heat of battle. They were full of struggle and strife, sacrifice and obsession, and a willingness to do good. This movie brings none of those feelings to the screen. The plot is so terribly altered from the original that it makes no effort to connect to it's origin. Everything falls flat.\n\nThe actors are so young by comparison to the characters in the comic, that I felt no real empathy towards them. Reed was a genius at birth, but no scene in this film brings about any depth of his intelligence. He's foolish, unintelligent, over-dramatic, and has very little ability to emote (considering Miles Teller's performance in Whiplash). The other characters (2 of which are just CGI monsters) are fairly one dimensional, and lack any real feeling of unity between them as a team. How they managed to do this with one of pop-culture's super families is beyond me.\n\nTruth is, this is what happens when you have poor writing, poor direction, poor editing, poor acting, and a large budget with producers with eyes like dollar signs. Fox ruined this one from the get go.\n\nIf you're a fan of the comics (or of movies in general), then avoid this movie like the plague.\n\n1/5",

Miles Teller, normally full of sass and energy, is just reduced to a soft spoken teenager (...right) who gets somehow disqualified for his science experiment to work at the Baxter organization.   There he meets the equally dull Kate Mara who really is just  as soft spoken and wearing some odd wig half the time.  I could go on and on and spoil the movie, and really I don't mind since nothing happens.  But nothing makes really any sense.  Why would Doom come back?  What does he gain really to come back and ... destroy Earth?  What if the humans never went back?  Why did Reed run away?

            "content": "Many people if I only managed to keep a hold of comic book collection I had as a kid I would not have to worry about retirement benefits now, or ever. I turned eight years of age just as Marvel Comics began releasing their flagship series 'The Fantastic Four'. That was my introduction to the set of superheroes and villains that would ultimately become The Marvel Cinematic Universe. There's always been a rivalry between Marvel comics and DC comics and as far as movie rights go Marvel is definitely in the lead. They steadily produce films that are not only critically acclaimed but are embraced by the fan base. They routinely can earn in excess of $1 billion. Unfortunately, the latest Fantastic Four film is not in that much lauded group. Marvel fell upon hard times years ago and had to sell the rights to some of the most successful characters. Among them were Spiderman and the Fantastic Four. This latest attempt to bring the Fantastic Four to the screen is universally seen as a dismal failure and is much as I regret it by favorite comic as a kid has yet another flop movie. Like many novel properties to a successful animated series produced for television primarily targeted at younger children. This quartet of the most iconic heroes in the Marvel Pantheon appears to have a curse upon it as soon as it goes into production is a movie. As a fan I have suffered through numerous attempts ranging from the monumental fail represented by the 1974 Roger Corman attempt. For those interested copies are out there; I have one and after watching this 2015 version of he wants to just to see the only rendition worse than it. The 2005 movie released by Sony now actually is beginning to look good.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of a comic book movie to a dedicated fan is continuity with the comic book itself. Although the MCU included many tweaks they fundamentally remain true to the source material. This 2015 movie completely rewrote the story and included a number of rather puzzling changes. As every charter member of the Merry Marvel Marching Society knows the Fantastic Four receive their powers and it took a spaceship beyond the Earth's atmosphere. After getting hit by radiation they crashed and realized they were each changed. Reed Richards gain the ability to stretch his body to now take on elastic composition. Susan Storm could turn invisible and later create invisible force fields at will. Her brother Johnny became the human torch to sustain his body in the living flame. And Reed's best friend, Ben Grimm, was turned into a creature with super strength that appeared to be made out of orange rocks. Although the basic changes were retained here that is just about the only thing that survive between the comic to this movie.\n\nReed Richards (Miles Teller) is first seen as a young boy already a genius. While other kids are making baking soda volcanoes for the great school science fair Reed is already working on a transport device. He crosses paths with Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell, who has an innate mastery of anything mechanical and to spend every waking moment perfecting the device. Finally, and another science fair the pair catch the eye of the renowned scientist, Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), and his adopted daughter Susan (Kate Mara). Bracken also has a biological son, a rather wild child, Johnny Karen with a penchant for illegal street racing. Many saw the decision of making Franklin and Johnny African-American as a contrived not to political correctness. Dr. Storm happens to be the director of a he Baxter Foundation, a government-funded research and development Institute. Reed is often intermediate appointment and put to work on the most difficult project, a quantum gate. When this works be a portal to a planet in another dimension. The work had previously been done by Dr. Storm's previous most brilliant student, Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell). His family should've changed the surname generations ago. Together Reed and Victor manage to get the device working just as the ready to do an unauthorized test Reed brings Ben in for the initial trip. They talk Susan into working the controls as the three young men, dimensions to Planet Zero. There they discover the strange green substance with energetic yet volatile properties. Given notice of every strange substance is always green? They rush to get back to the transport pod but Victor is trapped in the substance and has to be left behind. Just as a return everything explodes enveloping, Reed, Ben and Susan in a strange radiation.\n\nAt this point most diehard fans of The Fantastic Four or close to reverting to a catatonic state with their loved ones urging, it's going to be a right to stop watching.\" Having been getting a review copy I felt obligated to continue on reluctantly, I did. The each at the powers is supposed to Reed escape from the facility runs off the grid. The remaining three men to control their powers with Johnny making the most of being a human flamethrower and Susan able to fly around in an invisible force field bubble. Ben receives the fate that is similar in all incarnations of the story turning into the Rocky orange creature. He understandably has some anger management issues which may have been exacerbated by the fact that he appears to be a eunuch. Most times the Thing gets to wear a set of trunks but in this film he stomps around au natural, yet another point of contention for within watching this film. The military steps in and recognizes Ben as a weapon of precision destruction. They are just about to do the same with Johnny and eventually Susan. She uses her innate ability for pattern recognition and locates Richards. When he returned to planet zero they find that Victor has had his environment suit merged with his body and he now has the ability to control energy and matter.\n\nOne of the things that bother comic books back from the movies was that the special effects necessary to do justice to the characters had yet to be invented. Finally special-effects has reached the point where Spiderman threads no longer look like silly string and Reed's elastic limbs can retain a realistic look. In many public statements the director, Josh Trank, an original version that he is certain would've gone it rave reviews. Unfortunately the screenplay that was used was written by Jeremy Slater and Simon Kinberg. The latter had been heavily involved in writing most of the X-Men franchise while the former is only one previous script, 'The Lazarus Effect', a sci-fi thriller that was lackadaisical he received. The director, Mr. Trank has one previous film to his name, 'Chronicle', about teenagers that gain superpowers in a rather done, taut thriller, 'The Kill Point', Featuring Donnie Wahlberg and John Leguizamo. That is out on DVD and is definitely worthwhile purchasing. I have no doubt that this was an honest attempt by all involved create reimagining one of the most classic stories and comic books. It represents an attempt to use recent discoveries in quantum physics and to completely reconfigure the interpersonal dynamics. Johnny seems to resent Susan at the adopted kid becomes daddy's favorite resulting in him acting out. Reed is the prototypical socially inept genius nerd that Susan eventually turns to basically on the rebound from the self-centered and abrasive personality of Victor. All this romantic triangle is present in many incarnations of the story just isn't utilized as well as it could be here. In the third act the special-effects crew takes over the story completely. This is a major departure from what fans of comic book movies have come to expect thanks in large part to the overwhelming success of the MCU. People now expect a fully developed story complete with well integrated character development. We have moved far beyond the point where special-effects in the expected to draw the movie. It should add nuance story not its motivation. Hopefully the rights will revert back to Marvel and finally see it done correctly.",

I followed this movie last year from inception to cast and crew choices all the way up to release and...I really wanted this to succeed and prove the naysayers wrong. I wanted to point my finger into the collective chest of everyone who said this wouldn't work and would fail. Well, I sit a broken man feeling like I've been a part of some great rebuke by FOX studios. Fantastic Four is just a cash grab. A last ditch effort to keep competitor Marvel studios away from the first family of comics. With this I hope they relent and let Marvel have at least this bit of their toys back.\n  The story of Fantastic Four is a drawn out, science based look at the origins of the teams story. Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) master interdimentional travel by their senior year of high school and are recruited by Dr. Storm and his daughter Sue Storm (Kate Mara) and they bring Reed and Ben to the Baxter building so Reed can get his further education and bring this design and dream to fruition. Reed also meets the antisocial personality disorder rebel Victor von Doom (Tobey Kebbel) as well as Sue's brother and master craftsman JaltetaStorm ( Michael B. Jordon).\n  Upon finishing the project and finding out the asshole government is taking it away Reed, Ben, Johnny, and Victor get trashed and decide to go to earth zero as its been labeled. Things obviously go horribly wrong over there and everyone except Victor makes it back to earth with some slight genetic alterations. What follows is the team learning their powers to be possibly used by the government, Reed runs away leaving everyone behind for awhile. Until they return to the other planet and bring back Doom who looks a little rough but instantly (in the last 25 mins that he needs to destroy the earth so \"his world\" can prevail. \n  The story is has a schizophrenic pace to say the least. It starts out slow introducing everyone and the time travel mcguffin, immediately picks up to get us to the other planet and give everyone their powers and set up the team is in turmoil arc (that's 50 mins into a 99 min movie. Then trot along to show powers, find Doom and instantly nose dive into the third act like a falling plane. \n  My positives are that the Thing Ben Grimm himself looks phenomenal, that's ho CG should work and Dooms look and power of exploding people's heads through thought is just awesome. I just wish Kate Mara's obvious wig didn't stick out like a red head at a blonde convention, it's lazy and I haven't seen a wig job that bad since Samurai Cop. \n  I am deeply let down by this film but from all the backstage antics, politics, and hearsay it seemed like a project doomed to fail before release and I can see why. \n  Is Fantastic Four the worst superhero movie ever..!? No, not by a long shot unless we forget Elektra, Daredevil, Ghost Rider, Captain America (1990) Superman 3 and 4 among others. This movie is nowhere near the top tier of movies and falls short of the middle tier, but it's just above the bottom tier to offer a slight \"you need to at least watch it\" recommendation. I won't buy it or watch it again that's for sure but I'm glad I saw the movie dubbed.\"Trank-gate\" and made it out in one piece.\nJosh Thanks Fantastic Four gets a somber 2.3 out of 5.",

But this movie just made them look like whinny little jack offs, the worst of them all was by far Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm who comes off as a bi polar idiot with daddy issues. One moment he is fighting authority by street racing, then he is joining the military and being \"all he can be\" with a touch of daddy didn't love me.\n\nThe effects are bad at best, stupid at worst, they little have Ben Grimm get pummeled with flying rocks just because they like to do that \"And that's why he is a rock man!\" thing.\n\nI want to keep spouting why this is garbage but I can't get it all, so avoid this garbage and watch a better Fox movie like X-men Origins: Wolverine.

It's hard to strip charisma from one of the most charismatic young actors working right now Miles Teller who just seems like a generic actor with the weight loss for the role and the limited range offered from the screenplay. Michael B. Jordan also is stripped of all charisma he has, Jamie Bell is just a block of wood, and Kate Mara just seemed like an after thought when it came to the writing. Toby Kebbell played one of the most menacing villains of 2014 with his stand out performance in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and does a total 180 playing the least menacing villain in the past few years with 0 character motivation and ugly costume designs. Tim Blake Nelson and Reg E. Cathey do the best they can as talented character actors attempting to overcome the thoughtless script. I just don't understand how someone as talented as Josh Trank that made an amazing movie called Chronicle in 2012 with Jordan can make such a lifeless movie like this. The visual effects are awful especially for Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell, the score is just outrageous and seemed like it was recycled from other terrible action movies, and the cinematography does not help making every image as boring as the writing. This movie just feels like a 2 hour series premiere to a TV show for Fantastic Four but even a pilot of a TV show would actually give some decent tries at not writing lazy dialogue and not doing an 11 year time jump that comes out of no where and resorts to just rushed plot to get to the climax of this movie that also has 0 motivation. This movie makes the 2005 Fantastic Four seem like a romp (which it most certainly is not minus Chris Evans who you might as well have given an Oscar to compared to Jordan's performance). BORING",

            "content": "Review:\nWhat a load of rubbish! None of the new characters have the screen charisma as the original ones and the whole dark, gloomy feel of the movie, just didn't work. I totally got fed up with the technical jargon, which took up the first hour of the film and the movie seemed to jump from when they got there powers to them being used as weapons by the US government, so you don't see them exploring with there newly found powers. The \"Thing\" looked like a total mess and Doom just looked like a man in a suit with green eyes. The chemistry between the characters was also pretty bad, until they come together at the end and you don't really get to see any detail, because of its dark look. The storyline lacked wit and I got fed up with the stupid teleporting machine, which took up most of the movies concept. I'm glad that I got that off of my chest! Anyway, best friends Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) have been working on a prototype teleporter since childhood and during a demonstration, they get the attention of Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), whose the director of the Bacteria Foundation, a government sponsored research institute for young prodigies. Reed gets invited to join Storms squad, which includes his adopted daughter, Sue Storm (Kate Mara) and his son Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to complete a Quantum Gate, which was originally designed by the wayward Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell). Victor eventually joins the team, especially when he hears that Sue is on board and after a successful experiment, the facilities supervisor Dr. Harvey Allen (Tim Blake Nelson) plans to send a group from NASA to venture into a parallel dimension called Planet Zero. As Reed, Sue, Johnny and Victor came up with the initial idea for the machine, they decide to make the first journey to Planet Zero but Sue decides to stay behind to guide them. Reed recruits his best friend, Ben to join them on the journey and when they reach Planet Zero, they see some weird green lava, which Victor attempts to touch and causes it to erupt. Whilst running for there life's from the green lava, Victor is left behind because of the collapsing landscape and the others are brought back to earth by Sue, who overrides the controls. They then realise that they have super human powers, due to the explosion that happened in there ship while they were trying to escape from the lava and they are placed in government custody for further testing. Reed can stretch like rubber, Sue can become invisible and generate force fields of energy, Johnny can fly and turn into fire and Ben is a giant rock type figure who has amazing strength. Reed escapes from the facility and tries to find a cure for his friends while Johnny Storm is being used as a weapon for the government. After being in hiding for a year, Sue tracks down Reed and Ben is sent to bring him back to the facility. Now, with there new enhanced suits, they head back to Planet Zero to try and find a cure for there powers and they find Victor who has all of there powers along with telekinetic abilities, so they bring him back to facility, only to find out that he wants to destroy earth so he can rebuild Planet Zero in his image. Victor uses his powers to kill scientists and soldiers, including Dr. Allen and Professor Storm and he returns to Planet Zero with the four scientists in pursuit. Now under the name of Doom, Victor activates a portal that begins to consume the landscape of earth. He is then confronted by the four and after getting beaten down by Doom, they join forces and Ben punches Doom into the portals energy beam while Johnny closes the portal. When they return to earth, they are awarded for there heroics, with a huge operational base and they decide to call themselves the Fantastic Four. Sounds good on paper but it was complete rubbish. I must admit, the first franchise was a bit childish, with some unrealistic concepts but it was much better than this. At least they had some decent actors! With all of these studios rebooting there comic book franchises, after the success of the darker Batman, I'm not surprised that they wanted to reboot the Fantastic Four but they made a right shambles of it. Due to hype, it made a decent profit at the box office which proves that a movie doesn't have to be good to make money. Anyway, they really need to go back to the drawing board with this one because the whole thing was a right mess. Awful!\n\nRound-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Josh Trank, 31, who brought you Chronicle in 2012. For his second project, I think he took on a franchise that really needed someone with some more experience and he over complicated the storyline when he really didn't have to. Everyone is familiar with the history of the Fantastic Four so he didn't have to come up with a technical reason for there powers. If he does come out with a sequel, he really needs to concentrate on the characters more that the technical references, which are really not that interesting.\n\nBudget: $120million\nWorldwide Gross: $168million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/sci-fi movies starring Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, Jamie Bell, Toby Kebbell, Reg E. Cathey and Tim Blake Nelson. 2/10",

Having never been into comics, least of all Fantastic Four, I had no preconceived notions or expectations of the 2004 movie with the same title other than knowledge of it's cheesy premise- but things like that had been grandly overcome before by great writers, directors and actors.  Remember, before Tim Burton did the epic original Batman film, most people associated Batman with... well, Robin and the goofball 1960's Adam West television show.  But then I saw the previews for 2004's Fantastic Four.  And I knew exactly what to expect- a horrible attempt to cash in easy on the rise of comic-based movies and a Taco Bell cross-promo.  Inexplicably, I watched it at some point in the next few years and confirmed my hypothesis.  Years went by, the superhero films got better and smarter and sharper and even ventured into \"all-time greatest films\" territory with a few poor exceptions (cough..Superman, Green Lantern... Green Hornet.. stupid Spiderman reboot).  Right when this genre was becoming almost unbreakable, the most baffling preview: an unwelcome reboot of a dismal movie nobody asked for, f*cking Fantastic Four... Perhaps even more baffling is that I knew exactly what to expect from every inch of the reel this time and AGAIN found myself watching a terrible movie called Fantastic Four all the way through.  Even Taco Bell should be ashamed for banging this promo prostitute again.  I have nothing else to say about Fantastic Four.  Ever.",

            "content": "\"Where'd the rocks come from? From the same place the car went to. Where is that? I don't know yet.\"\n\nDuring my youth I spent many hours next door with the neighbor boy. Not just for having fun or horsing around, but also because in their veranda there was a disused closet with sliding doors where you could always find some old comics lying around. I suppose these were from the older brother who was a real comic fan. Many hours I spent sitting in front of that closet, reading them all. Comics like \"Archie the man of steel\", DC comics and of course Marvel. My favorite was \"The Fantastic Four\". This series I found extremely fascinating and that because it was a collective, consisting of several superheroes with different super powers. They formed a close-knit family and their identity was known to the population so these heroes had a rather family character. Actually, they were a little bit the forerunners of \"The Avengers\" and the figure of \"The Hulk\" resembled that of Ben.\n\nUnfortunately, this film is labeled as an unnecessary and worthless reboot. I partially agree with that. The only thing is that I can't judge whether this is an unnecessary reboot or not. I've never seen the previous films made in 1994 and 2005. Saying this is a failure or total disaster though, is something I don't fully agree with. A big part of the film I enjoyed watching and personally I thought it was interesting enough. The introduction of the various members of the unprecedented four was extremely captivating. The beginning showed a young Reed Richards (Judge Owen). A genius who seemed to come from Mars, according to some of his classmates, and who's building a futuristic machine in the garage. A missing component he finds on a junkyard where he bumps into young Ben Grimm (Evan Hannemann). The experiment proves to be a success and things can be materialized to an unknown destination and brought back again. Years later Reed (Miles Teller) and Ben (Jamie Bell) attend a science fair, where they attract the attention of Dr. Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his daughter Sue (Kate Mara). And before they know it, they are in a sophisticated lab rebuilding their invention on a large scale.\n\nThis introduction was the most successful part for me. It felt like an adventure film in which a boy pursues the realization of a dream. In an amateurish and childish way, the prototype of something big is made out of junk (a bit like in \"Project Almanac\"). Also the introduction to the various members who become part of \"The Fantastic Four\" in the Baxter Foundation, made this film different of other superhero movies. Mostly this part is kept short so they can move on to the action part immediately. The moment things start going wrong with the four noticing something happened to their bodies after they've jumped to the other dimension (while being drunk), it's still interesting enough. You witness how each of them discover their new capacities. But when the action-packed part of the film starts, it's no longer fantastic. It turns into an uninspired, quickly made up heroes-movie. As if they suddenly realized that stuff should be in it too. The visuals of the other dimension are still enjoyable, but the final stage feels rather flat and not very original. And certainly because nowadays as a moviegoer, you're buried under tons of superhero-movies.\n\nUltimately, this film emphasizes the formation of and relationships between the members of \"The Fantastic Four\". The superhero action that you ultimately expect, is fairly limited. A film that takes 90 minutes, with only a demonstration of superpowers and a final clash of fifteen minutes, can hardly be seen as a superhero movie. Perhaps this change was welcome anyway, after all the Marvel releases in recent years. The fatigue comes into play when it's about this genre. Perhaps the final part of the movie wasn't so great, but it wasn't painfully bad either. And now I'll just wait for \"Deadpool\" ....\n\nMore reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",

(Ps mild spoilers ahead)\n\nYes, this film is clearly butchered and it's a real shame because it has so much going for it. I kept watching thinking to myself, \"so when exactly does this turn terrible?\"-- and it isn't until they go back to the Negative Zone with Doom (I mean, Planet Zero) that the movie really starts to show where it has been cut up like a Beverly Hills Housewife.\n\nFor someone who knows little about about the Fantastic Four comics, I think this movie is largely dare I say it... GOOD! For what it is, that is, which is a visibly tortured script without a second or third act fleshed out, and a villain that had hardly any screen time. Sad.\n\nIt's got a pretty great first act but it just builds to such a rushed ending that it makes the film feel more like an extended series episode than a movie.\n\nPeople are upset with how Dr. Doom was handled, but I thought the design of him looks pretty cool, and all his lines as Doom seem in line with his character. Although they go with the Ultimate Universe where he has powers, and I know that people are dying to see Doom portrayed instead as an evil Batman type approach, you can't deny his level of power is still pretty impressive- and good for the studio for at least allowing him to be portrayed with a Dr. Manhattan level of power. The willingness to show multitudes of head explosions that Marvel hasn't dared let be seen quite before lest it become a film for anyone but kids, is a good move towards having a more varied kind of genre film that caters to the gritty side of the super powered movie.\n\n37 minutes cut out of Fantastic Four. I don't know what the true backstory is for what happened upon the making of this, but clearly there suffered huge problems in how to handle it, and this is an issue that happens far too often.\n\nThat could be 1/4 of the movie taken out which could have filled in the pacing and layout of the story and its characters and their relationships to each other. Could it have really been that superfluous to edit out of the final cut? And will we ever get to see that footage? Who knows. I am certainly aching to though.\n\nThe acting is well done, the dialogue and emotions are realistic, the seeds of the relationships are somewhat present, it is cinematically shot, the special effects are up to snuff, and what actual footage is there is well edited- so is a too rushed ending, a lack of Victor's background information and some artistic liberties in appearances really worth such a ridiculously low score?\n\nThe online mockery of this movie is unfounded and simply untrue- it is certainly not the worst comic book movie ever made. I would give it at least a 50%, at least. I thought it was pretty intense at times, and entertaining as a whole- that all counts for a lot more than 9% in my book. It was just disappointing to be searching for its flaws the entire time and then seeing where it goes wrong. I really do wish the additional footage will be released when it comes out on DVD. I am quite curious to see what was excluded, and how it would affect the quality of the theatrical cut. I would give it a 6.5/10\n\nRead this review & more at www.1931Productions.com",

I can't find much to say about this movie to recommend it. I guess if you're not too picky on movies?\n\nFamily friendly notes: lots of action and angst. A few scary moments.

It's a shame, since the character development of the titular heroes, the special effects, and the updates to the old origin story weren't bad at all.  The script could have definitely used a lot of polishing, especially to clean up the often-cheesy dialog.  Most bothersome is the pacing, which takes almost half of the movie's short 100 minute runtime to give the heroes their powers.  Doctor Doom's screen time is too short, depriving Marvel's biggest, baddest villain of the screen presence he deserves.",

The pacing is terrible, the story in unfocused, the villain is a joke but one that isn't funny just dull and boring, and  the very slow paced first and second act followed by a rushed third act just adds salt to an already open wound, however i did enjoyed the characters, probably due to the talented cast, and there are some good moments with the main characters, on the other hand the supporting characters are  very cliched, and the editing is absoluteky awful. This proves that when the executives and the director don't trust each other and try to pressure one another, the damage always falls on the final cut,  but what's the most frustrating is that it had the potential to be a great sci fi/ superhero movie and i sense it but i just didn't see it. Another very disapointing adaptation of marvel's most treasured tream of superheroes besides the X-men and Avengers.",

            "content": "Occasionally a director comes a long and throws the rule book out of the window, refusing to compromise and making a film purely on his own terms. When it works we are treated to such gems as Pulp Fiction.  When it doesn't work we end up with films like Fantastic Four.\n\nThe thing to bear in mind with directors who refuse to compromise is that the reason they do things their own way is that they have to, in order to get the film made that they want to make.\n\nJosh Trank (Cockney Rhyming slang) however appears to have taken the decision to throw the Fantastic Four rule book out of the window for absolutely no discernible reason other than self-promotion.  Firstly he decided that the blonde haired blue eyed all American Johnny Storm (The Human Torch) would now be African American.  Now, if this decision is necessary to tell the story Trank wants to tell, then that's fine, but it isn't.  There is no need within the narrative of the story for Johnny Storm to have changed race, and it is made even more confusing by the fact that his sister, Sue Storm (The Invisible Girl) remains a blonde Caucasian (well I say blonde, she actually has magic hair which changes colour, but we'll come to that later).  You wouldn't re-boot Shaft and cast a Caucasian actor in the title role, so why do the opposite when it serves no purpose?\n\nSecondly, still on the subject of meaningless changes of colour, we shall mentioned The Thing.  The Thing is orange, he has always been orange, but in this film he is grey.  A rather dull and boring grey that serves perfectly a metaphor for the film itself.  Again, as with Johnny Storm, there is no explanation for this change in colour, nor is the different colour necessary to serve any narrative purpose.  \n\nThrowing the rule book out of the window is fine of course if you are Tarantino, but Trank delivered to 20th Century Fox a two hour and forty minute film.  You have to wonder how bad this film was as Fox decide to do two things.  Firstly they cut the running time down to one hour forty minutes, losing an entire hour. Secondly they replaced a lot of what was left of Trank's footage and decided to order re-shoots without the director's knowledge, permission, or input.  The one hour and forty minutes that Fox released is a dull pointless and uninteresting mess that serve only to fulfill one purpose,  to teach generations of future film makers exactly how not to go about the process of making films.  \n\nThe first fifty minutes is dedicated to giving us the new origin story.  Now in a two hour and forty minute film devoting the first fifty minutes to the origin story would make sense, but when the running time is reduced to one hour and forty minutes, the origin story now takes up 50% of the entire film, leaving little left for storytelling.\n\nAlso, by taking out an entire hour of running time Fox leave no time for either action or superheroing.  It has been reported that Fox cut three action scenes from the original edit.  Quite why you would do this when you are attempting to make a super hero action film is strange, and particularly frustrating as the final result is that, apart for the climatic final scene, there are no other action scenes in the film.  \n\nThe other major problem with the film is the cast:-\n\nMiles Teller (Reed Richards) appears to be the only person in the film who actually seems able to act. This problem is compounded by the fact that once we come to the end of the fifty minute regeneration story Reed disappears for half of the rest of the film, only coming back in the last 25 minutes climax.\n\nMichael B Jorden (Johnny Storm) Trank describes the character of Johnny Storm as \"smart, hilarious and charismatic\" which is strange as Michael B Jorden skill fully manages to portray absolutely none of these qualities.  \n\nKate Mara (Sue Storm)  The blame for this one has to land squarely in the lap of Fox.  Trank wanted to cast someone else, but Fox insisted that Kate Mara play Sue Storm.  Mara commented that she wanted to make Sue Storm \"As real as possible\", she didn't.  Mara's performance is not one dimensional as a one dimensional performance at least has a dimension, Mara's performance has none.  Her portrayal makes Sue Storm one of the blandest, dullest and least interesting characters in the history of cinema.  The only interesting thing about Mara is her hair which switches between a light brown with blonde highlights to bright yellow blonde wig which she wore during the re-shoots.  Not only does this $5 wig look like it is made of straw but it is a full 15cms longer then her actual hair.  Why would spend $120 million on a film, and then ruin it by giving one of the title characters a crap $5 wig is anyone's guess.\n\nJamie Bell (Ben Grimm)  To be fair to Bell it is hard to know if he can actually act, as he isn't actually asked to do any acting. He looks a bit grumpy, says a few lines, and then is replaced CGI version of his superhero persona.\n\nToby Kebbell (Victor Von Doom)  Normally Victor is portrayed as the dictator of a fictitious eastern European country, adding gravitas and foreboding to his menace.  Here Trank gives us a Victor Von Doom who is just a socially dysfunctional greebo who spends his times sat in his room playing computer games and cracking one out off over his unrequited love, and it doesn't take a grates deal of working out to figure out who she is, as there is only one female character in the entire film.\n\nThere are numerous other issues with the film, but if I were to address them all it would take longer for you to read the review than it would to watch the film, so I won't as you have much more important and interesting things to do like alphabetise your DVD collection, iron your towels, or have a quick Trank.\n\nSuffice to say that Fantastic Four, whilst never the most sought after cinematic franchise, is now well and truly soiled goods and Fox should take a leaf out of Atari's book and rather than release the DVD's, they should just bury them in the New Mexico desert.\n\nOh and BTW, that scene in the Trailer where The Thing dive bombs out of a plane, that's not in the film.",

And some of the CGI of A2 was embarrassingly bad. So, relative to Avengers 2 and relative to say, the original FF movies, I liked it.  It definitely was lacking a little life - that would have been easy to add -  a little more humor and chemistry and interaction.  And, for sure, Ben Grimm, please put on some shorts.  That was awkward.  But, I think this was the right direction to go with FF in general.  Good tone, villain was pretty good, overall story was pretty good.  I liked it better than where x-men movies have gone - I am ready for x-men reboot.  \n\nThing to remember about superhero movies - the powers of the characters are almost like characters in their own right and need good screen time and presentation.  They did ok in this movie, but didn't really take advantage of what they COULD have done.  The old FF movies, while painfully campy and poorly cast IMO, did great job at portraying human torch's powers, the silver surfer was amazing and one of the best on screen looking characters in the MU.  Ben Grim's rubber suit was unwatchable though, \n\nI liked this cast better and Thing (with the addition of some Under Armor gear) was good.  But they don't really let their powers shine.  Miles Teller's powers were portrayed in a cool way, not a silly way, which i liked.\n\nI liked it, kind of wish they were doing sequel, but if Marvel gets it, that may end up being best thing in the end.  I don't like Fox making their movies in a MU vacuum.",

No.\nHowever, I hadn't seen a film derail its plot in its final act this badly since Superman IV.\nUp until then, the film had some potential, with a good cast. Apart from several terribly silly leaps in logic, the film had an interesting plot about inter-demtional travel, which felt like it could have been a film on its own. \nHowever, the character development is rushed and underdeveloped and once they arrive at planet zero, the planet is a let down. Like much of the film, it is restricted to in its scope, and we see just one small area. Instantly things happen, so they run back to Earth. We then get a brief run down of the transformation of the characters, then the film runs back to trying to rebuild the way back to planet zero. We already saw that. The film needed to move elsewhere from here. Maybe to the Fantastic Four. That would have been an idea. But no. \nThe plot line of the government using the four as weapons is given little time, with no in depth analysis of the effect of being put into war zones and killing humans on our young superheros. Again, it's just glossed over and not mentioned until the final moment.\nThen, when they return to planet Zero, we encounter Dr Doom. And it's from here that the film feels like the last 15 minutes of Superman IV, where the whole plot of Nuclear Man setting off a nuclear war and Superman having to prevent world destruction and beat a villain who had already had the better of him, was cut out, leaving him to just move the moon, drop Nuclear Man in a reactor, and give a quick speech and then fly past and smile at the camera. The film feels like it's missing so much, and that's what happens here in F4.\nIt's amazing how rushed the ending is. The film hadn't been great to that point, but a proper ending would have left the film as a solid 5/10 sort of film, and at least given hope to the series. Instead, the film is so hacked apart, leading to the critical outcry that occurred across the internet, leading to no hope of a Fantastic Four movie in the near future.\nThe cast are okay, but they have very little time to do anything. Maybe one day, the directors cut will get released and we will see a much better Fantastic Four, but its unlikely. Fox really dropped the ball with this one.",

Watching the film the problems with its production couldn't be any more obvious - it's like halfway through you begin watching a completely different movie. I honestly would be interested to see what Josh Trank's intended vision was and if it would've fully committed to the subdued and serious tone of the first half since the film's biggest problem is that it tries to be both a serious sci-fi film and a fun comic book action film at the same time. These two styles don't go together - pick one and commit! Honestly it's impossible for me to hate or even dislike this movie - it's absolutely worth watching just for how hilariously confusing a mess it is.

Having now seen the film I can firmly say and you may argue with me the negative buzz is well warranted. Before the last 20 minutes I was willing to give this a 2/5 but alas I cannot. In this review I will cover 4 issues I had with this film.\n1. Editing- this film is poorly edited and it shows on screen. A movie should flow and transition seamlessly into the next scene. Fantastic four does not, instead it feels like a series of vignettes- stilted, showcasing glimpses of a good film.\n2. Story Progression/Pacing- relates to editing, the story is smack smack smack with not a lot of logic behind anything. Character development and motivation is horrid with nothing happening until the last 20 minutes of the movie. And spoilers they don't get powers until an hour in.\n3. Age- actors who are nearing their 30s playing teens is always a worry- sometimes it's pulled off and sometimes it's not in this case it's the later. Everyone suffers from not making their characters more than one dimensional caricatures bogged down by the un-believability of the ages they are playing.\n4. Setting- a problem with movies when they use limited settings is they have to utilise them without them becoming stagnant and tiresome. Fantastic four once again fails in this department bogging it's movie down in a film that relies too much of its setting in a lab and thus warrants many yawns throughout.\nIn saying that the performances were fine and I really was rooting for this to be a good film despite all the buzz around it but alas it just isn't fantastic.\n1.5/5",

That had to have been one of the worst third acts in the history of cinema, and the only milestone that Fantastic Four achieved was the fact that it managed to join the line of other crappy Fantastic Four movies ever made. \n\nOkay, so in order to keep my sanity, I will keep this review fairly short. To start out, what I actually liked about the movie was the first half. The first half was actually fairly interesting, and the screenplay wasn't so bad. The movie felt like it was building towards something, and at the very least, I was entertained by what I was watching. Also, this movie contains an up and coming cast of stars, such as Miles Teller (Whiplash), Michael B. Jordan (Creed), Kate Mara (The Martian), Jaime Bell (Snowpiercer) and Toby Kebbell (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes). All of these actors have shown that they can act, and they do what they can in this movie. With that being said, let's get down to business. \n\nThis movie was very, very messy. Like I said, the first half was entertaining enough, but that's because it felt like we were building towards something. This movie never really builds towards anything and it felt like half of a movie. The movie spends a good hour building up a decent plot, but throws it all away with an awful second half. I didn't believe that a third act could be so bad until I watched this film, and let me tell you, it was truly was awful. \n\nThe screenplay during the first half was passable, but as the story progressed, it just went straight down the toilet. There are so many ridiculous plot holes in this movie that makes you question your sanity, and it honestly becomes an absolute bore. I'll just take one example from the film, and that would be the formation of the \"Fantastic Four\". These five people are brought together to crack inter-dimensional teleportation, but realistically, only three out of the five should've been there in the first place. Reed Richards and Victor Doom are both geniuses, and Sue Storm somewhat helps with the process, but the other two characters are there for no reason. They contribute little, if anything to the process and feel wasted. Let's be real, Dr. Franklin Storm put all of his faith in one unknown teenager, his genius daughter, his not so genius son, the muscle bound friend of Reed, and an erotic inventor. Only a God would've know that these people would've formed a perfect team together, which makes the movie so much less believable. \n\nThe visuals in this movie also struggled, as there were many moments where it looked just flat out awful. Even though the special effects lacked and the CGI was bland, the thing that stood out the most to be was Dr. Doom. He was probably the worst looking villain I've seen in a long time, and again, I had to see it to believe it. With a film with an incredibly high budget, I would've expected more out of it, but sadly, what I saw on screen was vastly disappointing.\n\nThe editing in this film was also a mess. As if the pacing wasn't bad enough, but many scenes cut off too early which made them feel incomplete. There were many chunks of time that was skipped over in the movie, and with a movie with this high of a budget, I expected a lot more. I don't know if that's the editors faults, or the fact that they had little quality film to work with. This movie could've benefited from an extra 30 minutes of screen time, but then again, that only would've been a benefit if this film was good.\n\nOkay, so most of us cinephiles know about the backstory behind this film, but no one is 100% sure. To sum it up, Josh Trank reportedly had a different vision for this film, but his disagreements with Fox led to a disaster in production. There were re-shoots, scenes were cut out, and the overall plot was tampered with so much that this movie felt so confusing. In my opinion, I've seen Josh Trank direct. He has proven to be an excellent director, and during this film, I could see the glimmers of potential throughout. I think he was aiming for a much darker and gritty style of the Fantastic Four, which I think would've worked perfectly. Since I have no knowledge of which side is at fault, I won't take a side. But, I think this movie's failure can be attributed to many production issues and behind the scene issues. It really felt like multiple people were directing this film, multiple people tried to edit this film, and all of them had different visions for the direction of the movie.\n\nOh boy. I still have a lot to say, but I will hold it all back before I go mental. \n\nIn all, Fantastic Four probably isn't as terrible as the reviews are making it out to be, but it certainly isn't a good film. Although the first half was passable, the production issues caused a conflict in tone and messy editing. The fantastic actors that this movie had at the helm were wasted, as they had to act their way around a crappy script. The CGI and visuals were awful, and it the visuals should honestly be ashamed of themselves. The third act is probably one of the most abrupt and awful endings in the history of comic book movies, and this movie is definitely not worth buying or renting. If you see it on Netflix or on demand for free, then maybe consider it. Although I'm trashing this movie a lot, it was still watchable at times, and I could see the glimmers of hope that it possessed. In the end, I will not execute this movie, but instead hand it two stars and try and forget about what I just watched.",

The real Doom is somewhere in between, we need someone to get it right for a change; give us the smart, stubborn, and arrogant Doom that makes his comic character so great.\n\nNo problem at all with the cast, the crap surrounding MBJ cast as Johnny Storm is embarrassing.

It was much better than what I have heard about it. At least it did not sound like a loud and lousy like any modern sci-fi flicks, chasing bad guys, bombing cities and downing buildings. But as a superhero and sci-fi film, it had its moment, only at the end.\n\nObviously the film was too slow and dramatisation was a backslash keeping the youngsters (audience) in mind. I actually expected hefty stunt sequences. Without actions, a superhero movie is like a limbless spider and toothless shark. If the web and tooth are the superpowers, then they must handle it quite smartly. So that is where this film failed to be a clever. This film had 4 superheroes and until the climax they were impotent. Which means the only superhero movie in the recent time that meant for older people. Precisely to say, if you are a 30+, you might enjoy it as I did. I know I can't talk for you and what kind of movies you like, but I know todays youngsters who refuse dramas and accept action-adventures.\n\nI agree it did not deliver as it should have been as a theatrical feature where surround speakers are ready to give us a breathtaking sound mix. I felt it some kind of a television episode. Because that is how the modern television series are presented. Personally, I would like to say that don't mind my words and the review, because I usually enjoy all the films I watch. So this one was average to me, but definitely not a bad and I won't slam it. Though I recommend it for old people who does not like modern high-octane stunts.\n\n6/10",

I think I confused the 2007 movie with this one.\n\nThis one was much more like reading the comic then most Marvel stuff. \n\nWith teamwork as a kind of underlying sub theme it  seemed to show that finding & exploiting the breach with other worlds through transdimentional portals or whatever might not be a mutually appreciated enterprise. It may yet prove that some doors to the multiverse are best left unopened especially to those that control the pursestrings puppeteering such projects.",

            "content": "My views towards superheroes films is similar to that of Disney movies; very complicated, convoluted, and getting tired of their formulas. A main contributor to this is most superheroes films feel the need to tell an origin story, and all feeling the same in outline form. Usually you have a young main character getting into an accident, is a good-doer, and after learning about his new-found abilities becomes a hero for the greater good. Our main character could suffer from blindness, being bullied, or simply being beautiful which limits the type of characters that are created. Superheroes films, at the moment, don't experiment much to the point that female-led superhero films can be counted on a single hand.\n\nFantastic Four was different for me as director, and writer of the film Chronicle, Josh Trank, brought in new ideas to a genre that refuses to experiment. It was a good film that while limited to the found footage format actually managed to be one of the rare times a found footage film worked. So for the first time since Man of Steel in 2013 I had expectations to experience a different kind of superhero film. Allot of what I learned about the film seem promising, and the teaser trailer got my interest. Now the point I started getting worried about the project wasn't the reshoots since one of my favorite movies, Jaws, and one of the best superheroes film ever made, Superman (1978), also endured reshoots. It was with the first official trailer for Fantastic Four that made me lose interest as the trailer was generic.\n\nYou think reviews would have kept me away, except for the fact superheroes films are the least trustworthy for me when it comes to critical, and audience reviews. If \"The Dark Knight\" is held to the highest standards for many of these reviewers so I had little reliable sources to turn to whenever one of these films get release. So out of the hundreds of reviews for this film the two reviewers I actually trusted with this genre both wrote negative reviews for the film. This caused me to be cautious. Then came in the talk of cut content which is where my interest raised again.\n\nFantastic Four follows four young outsiders teleported to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways. The four must learn to harness their new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy. The first ten minute of the films seem promising showing a young Reed Richard, and Ben Grimm attempting to send a toy car into another dimension. Unlike the rest of the film, the character are enthusiastic towards this goal, and dedicated to achieving it. What's wrong with these first ten minutes are simple. For starter, Ben Grimm \"It's Clobberin Time\" catch phrase originates from the times his older brother beat him up. Now I, expected this eventually pointless discovering would lead to some sort of repressed memory for Ben Grimm. This film clearly wanted to go in a dark direction so why not repress murder? It wouldn't be pleasant, nor worked well, but would have been different, and explain Ben Grimm lack of social skills or friends in the film.\n\nIn the first ten minutes, Reed Richard succeeds in building a teleportation device in his parents garage. Before that though, Reed Richards tells the entire class he wants to be the first person to teleport himself. His teacher, naturally tells him to pick a real career seemingly wanting to crush a young kid dream. I would argue against the realism of this scene, but school is where dreams go to die. My college professor told me that once when I, and several others, talked about our desired career on the first day in class (no joke). So after succeeding in teleporting a toy car what happens to Reed Richard? Fast forward seven years later. Neglecting what could have been interesting events to follow-up on. Why this timeskip is so damaging is plain simple; it glosses over the possible introduction of Reed Richard to the Baxter Foundation at an early age, and meeting the other major characters. If the film chose to show Reed Richard working within the Baxter Foundation at a such young age, and communicating with the other major characters developing the cast could have been easier. Also, I'm expected to buy within the first ten minutes a young kid developed a teleportation device in his parents garage, but a research institute aiming for the same thing completely missed this story in every possible way. This is the moment I gave up hope for good, sensical writing in the film.\n\nIn a science competition Reed Richards shows his teacher who told him to pick a real career. Demonstrate in front of his teacher eyes, and hands covering his ears a teleportation device. This same teacher who failed to crush Reed Richard dreams disqualified Reed Richard under the basis he believe Reed Richard perform magic. Yes, because Reed Richard who had his hands covering his ears build a machine in order to make an elaborate light show in order to perform magic. I would argue how this teacher got his job, but the US education system is terrible so it's not far fetch when depicting this teacher.\n\nAll of this was meant to develop characters within the first hour. However, that soon evaporate with one major mistake. So in the film Reed Richard, along with other young bright scientists that make up the core cast have to work together to make a teleportation device for the Baxter Corporation within the building. Instead of showing the trial, and error process of making such a machine would be a good excuse to develop characters, and their bond. The film decides to speed up the process by only showing the group talk to each other every now, and then. Not showing any hardship that has to be overcome when building a machine straight out of science fiction. Therefore, the completion of this teleportation device doesn't feel like a group achievement. Feeling more like the writers went through another plot point keep the story rolling.\n\nIt might read like I skipped over a lot of material, but the sad truth is hardly anything in the first hour contributes much to the overall picture. The only thing that needs to be brought up is the group decides to go to Planet Zero because they got drunk, and want to stick it to the man by going to this other dimension first. Something goes awry when the group goes to Planet Zero, and eventually return home with one less member. Now, Sue Storm, not going to Planet Zero would have been fine if she didn't get her powers by getting blasted by a computer. At most, a computer will catch on fire, and burn you. There are other side effects, but none of which include the powers to be invisible. To be clear, I'm not referring to Kate Mara (the actress who plays Sue Storm) career after this movie either.\n\nAnother issue is, like every live action Fantastic 4 film, is it desire to follow trends for of the time for unexplained reasons. For instance, as unsubtle as a villain like Red Skull in Captain America is, that film doesn't undermined the audience intelligent, and actually plays up on that aspect. Here, there's a character named Victor Von Doom. Hm, there's clearly nothing wrong here. I am one-hundred percent positive someone named Doom will not, in any way, be the villain of the film or turn out to be evil. Noticing this I am dealing with yet, another instance of \"Obviously Evil Bad Guy\". Unlike in say something like Mad Max: Fury Road where the \"Obviously Evil Bad Guy\" worked because the aesthetics of the film complemented it. In Fantastic 4 it is attempting to be more realistic (for some reason) where it goes against such a cartoonish name. The film attempts to humanize Dr. Doom by making him difficult to work with, rude to his peers, getting jealous when Reed Richard is talking to his possible crush Sue Storm, and doing stupid things when he is drunk. Wait, some of that is still evil behavior. Well, the writing really sucks for this film.\n\nBy the time the second act finally ends you're given enough reasons to dislike the film. The rush pacing, glossing over obstacles, missed opportunity for character development, and failing in setting up a grand story. One aspect that could have been engaging simply goes away due to a time skip. Ben Grimm returns to Earth as a pile of CGI, walking, talking rocks, and when the film shows Ben Grimm in this form for the first time he is scare. However, this turmoil for Ben doesn't last long as soon as he talks to Dr. Allen minutes later he accepts his new body. Well, that was pointless. There's also another scene where Franklin Storm sees his son, Johnny Storm, confuse in pain burning endlessly. Instead of making a somewhat emotional moment of Franklin Storm talking to his son, and calming him long enough for Johnny to be in human form. Viewers are instead greeted with a scene of Reed Richard escaping from a military base that has little security despite the fact they are holding people with abnormal abilities. Though, the film is not entirely to blame for this lengthy review. I got admit I missed an opportunity to make a racist joke as to why Johnny Storm is black in this movie unlike every other incarnation of Fantastic Four.\n\nOne line of dialogue in the film pissed me off way more than it will the average movie viewer. It was during a scene where supervisor Dr. Allen is showing footage of The Thing working in military combat fields. At the moment the camera shows The Thing ripping off the upper half of a tank Dr. Allen says \"He's been involved in covert operations\". Really? A walking, pile of rock has been involved in several covert operations? Not only that, but apparently none of this footage, nor the enemies footage of The Thing has been seen by any form of media? I'm expected to believe , The Thing, existence is unknown to the world when he is shown ripping apart the upper half of a tank, and throwing it at enemy soldiers? Now the reason this line pissed me off was because in my time off I played a video game called Binary Domain. The entire game was meant to be a covert mission, yet in one level I fought against a Spider Robot the size of tall building. This occurred in one level so try to imagine an entire video game spanning around ten hours with events like that. The game events unfold in the span of a couple of days, and of course it eventually get public attention. Yet, I'm expected to believe for an entire year The Thing has been a part of military operations, and none of the enemy soldier that saw him told anyone? Dr. Allen says The Thing saves people while The Thing is hurting people on footage. So if this claim is true, HOW COME THERE ISN'T A SINGLE NEWS REPORT OF SEVERAL SOLDIERS REPORTING THEY SAW A GIANT PILE OF ROCK IN COMBAT! I'm willing to accept any leap of logic, but not, when it is very clear, that the film itself is attempting to be realistic, and wants to be taken seriously to the degree of Fantastic Four.\n\nThe final act is entirely ripped from another movie. A generic superhero movie without giving its main villain a motive for destruction, or has heroes that care that a military facility is filled with dead people. Seriously, there's no emotional reaction from the Fantastic Four when ordinary people die. When the Fantastic Four have no chemistry with each other, than showing them be concerned with the fate of planet Earth in the climax there's no sense of weariness from them. At this point in the film, the team isn't even referred to as the Fantastic Four, nor is the name ever uttered in the film. It's ashame of it for some inexplicable reason. What this final act also contains is a force \"Save the World\" climax, and a weak final fight for some action. When the film actually ends, it becomes evidently clear the film amounted to nothing. From the first hour that set everything to the last act that goes in an entirely different direction. Losing faith along the way before becoming a film that satisfies no one.\n\nThe cast of Fantastic Four includes the talented cast of Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, and Jamie Bell. Performances they aren't bad when showing the inner struggle of their characters alone, but together the cast don't have any chemistry together. Jamie Bell, and Kate Mara for instance, never make eye contact with each other in the entire movie. When the Fantastic Four are all together on-screen they don't come across as good friends or a family. One issue being Jamie Bell is absent for a good portion of the film while the other cast member play characters who built a teleportation device. Toby Kebbell who plays Doctor Doom provides a stale performance. As soon as he appears on-screen there's no question he's a villain. He's gets the worst part to play since his costume for Doctor Doom is expressionless, and his mask seems like a crash test dummy head painted black with neon green lights implanted on it. It's look terrible on-screen.\n\nMiles Teller gets a few scenes where his acting chops adds to a scene. For example, there's a scene that requires Miles Teller to crawl to a pile of rubber after an incidents. His display of concern is convincing, but when he turns around to see his body stretched out his mortification sells this moment. It's a good moment in the movie, but this is only of one of about three scene where the characters come across as people. The other two scenes being Jamie Bell voicing his distraught in being The Thing for the first time, and the other being Michael B. Jordan screaming as he is engulfed by flames. These snippets make the character seem real since they are afraid of they new-found abilities they don't understand to use. However, there's where their most human moments end. Unlike other films in the genre, we don't see the Fantastic Four gradually accepting their abilities.\n\nThe supporting casts are entirely one note for the film. Reg E. Cathey who plays Franklin Storm maintains a similar facial expression of disapproval for every scene he's in. He's can't do anything in the role. Tim Blake Nelson who plays Dr. Allen has to look smug, and pretend to be chewing gum for every scene he's in. He makes little no lasting impression. That's about it for the supporting cast. Most of the actors in the film appear briefly in a scene or two then never appear again. One of them being Ben Grimm mother, and his brother who disappear after a single scene.\n\nThis film contains a few practical effects, and they are convincing looking. Like the mentioned moment when Reed Richard is crawling, and legs stretches out for a couple of meters. CGI on the other hand never blends into with the live action portion. It's rubbery whenever Reed Richards stretches his body in the few moments near the end when powers are used. However, the CGI isn't used for action scenes, nor in moments of showing off the heroes good sides. At most, you'll see briefly clips of The Thing military operations, one brief fight with Reed Richards attempting to fight off military gunman, and towards the end when the Fantastic Four team up to fight Doctor Doom. So very powers usage throughout the world. The Thing looks convincing depending on the lighting, but when he's fully visible isn't convincing. Kate Mara wig changes throughout the film, and so does her style. It's distracting, but the least of the film problems. Planet Zero itself is simply an empty planet with nothing living on it. The music is just forgettable.\n\nFantastic 4 is a bad film that had potential, but was squandered. It's a shame to be what it originally wanted to be opting to be a film that pleases everyone, and in the end becoming a film no one wants. Some ideas it had could have led to a good movie, and certain moments in the film are inspired, but the whole thing is a big mess. Good talent is wasted, special effects quality are uneven, and the script is weak on all front. In the end, the biggest let down of seeing this film is the only thing that makes it stand out in the genre is how bad it turned out.\n\nA Silly Afterthought:\n\nI had no idea where to include this piece of thought in my review so I just place it here in the end. One thing I noticed about all the Fantastic Four films, and some of the comic books is The Thing always wears pants, but in this film he's always walking naked. So, I find it funny the MPAA considers this PG-13 material, yet something like Steve Jobs has probably like small uses of the F word is rated R. If I understand this correctly, I could display nudity in a movie so long the character is entirely CG, yet simple foul language will get me an R rating. Every movie watcher probably knows this by now, but the MPAA really needs to update their regulations for movie ratings. Oh yeah, there's also the costumes which I didn't comment on. To be honest, I prefer the costumes in this film over the comic books which basically are blue tight suits with a number four on it.\n\nLetterboxd: http://letterboxd.com/cinema_maniac/\n\nWordpress: https://personafication.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "And here we go again, round...errr...whatever, for yet another reboot of yet another comicbook franchise, I hope its a winner. Yeah so after the light-hearted antics of the earlier movies failed to set the box alight way back in 2005 and 2007 (even though they weren't actually that bad), someone decided to give them another whirl. The Four are Marvels first team/family of superheroes and thusly they needed a big budget extravaganza to fit into their new successful universe.\n\nThis time things would be different, the jokey, slapstick shenanigans of the earlier movies was gone, long gone, in its place would be a much darker, grittier approach that would breathe new realistic life into the Four. The fact that the Fantastic Four were well known for being a more colourful, light-hearted set of heroes (mainly down to their rather silly super powers), seemed to make no difference to how director Trank wanted to go. This would be the Nolan-esque version of the Fantastic Four that incorporated many of the Fantastic Four comic incarnations, like it or lump it. \n\nSo the idea of trying to cover all comicbook visions for the movie was brave and reasonably sound, instead of just relying on hammy childish humour and action, they would balance that out with a much broodier tone. The characters would be younger, the technology would be more believable, costumes would be more sensible, super powers would be more grounded or shocking like an affliction, and the overall vibe of the movie would be more serious. The plot remains pretty similar to what we already know of the Four with minor changes. Instead of going into space they jump into a parallel dimension and are exposed to dangerous otherworldly energies or substances that cause the super power mutations at a molecular level. What follows is the team slowly coming to terms with their new powers whilst being confined to a secret military base and being abused by the government for special ops. Eventually, of course, they need to come up against the much stronger Dr Doom who was presumed missing in action in the parallel dimension.\n\nNow the start of this movie is actually fine (first half hour or so), it all moves along perfectly well. We get a nice small flashback to a young Ben Grimm and Reed getting to know each other and seeing their interest in science and technology flourish. Moving on from there we jump to a much older Reed and Grimm as they now prepare to jump into another dimension with the machine they helped build along with Doom, Sue Storm, and to a degree Johnny Storm (Johnny Storm is not really required for this, or anything, in any way). Everything I saw in these early sequences was pretty engaging I thought, it all looked good, sounded good and the cast fit their roles well. As we progressed further into the parallel dimension I still found myself enjoying the film. I really liked the visuals, the spacesuit design was cool, the Quantum Gate machine looked both intimidating and functional and planet Zero (parallel dimension planet) was eerie and foreboding. \n\nOnce reaching the real crux of the movie, their super powers, I was quite pleasantly surprised to see a very hard edged approach. Now when I say hard edged, I mean its clearly been crafted in a Cronenberg fashion (as widely reported) with a big body shock element infused into the proceedings. I actually really liked how Trank and co (or whoever) did this, having Sue fluctuate between transparency without control, Grimm being a painful mass of solid rock material with no real shape, just a pile of rubble on the floor. Then you have Johnny also appearing in pain as he writhes around on a table engulfed in flames, and finally Reed strapped to a table, his limbs elongated, muscles pulsing, he doesn't appear to be in pain but unable to control his limbs properly. This angle was pretty daring for a supposed young persons comicbook flick, but it deserves kudos, I think the team behind the film really managed the impossible with such corny super powers, they made them actually believable and emotional, we could feel their fear.\n\nWhat I also liked, and what also shocked me, was the inclusion of actual minor horror elements in the film. When Doom gets back from planet Zero and starts killing people for no real reason, he does it in a nasty way. He appears to fry them until their bodies pop, or their internal organs explode outward, which ever, but you do see blood! As Doom escapes from the military facility he appears to make peoples heads burst with blood splatterings galore! I did not expect this at all. Unfortunately even though Doom is a badass in the film, his visage does look very rushed as does his attire. He merely seems to be wearing a dark metallic bodysuit and mask with lots of neon green glowing through in places. Apparently his spacesuit had fused with his body but that doesn't really explain why he looks the way he does, how he got his green cloak and hood, nor does it explain his mask and weird mouthpiece (the glowing green was the energy substance found on planet Zero). He basically looks like some kind of metallic, mummified, mannequin, gimp.\n\nDespite the half decent start to the movie things do take a nosedive quite rapidly. The timeline clearly jumps around, different edits, wigs, things aren't really explained too well etc...such as Reed running off and living in Panama for some reason. What the hell was he trying to do? what was the point in that entire sequence?? Characters talk about how Reed has been off the grid for so long and how he's hard to find...yet they just manage to find him really quickly when they decide to hunt him down. And why is it the Four agree to remain in this secret base and carry out special ops? Surely they must know these military government types are just using them and they probably won't find a cure, they all seem pretty naive to me. Then you have this whole other dimension notion, visually effective at least, but none of it is even remotely thought out properly. They reach another planet in another dimension, but it just doesn't come across as that bigger deal. Surely this would open up so many questions about that parallel dimension and that universe, that whole plot angle just seemed way too big for this movie. An entire alternative universe in a parallel dimension! that's some heavy shit! but they use it like some kind of throwaway plot device. Did I mention the wigs aspect?\n\nI still don't really get why Doom wanted to stay in the parallel dimension on planet Zero. OK I understand that the natural raw energy somehow powers him and seems to keep him alive or healthy, but there's nothing there! What the hell is he gonna do on this barren wasteland of a planet forever?? Why does he wanna wipe out Earth all of a sudden? especially if he doesn't even intend to remain on Earth, in our dimension. Oh and how did he know when the team had come back to rescue him? how did he know where they would reappear? maybe it was the same location? Did anyone else also notice that the despite the weather appearing to be really bad and really harsh on planet Zero, it was always very calm with no wind or anything, where ever the characters were.\n\nAt the end of the day there just doesn't feel like there's anything at stake here, the finale is set in this desolate wasteland in another dimension, so who cares. The Four never really seem to fully utilise their powers for anything, or anywhere, they just get them...and mope around. Even when they must battle Doom, they still don't seem to be that effective with their powers, but I guess you could say they are still learning (for the sequel eh). Even though I quite liked the start of the movie and I did like the initial body shock reactions of the characters, the entire film is essentially just exposition for the obviously pre-planned sequel which may now never happen. As such, this movie is like a highway to nowhere, exposition that leads to nowhere, Hollywood is so comfortable with this cheeky method/formula now, and its very worrying. You don't get proper movies anymore, you get promises and setups for the following bigger movie, if you're lucky, because as we all know, films always come in trilogies these days.",

This one is closer to my taste, although the Fantastic Four seem younger than their actual age in the comics.

For God's sake! \n\nIt's a fair movie, with nice action and interesting storyline and that's it. It's a marvel movie, it's promising that a sequel will come and that's all I need! It's not X-Men and it will never be, cause it's a different type of movie. On the same topic, it's not spider man, it's not superman, etc. It was an improvement (makes sense) to the poor special effects of 2005, and yes, I liked all the actors! \n\nCan't wait to see the next one, I hope not in 2025!",

Are Not the actors, each one of them made a decent work, the problem here was the script, the plot and the story. This film is an introduction of 1 hour with 46 minutes, which is a total error. Any movie has an introduction, a development and a conclusion, but Fantastic Four does not have the last 2 aspects (and that are too important) history develops slowly, giving to know the characters one by one in a way little showy and poor. Development in the characters does not exist, there is no personality in them, not even the villain is interesting, there is no reason and no reason to be villain. Josh Trank and the same FOX not knew handle the start of these super heroes, let us hope that in future, the 4 fantastic or \"Fantastic Four\" have a movie just and decent, let us hope that Disney-Marvel take advantage of this situation. Disappointing and boring, with a introduction eternal without a development and final.\n\nReview en Espa\u00f1ol:\nProbablemente, Fantastic Four sea la candidata ideal para \"la peor pel\u00edcula del 2015\" al menos Sandler puede presumir que \"Pixels\" ya no es considerada la peor del a\u00f1o.

El desarrollo en los personajes no existe, no hay personalidad en ellos, ni siquiera el villano es interesante, no tiene motivo ni razones para ser villano. Josh Trank y la misma FOX no supieron manejar el inicio de estos super h\u00e9roes, esperemos que en un futuro, los 4 Fant\u00e1sticos o \"Fantastic Four\" tengan una pel\u00edcula justa y decente, esperemos que Disney-Marvel aproveche esta situaci\u00f3n.

This film from the graphic work has a ton of money put into the wrong things, the script was very rushed and extremely cheesy. They moved the character opening in way too fast with a ton of skips, then the story sets in so quick it was like watching old G.I.

Simply put this film just didn't have it's stop and starts into play in the story which killed the movie from the moment it started.\nThe acting was fairly good for what script that it had anyone could've done it, though some of the actors just seemed to not do well in front of a full time green screen situation.

Frankly speaking, it's got a lot of great ideas but has literally the worst editing/pacing I have seen in a long time in a Hollywood budget action film.\n\nI think Marvel's set a precedent of unnecessarily, colorful, nonstop laugh worthy entertainment to the \"super hero\" genre that now everyone expects and inadvertently wants. Why? Why does everything have to be sandwiched between glib humor and punchlines? Are we really so incapable of being entertained without a laugh? \n\nWhy can't we appreciate a grounded, dark, charmless hard fiction about a bunch of kids who had their lives fucked up?\n\nIronically what I love about this iteration of Fantastic Four is that the tone of the film is just downright misery. That having cool super powers isn't \"fantastic\" at all but actually a dreary affair.\n\nThat all being said, great ideas don't flourish without the proper execution and F4 just doesn't make a good film. The pacing is all wrong, it's 80% setup, 20% conflict with an abrupt ending. The resolution itself has no build up, none of the characters had time to resonate or interact, cheapening the whole \"we're better together\" motif. Reed's brilliant master plan to beat Doom was \"Make Ben Invisible so he can punch him\"? Really? The ending poses a problem too, 4 kids strong arming the US government to give them whatever they want? What? The Franklin kids don't mourn their fathers death, but in fact joke about it when naming the building? What?\n\nF4 felt like a long pilot for a possibly great TV show, one that I would love to watch. Unfortunately it's just not a great film and at the rate people are bashing this movie we're not likely to get any more \"episodes\".",

And a film is really only as good as it's villain.\n\nSay what you want about the original Fantastic Four (2005) movie, but at least that one was fun.  In the end, this isn't really an awful movie.

There are some interesting ideas in this movie, and somewhere deep down there is a good movie.  The problem however is twofold: studio meddling, and the fact that the movie it's trying to be just isn't a Fantastic Four movie.  The idea of people with powers suffering and being exploited is actually pretty damn intriguing, but it just doesn't fit the tone of who the Fantastic Four are.  They're a family who have grand adventures, and I never felt that with these guys.  They bicker constantly, not like a family, but like people who genuinely hate each other.  They have no adventures really, with the 90% of the movie taking place in one dull location.  If you took away the Fantastic Four brand and went all out with this vision, you could have an intriguing Cronenberg-esque sci-fi trip, something that could go down as a cult hit.  Even with the Fantastic Four name though, if you went all out with this vision you may at least have something kind of interesting, and that's where the second problem comes in: studio meddling.  It's obvious the studio didn't have faith in the director's vision, and while I don't necessarily blame them, their adjustments just make it worse.  They clearly tried to make it a more standard superhero film at the last minute, but the result is just an embarrassingly sloppy climax with cringe-worthy dialogue and ugly CGI.\nThe biggest shame of this movie is that it could have been good.  Everyone involved from the director to the actors to the studio, they've all produced good products in the past, and they clearly all have a vision for this thing.  The problem is their visions clashed and just didn't fit the property they were working with.  It's not a fun bad movie, it's just a depressingly bad movie.

With a director like Josh Trank(Chronicle) attached, this film could have been great. There were SEVERAL writers collaborating to make this film. Not one of them stopped and said, \"Guys, this movie just isn't working.\"\nUnfortunately, no one did so. THIS WHOLE FILM IS EXPOSITION. The whole movie is a setup for a sequel. Not only that, but the CGI is laughably bad. Fantastic Four had a huge budget, but still managed to create CGI effects in comparison to the original straight-to-DVD film in the 90's. \n\n    Also, the actors in this film are all considerably talented. But, for some reason, they just couldn't pull it off. Some of the acting in this film is cringe-worthy, especially from Toby Kebbell. Miles Teller is normally great in films like The Spectacular Now or Whiplash. Michael B. Jordan was awesome in Fruitvale Station. Jamie Bell and Kate mara are fantastic actors. Speaking of Jamie Bell, I have no clue what the f**k he was trying to do in this movie. His performance was just not working at all.\n\n   Fantastic Four is a ludicrous film. I would not wish this film on anyone, and I think it's time to stop trying to make Fantastic Four films. I am beginning to think that it is impossible to make a Fantastic Four film. You would be much better off going to see another film such as The Gift.\n\nRating: F",

The fight sucked as well. And Dr. Doom looked like shit. Also why kill off the main villain for the Fantastic 4 in the first movie. The one memorable part of the movie for me is when Ben head butts Reed Richards I didn't hear any noise and to me it looked Fake. I said that looks fake and busted up laughing. This would've been better off as a standalone scifi movie and cut out the little action in it and have it as some sort of exploration movie. Not much else good to say about this movie.",

The problem in the cinema format is they need to do more than just introduce you to these characters because we don't get another eight to twenty hours to delve into the issues the movie teases at.

The first act of the movie followed the Ultimate Fantastic 4 comics so well.   But then it all started going wrong when they got their powers.   Thing becomes a secret super soldier (how can someone as big as him remain a secret?!?!) and we never get to see any of it. and they try and make them pawns of the government.   Then the the film makes the exact same mistake the previous films made.   Rather then making Dr Doom ruler of Latveria and the inventor of a suit of power armor that could put Iron Man to shame.  They try and give him powers and make him crazy.    Gone is everything cool about the dictator with ambitions of world conquest that is doctor doom.   Thing at least looked great in this movie (although seeing his rocky butt-cheeks was something I could have done without) unlike the thing from the original movie that looked like an action figure sculpted out butterfinger candy bar poop.   Johnny Storm was fun but barely in the movie.   Reed Richards was passable at best and Kate Mara who is a great actress is the invisible woman.  they never use her even close to her whole potential though.   Im convinced that at one time this was going to be a good movie but when Disney/Marvel heard that a franchise that technically belonged to them was going to make money they couldn't get at they secretly went about sabotaging it either out of spite or to protect their holdings.   skip this one stick to the comics.",

First of all, the only job for the filmmakers was to make this movie better than the previous instalments, which shouldn't have been difficult. I mean, Trank maybe had a better ideo to end the movie, but in the end we dont know who to blame, and we have to judge the end result; which is really bad. I guess they were overthinking this one, or maybe not, maye they did just what they came up with and translated it into something called Fantastic Four. The actors did a good job (which I really didn't expect them to do), but there was not a slight bit of chemistry, which the revious movies did a way better job. Focusing more on the struggle of the Thing is also something previous movies tried, and didn't work out. Trying to make Van Doom more than just a man with a mask and gadgets is cool, I liked it, but you can't call that persona Van Doom (just call him metal gear man with head exploding powers ore something). What really hurts in this movie are the painfully obvious reshoots. The worst part is, they dont even make this movie better, they just unnecessarily steal playtime. The climax of the movie took like 17 minutes. Seriously? C'mon, if you struggle to show the audience everything you want, then make this a 2 1/2h movie (even though I highly doubt that would have helped this movie). I think they could make it better (and by THEY I do mean FOX), but I dont really know how to get people to pay for a Fantastic Four movie anymore, and I think this franchise is buried for the next 10 to 15 years. I hope the F4 come back, and we can do them justice (sometime). I will give this movie a better ranking than some other 'better' movies (like Iron Man 4) because the movie at least didn't make me mad. It was disappointing, and it was boring, but it didn't make me jump on a bandwagon and hate on it everywhere I go (LIKE IRON MAN 3, fuck that movie).",

            "content": "Time waste.  So another origins story for the troupe, this is an updated story of how the Fantastic Four came to be.  They travel to an alternate universe and become mutated by the elements of this new planet.  I really don't know why this specific group of superheroes is so hard to get right; so far to date, the only time where it has truly excelled is when it was a different title: The Incredibles.  I can't say that I've seen the Roger Corman production, and I don't have a personal connection with the comic books, but I've seen both of the Tim Story movies, and they ranged from okay to mediocre.  I think those two movies catch an unfair amount of flack, but they're still not good films.  With this reboot, they have made something that is far more lacking than either one of the previous movies.  The best thing I can say about the 2005 movie is that it shows that not every superhero movie had to be brooding and dark, and you can have one be more lighthearted; from my understanding this isn't the darkest of superhero stories anyways.  With this reboot, it is back to basics, and there are dark elements all over the place.  Honestly, this really makes me feel bad for critiquing something like Ant-Man for not being perfect, because with this, there really is nothing to recommend about this, and I will happily watch the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe before I will ever pick this up again.  So where to begin with everything that is wrong with this.  For one thing, there are no surprises to be had here.  It's another origins story for a group that everybody is already well aware of; nobody wants to see another Spider-Man origins, Superman origins or Batman origins, and nobody wants to see this, either.  It's just like a bad cover song at karaoke of a song that wasn't all that great to begin with, and you just want the drunken man to get off the stage.  I am not exaggerating when I say that it takes a full 45 minutes before something new happens.  I have heard differing stories on how much this was studio intervention and how much was director Josh Trank, and it doesn't really matter, because everybody is to blame and we all lose.  These aren't terrible actors; I've seen Miles Teller knock it out of the park in Whiplash, Michael B. Jordan bring it in Fruitvale Station, and Toby Kebbell deliver a gut punch in Dead Man's Shoes.  That said, I feel that every single person here is miscast, and nobody shares any chemistry with one another, they are just going through the motions and reading the lines on the page.  The dialogue is as clunky and boring as the rock planet that they go to, which brings me to the next point: the effects look cheap.  I don't know if somebody pocketed the majority of the $120 million budget, but the special effects look like they could have been rendered another few times over, and to have not one but two of your most climactic scenes take place on a barren rock planet is not an exciting choice to make for your adventure movie.  The villain motivation is weak and questionable, and the more I think about this, the less I like it, and I don't have anything good to say about this overly dull action film, which, in itself, is saying something.",

And in 2015, the Fantastic Four have contracted another chance on the big screen, but this version is a very different interpretation of Marvel\u00e2??s main superhero family to the Tim Story versions of a decade ago. There has been much hype about this reboot that looked intriguing when the trailer came out, but as it has now been released, it seemingly should have followed the recipe for superhero films Marvel Studios have perfected. Unfortunately, this new Fantastic Four capitulates under the numerous mistakes it conceives, much to our surprise, for it has all the elements to be fantastic.\n \nSeeing as this version starts off with all the characters separately, they have to bond lots to become tightknit, and unfortunately they never really feel like a group once. We can\u00e2??t ever understand their close bond as friends, siblings, lovers or enemies because we don\u00e2??t get to see them bond, and this is a major problem because to us the characters don\u00e2??t mesh as a unit, and so we see an empty group of heroes who still seem by the end strangers. The characters are thoroughly underused, for only when they talk scientifically do we feel like the film is getting somewhere, but when they try to make small talk for the purpose of character building and relationship bonding, they fail miserably because this script does not make time for it, in fact it fails to make time for any of the moments that make the recent crop of superhero films as successful as they are. Each character cannot be distinguished from one another until their powers ever so poorly cling onto them. They are all brainy scientists with poor upbringings, yet their ambition to do great makes them unique people who struggle to get along with other humans, therefore, all five characters are effectively carbon copies of each other, minus the radical beliefs. So, how can we embrace the characters if the only diversity comes with the usurping of their powers? And to make matters worse, the powers aren\u00e2??t made to look entertaining at all, and like all its problems, we don\u00e2??t see much of it, and when we do, the bits chosen don\u00e2??t tickle our fancy.\n \nMiles Teller is our protagonist Reed Richards AKA Mr Fantastic, a genius with the ability to stretch like rubber. Teller falls into his character better than Ioan Gruffudd ever did, but the thinness of his character means shallowness to a lot of things because he is our protagonist. Kate Mara\u00e2??s Susan Storm is far worse than Jessica Alba\u00e2??s creation; all we feel is her cold exterior we can never penetrate. We can\u00e2??t even begin to hope for a romance between her and Richards because her lacklustre performance prevents the idea from even popping into our heads. Michael B. Jordan, despite being black is the sister of Susan, who is white, making her his adopted sister, and to be honest to confuse their lineage doesn\u00e2??t add complexity to anything, it merely makes them feel more like strangers. Because his father is the group\u00e2??s guide, Jordan\u00e2??s Johnny Storm has depth to his character, unlike his partners, but he isn\u00e2??t even the second or third protagonist! Ben Grimm is the most neglected of the lot, lacking brains and brawn, and screen time! We don\u00e2??t even get to see Jamie Bell that much, but all of a sudden after a mishap is made out of rock, and becomes the heart of the group. This confusion isn\u00e2??t helped by The Thing\u00e2??s poor appearance that blocks emotion. And Victor Von Doom, the villain with a hell-bent vision that Earth needs to be destroyed because humans have driven it to deterioration is a weak enemy. Every feeling of his is under-emphasised, from his hatred of other humans, humanity\u00e2??s treatment of Earth and his love for Susan; therefore he becomes quite a one-dimensional character with the inability to express his emotions. Toby Kebbell does what he can with Victor, but in the end what we have is an undercooked villain with radical beliefs that have come out of nowhere due to his embittered personality that has dealt with constant rejection.\n \nThe development of the story is interesting at the start, playing upon the inter-dimensional travel ploy that is a big feature for the film, and one we can potentially understand in our technology-heavy society. When teleportation is achieved, the planet they teleport to, named Zero, is the most interesting this film can hope for. It is fascinating that the protagonists go there and actually investigate their surroundings, something which the 2005 Fantastic Four embarrassingly attempts to do, and even though the most we know about this planet is its man-made name and green lava-like substance, there isn\u00e2??t much to remember about it, and that is Fantastic Four\u00e2??s major problem. It suffers from the inability to delve into the interesting details of its story, which although there are plenty, it doesn\u00e2??t realise which ones are which and suffers. To see a film unable to control its own story, and provide life into memorable superheroes is sad viewing, because Fantastic Four is a mess that has potential, but the filmmakers here haven\u00e2??t understood what constitutes into making a story develop and flow.\n \nFantastic Four cannot flow properly therefore the narrative is unbalanced throughout. The opening is given plenty of time to develop, but the shortness of the running time makes the film miss large sections, which feels like it jumps ahead from scene to scene, and the scenes that are chosen lack importance or clarity. Upon the return of Victor 80 minutes in, the film is suddenly at a climax, allowing the audience to turn to one another and give a stare of \u00e2??did I fall asleep or is that it?\u00e2?? because the bridging scenes are absent, making this film feel rushed because it fails to dedicate its time equally around the film. About half-way in, the induction of a montage that tries to forward the story in terms of character bonding and the building of the teleportation device shows just how clearly the filmmakers didn\u00e2??t know what they were doing. If the montage were converted into actual scenes, all of the criticism I\u00e2??ve levelled at the film would be deemed obsolete, because Fantastic Four would then become layered, both in terms of the characters and story.\n \nFor some reason, the film maintains an obscure tone that suits the film on occasions but cannot be understood why it is so dark. To allow for the characters to bond and for us to create a connection to the film, there has to be far more of a lighter quality to the proceedings, maybe not as much as Chris Evans brought as The Human Torch, but definitely some kind of comic relief that could take the seriousness down a notch or two. I actually don\u00e2??t understand why there needs to be a dark tone because the characters are all young, ambitious and on the verge of ground-breaking discovery, and not once is there the threat of evil until the last 10 minutes, so as you can see the imbalance is rife. Reg E. Cathey\u00e2??s addition as Dr Franklin Storm, parent of Johnny and Sue, whom you may know as the guy who makes tasty-ass ribs in House of Cards, is the guy that brings this gloomy fa\u00c3\u00a7ade over the film, despite being a strong character who you can actually feel is acting. His addition gives the characters an anchor they can rebel against and return to, but most importantly his level-headedness stops the characters from relaxing before and after they gain their abilities. Without Franklin as a guide to the group, the gloominess would not have potentially been achieved, and the characters would have had to guide themselves, making for a more reckless film with the capacity to amaze.\n \nThe short running time means the ending is so lacklustre and insanely quick, it will definitely leave you underwhelmed by the whole experience that didn\u00e2??t develop, intrigue or satisfy such an interesting beginning. The location of the climax is boring, the fighting is tedious and the visuals are so monotonous it would not even take a film buff to notice it. Director Josh Trank has said the final package wasn\u00e2??t his version because 20th Century Fox made cuts to the script without his supervision, and so with his dissatisfaction sky-high, it doesn\u00e2??t change a thing because Fantastic Four was a mess nonetheless. These superheroes need to be left in their comic books fighting evil without critics embarrassing them for a fourth time!\n \nThe Verdict:\n \nFantastic Four has glimmers of the great superhero film it could have become, but in the end, this reboot has torn apart the characters\u00e2?? dignity and the world\u00e2??s love for this family of heroes.\n \n\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??        2/10",

Josh Trank tried to do something different and I appreciate his efforts even if the final product is ultimately just not good enough to carry it's own dramatic weight. But that this is supposed to be the lowest scoring Marvel movie on par with the 1990's Captain America just smells fishy to me. I'm sure Disney would really like to buy the rights to the franchise as soon as possible, god forbid that has anything to do with it.",

The whole movie feels like a prequel to what should've been the actual Fantastic Four movie, very little stretched over too long a space of time, but it's still functional. A brain-dead movie that only the truly hardcore of Marvel fans could really want to sit through despite the very little justice it does to the source material.

I loved the trailer. I was enthralled unbeknownst to me that the film advertised was in fact a FF reboot.\n\nAnd that's what still sells it to me now despite all the flack it's getting. This is a reboot. It's a stand-alone film with inspiration from famous comics and the characters within them. I guess it's easy for me to say as I don't have any attachment to the comics or their beloved characters.\n\nI adore the fresh, grounded approach to known stories, in this case the younger characters are more modern and seem to deal with 21st century issues. The superpowers are explained by science much like other superhero films but in a way that seems like it could quite possibly happen in the news today. It sounds silly to say that it doesn't feel far-fetched by the atmosphere that engaged me leading me into a reality that made it seem possible.\n\nUsing a body horror angle to introduce the characters' powers was a breath of fresh, cool air. To show these characters as real people would behave was something new that I felt needed to be done to refresh the superhero genre. Some effects seemed a little gimmicky but only after a friend pointed it out to me. I think they could've actually taken the whole story in this direction (as the horror was only hinted at and quickly brushed aside) however they chose to skip ahead and get to the action.\n\nNot a lot of people enjoyed the pace of the film, they complained about the lack of action and the slow-burning build that seemed to drag. I however, loved the detail that went into the set-up for these characters as I'm not easily engaged by constant action. And as a reboot, it seemed important and such a good opportunity to flesh out a completely new origin. I think people wanted to see more of the superheroes and didn't care much for the people behind them. Despite this, the characters personalities' were quite one-dimensional which explains why the first 2 acts fell short for a lot of people.\n\nThis leads to an issue with the third act, which for the length of the film, seems like an after-thought. In my mind, they could've gone two ways. First, they could've given more running time to allow for a better built-up, fleshed out and authentic action sequence that threaded better into the story rather than choosing a dark and brooding character to suddenly just go, 'you know what? Fuck Earth.' Or, they should've made the final act about what their new bodies would mean for their place in society i.e. make the antagonist the military/government that tries to take their freedom (crudely described; apologies). THEN we could introduce Doctor Doom in the sequel. Get where I'm going?\n\nBut alas, this was not the case and therefore this was far from a perfect film. However, I still enjoyed it as a whole based on the sum of it's good parts.",

To say it is the worst movie ever made is ridiculous. Worse than Gigli, Glitter, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li, Dragon Ball Z, Battlefield Earth or any Uwe Boll film? The answer is unequivocally no. \n\nF4 starts off really well. First half of the film is scripted intelligently and well paced. It was actually intriguing and had me thoroughly engaged. The 1st half of the film truly felt complete. It's the other half that was a total mess and where it all falls apart. That was also the major problem the film can be dissected by its two acts and quite apparent missing a middle act. Rumors of studio meddling points to this disjointed mess of movie that  could have been otherwise a good picture. Cutting the budget, taking away three major action sequences and took over final cut of the film. Josh Trank is a talented director anyone who has seen Chronicle would know this to be true. I wish he would have been allowed t o make the movie he wanted. I guess we will never see it and for now we have to live with the film that exists now.",

Then they pretend they need him after he finishes the job, succeeds in getting to the new planet, and then leaves his friends to escape the governments control. All his research was probably closely documented, not to mention his 3 partners who helped in the teleporter's success and are there to help build it! Then the actors were so young that I really hated the affliction given when delivering lines. Like the world is about to end, everyone you love is going to die, and your partner Victor is the cause; and you're telling me your going to SPEAK NOT YELL \"Victor don't.\" Really? I don't feel like you could even act calm in that type of situation. Then the line \"I'm a adult, dad!\"  This line was delivered very oddly.I would expect either a low and cool delivery or a very loud angry, almost teen way, of delivery. Instead the delivery was a combination of both like the actor could not make up his mind on how to deliver the line. Both the characters Ben and Johnny felt very neglected in the movie as well. The enemy was too over powered and could not have been beat. The fantastic 4 suddenly stop breathing oxygen for the boss fight. Not enough energy after the death of Johnny and  Sue's dad's death. I mean he helped all but Ben through the movie and I feel like a lot of anger and energy would have been released at such a time.  (Johnny did at least show a bit of anger seconds after his father was struck). Reed was just awful. Never really liked the character any way, but with the poor delivery of lines and the character being portrayed in a very fake and, at times, as the actor himself way I just could not believe that reeve was a three dimensional person like we all are. I mean where was the inner thoughts and depth. Sue did have depth but she also got neglected in some parts and just could not carry the other actors with her.The older actors in this move were well seasoned and just very unfortunate enough to be in this film. At times I felt that the actors forced the young actors to actually feel and be in the scenes.The ending sucked not only because of the plot holes and overpowered villain, but because the young actors had to actually carry a scene out by themselves. I admit that being on set with a green screen, no props, and looking up at a, probably, really nice coworker while tying to be in character is hard, but its your job! Like you get paid to act, so do it right! Use your imagination and touch on feelings. Don't be afraid to show your emotions. There was just too much \"trying to be cool\" going on. The fact that your still young in the movie means you should be showing even more emotion. You haven't had the years to learn how to completely control your emotions and keep cool. In fact I don't think a single person could be in such control at the end of the world. Where is the director! You couldn't tell the actors this?!? Did you not care that they totally forgot how to act? Did you even try to re-film the acting? The only thing that got this in theaters was the fact it marvel, has action, and the graphics were professional. Besides that it sucked.",

Not to mention that there may be a whole other half movie, based on complaints from the director and the number of scenes identified from the trailer that don't appear in the finished project.

The reason probably again for this failure is its marketing and the lack of story and creativity. It doesn't feel very much a superhero film instead it's more of a sci-fi film. The running time is only 100 minutes but it deserves 200 or even 300 minutes to be exact, there's no payoff or setup to get here. The characters are younger this time and to be sure this time, they were accidentally given powers, kinda like the 2005 film right only to be set not in space but in a Mars look a like place? There's no tension or a villain wants to rule the world storyline here rather than these characters want to reverse their powers back to normal. And what's this, they don't feel being heroes at all? Come on you guys have to serious on this one.

Sure. But its a good movie. Bear in mind, I'm not implying that its the best that Fox Studios has to offer but its still better than all the crap I have suffered through this year that made more money. I understand how you'd think that this thought has no basis of merit but I disagree. Hear me out. Lets assume you enjoyed a movie that everyone else hated on but you kept your silence as you are aware that every movie is subjective, but then suddenly, using the mass consensus as a weapon, everyone dog piles on a movie that you didn't really mind, and you end up getting a bit underwhelmed with the overall response as you liked a movie that everyone else didn't enjoy. And It all just seems like an immature joke that you had a great time with but the others around you didn't really understand or may be even unimpressed by it, which leaves you poking everyone with your elbow saying \"huh, huh?\"\n\nWell I'm stuck in that category.

The plot was non-existent since you had to wait 90 minutes to get to what the plot should have been: Dr. Doom vs. Fantastic Four and it only lasted 5 minutes. Then add in the awful casting.

That's not a joke; every scene in this movie is so under-lit that you feel like your wearing sunglasses indoors. Every outdoor scene feel you're attending a vampire funeral. It is a funerary tone is unfortunately appropriate because this is a joyless, dead serious movie that rings all of the energy out of something that should be bouncy and fun.\n\nThis is the fourth failed movie rendition of this property and the fourth time that Hollywood has shown that it doesn't have a clue how to do it right. Roger Corman's legendary 1994 action-comedy was so infamous that it never got released. The 2005 Fantastic Four movie and its sequel Rise of the Silver Surfer, were colorful but featherbrained and forgettable. Yet, they were modern masterpieces compared to director Josh Trank's current modernization, a movie so joyless that makes the last hour of Revenge of the Sith feel like Christmas morning.\n\nAt the beginning of the new Fantastic Four - or as the poster calls it, 'Fant-4-stic' - we meet 10 year-old Reed Richards (Owen Judge) who is working on a matter transfer machine.  He becomes friends with young Ben Grimm (Evan Hannemann) whose family owns a junkyard and has the parts that Reed needs. They become friends and grow up working together on the project, but years later at their high school science fair, their teacher (Dan Castelanetta) dismisses their amazing discovery as \"a magic show.\"\n\nThe government is more interested in their discovery and gives them access to work on it - along with Sue Storm (Kate Mara) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), and a broody drop-out named Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) who is said to be from Latvaria, but has an accent that is true-blue America. The team is given access to The Least Secure Government Research Facility on the Face of the Earth. Seriously, they can go anywhere, do anything, and send out photos of themselves to their buddies without any restrictions what-so-ever.\n\nThe first test of the matter-transfer machine with a chimp is successful, but Reed (played as an adult by Miles Teller) thinks that he and his team would be perfect for the first human test. The project overseer (Tim Blake Nelson) wants to bring in astronauts, but Reed is undaunted and wants to try it out himself. After hours, he gathers the team for an unauthorized test, but things go wrong and they, of course, find themselves with magical powers. Reed can stretch. Johnny becomes a human torch. Ben turns into a walking, talking chunk of rocks. And, for no reason at all, Sue gets the power to turn invisible, which is a head-scratcher because she didn't go on the mission at all - she was at the lab computer, so okay.\n\nThe introduction of these elements make up the movie's first hour. We are laboriously introduced to every single character. Then after the accident, we are laboriously introduced to all of their superpowers. By the time the introductions are over, we have time for a ten minute action scene before the movie abruptly ends. The worse section of the movie are the discovery of the powers. What should be a moment of joy and discovery is a long, sad series of 'what-have-you-done-to-me' scenes that have the same tone as if someone's dog just died.\n\nThe idea here should yield a movie that is as joyful and fun as last year's Guardians of the Galaxy. Quite the opposite. This is a grim, mean-spirited and broody movie. Instead of a fantasy, we get the approximation of how these events might play out in real life. That's exactly the wrong approach. The characters spend much of the time getting to know each other that you feel like you're watching the pilot to a TV series.\n\nThe comic books, as I remember them, were colorful and fun. The team felt like a cohesive family unit whose chief quirk is that their differing personalities meant that they were always playfully squabbling with one another - like a family. Here they seem to have been pulled together from central casting. The actors do what they can, but never at any time are they required to give us any sense of joy or wonderment. What was the thinking here? Why make a summer action movie this gloomy and oppressive? Why spend 90% of the movie on introductions? Why set the entire movie in a lab? Why give it such a mean-spirited tone? Fans of the movie won't recognize the characters.  Non-fans will be repelled by the movie's repellant atmosphere.  Who was this movie made for?\n\nNOTE: There are no credit cookies, midway or at the end.  Which is okay, because the less time spent with this mess, the better.",

The movies first and second acts are relatively unoffensive. While not exactly exciting or even fun to watch, it would have been just average enough to make this movie OK. I started to get worried when, 45 minutes into the movie, it seemed that nothing relevant  had happened in the plot yet. The heroes still hadn't gotten their powers, there had been no big action set-pieces we come to expect at this point, and none of the characters had developed in a way to make me feel any emotional connection towards them. Then the film begins to fall apart at a baffling pace, as the words \"ONE YEAR LATER\" appear on the screen right in the middle of the second act. What follows is a few poorly edited, short and boring action sequences that look like they were ripped directly out of a sci-fi channel original movie. Then the bad guy shows up and decides to destroy the world for absolutely no reason at all, the boring heroes fight him in one of the worst third acts I've ever seen in a movie, and then it just ends with some of the most painful to listen to dialogue I've ever heard in a movie my entire life.

Marvel has done a wonderful job and set the bar high.  I'm sure that hurt the reaction here some. I enjoyed the story. It was good enough for a reboot. I thought the acting was fine. SFX was good as well. I liked how the relationship between Reed & Ben was fleshed out.  It did seem that 3/4 of the film was devoted to the origin.  That seems like a lot more than the other superhero films that deal with origins.  I suspect that hurt reviews too. After the 4 find themselves capable of using their powers, it seems like the film has less superhero action than other films and the climatic battle is rather straight forward and relatively short. I'd watch another film with these characters. I hope I get too but I understand I'm definitely in the minority in my view of this one.",

Yes, Trank was a good choice at first, but the more reports came in of Trank's behaviour on set, and after Kate Mara (Susan Storm/The Invisible Woman) was told not to read the comics, and Trank was allegedly turning up to set drunk, and shutting himself off from society, the movie was immediatley doomed.\n\nThe Second thing they screwed up with the film was the characters. None of these characters projected the original wit and fun of the comic book heroes. Even though the actors (Mostly Teller as Reed Richards, Mara as Sue Storm, Bell as Ben Grimm and B. Jordan as Johnny Storm though) tried to save the film, no-one could really help the fact that the script was witless, and the characters were pointless. The main disappointment in this aspect of the film however is the plain lazyness and downright insulting way the villian - Viktor Von Doom/Doctor Doom was written. Instead of being an evil egomaniac bent on revenge towards his former friends, he becomes a stupid, video game playing nerd, who has a slight crush on Sue, and is angry cause he got... um... burnt a bit? \n\nThe Last and most important part of this film that they screwed up, was the pacing. I timed the film, and 45 minutes into the film, and it's an hour and a half long film, 45 minutes in, they return from Planet Zero, with their powers. Then the credits are about 7 minutes long, so you minus 7 from around 45 minutes, brings you to around 38 minutes. They have their powers in this film for 38 minutes, minus the time it takes them to do the most expositioney piece of writing of all time to explain their power which is about 5 minutes, so that brings us to 33 minutes of them having their powers. And to make matters worse Doctor Doom returns as the villian for the final fight, 15 minutes before the film ends. And 5 of those minutes, is the final fight, Doctor Doom is expositioned for 10 minutes, and in those minutes: He kills about 30 people by exploding their heads, with... his mind? I guess. Reed and Ben talk. Johnny accidentally attacks Sue. Doctor Doom kills Sue and Johnny's father. The World starts to get sucked up into a black hole. \nHang on while we're on the subject of the final fight and that god damn wormhole piece of crap, lets focus souley on that. So Doctor Doom was trapped on Planet Zero for a year now, and somehow found a hoodie cloak (no seriously where'd he get that?) and when he comes back, hes already figured out how to blow up people's heads or suck the life out of them or something, and create a freaking Black Hole? Yeah sure, it looked cool. But it was a piece of shit. I mean come on, Doom created a freaking Black Hole with his mind, and then, um, what was his plan after that? What was he supposed to try and do? What was his goal in life? WHY DID DOCTOR DOOM EXIST!!!\n\nIf this was a film about a group of kids getting superpowers, and trying to learn how to deal with them, and then one (Viktor) goes rogue and they team up to stop him. It would've been great, it may have even been one of the best superhero films of all time. It had potential, but FANT4STIC is a clear defintion that Superhero films can still suck balls",

            "content": "Once excited about the notion of a new big-budget Fantastic Four movie that featured the presence of Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan, I ended up watching it when I heard neverending critical scorn and so I had to learn precisely what rendered it to terrible.\n \nFaster than Johnny Storm can fly, audiences will realize that The Fantastic Four is anything but fantastic. Before the story can actively allow audiences to get a sense of the situation, it already hurls its characters into an overdriven pace. A good superhero movie knows how to pace itself appropriately. If it is going to be commercial and blockbuster-oriented, then it needs to be fast and action packed. If it is intending to be a really atmospheric piece, it has to sensibly moderate character building with spectacle. With Fantastic Four, there is no sensibility in the pacing.  \nThe fact that the story gives no time before it throws viewers into a point in Reed Richards' life where he is a child who speaks of exceeding interest in scientific discovery before being shot down by his teacher is not just cliche, but it makes no sense whatsoever. To characterize him as a child prodigy is one thing, but to turn him into a paper-thin cartoon character building a teleporter in his garage after failing to \"build a flying car\" is a new level of juvenile. The film has not even given audiences two minutes before it is already doing this. One of the first lines in the film is \"When I grow up, I want to be the first person in human history to teleport himself\". That should tell you how instantly the film just throws plot dynamics at viewers. And the decision to make the line \"It's clobberin' time!\" a line used by Ben Grimm's older brother upon attacking him is just a massive slap in the face for fans of the comic book series and people with any sense of intellect anywhere in the world watching this film. \nBefore the film reaches ten minutes, Reed Richards and Ben Grimm have created an advanced teleporter as teenagers, been disqualified from the Science Fair by the voice of Homer Simpson and then given a scholarship. It all goes by in a senseless rush, and yet this is misleading because straight after than the pace takes a sudden drop. From there, there is more than half an hour of characters just building a teleporter and discussing unappealing scientific jargon and tedious character subplots which have a real lack of practical drama. The characters don't actually gain their powers until halfway through, and by that point many viewers will have stopped caring anyway. Alas, I decided that despite my pessimism I would soldier on.\nAfter they get their powers, there is suddenly a massive ellipsis which jumps significantly ahead in time, and we see the characters have learned to use their powers through very brief clips of footage. The story points out that they are being utilized as tools of the military, and this brief segment shows impressive visual effects to boot. For a $120 million film I would expect nothing but the finest visual effects, and the film does boast some top notch CGI, particularly in the design of The Thing whose detailed stone shell, stature and movements are all very effective. The Thing gains special props for being so much more convincing than the cheesy prosthetic worn by Michael Chiklis in the Tim Story films. And yet, the quality of the visual effects just makes the experience of the film so much more disappointing when Josh Trank can't find anything to do with them. Despite the production values of the film, the $120 million production that is Fantastic Four would rather rush through a story plagued by too much talking and too little action. The action scenes are the best moments in the film because the combat the characters engage in proves entertaining, but there is never slightly close to enough of it. The film reverts back to talking very fast, and even though the titular team are now working with the military, they are put to no use. After an extremely brief moment where audiences see that Mr. Fantastic can be put to use with an effective use of his powers in the action, the film reverts back to its meandering path of tedious character conflict. The action is kind of thing audiences are going to actually want to see, and the fact that nobody bothers to acknowledge that really weighs down on the experience even further. The best scene in the film is its final action climax, though this has nothing to do with the narrative. The action climax is extremely brief, bereft of any genuine feeling and just an example of wasted funds values on a film which could have donated its funds to far superior material trying to enter production as we speak. And in the blink of an eye, it's over, as is the entire film. The feeling I was left with was worse than when I experienced Gavin Hood's adaptation of Ender's Game. Ender's Game used a misleading narrative to leave the viewer feeling like they were waiting for an action climax only to be told they had already experienced it. That pissed me off. And yet, Fantastic Four offered a different way to achieve the same result. The film is a mere 100 minutes long and spends the time dashing through many plot points while dragging on for others, rendering the already-thin narrative one which just collapses in on itself. And as a result, the story goes nowhere. So when the film reaches its sudden climax, it feels like the story is simply at a midpoint where it is suddenly turning everything around with a conventional burst of action. In actual fact, this is the end point in the movie, meaning that Fantastic Four ends just before the point in time that most films would call their halfway point. It's incomprehensible to the point that it's hard to describe, but it's the kind of feeling I've never really had before. It's one I never wanted to have, so I would advise you not to watch the film to experience it.\nFrankly, what's ridiculous is just how Fantastic Four manages to be both similar and different to the 2005 rendition and still mess up both parts. The lack of action is the same mistake made by Tim Story with his first Fantastic For movie, and I just don't get how a film with a $120 million budget ends up so lifeless and short on action. I mean, where else is there for the money to go? It's certainly not into the screenplay because the writing is pathetic. The saying \"talk is cheap\" applies here because the dialogue has no dramatic heft to it, nor does it put any interesting characterisation into those being depicted. As it is, the film's intro gives a cheesy characterisation to Reed Richards and Ben Grimm before audiences are left with subpar glimpses into the lives of Sue and Johnny Storm. The former is especially strange as it conflicts with the grim and serious tone of the rest of the film. Unlike the 2005 film, Fantastic Four really takes itself seriously as a legitimate character piece even though it clearly has no idea what the concept of \"character\" actually is. This doesn't help the cast because they are forced to play figures that are too young to maintain fidelity to the source material. Even though they are clearly talented actors, it is clear that with everything else in the film working against it. There is no saving Fantastic Four or even the cast, but they do prove to take a stand for their own credibility.\nMiles Teller delivers a somewhat charismatic performance as Reed Richards. He is instinctively able to capture the appropriate mindset for the character because his tone of voice ensures that the way he delivers the scientific-related dialogue in the film feels really natural to the character. Miles Teller is easily able to convey the intelligent nature of the character, but he also makes a decent impression during the action. What little action he is assigned proves to be something he works with as he picks a convincing punch in the face of either the military or Doctor Doom. He does it during a short period of screen time which is an effective boost for his credibility. And though there is no room for development or genuine emotion in the part, Miles Teller does what he can within such boundaries and delivers a solid effort.\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said about Kate Mara. Condemned to having the most melodramatic character in the story, Kate Mara is doomed from the start because she is constrained by blatant repetition. There is little appeal in her, and her chemistry with Miles Teller has no flair. While Jessica Alba was a terrible Sue Storm, at least she was sexualised to a point where she had some sense of value. With Kate Mara, the writers respect her enough not to condemn her to playing a one-dimensional sex object but not enough to give her a genuine character to work with. Kata Mara's legitimate talents as an actress are not valued enough in Fantastic Four and she has little to offer in terms of gimmicks so she is simply a boring presence.\nMichael B. Jordan also delivers a decent effort, though the character he is served with is pathetic. I have little concern with the race of Michael B. Jordan in casting, but it is unfaithfulness to the source material and changes Johnny Storm from being Sue Storm's biological brother. Now, she is his adopted sister and so the relationship changes. There is not even an attempt to characterize any kind of familial bond between them. And at the same time, the sense of comic energy that made Johnny Storm the one good thing about the 2005 Fantastic Four film is diverted into mild elements of African-American stereotyping for the sake of humour. It is too restrained to lay down any effect and too wrong for the character to do anything but cause viewers to question the film even more. But still, what's obvious is that Michael B. Jordan is a strong actor because he makes the attitude of Johnny Storm feel genuine while making a naturally likeable character out of the part. Also, when the visual effects set him ablaze, he really embraces the nature of his superpowers and flies with determination to throw fire in the face of adversity. Michael B. Jordan's natural charisma transcends the blank slate he is thrust upon in his portrayal, and so he has mild appeal despite being far from a true Johnny Storm.\nAnd Jamie Bell follows the same meandering path as he bears little resemblance to either Ben Grimm or especially The Thing. The man is the actor from Billy Elliot playing an overtly masculine figure of stone, failing to capture any sense of brute physical strength in the part. And also, his voice is clearly mismatched for taking on The Thing because it lacks the dank level of booming brute strength to be capable of delivering the iconic line \"It's Clobberin' Time\" with any sense of actual power behind it. Jamie Bell hides behind visual effects for most of the film, but whether he is on screen or merely voicing a CGI creation, he makes no such impact.\nToby Kebbell also proves to deliver a lifeless and shallow effort.\n\nSo though Fantastic Four has some of the right cast and visual effects, they are used exceedingly minimally while playing second fiddle to a pathetically written and incompetently paced excuse for a story.",

Josh Trank was on his way to a promising career after his sleeper hit, Chronicle shocked the world, but after many issues on-set, the film undergoing massive re-shoots, and the studio intervening and eventually taking over production, I'm quickly reminded of what happened to David Fincher on Alien3. The cast were all capable and I was very excited about Miles Teller as Reed Richards, but none of them seem to want to be there, they have no chemistry, and there's hardly any scenes with all four of them in it working together. There are some good moments in here like the body-horror angle they took to introduce their powers, the special effects are updated (most notably on The Human Torch), and Doctor Doom's rampage near the end played out more like a slasher film with a level of violence unsuitable for a PG superhero film! That is all I enjoyed however and there are too many problems to list but I will detail the major ones: the script is terrible and was re-written so many times it is an absolute mess, there is almost no action scenes with the climactic battle lasting about five minutes, nearly the entire film takes place in three settings and was pretty much shot on a sound-stage, the movie spends no time showing us how the heroes adapt to their powers and instead makes the critical error of jumping forward a year in advance to where they're already being militarized, and there is laughable continuity issues between the re-shoots with Sue Storm's hair changing style and colour *face-palm*. It is astonishing that a film this bad can still be made in 2015, especially one part of the 100% profitable superhero craze, but the evidence of inexperience, studio meddling, and lack of inspiration is all over this \"film\" that's only reason for existence was to hold onto the film rights....because that worked SO WELL with The Amazing Spider-Man.",

The Thing makes a great rock monster, Johnny does \"flame on\" and off, Reed stretches and Sue throws a mean force field. Unfortunately, they don't get much opportunity to showcase as the action sequences are few and far between, all of which left me wondering how much longer it was all going to go on.\n\nRead the entire review at www.celluloidup.com",

It's gripping and exciting to watch these young scientists attempt to crack interdimentional travel, and then it turns,intriguingly, into a sort of sci-fi horror for a stretch (haha) especially when Dr Doom shows up and starts going all Scanners on everyone in a secret lab, theres some truly rating pushing gore going down in this fairly awesome part of the film. Then it turns to buisness as usual, stop the bad guy/save the world, you know the whole spiel. But this is a refreshing superhero movie and unlike so many misguided post Dask Knight comic book movies this one attempts to not simply make everything more dark and broody than it should be, it dose what these films should now be trying, to make a proper genre movie out of a superhero concept, and it dose it so very well for a long time, sure it falls apart a bit and has some truly terrible effects here and there, but i think this is one of the most interesting films of it's kind in quite a while.

Then it turns in to a depressing dark escape mission for like a few mins after they get their powers lol. Like what did they think they were making a Batman movie? Fantastic Four was never a dark gritty comic. Where is the funny banter from Johnny Storm? ( also semi spoilers ahead but does it really matter ? haha ) \u00c3,\u00c2\u00a0This movie is just dark and stupid. Slow paced, dark tones , boring characters , not like the comics at all. Its like someone briefly told the director what Fantastic Four is and he was like \u00c3\u00a2 alright cool like me go dark and do what i want. \u00c3\u00a2 Also the fact that Johnnys suit lets him \u00c3\u00a2 flame on \u00c3\u00a2 like really? Nah he can control his own flames not some suit letting him turn it on and off like dah heck is that? Also after Sue gets his powers BOOM her hair is more blonde? lol really? so stupid. Then after they get out or \u00c3\u00a2 working with the military \u00c3\u00a2 they go on a witch hunt for Reed. And this is at 1 hour mark. Yes it took them 50 mins just for them to get their powers aka get back from the other planet and then roughly 12 mins to be like \u00c3\u00a2 oh hey we can use them for the military and oh reed is running around dodging us \u00c3\u00a2. Let me remind you that this movie is 1 hour and 32 mins long. So you waste 50 mins just for them to get their powers. You know how long the 2005 version took them to get their powers ? like 24 mins give or take. Also we get one \u00c3\u00a2 fight scene \u00c3\u00a2 with Reed that lasts like maybe 30 secs? Around this time Im very bored and just wanna turn it off. After this its abunch of boring nothingness for like 15 mins. In those 15 mins like 2 mins is getting Doom back. Then we have an interesting Doom blowing some guys head up. And then we just have Doom doing it to abunch of people lol. Like I said before this movie is really dark. like Idk if im actually watching a Fantastic Four movie. Mostly everything in the trailer is at the end of the movie. Then the last 10 mins is Doom trying to get \u00c3\u00a2 revenge \u00c3\u00a2 and trying to blow up the earth. Doom looks stupid. They go to \u00c3\u00a2 Planet zero \u00c3\u00a2 To stop him. Not one funny or whitty line from Johnny. Boringest \u00c3\u00a2 fight scene \u00c3\u00a2 ever. Like did they really think this was a good movie? One of the worst Comic book movies I have seen in a really long time. I rather watch the 2005 Fantastic Four movie. Atleast that is more like the comics. This movie gets a 1/10",

There is a masterpiece version of FANTASTIC FOUR here, just under the surface. Despite what you have probably heard this FF movie is NOT the horrible movie it's been made out to be!

Like Batman Begins, this re-do tries anchoring the particulars of the Fantastic Four's origin tale in reality. The problem is: The particulars of this specific comic book title simply prove too fantastical to present as believable. Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight saga involves a rich, psychologically-scarred vigilante with no super powers, but this much different hero property involves a human Stretch Armstrong, a man made of rock, a racer who spontaneously bursts into flame and an invisible woman. No amount of taking a naturalistic approach is going to convince popcorn-munching moviegoers that a computer programmer gets sub-atomic powers from the fourth dimension or that somebody actually names their kid \"Victor Von Doom.\" Worse, an inordinate amount of time gets spent laying this groundwork to make the mechanics behind the titular foursome seem plausible. Unfortunately, this doesn't amount to a great deal of entertainment value in the long run ... and it definitely feels like a long run. For a movie so interested in plausibility, however, the last act reeks of blockbuster schlock. From predictable deaths to shoehorning in superhero catchphrases to the big bad confrontation, it follows some familiar gamma rays down a rote rabbit hole. Worse, it nearly negates the interesting build-up that precedes it. Why flirt with realism at the outset if you're just going to turn cornball near the end? Marvel Studios exhibits a genius knack for straddling the comic-al and true blue spectrums in their projects, tongue always in cheek. Fantastic Four just goes from one extreme to the other in what's more of a flame-out than flame-on. \n\nIn this PG-13-rated adaptation of the classic Marvel comic book, four young scientists (Teller, Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell) achieve superhuman abilities through a teleportation experiment gone haywire and return to a world in need of their new-found abilities. \n\nThough the director usually goes down with the ship, Josh Trank (who already made a believable, albeit dark, superhero tale with Chronicle) at least takes a interesting approach. He spends ample time with these characters and high falutin' ideas, which makes the third act's descent into cheese seem more like studio tinkering than his own temporary lapse of reason. Moviegoers deserve to see his complete vision, especially considering the spot-on performances that result from his ace casting. Considering the believability factor of the first act, it won't be superb but it will doubtlessly not silver surf into complete oblivion like this fantastic mess.\n\nBottom line: It's Blubbering Time",

The sets are boring only being a concrete military base and a desolate rocky planet, but this can be forgiven if the film had interesting characters, but sadly it does not. The Fantastic Four are suppose to be not only a team but a family as well; they joke with one another, discus things, and work as a team, the don't do any of that in the film, well except maybe for the last part but that was only because they have to. There's not even a brother/sister dynamic in the film and that would've been interesting but they barley even bring it up. Our \"heroes\" aren't the only one this movie messed up either, they make Doctor Doom such a waste of potential. You finally have the chance to give us, at least, a decant Doom, but his character just feels rush and isn't at all an interesting character, and it's a shame, since Toby Kebbell gave us an incredible movie villain last year as Koba in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Doom is also one of the worst looking character I've seen in a superhero film, right up their with bat nipples, and Halle Berry Catwoman. Fantastic Four might be one of the worst superhero films I've ever seen, and it pains me to think that now the 2005 movie will now be known as the good Fantastic Four; Fox should just give up, and hand the rights over to Marvel.",

The end result isn't as horrible as everyone says it is, but it still deviates from the expected stellar quality Marvel norm.  It begins very promising, but keeps the viewer locked inside a interesting introduction right up until the last twenty minutes.  Kind of like if SPIDERMAN spent half the movie turning into Spiderman then learned about his powers (off-screen) in containment.  It's not very much fun when the government has control before the superheroes have a chance to play with their abilities on their own.  Instead of it actually being about The Fantastic Four, it's mostly about the pros and cons of creating a portal to another dimension.  One villain is predictably fought at the end of the movie with humdrum spacey special effects.  Actions scenes need to be within public locations and have must normal people being subjected to all the chaos.  Watching characters fight on another planet surrounded by empty space and rocks creates more of a cartoon experience rather than something relatable.  Overall, this one rides the line that separates a great Straight-To-DVD movie from a bad theatrical release.",

It's also worthy to note that this is the worst attempt yet. This movie is boring, stale, depressing, unfunny, and to sum it up: Awful. This movie probably has the most horrible pacing I have ever seen in a movie ever. The movie spends FIFTY FREAKING MINUTES setting up the characters, then DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THEM AFTER THEY HAVE POWERS. The first half is mildly enjoyable while watching it, but after watching the full movie, it makes you realize how much of your valuable time the first half of this movie wasted. The second half may as well go down as one of the worst acts of a superhero film ever, alongside X-Men Origins: Wolverine's third act and the entirety of Superman IV. The butchering of one of Marvel's best villains cannot go unpunished either, as it is worse than SM3's Venom, Origins Wolverine's Deadpool, and IM3's Mandarin. The finale is as rushed as the film itself, and the last lines of dialogue are literally like the movie is sticking a middle finger in your face. This is one of those movies that you hate while watching, and it gets worse the more you think about it. The acting is boring, the writing is cringe-worthy, the CGI and greenscreen is atrocious, the chemistry is nonexistant, the pacing is unbelievable, the third act is hilariously laughable, and the movie itself is a disgrace to your eyeballs. This movie makes the Tim Story Fantastic Four movies look like Sam Raimi's first two Spider-Man movies and the Dark Knight Trilogy combined in comparison. If you couldn't tell already, DON'T WATCH THIS ATROCITY. 1.5/10",

I didn't mind the younger cast or the dynamic of the team, but the traveling to alternate dimensions that gives them their powers...didn't make any sense to me especially since Sue Storm actually didn't travel to the other side but also develops equal amount of change to her body. Dialog was terrible in this movie. Reed & Sue had zero chemistry. It was just a silly attempt at reimagining something that was not broken in the first place. Sadly, by not sticking with the Origin story of the original comics, you also lost the audience who has read hundreds of these comics, alienating fans of Stan Lee & Jack Kirby. Can you imagine a Superman story without Kypton blowing up and without him being found by the Kents or a Batman without his parents dying? Hollywood you should know better...I still can't find anyone who think liked the 1998 Godzilla movie.",

You can blame the writer and director for not putting forth an effort to make something memorable.  But the truth of the matter is FANTASTIC FOUR IS A SHITTY COMIC BOOK.

The film is just boring and 40 minutes into the film and nothing happens. There's hardly any action. When there is action it would last 30 seconds. I thought this was going to be a perfect cast for the movie but when you see the film they were horrible but I don't blame them I would blame the writing. One thing I would like to point out is Kate Mara's hair in one scene it's blonde then it's back to brown and they would do this in every other scene a couple times and I really don't know why they would do that. Also the final fight scene only last like 3 minutes. Some scenes in the trailer don't appear the film so I don't understand why they would cut some scenes in the film. When the film gets released on DVD and Blu-ray I'm pretty sure they'll release a directors cut of the film. Overall if your a fan of Fantastic Four or superhero films don't see this movie it's a complete disaster.",

They were not particularly popular in the original comics and not later on. Even with Jessica Alba's appeal in the 2005 version it still was a bad idea, never mind all the problems with those movies. Now they go and do another one? Whose genius idea was this? There are so many great ideas out there, comics and story concepts that have gone unnoticed or yet to be given their due, and they go and try to reboot Fantastic Four??? So what did they create? Well first of all they switch out a main character to a black guy, the sort of thing that offends devotees to a series like this, who are for the most part the only ones wanting to see this. It is political correctness run amok, or in the case of the movie Annie, was actually an anti-white racist attack meant to slight whites by changing a cultural icon-- something that blacks would never allow if the roles were reversed. I run off topic though. To change up a character to appeal to political correctness is ridiculous. People do not like it. Will we see a white Fat Albert in the future? Never. Point made. Moving along the movie is just horrible for all the reasons that so many other CGI monstrosities are horrible. They lack a good story, the acting is poor, and the structure is terrible. I was never interested in any of these characters and certainly was not made to care what happened to them or why. To Hollywood I say this, pick up one of those sensational new comic ideas out there and make it gold instead. People want to see fantastic things, but they want a good story.",

A dull start that seemed to be setting up for the main storyline was dragged out into a film almost entirely composed of exposition that could have been covered in half the time, allowing for some actual action.  While technically being introduced relatively early in the film, the main antagonist wasn't brought to the front of the action until towards the end of the film in what was probably meant to be a plot twist, an assumption based on earlier events of the film, however this would only be surprising to those who fall into the unfortunate category of having neither read the comics, seen the cartoon series, heard of the characters before, didn't pay attention to the character's name, have never seen a film before, or are dense enough to not suspect what was going to happen.  While some parts of the film were exciting these were far and few between, with the final fight scene making up a pitifully small amount of screen time and being rather anticlimactic, leaving a distinct feel of disappointment.  Although a far better adaptation than the prevision films, there is little else of merit;  the pace was slow, the script was mediocre at best, the dialogue was clunky, and the characters were almost as thin as the plot.  It truly is a pity as the main cast showed a lot of potential to make a good film, but were let down by the script and execution.  It felt more like a cheap backstory subplot than a film in it's own right, feeling as though it was simply an attempt to establish a franchise for monetization rather than produce a good film.  The only thing that can be hoped for is that if, after such a disappointing film, the sequel isn't dropped that it will be all action, since this film did all the exposition and backstory that a franchise will ever need.",

No. Far from it.\nThe script was EXTREMELY poorly written. The cast - Micheal B Jordon, Kate Mara, Miles Teller, Jamie Bell - If you know Hollywood, you KNOW these are some of the BIGGEST young actor talents that will surely rise to Oscar level one day (Miles' film already did!) and it is disappointing to see how they underperformed here. The relationship between Reed and Ben was developed nicely then abandoned. Sue and Reed lines were so weak there could be no chemistry. And well Johnny just lacked the energy that character is supposed to have. He was mostly angry the whole time. I think Victor Von Doom was the only one who was convincing for me, why he hated people and how he felt about things, which again got completely wasted due to such a pathetic ending for one of the BIGGEST villains in the Marvel universe, with 20th Century fox was SO LUCKY to have since Disney's Marvel cant ever use it till Fox gives rights back... and it got wasted. \nThen those special effects... SO POOR. Was i watching the last Fantastic Four movie? The Thing looked awesome though, yet we never saw enough of our heroes fight enough and see their powers in full action . \n\nFantasic Four is one of Marvel's BIGGEST and BEST comic titles in history! It sits up right there next to Spider-man. It was Marvel's answer to Justice League (no, the Avengers weren't). THATS what made me sad. They kind of wasted the property with such weak script, directing and acting. And I dont care if the studio super meddled with Josh Trank's work! He should have just left the film like Edgar Wright did with Ant-Man.\n\nHOWEVER, all this being said, F4 is NOT a horrible movie. Not even remotely. The first hour is very watchable! They have this sci-fi horror theme going on, a completely new take. They build a nice mystery about the unknown universe. Dr. Doom walking through the halls blowing people's head was slick! And Mr. Fantastic's power use was so much more creative than the last movie! The problem is, instead of building up, the film just goes down, and the final act doesn't redeem it, rather makes the most sloppy bit. BUT, I ENJOYED WATCHING THIS FILM. I does NOT feel like a waste of my money! \n\nSo if you like superhero movies or sci-fi films, I would ask you to consider this. Go on a late weekday for lesser cost. But watch it once before you judge it form other's reviews.\n\nPs.- I am NOT really forgiving about movies (unless it has spider man :P) nor do i give a good rating easily. I know this was a poorly made film. BUT it didnt feel a waste of time n money and i liked it. It is still NOT a \"Batman & Robin\" or \"Green Lantern\" bad",

Dr. Doom doesn't show up until literally the last 16 minutes! There is NO action until that point! No sense of any danger. The characters are so boring and their chemistry is non-existent. There is close to zero interaction between the characters! I couldn't care less about the characters and the plot. The ending battle, if you can call it that, is about 2 minutes long and Whoo hoo! The Earth is safe! But, you just DON'T CARE! Because this movie's pacing and Dr. Doom's reasons to destroy Earth are so shitty that you can't even make yourself enjoy it. Speaking of Dr. Doom, he looks like Tin Man from The Wizard of Oz. The CGI is truly awful. I think the original Fantastic Four from 2005 had better effects! The cast is good, although. But, their characters are so SHIT that it even makes them look bad! I have nothing good to say about this movie except that it's watchable and I didn't really feel bored by it.

Like the crew's interdimensional voyage, everything pretty much goes to heck around that point of the film, with characters acting dumb and a boring third act that comes out of nowhere, clashes with the earlier sections of the movie and is simply dropped into the narrative. Our big bad guy, Dr. Victor won Doom (played by Tony Kebbell) does not have any real reason to be evil or threaten our heroes in the movie except for the fact that the script tells him to do so! The resolution to the plot feels so unearned and is so dumb that you can only laugh at how lame it is. For me, while it is not the jarring disaster or waste of time everyone was predicting, the only worthwhile parts of the movie that save it from being completely missed opportunity are the beginning section of the story and the visual effects bringing the Thing (portrayed by Jaime Bell) to life. It does make you wonder what a better version of this movie might be like, though.",

I guess that's what happens when your movie's story skips a year in time. The beginning of the movie wasn't awful and I was somewhat getting into it  But people were totally right about what they said about this movie. It's all setup and then a shitty final act. There is actually no second act; no middle. We jump from the origins of their powers to the final conflict. At least the earlier two movies had some sense of fun and personality to them, as stupid as they were. This movie is the definition of mundane. Dr. Doom looked horrible and was an awful character. I don't know what they were thinking with his costume design. Not to say everyone else wasn't awful too, cause they were. There was no one to attach yourself to throughout the movie, not even Reed RIchards. There was no weight to Doom's actions (or anyone's for that matter) or to the final battle. It's all brief, rushed and meaningless. I have to admit I liked the look of the Thing though. But overall, the special effects in this movie were pretty weak. The one thing you could expect to be decent in this day and age, and they still messed it up. I really wanted to like this movie and hoped it would be good. I loved Josh Trank's first film Chronicle, one of the best found-footage movies I've seen. Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller are two of my favorite young actors. I can't believe how much they fucked it up. I hear Fox reshot and changed the final part of the movie completely. That would make sense why this movie feels so disjointed.

The pacing of the film made the film boring, there was no chemistry between the cast ( which is a shame because it was a great cast), the villain lacked development ,the humour was ok but again there was no chemistry between the actors and the battle scenes were CGI at its worst. The film also had a gloomy tone which is weird for a comic film, especially a marvel one. i would have been better off watching a real comic book film such as ant-man. Honestly 20th century fox needs to sell the rights back to Marvel as they are the only ones who can do comic book characters justice on the big screen.",

I do not understand why they took a long time to develop the characters, it was not entirely boring.  At least you will understand the bond between Reed and Ben. Fine.  \nOne of my biggest problems with the movie is Reg Cathey as Mr. Storm.  His acting was not great, his voice is distracting and I did not see him as a smart convincing character.  Since they took so long to develop Reed story, they did not have time (i guess) to show you how they developed their new acquired powers, so instead they give you a glimpse of a few training exercises.  There was a 1 year gap, which they filled it with useless scenes instead of giving us some idea of what happened to Victor (Doom) and how he developed his powers.  So, to make it worse, they decided to have a fight full of Hollywood clich\u00e9s (like standing superman-like) and annoying sequences.  The fight, instead was poorly orchestrated and very very short.  I am so disappointed that I am afraid to even consider watching any other Fantastic 4 movies in the future.  Terrible!!!",

            "content": "For the first 45 minutes or so of the rebooted Fantastic Four I was having a hard time seeing why there was so much negativity surrounding the movie. I admired the slowly paced set up to the characters obtaining their powers as it allowed us to get a good enough glimpse of who they are when they are just regular people. I liked that the movie aimed for a more realistic tone than the Marvel Studios movies and portrayed obtaining powers as something freaky and scary instead of \"cool\".\n\nBut once the four obtain their powers the movie jumps ahead a year and my emotional investment in the movie completely died. I was really looking forward to seeing how the four main characters would cope with their abilities. I wanted to see their initial horror and their slow struggle to accept who they are and to learn how to control their abilities. The movie took a cheap shortcut by fast forwarding to a point where the four had already mastered their abilities and since we missed such a vital segment of their character development I had a hard time caring about them.\n\nThe 2nd half of the movie is incredibly rushed - a stark contrast to the slow burn of the first half. \"Dr. Doom\" enters the scene, threatens to destroy the world and is defeated all within a timespan of 20-25 minutes at most. When the four unite against him, there is all of this talk about how they will have to put aside their differences and work as a team. Unfortunately, the movie completely failed to develop the characters and their relationships with one another. The Fantastic Four are known for being Marvel's first superhero \"family\", but these characters feel like acquaintances at best by the end of the film.\n\nSpeaking of the film's ending, I left the movie feeling like I had watched a 2 hour TV pilot rather than an actual movie. I just felt so unsatisfied when I left the theater, as if I had only seen a teaser for the REAL story that was bound to happen later on. We will never get that story though, as this movie is destined to bomb at the box-office and never get a sequel.\n\nDirector Josh Trank said there was a lot of studio meddling with this movie and I can believe it. It feels like a good 30 minutes were cut from the film. Maybe if the film were longer it could have addressed my complaints. But as is, the movie fails to develop the relationships between the four main characters and as a result it completely lacks heart.",

Yes it's no masterpiece but dam the cast was really appealing and the whole film just sucked me in and kept me entertained for the whole two hours. It reminded me a lot of these heroic fantasy films from the 80's and I really enjoyed that. I thought they went for something a bit retro with de-saturated colors and a lot of green and blue which are some of my favorite colors. I liked the ending as well and Tobby Kebbell was surprisingly charismatic and mysterious as hell as Victor Von Doom. Definitely one of the coolest Superhero film I have seen in a while, tainted of humor and self derision... what else can you ask for?",

They cut out the dwelling and characters' introspective, emotional crisis' and just give you four very different young people that are brought together by a conflict. Albeit, the conflict has been done to death: Dark Knight Rises, The Flash season finale, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, Green Lantern, Avengers). The effects were good, the movie's pacing was well done and the origin Reed Richards was brief and informative enough to show you how far his dream took him.\n\nHis unwavering best friend lost everything in his blind allegiance to him. Johnny was a misguided youth crying out for his father's attention, while trying not to live in the shadow of his over-achieving adoptive sister, and Victor Von Doom was a man who was just rejected by the world. The woman he loved, the creation he fronted, the people he worked with and the world itself cast him aside as a social outlier. \n\nThe sub-text is all there, and it's very well done if you're astute enough to catch it, without a director dedicating 15 minutes per character for you to establish an emotional connection. A lot of this films' context hinges on the intelligence of the one watching it, and being able to empathize while picking up details, without having a plot watered down with pointless meandering to flaunt ultimately insignificant sub-plots.\n\nVerdict: People who are hating on the movie either don't know the characters and are starved for context, or they're just hypocrites who bitch and moan whenever they get want they asked for, because it wasn't designed just for them.\n\nRemember, comic book movies are NOT made for comic book readers. They're adapted for casual viewers with the hopes that they do the books justice. If you read between the lines, everybody in this film was done right, arguably except for the Storm siblings, but this wasn't an emotional rollercoaster - it was a sci fi action flick. \n\nIf you're open-minded, I'd recommend this movie.",

I don't know where to start with this mess, this is one of the most poorly plotted movies I've ever seen.\nThe beginning of the film is completely rushed in order to get Reed to the Baxter Building, then a drunk Reed in a last moment decision tells Ben to came with him and Ben despite that Reed is drunk he agree to come, then the film jumps to 1 year later like we hit fast-forward in order to get to the inevitable fight between the team and Doom. There was absolutely no chemistry between the 4, Reed and Ben didn't have any sort of brotherly bond and instead it felt more like Reed just kept Ben around because he was useful, while there was zero chemistry between Reed and Sue, The family dynamic was one of the few good points about Story's Fantastic Four films. Even with script problems, you got the sense that these people really cared for each other. Another problem is that the movie is WAY too serious & dark, there is no fun at all, Fantastic 4 are not super-serious, dark and gritty, yes, they have some very serious moments but it's mostly fun, i think a combination of humorous and serious tone(serious not in high levels, only a bit) fits perfectly to F4. Inevitably i'm gonna mention how ridiculous Doom is. I'm still trying to figure out why he wanted to destroy the Fantastic 4 ? anyone know ? anyone ?...crap he was part of the group, he worked with them, why he wanted to kill them ? his motives are unclear, well his look is terrible, it looks like an unfinished look of Doom which happens in pre production, we barely saw him in the film only for 5 minutes, It's as if they were putting this movie together and then at the last minute, someone went, \"Oh crap! We forgot that the Four need to fight Doom! ahh screw it, let's just bring him back right now and toss him in at the end.\" it's a mess...i expected the movie to be bad BUT not THAT bad, F4 just earned a place between the worst comic book movies of all time !!!!",

Meant to be darker, gloomier and more thought-provoking, Fantastic 4 could have been a different summer super-hero flick. Unfortunately, something awfully goes wrong with the whole movie and the pacing, the suspense, the villain, the character - nothing meets the initial expectation and potential of the story. It is very difficult to point out what has exactly gone wrong, but the most important element is the lack of entertainment resulting from the slow pace. Basically everything that is told in 100 minutes could have been told in 50 and then a second part would have taken place (with possibly higher stakes).  \nIn conclusion it is only a shame that such a concept is wasted a talented young actor such as Miles Teller does not get the chance to show what he is capable of.

Having such low expectations did make the film more enjoyable, but it was not without its problems.\n\nLet's start with the good. The movie is very well-acted. Teller, Mara, Jordan, and Bell all did a great job as the four heroes. Each had a very different take on their character, and this really separated them from the 2005 incarnations of the characters. The relationships were done reasonably well, particularly between Reed-Ben and Sue-Johnny. I also felt that the movie didn't drag on, it got through its plot points at a non-exhausting pace.\n\nNow for the bad. The characters seemed to do things against type. Reed separates himself from the rest of the group for some reason. Dr. Doom was underdeveloped, though memorable. The Reed-Sue dynamic was underwhelming. The editing made the film feel like it was jumping around too much.\n\nIf you were not interested in the movie to begin with, then it's a safe bet you can continue to ignore it. It is certainly a different take on a superhero film, for which I am glad. If you are curious, it's worth checking out.",

I really thought this would be Fox's \"Avengers\", but maybe I was asking for too much, bad performances, bad villian, sloppy pacing and bad storytelling turned out to be one of the most disappointing movies ive ever seen personally",

Obvious reshoots, the cast phones it in, the CGI is from the early days of computers and theres just no care in the film at all. You start to wonder why didn't they just pull the plug? I guess they were in too deep. The movie is a disservice to fans of film and to the characters of the source material.

A gifted young cast (Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell) are tasked with giving  this golden goose a fresh sheen. It's not happening.\n\nDirector Josh Trank (Chronicle), who co-wrote the mess of a script with Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, take their sweet as time to get anything going. Reed Richards (Teller, slumming hard) is a science genius recruited by Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathy) to join his rogue group of scientists. Storm's adopted daughter Sue (Mara) is a willing participant, not so much his car-crazy son Johnny (Jordan). Mara and Jordan have so little to act with they pretty much give up on it as soon as the movie starts. Toby Kebbell is Victor Von Doom, Dr. Storm's hot-headed pupil, who overdoes it like crazy. You can tell he's the villain because he gives giving shit to Reed's BFF, Ben Grimm (Bell). Everyone is supposed to be excited by Reed's invention, a teleportation process that can transport a live monkey to another diminesion. How I wish I had been that monkey.\n\nSo of course the quartet get into the teleporter and voila, they're the Fantastic Four. There's nothing resembling fantastic in this trashheap. Blatant franchise building has seldom looked so cynical. That includes the lazy effects that turn Reed into the elastic Mr. Fantastic, Sue into the Invisible Woman, Johnny into the Human Torch and Ben into the pile of rocks known as The Thing.

            "content": "This movie is the first of the new Fantastic Four franchise, so (for me) it makes sense that the writers took their time to develop the story of the characters and the how they became a team. Although slow, the movie was interesting and funny. I thoroughly enjoyed it! The fight at the end was not one of the better superhero battles that I've seen, but it felt truer and more believable than your typical superhero battle. The four had never fought as a team before, and I feel this was smartly depicted. Everyone was attacking from their own angle, with their own strengths, rather than combining each other's. With this in mind, I am extremely excited for a second because the first is foundational. The relationship dynamics between the characters felt realistic, poignant, and well-developed. Moreover this review would be incomplete without me mentioning how happy I am to see not only a black leading male, but also a black superhero. I'm not going to lie, it seems to me that enough of these negative reviews come from people who were/are upset that a black male replaced a role traditionally for a white male, BUT many of these extremely popular superhero comic books were written during a period when racism was at an even higher level than it is today. Personally I feel it was an AMAZING decision. Tensions between different groups in America are increasing, as people find outlets to voice their frustrations. Seeing a minority as a superhero in a high budget movie, I do feel like the ball is moving in the right direction! \nOverall I'd encourage people to watch it, but be prepared that the action is limited as the focus seems to be on realistic development.",

However this movie's final act is what really puts the nails straight into the coffin. Poor setup, weird and ultimately stupid action, and a villain that has no motives and looks like a pile of aluminum foil. One of the movie's other fatal flaws (one of about 50) is its tone. While it tries to be more realistic and gritty, it comes across cheesy and ... Lame. The characters have no real bond between them which is one of the main selling points of the fantastic 4. You know the \"team\" of the fantastic 4. This group hardly even feels like a group of friends by the end. They don't resolve the problems they have with one another, they don't have any real \"bonding moments\", and most of the time they are disagreeing with one another!

I am quite convinced that even if Fantastic Four 2015 wasn't pretty terrible, most fanboys would have condemned it for even existing.  And that, honestly, pisses me off.  I firmly believe that every movie deserves its day in court, regardless of background or any questionable business decisions involved in making it.  But after having thoroughly examined the accused, I have no choice but to pass a guilty sentence on most counts.  \n\nThe first half is surprisingly good, being mostly well-intentioned soft science-fiction, resembling something between Interstellar and Tomorrowland.  It's actually commendable that a modern superhero film take a deliberate pace and reserve action for the final reel.  It also features an effectively creepy series of scenes where our heroes are struggling to adjust to their newfound powers/afflictions while being prodded and observed by indifferent scientists.  It's chilling PG-13 body horror, and clearly influenced by David Cronenberg.  The cinematography is impressive and the visual aesthetic and effects are a giant improvement over the cheap and campy looking two previous installments.  It's clear that director Josh Trank (an indy director who made Chronicle) wanted a complete film with these elements and wanted to avoid typical superhero tropes.  However, the second half is absolutely terrible and resembles something that was tacked on last minute.  The plot becomes forgettable and rushed.  The main villain gets shoved in 20 minutes toward the end.  The final confrontation lasts less than 3 to 5 minutes, if that.  The action is awkward and schlocky.  And worst of all - it's boring.  It also strays too far from the source material and barely resembles what a Fantastic Four movie should look like.  (There fanboys.  I threw you a bone.)  Dr. Doom has a brief, cool scene in which he murders a dozen scientists by exploding their heads, but it's fleeting.  The cast (which has received immense criticism) tried earnestly to make the most of a questionable script.  Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, and Reg E. Cathey deserve citations of valor for courage under terrible circumstances.  The rest failed to make an impression.  \n\nThis is largely the result of 20th Century Fox hijacking the project and forcing the second half to more closely resemble the superhero movies they want to compete with.  But it was rushed and half-assed.  The strain shows and I wonder what Josh Trank's uncompromised sci-fi vision of a Fantastic Four movie would look like.  We will probably never know, and what we have here is a disaster on all fronts.  But to be fair, the reason for Fantastic Four's box office woes probably has more to do with the lack of action than its merits as a cohesive film.  Remember, audiences pay to see tons of stupid movies, as long as jokes, tits, or explosions are in order.  But Marvel Fans can rejoice, as Fox will undoubtedly sell this franchise to Marvel/Disney with only X-Men and Deadpool stubbornly resisting acquisition into the MCU.  If you have to see this, rent or stream it.  Enjoy the first half and cry yourself to sleep after watching the second.",

If so, they will be sorely disappointed as this was more the \"Mediocre Bunch,\" but the blame for this goes far beyond the four principal cast members although they have to take some heat as well. \nThe story is about as interesting as a nine-year-old telling an original ghost story at summer camp. Or a committee of Hollywood studio suits-which is where I think much of the blame belongs. Choose whatever trite label you wish: formulaic, predictable, cookie cutter-they all fit. There didn't seem to be an original thought in any of the narrative except for the scene showing where Ben Grimm gets his \"clobberin' time\" phrase.\nWatching this reminded me of two other \"major\" dsiappointments of the past, namely Dark Man in the 90s and the 1980's enviro-feminist mess that Dino DeLaurentis made of King Kong. However, what gave those two any sort of \"watchability\" were the up-and-comers in lead roles: Liam Neeson in the first and Jessica Lang in the other. Even though the viewer knew the scripts were \"gawdawful,\" the brilliance of those two actors was on display, which ironically is very evident in one piece demonstrating the \"acting chops\" of both at their absolute best, Rob Roy. However, I am not discussing a great movie here; I'm pointing out a weak one.\nAs mentioned, the cast is not fully responsible for this mess, but they are hardly blameless. In fact, other than Michael B. Jordon's performance as Johnny Storm, none of the others made any real impression other than the gum-snapping \"evil corporatist,\" and it's pretty easy to guess what reaction the audience would have toward him. As I said: formulaic, predictable, and cookie cutter. \nDr. Doom was Mr. Goth Gloom missing only eyeliner, clove cigarettes, or a penchant for listening to The Cure; Sue Storm was blonde-apparently her sole qualification for the part; Reed Richards, while not bad, doesn't really shine (I'll avoid the obvious pun concerning any acting abilities here).\nIn fact, the only thing worth sitting through during this mess was the music, so it was no surprise to see Phillip Glass's name attached to the music. However, even that is a bit depressing since he is known for being  involved in cutting edge and non-commercial work. Still, were it not for that, the single star here wouldn't even have made it.\nThere are two items worth mentioning: the first is that I never saw Stan Lee show up in this film (although I may have missed that), and the second is that this is the first Marvel production in a long time that had no \"bonus\" tease after the credits. So, perhaps the \"minds\" behind this knew better than to even try and pretend that this was on par with the other work coming from this studio.",

The first half hour makes you believe the film has plenty of potential and starts off intriguing, but once the team gets their powers, it just leads to more build up. I swear, this entire film is just setting up for another movie and makes it feel more like a pilot episode for a TV show. However, though it is mostly build up of the characters, the chemistry between the actors is pretty strong. Once Dr. Doom does come though, the film throws a complete curveball with a random and pretty forgettable third act. Also, Doom's motivations were just ridiculous considering you never saw anything like it when he was Victor. So apart from strong chemistry and a good opening, the film just feels like a scene after scene lead up and is beat down with a pretty generic third act. I give props to all the actors, but overall it can't save the film. I definitely wouldn't recommend it but don't think it's the Batman and Robin of this decade. D+.",

I felt Dr.Doom's  portrayal  was very different, in a bad way. As a comic book reader Dr.Doom is a bad ass, he's a powerful leader with a fearful name, and a king!

It feels like there was a second director. Doctor Doom is introduced late as the villain and we're left with a movie that's feels like a waif. The groundwork is great actually to possibly make a great sequel that is on par with Fox's other comic book heroes, X-Men. The origin story was just a little too crammed yet a little too thin. It was defiantly battling visions as there were 3 screenwriters and rumors of editing room battles. Josh Trank can't be blamed for this movie alone. I say this was a product of battling, divorcing parents who emotionally abused their child till there was no emotion left in it.

            "content": "So the one-massively criticized superhero flick is here, and it's been called one of the worst movies ever made, a crappy Batman & Robin, and even \"Craptastic Bore\", but is it really that bad? The not so Fantastic Four is defently an origin story that takes well too long to tell, and that forgets important plot details and that's well too short to be a superhero-flick and that never really pays off. \n\nThe first act is definitely the greater aspect, with its interesting plot and somewhat exciting events. But there are also some inlogical things, especially when it comes to the editing. That lack of greatness really escalated later in the second and third act. The characters are always the major detail of every movie that needs to be well written and presented, but I'm wondering if the writers were drunk or just stupid while they were writing it, because it's just so badly done. It took the half part of the movie just to get the characters going, so it took well too long to introduce them. The second thing is that we never got to see how our heroes developed and got control over their powers. The major reason is that the editing is so terrible. They skipped everything from how they got to learn to control their powers to how their friendships and chemistry developed! They therefor missed important plot and character details. That's a serious mistake for one that just were a part of the development of the X-Men franchise, well good luck on getting back there!\n\nThat's just one small aspect with all the big mistakes in this reboot, and another one is definitely the many and serious plot-holes throughout the whole movie. The storytelling is also very messy and just weird from time to time. But the real mistake is the lack of a greater third act. We didn't get to see the wrath of the villain until like 20 minutes before the movie ended...what the hell?! Another thing is that Dr Doom is extremely vaguely presented and there are very little relatable aspects with him. He's ugly too, and you can't really feel that understanding of him, why he's the villan. The only great thing about him is that he's defently scary. So yeah, it's not a flawless movie, not by a long shot.\n\nBut it doesn't end there; The crappy Fantastic Four also got some predictable moments, and dialogs here and there, and the movie is extremely short. The major BAD thing is that there are so much plot and character story missing, but why is the movie so short then? There are even shots in the trailers that looked promising, and some of them wasn't in the movie! Im stunned by how this movie even became to be this bad. Even the climax is just too short and well too rushed for its own good. Sure it got some cool moments, but ohh myy it tries to be serious, but it totally fails due to terrible editing and storytelling; not to mention some of the vague CGI and forced humor. \n\nIt's understandable why many out there hates it; it's full of enormous flaws. One of the most flaw-filled movie I've ever seen with its lack of plot and character details, character development, massive amount of plot-holes, messy editing, vague and non-relatable villain and of course the forced humor, rushed third act and the dry chemistry between the characters after they got their not so fantastic powers. But it got some bright aspects too; like great actors, good soundtrack and somewhat okay dialogs, but that's sometimes forced to the audience (fact-based dialogs).\n\nSure it got some okay aspects and you can still watch it, but the flaws are just so big and impossible to hide from. It's indeed a bad movie with it's terrible editing and lack of a Marvel-entertainment that steals the show nowadays. Give the rights back to Marvel or try again Fox!\n\nThe reboot that failed.\n\nCritical rating: 2/10\nPersonal rating: 5.5/10",

The movie started out out ok but took a nose dive and stayed slowly eventful and very boring. The thing (which would have been a GREAT hook for kids) didn't get nearly enough screen time was over shadowed by Johnny storm doing the same flyby and invisible women floating around in a invisible cocoon over and over again.

This movie is not good, do not misunderstand me, however if Doom was given more screen time to be fleshed out, and the big finale at the end stayed under the science-fiction/horror vibe of the first two acts, this film really could have been fantastic. There are a few silly lines in the first half of the film but besides that, it holds up very well and is a solid introduction to the movie. It does not feel like a superhero movie and funny enough, when it begins to feel that way is when it turns to shit. Watching these characters post returning to Earth and while becoming aware of their abilities, you could really see the fear and discomfort in their eyes. I really took a liking to these moments because it felt different from every other superhero origin movie we've seen. \n\nThen, we reach the \"1 Year Later\" mark. I didn't mind this idea because in many ways it worked and skipped over a lot of what we are sick of seeing from origin films. The only problem is it came too early. The audience just needed maybe another ten minutes of these frightening reveal scenes to then be satisfied with that jump in time but instead became a missed opportunity. This would have been easy to cope with if it were the only mistake. The action scenes were lackluster, also with potential to fun. When the Thing confronts Mr. Fantastic in the woods, it astounds me that there was not a big fight between these two former friends. This could have been a huge scene and instead ends within seconds of starting when the Thing head-butts Reed. It's almost like they wanted fans to get excited over the first big fight in the movie, only to realize it never comes. Then, to make matters worse, once Doom is back in the picture, the movie decides to abandon all of its originality and become an under-parred superhero movie which under this new tone loses all of its foundation. Dooms motives were interesting if only they were explained more. I liked the direction however eventually it hit a dead road. If we were able to see Doom on Planet Zero and shown him growing fond of this world and understanding why he needed to destroy Earth to be happy with it, then he would have made a fine villain. Instead, he's practically worthless and simply a villain just to be a villain. This movie is extremely frustrating because while watching, I saw so many paths it could have taken that would have benefitted the entirety of the film and instead, each time steered further and further away from where it should have been heading. This is the saddest movie flop of all time because of the never ending potential it had. I'm in love with the cast, the director, the writers, and obviously because of the X-Men have faith in the studio of Fox, so the fact that this film is hated instead of praised like its big brother franchise (X-Men) is truly heartbreaking. \nIf you want to see a good Fantastic Four movie, watch this one up until they find Doom and then turn it off as quickly as possible.",

Also probably the worst depiction of an iconic marvel villain. The performances were pretty disappointing even though it had a pretty impressive cast, their expressions were unrealistic and kind of mechanical.

            "content": "Few movies have had such a prominent stink of negativity attached to them as Fox's Fantastic Four reboot, a movie that is already being considered amongst the worst superhero movies of all time. Director Josh Trank (Chronicle) was given the freedom to go darker, emphasize more science fiction, and select a cast of respected actors rather than bankable names. Then came rumors of aloof and secluded behavior on set from Trank. Then came rumors that Fox and producer/co-writer Simon Kinberg (X-Men: Days of Future Past) effectively shuttered Trank from his own movie, reshooting 40-minutes of a 90-minute film to salvage the wayward production (get ready for plenty of stuff in trailers not to be in the finished film). Not quite the room-clearing disaster of rampant speculation, the new Fantastic Four is a superhero movie that never really gets started and has constant battles with tone, characterization, and plot. It seems like the real villains of the movie are the Fox executives who signed off on the \"gritty, gloomy\" rendition and then interfered when they got too scared, managing to undercut the original vision, muddy an already messy film, and make things even worse. The behind-the-scenes drama is easily more interesting than anything that happens in this movie. \n\nReed Richards (Miles Teller) is a science genius recruited by Dr. Storm (Reg E. Cathey). Reed invented a makeshift teleporting device as a young child with the help of his friend, Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell). At Dr. Storm's lab, Reed works with Storm's children, Sue (Kate Mara) and Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), and a morose computer programmer, Victor Von Doom (Tony Kebbell). The group transports to another dimension but is attacked by a strange green energy cloud. Victor is left behind. The surviving foursome exhibits unique abilities. Reed can stretch his body. Sue can turn invisible and create force fields. Johnny can fly and set his body on fire. Poor Ben is a hulking rock monster. Reed promises to find a way to reverse what happened to them, but the re-emergence of Dr. Doom puts the fate of the entire world at risk. \n\nIt should be of little surprise that Fantastic Four feels like two different movies awkwardly and inarticulately smashed together. For the first hour, the movie follows the path of our heroes and their contraction of their powers. Rather than the gee-whiz fun of getting superpowers, the characters view themselves as freaks, their bodies turned against them, and their colleagues deeply afraid of them. It's a far moodier antidote to the vicarious thrills of gaining special abilities. There are some effective sequences that channel David Cronenberg's The Fly and Scanners, and it's these brief moments where you feel Trank's vision connect the most. Doom walking down a hallway and making heads explode, in a PG-13 way, is horrifying and cool. The problem for Trank, and the movie as a whole, is that this first hour still isn't a very good movie. It takes far too long for these characters to get blasted by green space goo and become supers. The setup is so protracted and needless. Did we need to see how these characters came together? Did we need to see their childhoods? It's not essential to see the team come together when we can already start from that point. In a sense, it reminded me of how needless I felt Pixar's Monsters University was; did we need to see how these colleagues became friends? Despite this action-free opening half, the screenplay could have fleshed out the four main characters to justify the added time, but it's hard for the movie to justify much. \n\nThese are some of the most boring and underdeveloped characters in recent comic book lore. If these versions of the Fantastic Four existed in the 1960s, they wouldn't have made it to issue number two. Reed is smart. Sue is smart too but also standoffish (and adopted). Johnny likes fast cars. Ben is tough and loyal. Victor is a pessimist who called dibs on flirting with Sue. That is really about it, folks. Ben disappears for most of the film, called in to make the trans-dimensional jump because Reed feels like Ben deserves to be there since he helped create an early prototype with Reed. Actually, let's talk about that scene. It's a high school science fair yet the only other displays we see are clearly for much younger children, and yet Dr. Storm is visiting an all-ages school science fair to groom talent? That seems weird. Why does Dr. Storm offer the same offer to Ben, who helped Reed design and build his early teleporting machine? Regardless, Reed leaves his childhood pal behind with Ben's abusive family. That's because he's a good friend. Then, once the horrible transformations occur and Ben gets the worst of it, Reed runs out on him again. Sure it's in the pursuit of finding a cure, but who's to say he couldn't do that in the already constructed government super science lab? Sue doesn't even go on the first trans-dimensional voyage; it's just a boy's club. Sue spends more time in this movie staring at computer screens and looking intently than any action. It's probably for the best, though, because the scenes of her flying around in a bubble made me think of Glinda the Good Witch. I'm not a Kate Mara fan. I've found the majority of her performances to be stilted, but even I can admit she's given nothing to do here but move her eyes from the left to eh right and inform Miles Teller about Portishead, a band that's only 20-plus years old. It's sad but the most interesting part of Johnny is that a black actor, a point that caused certain more irritable fans to foam at the mouth at the adaptation, is playing him. If these super heroes aren't going to be super until halfway through the movie, they better be interesting characters. They are not even close. \n\nIt's with the return of Dr. Doom that the movie makes its inept transition into the second movie, the one reshot by the producers and the studio. In an implausibly fast amount of time we're given our villain of the movie and he sets off to open a black hole to destroy Earth because... we're self-destructive? So humanity is self-destructive so Doom is going to destroy humanity? I would also like to know exactly how Doom survived for over a year in the alternate dimension when it clearly looks like there is nothing of substance for miles, unless green goop is edible. Did he just lose the need to go to the bathroom? Doom's powers are rather nebulous, which makes it even less interesting when the Fantastic Four decides to, get this, work together to beat the bad guy. For a movie that hasn't had one action sequence until its final act, now our characters must band together to stop Doom and his giant flashing blue light black hole thingy. The special effects are pretty undistinguished and hard to read at times. I'd also like to remark how hideously this other dimension looks. It's all rocky crags and dark clouds; it's like a less successful timeshare for the residents of Mordor. It doesn't quite look like the paradise that Doom describes it as (the brochure lied to us!). This jumbled conclusion feels so ham-fisted and rushed, a villain and a typical world-destroying fate that must be thwarted at the last minute. Things just sort of happen rather than storylines finding payoffs, and then it's all sort of over and the resolution echoes the very end of Avengers: Age of Ultron, even with the credits cutting off the vocal iteration of the title heroes. It's so transparently different in tone, sloppy in development and execution, and so quickly introduced and resolved, that the whole conclusion comes across as forcibly laughable.\n\nAt the end of watching the dire Fantastic Four reboot, I felt more sympathy for Josh Trank. He still deserves blame for helping to conceive and develop such a misshapen story and squander his actors. After three duds and whatever you want to call the 1994 Roger Corman adaptation, it feels like maybe this franchise is just cursed. Maybe these characters are too dated and their powers are too silly. Then again we know that these characters can work in the format of a movie because a good Fantastic four movie already exists, and it's called The Incredibles. It doesn't seem like anyone is going to come away completely clean from this misfire and financial flop, especially now that Trank and executives are engaging in a P.R. blame game. Fox was hoping for a rekindled franchise. Now they may be hoping to work out a deal for Marvel to buy back the rights to the characters. I would have been interested to see the full vision of what Trank was going for, especially since the one scene that feels most adamant is the best sequence in an admittedly mediocre super hero film. At least the movie would feel cohesive. It probably wouldn't be good but at least it would be committed to trying something different. Instead, the movie tries to be different from the super hero blockbusters populating the landscape and then, at the last minute, tries to follow their lead and become one of them, becoming its own misshapen and poorly developed blob. It's not the worst super hero movie in history (that honor still has to belong to the atomic bomb of taste, Batman & Robin), but even achieving sustained mediocrity is too much to expect. \n\nNate's Grade: C-",

            "content": "Fantastic Four, (or FANT4STIC as promoted) is a film directed by Josh Trank, starring Miles Teller, Jamie Bell, Kate Mara and Michael B. Jordan as the four leading characters. Overall, we have never received a Fantastic Four film that fills the success of the comic version. From the old 80's original, to the new 2015 rehash of the franchise, there never has been a Fantastic Four film that grasps success compared to other Marvel comic book films, such as the Spiderman franchise.\n\nI do not recommend this film, yet this recommendation is conditional. I enjoyed this film for the actors dedication, yet the dull, poor plot didn't grasp me at all. So if you are above the age of 12, and have heard of the Fantastic Four, I do not recommend this film. It is a simple way to use big comic book names, and produce a poor film, with so much hype that it's labelled as a 'Must See' from trailer reviewers who lack interest in Comic book originals.\n\nEven as a child, I don't think I would enjoy this film, there is so much plot jump, from one point of view to the next, switching from one dull story to the next, then finally this all links into one big, dull, twist of expected, poorly written events that there was nothing that caught the eye of anyone who was there with me when we saw this film.\n\nThis film takes itself far too seriously, and as a comic book fan, who is open minded, and hopeful for all franchises and faithful to such talent such as Michael B. Jordan, I am very disappointed with this production.\n\nIt is expected now that further income for the production will be from viewers who have heard how poor this films was.",

            "content": "Where to even begin... So -- I believe that a majority of the reason this film received such poor reviews is because everyone is comparing it to all other marvel films, as well as the original fantastic four. If you don't compare it to anything, and just address it as a film on its own - it was slow, nothing really happened, didn't bring anything new to the genre, and had very little substance. On its own, i would give it a 57%. However, if you compare it to the other marvel movies which have set the ball as being some of the most action-packed, epic films of all time, that 57 drops to a 47% and then when you compare it with the original fantastic four, which people everywhere communally agreed never exsited, this film is actually WORSE than that one, so that drops it to a 37%. So I would give this a 37% for lack of everything. That being said -- its not as though you would watch this and cringe. There is nothing inherently bad about it. It's not a terrible film. Its just sort of pointless. One thing to keep in mind about this film is that it was really created so that Sony could keep the right to the fantastic four franchise to prevent it from reverting back to marvel and offering a competitor studio a chance at another potentially fruitful series. After having released a statement saying they plan on going ahead with a second Fantastic Four film set in this universe that will be more epic and have more action - I feel, based on this film and the characters and world they established, it has a shot at being a 70%, but I can't expect anything more than that based on the sheer lack of originality and delivery. The only thing I really liked about this film was Mr.Stretches stretchyness. They did a good job with that. Thats about it. Also; Kate Mara looks the best she ever has, but they don't really show her much.",

            "content": "The Fantastic Four returns to theaters in this dark and gritty reboot and the result in anything but fantastic, more in the ways of pathetic and horrendous. The Fantastic Four has had a troubled history on screen. Roger Corman produced in a film in 1994 which was never released into theaters, with the characters finding their first official on screen adventure in 2005's Fantastic Four, directed by Tim Story. Despite mixed reviews, the film was still a success at the box office and warranted a sequel entitled Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, released in 2007. While that film received mixed reviews, slightly better than the 2005 film, it wasn't considered a box office success, causing Twentieth Century Fox to abort a third film and reboot the franchise all together. This new version arrives eight years after Rise of the Silver Surfer and ten years after the first, and the result is absolutely terrible.\n\nThis film has been known for its behind the scenes production problems, which have been highly talked about and appeared on the internet. Director Josh Trank and the studio, Fox, had a difficult relationship, while even Trank was known for being difficult to work with and erratic on set, causing various problems, including damages worth around $100,000 involving a house rented out to him.\n\nThe film focuses on Reed Richards, a high school student, who is working on a teleportation device, with help from his friend Ben Grimm. Their work attracts the attention of Professor Franklin Storm, director of the Baxter Foundation, which is funded by the government. Storm recruits Reed, who joins his adopted daughter Susan Storm to help complete a Quantum Gate, with aid from Johnny Storm, Franklin's biological son and Victor Von Doom, the creator of the Gate. After successfully testing the Gate by sending a monkey to an alternate dimension, the government decides to coordinate with Nasa by sending their own people through the Gate, forcing Reed, Johnny, Victor and a reluctant Ben to decide to carry out their own expedition. Arriving to the dimension, the group is suddenly threatened and attempts to escape, leaving Victor behind after he supposedly dies. Upon returning, the three survivors, as well as Susan, suddenly develop strange powers, prompting the government to test them. This is where the whole film goes down hill.\n\nThe film doesn't really have any real structure, who no exact pacing, while it appears like a badly put-together jigsaw puzzle with all the wrong pieces and none of the right pieces. The result is a film with no real pacing. Almost every scene seems rushed, while there is no real resolution.\n\nThe cast, sadly, doesn't do well in this film, which is a shame, since they are good actors. Miles Teller doesn't seem fit for the role of Reed and doesn't seem like a scientist. In much of the film, while he attempts to put forth scientific equations and tests, he at times feels more like an outcast. After the team develops their powers, Reed disappears, going into hiding, which doesn't really support the film or have any real merit to the plot. It just feels like it's thrown in there. Going along with Teller, Trank fought for him to be in the role, but after casting and before production, there's news that Trank and Teller developed a bad relationship, which could have effected the character and Teller's performance. Kate Mara, as Susan, is terrible, which is sad, since I have found her best performance to be in House of Cards. There is news that Fox insisted on her casting and that Trank treated her coldly as a result, possibly resulting in what we have screen. That there is really disappointing, since Mara probably could have given much more to the role and the film. Jamie Bell isn't convincing as Ben Grimm, though he handles the performance of the Thing perfectly. The same goes with Michael B. Jordan who isn't convincing as Johnny Storm and isn't given much to do with. Both Jordan and Bell are fine actors and like with Teller and Mara, it's a shame to see them not have much to do. Toby Kebbell isn't menacing or convincing as Victor Von Doom, while he doesn't prove to be a scientific genius, more like an anti-social outsider, which greatly ruins and effects the character. Tim Blake Nelson chews the scenery as government stooge Dr. Allen and Reg E. Cathey isn't interesting as mentor Franklin Storm.\n\nA big problem with this film is the pacing. Like I said before, the film feels like a badly put-together jigsaw puzzle. There's no real structure, while it seems that the film skips the second act and goes straight to the third act, which instantly makes no sense to the viewer and to the film's story. After the team gains their powers and Reed goes into hiding, the film instantly cuts to a year later, which effects the film. Johnny, Susan and Ben have learned how to handle and use their powers, though we never see them learning how to use them. I would have liked to see them training to learn their powers, since this would have made for sense as to how later in the film they know how to control them. In Iron Man and Batman Begins, you had an origin as to Tony Stark creating the Iron Man uniform and Bruce Wayne developing the Bat-Suit, here though there is no real origin. It seems forced. Another major problem is that the team never has a real threat to face. There are reports that before production began Fox cut three key action scenes from the film, which probably one of the main reasons as to why after gaining their powers, developing them and using them, they don't face a real threat. In Iron Man, you have Tony facing off against his terrorist captors in Gulmira after he masters the Iron Man suit. In Batman Begins, Bruce takes down Carmine Falcone and starts to slowly liberate Gotham City. Here, no real threat.\n\nWhich also brings us to Dr. Doom. In the comics, Dr. Doom is a well-known villain and one of the chief adversaries of the Fantastic Four. Here, he doesn't seem like a real villain. After escaping the dimension and leaving Victor behind, since they believe him to be dead, I kept wondering where the villain was, how was he plotting his return. When Nelson's character sends a small group back to the dimension after Reed fixes the Gate, they find Doom and the film is almost over, a major problem I also had with Hugh Laurie's so-called villainous character in Tomorrowland. Here, sadly, Doom isn't a real threat, he's underused. Even Tim Blake Nelson isn't a real threat, he's more like a scenery chewing villain. Sure he wants to use the Fantastic Four as government weapons and take over the alternate dimension, but still there's no real motivation. The same with Dr. Doom, which is a problem. In The Dark Knight, the Joker's motivation is clear: he wants to cause chaos, destroy Gotham and bend Batman to his will. Even if Skyfall, Javier Bardem's Silva wants to kill M and gain revenge. Here, Doom has no real motivation. Doom isn't even a danger to the team.\n\nThe team also doesn't seem like a real team. They don't seem like the Fantastic Four. All of a sudden, after Doom's appearance and threat, do they manage to work together and trust each other. Up until than, not so much. Once again, it would have seemed better for the team to get know each other, their powers and how to work together. Here, it seems forced.\n\nWhile the special effects in the film are fine, especially with the Thing, Reed, Johnny and Susan, the ones for Doom are not. It seems that toward the end, the studio came to the point where they felt they developed good effects for the other characters, but didn't need to for Doom. Here it's a shame. Doom doesn't look interesting. He seems more like a crash-test dummy thrown into acid, more like a joke.\n\nThe other problem with the film is that it is also too dark. This is a problem, since every comic book movie doesn't need to be dark, gritty and grounded. While it worked with Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and even several films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it didn't really work with the Spider-Man reboot, The Amazing Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man 2. It's almost as if some filmmakers have started to think that if Nolan could darken Batman and ground him and make him gritty, other comic book films can do the same. Not so much. The gritty and bleak feel ruins Fantastic Four. It would have worked better if this film was lighter and more colorful, more like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man.\n\nMarco Beltrami and Philip Glass try their best with the score, but seem to be underused at times, which is also a shame, considering that they are great composers.\n\nThe end result is a film that seems to be made by committee, by a bunch of board members sitting in a room and throwing out ideas. While we can blame Fox for interfering with the director, we should also probably blame Trank. While he claims that his version would have been better had Fox not interfered, the big question is: How would had it been better? \n\nWhat Fox needs to do is give this property back to Marvel, who will probably make a way better film, or else choose a director that they can trust and work well on this kind of film. The film isn't fantastic, it's pathetic. Terrible. Horrendous.\n\nThe only good thing is that it's 100 minutes long and when the credits appear, you are pleased that it's over, despite wasting 100 minutes of your life on a real clunker. This one is a real mess and will probably stand as the worst comic book film, worst than Batman and Robin, while it also makes 2005's Fantastic Four appears much better and a lot like art. Which isn't saying much honestly. Pass on this film and see a better comic book film.",

            "content": "Marvel is going be one of the best studios to transform their comics into films, that is actually perfected well. Their recent slew of movies based on their properties has been well received amongst both critics and audiences alike. Until now. With the release of \"Fantastic Four\", the studio has stumbled upon a major dud, and might set the company back for a little while. The film itself is bad film, but it is definitely not the worst movie Marvel has released. There is potential here, we're just not seeing it. \"Fantastic Four\" is a perfect example of letting a studio take over the production, and supplying the needs and wants of the fans. And ultimately, it just comes out as one big mess.\n\nThe plot involves four young minds working on a way to teleport towards another dimension. Unfortunately, a freak accident causes the quartet to gain supernatural powers. These include Reed Richards (Miles Teller) developing elasticity throughout his entire body. Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) setting his entire body on fire. Sue Storm (Kate Mara) can turn invisible and create forcefields. And Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) whose whole body has been transformed into a piece of solid rock. Can the four of them work together, or will their personal issues get in the way?\n\nOh, boy. \"Fantastic Four\" is a bad movie. To begin with, the special effects look nice, but it feels like everything is fake, especially with Bell's Thing; whenever the character is on screen, all the audience sees is just a computer generated image walking around. It defeats the illusion of what we're seeing isn't always there. The sets, again, look nice, but everything is done in the computer, it makes the audience wonder why the filmmakers didn't bother with building actual sets that looked real enough to make the audience think it is believable. It just feels cheap and unnecessary. The editing is another big issue as everything (except for the first third), feels absolutely rushed, and makes the whole production feel predictable.\n\nBut the biggest issue that the movie has going for it is the writing. There are various plot threads that feel left out, and could have been explored a bit further. The team gets their powers way too easily; we get the traditional training montage of the team using their powers, and we've seen it done before. Along with the terrible editing, the writing plays a role in this traditional formula by expanding the timeline of events happening in the movie with no regards with what is going on. This happens, and this happens; it's just formulaic.\n\nNow, with that being said, is there anything good about the movie? Well, the cast does a good job in their roles, and their direction by Josh Trank isn't bad. Plus, the orchestrated score does a nice job setting the tone of the film. But other than that, the film just suffers from the aforementioned problems.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Fantastic Four\" could have easily been given another chance, had the production actually spent some time in the editing room and doing what they want, instead of what we got in its place. Overall, this is is just a fantastic mess.",

            "content": "As an avid comic book reader, I was never fond of the Fantastic Four (established 1961), sure they have some compelling space story lines, but I always felt they worked better in a larger spectrum with other Marvel characters (in the comics). Whether it is Reed geeking out with his other science bros like Tony Stark (Iron Man), Dr Hank Pym (Ant Man) & Peter Parker (Spider-Man) or when the Thing takes (or at least tries) on the Hulk or Invisible Woman/ Sue Storm aka Sue Richards having an undeniable chemistry with Namor (Marvels version of Aquaman) or Logan (Wolverine), this four characters (including Johny Storm aka Human Torch) just together living as a family never really interested me much. Well except for the exception of their main antagonist Dr Doom (IGN ranked him as #4 on best villains of all time). But yet as a huge fan of the super hero genre, it is disappointing to see how despite millions of fans (& story lines),  the Fantastic Four have never seen a good Big screen adaptation. There was a movie in 1994 made by Roger Corman (king of the B-Movies), which was never released. It was only made to secure rights for a friend, and is stuff of pure cinema legend and sought out by cult film fanatics. If you've seen any YouTube clips of it, you know it's terrible (Update: the movie has found its way online). Let's fast forward to 2005, where the guy who made the 'Barbershop' movies director Tim Story was given the opportunity to make a 'Fantastic Four' movie. If you can recall it, you'd remember it was pretty enjoyable yet, Jessica Alba was really the only memorable thing from the movies, or at least the most talked about. Nevertheless, the film was a box office success enough to guarantee a 2007 sequel 'Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007)' which was pretty awful.  'Fantastic Four' is one of those Marvel properties that has yet to be turned over to Marvel itself, and is still owned by 20th Century Fox, which is unfortunate, because that studio still has no clue what it's doing with this franchise. That brings us up to date with 2015's reboot directed by Josh Trank. Trank's only other credit was the awesome \"found footage\" superhero film 'Chronicle', but supposedly Trank is very difficult to work with, which is why he was booted off the upcoming 'Star Wars' film. Whatever good 'Chronicle' had going for it is non-existent here with 'Fantastic Four' and seems like it's one long set up for something yet to come. Right from the production & the casting (controversial casting of Michael B Jordan, an African American actor in an essential white role), the film has been making news for all the wrong reasons. I think the first major clue for me that this movie was doomed (no pun intended) was, the 1st trailer itself! A super hero film trailer which was not exciting! Even duds like Elektra & Ghost Rider had better looking trailers. Another major clue for me that this movie was doomed was its running time of 100 minutes. Why? Because when you have a film like this - a reboot, where it has to introduce various new characters, set them up and a new premise/universe, the movie isn't going to be an hour and a half long. It's going to be two hours. Those extra twenty- thirty minutes can make a difference. For the record, the first two Fantastic Four movies had around the same running time. The original film was only six minutes longer. But that movie wasn't the best one, either. I reminded myself of X-Men. X-Men was a great movie. It had a similar running time, but not the same task, as it wasn't a reboot, well kinda. Yet as the first installment in a franchise, it did a fantastic job at setting things up. Yet, with Josh Trank at the helm & a talented cast of Miles Teller (who was awesome in Whiplash last year), Kate Mara (exceptional in Netflix' House of Cards), Michael B Jordan (brilliant in Fruitvale Station) & Jamie Bell (excellent in TURN: Washington's Spies), I wanted to give this film a chance despite the wide spread negative reviews pounding the internet. In my opinion, its not as bad as the reviews are pointing it out to be, in the sense its not 'the worst superhero film', like common did everyone forget Batman & Robin, Elektra, Hulk, Iron Man 2 & Catwoman? This is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.  The film's plot really potential & it does manage to have some great moments, but it just takes too much time to become interesting, long enough to make us not care. The story follows young genius, Reed Richards, who at the beginning of the film, working on an experiment that attempts to construct a teleportation device. It was hardly a success as the object they've sent to who-knows-where, never returned. Seven years later, now teenage Reed (Miles Teller) is again trying his luck on the same experiment. The attempt yields a better result but is still dismissed as a magic trick by his high school teacher, but not by Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), who at that moment, is drawn with utter interest to Richard's experiments. The meeting brings Richard's feet to Baxter Institute where he is joined by Storm's adopted daughter, Sue (Kate Mara), his son, Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), and his ex protegee Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell), to work in completing a larger and more advanced version of Richard's device. The success of their effort prompts their team to send all of them four to their target alternate universe, but the consequence is far worse than they could imagine. It's easy to dismiss Trank's Fantastic Four as an unfortunate victim of superhero fatigue that emerges in the wake of the continuous influx of superhero movies inundating the big screen, but you can't shrug off its fatal narrative flaws that include unfocused pace and bland character developments. The latter may have been completely covered by the actors playing the two-dimensional characters, but ex-positional defects keep sending them to becoming something the audience might find hard to care about. Perhaps its the ill-contrived rationales behind how all the often-sense-deprived proceedings work, that keeps the film constructing a form, worth-of- attention, or the forced CGI-gimmicks that strip the sense off the moment's supposedly strong sentiments, that hampers its spectators' ability to absorb its message, and thus, feel that the dangers these characters are about to face, is real. Either way, it's difficult to care, much less find reasons why we still should. The running time really is a problem. This film is rushed beyond belief and its plot is nonsensical. The characters' introductions are decent enough, particularly the Fantastic Four, but their roles throughout the rest of the film are disconcerted. Exposition can be tiring, but after the exposition ended and the action was supposed to pick up - it didn't. Second, the plot. As I said above, the film's plot seemed interesting. It had potential and it looked like it could go somewhere, especially considering how superhero movies nowadays have managed to flesh out their stories and make them very enjoyable. There are even hints at awesome things to come at certain points. But the film's in shambles. You hope and feel it will go somewhere, but in its hour and a half running time, it feels so empty. One of the reasons for that is the third thing, the writing. The writing isn't good - the film's climactic conflict feels backed up into the end of the movie, because there wasn't enough time to set it up. The writing caused the pacing to be terrible - transitions between scenes weren't good and some scenes either went on for too long or were far too short. Speaking of \"things\", The Thing is entirely CGI. No make-up, costume or anything - just a giant, naked rock monster. Yes, he's naked, too. Not even any shorts. Huh. But yet, in his shortest screen time, he will probably be the only thing you remember. Did I talk about Doom? I don't get it why cant FOX just stick to his comic book origins? It may sound a bit flashy, but its anything better than what they have been providing us with. Sure the Doom here is way more efficient & creepy than the previous films, but what is with him being this dis grunted blogger, & shouldn't they have mentioned he is going to appear on screen for only five minutes or so. Doom makes an unsurprising return here as their common enemy, driven by a fusion of body and alien matter to cause global destruction and around whose defeat to ensure the survival of planet Earth becomes a rallying call for the team to unite despite their differences. It is one of the dullest and most unexciting finales we've seen in a Marvel movie, not least for the fact that it doesn't know how to collectively bring together their superpowers except in a tag-team fashion to distract their opponent. There's probably some salvageable remnants left in Fox's previous attempts to bring one of Marvel's most popular superhero team to the big screen. That's maybe what Fox thinks in pushing this new adaptation, given how franchises keep being rebooted and resurrected these days, assuming either lighter or darker takes, to pull away themselves from the shadows of their previous (most often, forgettable) forms. The latter is more evident with this film, as Director Josh Trank, puts a darker spin to it, employing a grittier feel to its plot. While that is true and recognizable, there's no denying of its desperate efforts to emulate its Marvel predecessors. Trank's intention of emphasizing the tension within the quartet is evident and admirable, but is ultimately undone by a script that doesn't develop it in any substantive manner. Worse still, it leaves an audience looking for visual spectacle severely wanting, that not even a very busy third act manages to salvage. The way the characters get their powers is more interesting and more realistic, and the team is assembled, but they skip any kind of training montage to a single display of their abilities which are not yet honed, we skip all that to introduce the main villain. He is majorly overpowered for reasons unknown, but the action finally begins, only for the movie to end after the first and only super showdown. On the whole, 'Fantastic Four' is a not so fantastic effort to build a franchise! Despite a likeable cast, a weak story,  a cringe worthy script & average special effects, the film turns out to be one of the most disappointing films I have seen all year. To be honest I was really enjoying the movie until the end and it straight up didn't deliver after making us get to know these characters, and making us wait to see the good stuff! I don't think this 'franchise' needs to crossover into any other universe, be it preferably Marvel and not X-Men, as it's got enough potential to hold it's own, and I'd give a sequel a chance because it's a step in the right direction, which is still scheduled for a release on June 2017.",

In this day in age, I thought graphics would be immense, but what we were lift with as an ending product was barely professional CGI effects, and this was partly why this movie was such a fail (don't get me started on the whole Trank and Fox situation). A successful film for me is seeing development in your on screen characters, and again this is where another amount of disappointment originated from. there was just hardly any chemistry, which is so annoying because I loved the casting!!!! Enough of the negativity! this film did also contain some really good scenes, such as when they all got their powers! *Spoiler Alert* although wasn't a fan of Sue not going to Planet Zero, but it was still good! I would watch it again, but I hope for sake of the Blu Ray it comes with an alternate version or extended cut!",

Let's start with the controversies/geek problems: Johnny Storm is African-American? Irrelevant, Michael B. Jordan is a good actor. It is not a faithful adaptation of the source material? As far as I understand this closely follows the Ultimate Version. Josh Trank is a problematic director? Bryan Singer had those problems in the first \"X-Men\" film and everyone loves that. They disrespect these \"iconic\" characters? Honestly this super team is extremely silly and dated due to their 60s origins, and even Marvel killed the F4 comic books as they are so focused in their CU (that is truly a disrespectful move to fans). This looks like the worst super hero film of recent years? Have you seen \"Daredevil\", \"Elektra\", \"Thor\", \"Thor: The Dark World\", \"X-Men Origins Wolverine\", and \"The Incredible Hulk\"?! A comic book film is supposed to be comedic and colorful? The best super hero trilogy - \"The Dark Knight Trilogy\"- is dark and sophisticated; it is not a bad thing to go to this direction, just because it isn't made by Marvel Studios that doesn't mean is awful, but of course it depends on the execution. Is this the worst super hero film of all time? It isn't worse than \"Superman IV\", \"Batman & Robin\", or the examples named earlier. It is the worst Fantastic Four film? Have you seen those last three films?! There is nothing lower than that. \nWith all that being said, \"Fantastic Four\" is a mess. It is horribly edited, the CGI is horrible (I haven't seen CGI this bad in a summer blockbuster since \"X-Men Origins\"), the characters are underdeveloped, the villain is laughable, the second half is dreadful, a rushed and laughably incoherent ending, and it is incredibly short for a comic book film. But even if it suffers from those colossal problems due to the creative issues and the problematic production, this isn't the abomination people claim it is (a lower score than \"Quest for Peace\", \"Pixels\", \"Jupiter Ascending\", and \"Howard the Duck\"? You got to be kidding me). The first half of this film had potential as it has character development, the cast deliver the best performances they could (with the exception being the not so well utilized Kate Mara), some of the imagery is good, the \"Chronicle\" style works perfectly with this characters, and there is even a scene that tries to emulate Cronenberg\u00b4s body horror. \n\"Fantastic Four\" is a bad movie, no doubt about it, but it isn't an abomination. It had some potential in the first half but then it all disappeared. Don't pay attention to the RT score or most of the audience reviews, as they are Marvel fan boys who hate every non Marvel comic book film. A bad film that had potential of being a solid film but the result was this mess of film.",

            "content": "If I had left halfway through this, I'd be giving a much better score. As far as \"origin stories\" go in the world of comic book movies, Josh Trank's take on the \"Fantastic Four\" had the novel approach of viewing their powers through the lens of a horror movie. Indeed, the body horror element and the gritty level of realness that Trank brought to this film made it something special... right up until the second half kicks in and then suddenly you have no idea what direction it wants to go. Not to delve too much into the backstage drama that this film went through, but you can't help but wonder who's to blame for squandering such a fresh spin on a superhero property - a meddling studio, or an indecisive director? There were definitely pieces of a good (and probably great) movie in here. It's just that you can see all the glue that is loosely pinning the bad bits onto the good bits. Not only was the movie rewritten and reshot DURING filming, but entire scenes and set pieces that were already shot were dumped in favour of the studio's vision for a better movie. Which is a real shame! The first half was sooooo decent, I thought. It's not the worst movie of all time (as some blind haters will have you believe), but I just can't tell anyone to go see this for themselves if they're paying for it. This is only worth seeing if you're curious what a big budget car crash looks like, or if you're just genuinely curiously (like I was). Again, it's not terrible... but it's just not good either.",

I will say this though: it is definitely less campy and the first hour actually isn't too bad. It's the 2nd half that brings it way down. The payoff for all the set up is terrible. After getting their powers, the movie jumps forward a year so we don't see them develop at all. The 2nd act gets kind of boring and then the final act is too rushed and Dr. Doom is horrible.

There is no reason for this film to have the same rating as Catwoman.

With an excellent cast giving great performances, the film starts to fall flat when the primary members of the fantastic four get there powers. It's here that the editing suddenly gets spotty and we see that the CGI is in need of a tune up. \n\n Even so, it's also at this point that we do get a pretty good (albeit short) action scene featuring Reed Richards and a few cool scenes with Doom living up to his name.  So everything about this film is not trash as others would tell you, there are bright spots amongst the chaos.   I personally believe everyone should experience this film and draw their own conclusions because I feel like it's worth seeing even if to hypothesize the ways in which you would fix it.\n\n  I won't spoil the ending but that's definitely one place I'd like to focus on if I were fixing the movie. It's like the studio wasn't sure how wrap it up so they just opened a book of clich\u00e9 endings that no one wants and just picked at random.

It doesn't have to be in your face, it just has to be there and it is. The team as a team was not expected to be fully functioning -it's an origin story. The main actors were exceptional, especially Miles Teller and Kate Mara. The story was compartmentalized; the first part worked just as it should have; the different tone and set, gave it character. The second part also hit its mark: the science, the depiction of powers. All these were very well done. The third part of the movie, though, felt rushed. Victor's motives were not questionable; the stage had been set for what he wanted since the beginning. I did not mind his depiction as a mad/creepy genius, essentially, but there was something rushed about its conclusion. The visual effects were sometimes satisfying, others, a bit disappointing, that much is true. But other than a hurried ending, and slightly unsure pacing, the movie did not suffer at all. As an origin story, it served the characters well. Not everything has to be an over-the-top colorful firework of a superhero movie. If it was up to me, I would not give up on these characters. If the creators learn from their mistakes, I expect the sequel to be a lovely experience.",

            "content": "\"It's clobberin' time,\" said someone to the prospects of this being a successful movie franchise.\n\nI've never been particularly close to the FF. I have only a couple trades (because my favorite writer was involved), and I generally think higher of the previous two movies than others. What '05's FF and it's sequel got right, I think, was the sense of family amongst the characters. Whether or not related by some biological or legal technicality, they still cared about each other; their rapports and relationships were very apparent. When Johnny made fun of Ben, sure the Thing would get angry, but we understood that Johnny still loved Ben like a brother/cousin/what-have-you. We did not get this in the latest installment.\n\nWhat we get is a Reed Richards whose more of a thoughtless jerk, a Sue Richards that needs to abandon emotions to show how smart she must be (which has been done with female characters in other movies), and a Ben Grimm who we come close to feeling for, but is otherwise unmolded as a character. Johnny Storm cracks a little wise, but he doesn't seem to know or get along with Ben as well as he should. His first scene with his sister, and they don't even make eye contact! What's that about?! (Side note: With an adopted Storm child, that could've only *emphasized* the themes of family...but again, they weren't really played strongly in this venture.)\n\nVictor Von Doom may not've been the blogger I kept hearing he was, but he seemed to jump to \"destroy the world\" style villain with little back up. I get that he didn't want \"the evil government\" to pollute the alternate world, but destroying Earth is too big a jump for the first in what (they'd hoped) would be multiple movies. In this character's case, it'd be a refreshing twist if they'd made him a dictator.\n\nNow, there were a few moments that weren't absolutely horrible. Reed not knowing what a fist-bump is, Johnny ripping on Victor, and even some elements of the final battle were decent. But then you have heads exploding, in a movie that's supposed to be about Marvel's First Family, and it just reeks of over-effort for \"edginess\". Seriously people, watch it before letting your kids see it. You shouldn't have to for an FF movie, but this time, you absolutely do.\n\nIf nothing else, let this be a cautionary tale to all future comic book movies: Grey, sterile environments, darkened or jet-black costumes, heaps of cynicism and moral ambiguity, hyper-/extreme/graphic violence and people looking more depressed or angry while hardly ever smiling, doesn't work in every property. The reason people have enjoyed the Fantastic Four for as long as they have, is because of their family bonds, the light-heartedness and, yes, even silly aspects of comics. The same is true of the likes of Shazam/Captain Marvel, Superman, and numerous others. Making things, \"dark\", \"gritty\", \"edgy\" and \"more real\" doesn't always work for escapist entertainment, or at least not in every facet of the plot and characters. A bad story will be apparent no matter how \"hip\" you try to mask it.\n\nBleakness of visual, characteristic and narrative tones is not \"realism\". It's just depressing. Hint hint, Warner Bros./DC!",

            "content": "Fantastic Four is the newest superhero film to be released and stars Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, and Jamie Bell. It is the third live action Fantastic Four movie and is a reboot of the Fantastic Four series. I have never been a fan of Fantastic Four. I never read the comics and I didn't like the previous two movies. We have all heard the bad buzz surrounding this film. From the film's director, Josh Trank, showing up drunk on set to studio interference, most of the buzz surrounding the film has been bad. I also was not impressed by the trailers and so I walked into the film with very low expectations. With all that said, Fantastic Four is one of the worst superhero films ever made. The film is nothing but exposition and attempting to set up a movie universe like the Avengers. Everything about this film is terrible.\n\nThe characters themselves are terrible. They are all boring and suffer under this terrible script. They don't have any chemistry with each other. Even though they are supposed to be a team, nobody really seems to like each other and you never really get that team feeling from them. The cast however is very talented and they do the best they can with what they have which isn't much. The cast's decent performances are the only somewhat redeemable thing in this movie.\n\nThe villain of the movie is Dr. Doom who is one of the worst super villains to ever appear on the big screen. From the very first time we meet Dr. Doom he is a rude and boring jerk with no villain motivation. A good villain should be likable despite the fact that he's the villain but Dr. Doom is so bland and boring. He also looks terrible, his suit basically melds into his body so he looks like he's covered in green plastic and doesn't even have a moveable mouth. He is about as far away as they possibly could have made him from being the Dr. Doom from the comics. Basically how he becomes Dr. Doom is (and trust me I'm not spoiling anything) is that he touches some green liquid which causes a huge eruption and makes the team run to their spaceship and he gets left behind. He's gone for the entire middle act and then a year later, they go back to the planet, and find him, and bring him back to earth. He immediately starts killing everyone and says he feels at home on the other planet and wants to basically rebuild Earth on the other planet. But why? There isn't any set up for any of this at all. Yes, he was always a jerk, but he wasn't homicidal and there is no reason whatsoever for him to want to kill people and destroy earth, it's so rushed. \n\nThe film has terrible dialogue as well. At one point, Reed Richards is trying to convince the team to steal the machine they can use to go to the other dimension. The problem is that they have been forbidden from doing this and Ben Grimm says \"Hey man, we can't do that because they will find out we left\". and Reed's response is \"Hey man, don't worry about it because by the time they realize were gone, we will already be back\"! The way he said that made it sound like they were about to sneak out to go to some party down the street but I'm like dude your going to a different dimension, that's a little bit different. Another horrible example is when they need something from the government and the government agent says \"What if we say no\"? and the Thing growls like he's a dog and Human Torch says \"Say yes\". Shut up Human Torch, just get out of here.\n\nThe film visually is terrible. The CGI is some of the worst effects to put to film. The character designs of the Human Torch and the Thing were the worst. It looks so fake, there is nothing convincing about it. The lighting is terrible as well, most of the movie is so dark, and there is a blue lens over the camera for a good portion of the runtime making the whole film look dreary and depressing. The film had a budget of one hundred and twenty two million dollars. Ant Man had a budget of only eight million more dollars and that film visually is excellent. You would think that with this money behind it they could make the CGI just a little bit better.\n\nThe script for the film is of course the main problem. The movie itself is so short for a superhero film being barely ninety minutes. The film is just so boring. There really is nothing but talking the whole time and there is next to no action. The only real action is at the end when the Fantastic Four has to fight Dr. Doom but it's not really a fight it's more of a dance. They just dance around with Dr. Doom for thirty seconds and then SPOILERS! Dr. Doom dies because the Thing punches him into an energy beam. It's just so stupid and lazy. The film is so serious as well, there isn't anything fun or lighthearted at all about it and it makes the movie so unenjoyable. The characters aren't' even referred to by their superhero names or even the Fantastic Four until the very end where they don't even say the full name, they just hint at it because they're so embarrassed they're just trying to finish the movie.\n\nOverall, Fantastic Four was god awful and it has nothing to offer anyone. There is a sequel for this film planned in 2017. Don't expect to see the sequel to film in 2017 but instead expect to see a reboot in 2023.\n\nFinal Rating: 1/5 Terrible.",

The main issue is that throughout the whole film, they anticipate something that barely even happens. Another big issue is that the cgi at some moments is atrocious. The final action fight scene (which is the only one of the two lackluster scenes) is not impressive at all. Honestly, this film is very boring, dull, and poorly made. Unlike most bad superhero movies like B&R and Superman 4, this film isn't entertaining. See, those films are bad, but still entertaining because how bad they are. This film isn't entertaining and that's why it gets  a 3.5/10.",

The problem with this version is exactly the same as the first F4, way too slow to begin with leaving the last half hour for all the action. The trouble is a bad screen play and poor direction; both at the hand of Josh Trank. Normally Marvel has been doing such a good job that this one is now an anomaly. I think Marvel knew that as Stan Lee does not make his signature cameo (he is Executive Producer) and there is no teaser during the credits.

It's hard to feel anything for these characters when they are so cookie cutter. I love the actors at hand here, but this is something one does not need to see if you have seen their story before.

Josh Trank (Chronicle, a far better movie) is out of his element here, crafting a dull, nonsensical, morose reboot of, in hindsight, an immensely better saga.\n\nMiles Teller is Reed Richards, a teenage scientist with an invention: a teleportation device, created with the aid of pal Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell, who seems out of place here). Together, they catch the eye of Dr. Franklin Storm (The Wire's Reg E. Cathey) and adopted daughter Susan (Kate Mara, in a noticeable wig) at a science fair and are shipped off to the \"Baxter Institute\". There, they meet Franklin's biological son Johnny (Michael B. Jordan, also of Chronicle) and hilariously-named Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell, who makes the previous movies' Julian McMahon look like Olivier). Together, these young scientists create a machine, which transports matter to \"Planet Zero\", said to be a home to great energy. \n\nOf course, they go. Reed, Johnny, Ben, and Victor all travel to the other world, where everything goes wrong: Victor is presumed dead, and the other three (and Susan, who was impacted by energy that they brought back) receive powers. Reed can bend, twist, and elongate his body. Johnny has the ability to burst into flames. Susan can shift in and out of visibility, and can also create force fields, and Ben is entirely composed of rock, and is, as a result, very strong. They're all fine - their \"biochemistry is off the charts\", whatever that means - and are sent into combat by the government, including a shady, gum-chewing Tim Blake Nelson.\n\nHang on, did you really think von Doom was dead? Of course not, and he looks like a metallic red skull - in other words, ridiculous. His eyes glow green. It's laughable.\n\nI'm not joking when I say that some of the lines in this movie are atrocious. \"There is no Victor. There is only doom!\" \"All this power, and he's the source!\" Yuck. The screenplay is credited to three, including Simon Kinberg, and he should know better - he's written smarter, better films than this, including last year's terrific X-Men: Days of Future Past.\n\nDon't see this movie. The CG is spotty, the characters weak, the acting extremely poor, and the writing and direction reeking of Uwe Boll. It's a step back for the team in film, and it makes Tim Story's installments with Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba look like The Avengers in comparison.\n\nRATING: 1 out of 10",

I found the movie's plot (if there was even one to begin with) to be choke full of plot holes and inconsistencies; the actors' performances looked really bland and so devoid of emotion at times, that I Just couldn't make any kind of emotional investment or connection with any of the characters. The movie as a whole (save for maybe the ending climax) was so lacking in soul, I almost fell asleep halfway through the viewing. And the fact that most of the scenes in the film just takes place in a giant lab didn't help either. Just about the only saving grace from this film was the splendid soundtrack, composed by the duo Marco Beltrami/Philip Glass. Looking back at this film, it really makes me wish they had just continued with the original Fantastic Four cast from before. Hiro's Score: 1/5",

The cast is incredible, they might not have been the ones I would have pictures in these roles, but they are still talented and interesting actors.

The fact that they were all outsiders in their own way, them being wickedly smart and kind of awkward was an idea that I could have lived with. There's also the \"scaryish\" elements in the movie that I liked. It felt like they were monsters, they were strange, and all of these ideas were potentially good ones but the execution was botched.\n\nThe pace was so F-ing slow for two third of the movie, and once there's a little bit of action it ends. At times it was obvious that some scenes were cut short, some bits of dialogues annoyed the hell out me. Fox had all of the right ingredients to make an awesome movie but they sorely missed. If we look at the bright, among other things, you can use this movie showcase the importance of editing.  @wornoutspines",

There is zero build up for the main villain and when Doom is presented he is incredibly overpowered and then conquered easily. There's zero chemistry between actors. There's no character development.

It's boring, stupid, unfunny, and an abomination. The movie tried to be less silly than the others and more serious and brooding, which was a terrible mistake. These heroes are ridiculous, have fun with it. But it tried to be the Dark Knight of the series and failed miserably. The script is pretty laughable, the relationships between characters feel awkward and forced. This doesn't feel like a team, they feel like some strange people forced to work together. The first hour is tedious, it takes forever for anything to happen and when something does happen (getting their powers) it's hilariously bad. So then the movie flashes forward a year instead of being smart and letting us see how this team learned to control these unique abilities and work together. The final act of this movie was the final nail in the coffin for the movie, Dr. Doom (who looks awful) wants to destroy the world for rushed and unexplained reasons. He now has a full suit and wants to be called \"Doom\" (HOW SCARY!). So the final fight lasts no more than 2 minutes with the team beating him up, then it ends with some cringeworthy dialogue. So it sets up a sequel so much it doesn't even try to be good. It's dull, uninteresting, and feels like it was written and directed by a 5 year old. Fantastic Four ts .5/5 stars (F).",

I can also understand that it is always best to be absolutely fair no matter how much shit the press, critics, and even Rotten Tomatoes tell you how bad a movie is before its release. If you are a true fan of comics that you like, it is only fair to go see it in theaters at least once. I am an open minded person when it comes to these sorts of negative reviews, but this is something where I have to agree with the 98% of the overall critic's out there. I mean GAWD DAMN what in the blue freaking hell did I just watch an over hour ago? So the premise for this one is that FOX decided to change up the origin story a bit by giving these four their powers not from outer space, but in another dimension. Alright, that's fine and dandy because it is a nice change of pace and takes a chapter from the Ultimate Fantastic Four storyline. But everything after that, well.... FOX should just sell the rights back to Marvel already so they can clean up after their filthy ass mess.\n\nThis film had me going for a little bit with Reed and Ben's origin to showing off how smart he is. But after they get to the Baxter building scenes it is drawn out for so long with a montage of them just working together for a long time and it takes the movie almost AN HOUR for them to get their powers. After that it's just like they spend a year of their lives working for the government doing black ops missions, to one of them being on the run because he escaped, and even their base of operations is a military base itself that the US government just hands over it to them. That is NOT how you write a Fantastic Four story! Not to mention altering almost every single main character in here from Dr. Doom looking like a greasy hacker with authority issues, to Sue Storm being ADOPTED from Kosovo, to Tim Blake Nelson who should have been the Mole Man but wasn't. I had no problem with Michael B. Jordan as the Human Torch, but I kind of wished he would have done more with that character like make out with a random hot chick or prank the Thing behind his back. The only thing the I like about this where the their super powers which were good, especially from Sue Storm which I thought was a lot better than Jessica Alba's powers. But overall, there were so many changes to these characters and so many alterations that I would actually much rather prefer to watch any of the other three previous Fantastic Four films than watch this abomination of a comic book movie.

The short montage of the members working together isn't enough for the character shift. It was almost whiplash. Doom is an appropriate skeez the entire time. No complaints there. Ben was perfect. Near the end of the film I couldn't help noticing plot hole after plot hole. My favorite is where did Doom get his villainous cape?\n             \nIt was still more enjoyable than the Green Lantern.",

Maybe if the times were different, and people a little less cynical, you'd have stood a better chance. You're not as bad as the world makes you out to be, but you're not as good as you could've been in more loving hands. It wasn't your fault entirely. Soon, I'm certain, you'll achieve a certain cult status, and be seen and judged more objectively. My advice for the future: develop your characters (it'll be nice to know who they are and what their motivations are); mold a steadier plot (you were a little erratic in that area); get out and see the sun (too dark); also have some fun (the world isn't as bleak as you believe, besides, you have a family that loves you). Hopefully, you've learned from this and will be stronger for it. Keep doing what you're doing. I think you'll be alright.

            "content": "Growing up, I never really read comic books, but I did enjoy 2 superhero shows. The first was Super Friends, and the other was Fantastic Four. \n\nI can't stress enough how ridiculous the backlash has been for this film. I made the mistake of accidentally catching the review consensus this time before watching it--something I absolutely hate doing. But I did, and therefore spent the entirety of the film expecting it to be terrible. It's no Godfather, but it's not The Last Airbender either. This movie is entertaining, riveting, visually stunning, and far more inventive with its origin than the previous series.\n\nWith a much darker take on the classic comic book series, director Josh Trank has us immersed in a world that's already somewhat dystopian. High school genius, Reed Richards (Miles Teller), gets recruited to a team who is developing a machine that can teleport organic matter to an alternate world. He, along with Sue (Kate Mara) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell), and Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell), gets super powers from the energy contrived by this mysterious world. \n\nAs filmgoers, we tend to take each adaptation of a film as the definitive version. This doesn't happen in literature. While Frank Miller did catch some flak for darkening Batman in his Dark Knight Returns graphic novels, overall the feedback was positive and today he is credited by many for revamping the series.\n\nThis new Fantastic Four isn't perfect by any means. The dialogue is shoddy, the setup takes up 2/3 of the film, and there isn't enough action to satisfy a room full of Comic-Con attendees, but I couldn't stop watching. The first 45 minutes or so feature some of the best cinema I've seen all year--full of mystery and intrigue. While I grew up with the cartoon version of the Fantastic Four, I have an appreciation for the dismal tone of this film. It's something new and edgy. \n\nI did feel, however, that the direction is a little sloppy. As much as I love Miles Teller, I feel like I'm watching some of his bad takes rather than a final cut. Also, there is no purpose for using a CGI monkey over a real one.\n\nBut overall, I would watch this film again. It has one of the best Marvel movie villains to date. And although most of this film is a setup, it takes one for the team and provides a solid foundation for future films in this series.\n\nTwizard Rating: 81",

In fact, the movie is engrossing and entertaining from start to finish, the plot well-developed, the characters interesting and empathetic, the action scenes exciting.

However, the way the rest of the story plays out, this movie could have been about any four people (five actually) trying to figure out how to transport matter from one location to another, and after sending themselves through the portal end up get strange powers. The fact that they use the same character names as the FF universe could just be coincidently. Was the movie enjoyable, yes. Does this do the FF franchise justice, no.",

I cannot believe how much this movie infuriated me. Doctor Doom, no explanation as to why he hates the earth so much, he's just some hipster loner douchebag who is a dick and hates the earth for some bizarre unknown reason. And the thing, another loner with an abusive background (at least SOME background my god) and not one redeemable quality too him makes him seem relevant or cool.

However is it as bad as critics and fans say alike? No, not even close. I'll admit, I didn't hate the movie. I was deeply disappointed, but I didnt' hate it. The whole film for one is way too short and for two a whole lot of nothing happens. The movie as a whole feels just like one big set up for something bigger and throughout the whole venture you expect just that; something more. It's the epic Blue balls of Comic book film history. A terrific cast squandered on a soul less origin story. You are never invested in any of these characters. Nobody's personality pops out as particularly special or interesting. Then ending, which comes out of left field is tacked on and pointless. It's one of those oh yeah we forgot this a comic book movie and we have to put a villain in here to fight and defeat, but it's all just bandage dressing. The wound had already been bleed out by this time and they were just putting a bandaid on a tourniquet. I'll say this however, if this film was a pilot for a series on Sci fi channel or Fox, it would have worked. And mostly thats where the problem lies. It doesnt feel cinematic. In a comic book world of Captain America and even fox's own X men it just doesnt feel big enough. Who knows? Maybe Fantastic Four might be better served as a weekly television series or even a event series on Netflix. That would give the creators more time to flesh out it's ideas, themes and even it's characters. Because as it stands this film is unsatisfactory. Again, not good, but it isnt the worst Comic book film every made. I'm tempted to say it's at least better than the other two efforts. But saying this film is better than those two films is like saying being shot in the head is better then dying by lighting yourself on fire.",

It's a DRAMA, SUSPENSE, kinda thriller with a peculiar scene out of a video game (very gory, well edited/done, reason that is not for kids or for sensitive humans). I loved this movie by the way coz it has all the things I love on a movie (I admit it doesn't have enough humor in it but that's even better to me, since I admire drama films more somehow). Yes, sometimes the rhythm of the movie (the pace) is slow but I feel is not the cast's fault (maybe is more of the director in this case that did not told them to move on and go a bit quickly on the lines OR the one who wrote the script...let's face it, there were 3 fade outs that were not ment to be, not well edited maybe, but I forgive that). The music score...now that's another story. That was brilliant and well done. I need this soundtrack for real. I loved it ;D Oh, and the cast did wonderfully (with what they had at hand). They took each of their roles seriously even if the script has a few flaws. That was very pro of them. Anyway, if they do another one, I would watch it, why not? Coz it doesn't have the cast with the one we grew up in? Coz is not Disney/Marvel? I will watch it coz I love 7th art and coz if it has the themes I enjoy and love the most, count me in.

In the film, Reed Richard's friend Victor Von Doom gets stuck on the alien planet and becomes a product of its energy, Dr. Doom. The Fantastic Four are left to fight Dr. Doom before he destroys Earth by sucking all matter into the alternate dimension. As a reboot, I thought this film was flat and hollow. The character development is not near what it should be, and the underdeveloped characters make for underdeveloped action sequences. The final confrontation is not nearly satisfying enough, and it feels like the film goes by in a blur. This is watered down version of more competent Fantastic Four films. Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan (That Awkward Moment) are out of place in this film and look older than the teenagers they play. We didn't need a Fantastic Four reboot but got one anyway.

Overall the film felt great and could've benefited more from a less effects heavy messy climax they had. I had a feeling while watching that the film was a straightforward sci-fi flick instead of a superhero movie, and I liked it based on that. In a way the film would have been better if I had never heard of the Fantastic Four. Summing up, it's a character driven sci-fi movie that turns into a generic superhero climax. I was hoping for some philosophical resolutions instead violence, but that's just what I wanted and that may not be a fair expectation from me.",

I wanted to see the Fantastic Four together as a team but it really felt force at the end when they got together. Dr. Doom was the most stupidest character ever.! and looked nothing like the character in the comic, some of the stuff that was in the preview wasn't even put into the final cut of the film it was just complete disaster and the story was very weak and felt rushed but stretched out, honest truth about 90% of the film was just drama and the rest 10% was action but either way the action wasn't great and especially that final battle sequence with Dr. Doom with bad Computer Graphics and Green Screen it was just a movie that came out on a cheap Television network. I wanted more from this movie and it didn't deliver and i understand the hate this film is getting with False Advertisement. As much i love Miles Teller, Michael B.

The second and third acts of this film were lifeless and the few action sequences had little impact.  The villain was only a villain because he was a villain.  His motivation and drive are never fleshed out after the first 40 minutes of implication layering.  I'll admit, thanks to the first act, that this movie was better than I was expecting, but it definitely stains an already dirtied movie franchise.

Oh I'm Josh Trank and its Fox's fault that I couldn't make this movie better so I'm exiting myself from the project and letting it go WHATEVER! But anyway back to the final product. This was not a family it felt like generic actors acting like they know each other. But I will dissect this character by character first off Miles Teller as Mr. Fantastic he was excellent in Whiplash and good in this film, Next is Kate Mara as The Invisible Woman great performance by her but whats up with the hair could the hair stylist decide what type of hair she had good lord! Michael B Jordan as Human Torch was kinda like human torch I guess, Next is Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm/The Thing he was great as Grimm but when it came to The Thing it seemed like he enjoyed being a giant rock monster! But anyway don't buy this movie, don't watch it, ITS PRETTY BAD folks!",

I'll be honest, I needed to see this film to get a Summer Blockbuster special offer (free tickets/snacks) from my local cinema, otherwise I might have given it a miss. There is superhero fatigue for one thing. Yes, Marvel manage to keep the genre sparky and fun most of the time, but the X Men films and the recent Spider-Man films have been a bit of a chore. \nIt doesn't seem that long ago that we had Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans fail to set the screen alight with a competent but very dull pair of films. This time the cast are younger - yes, it's that unoriginal idea 'The Origin Story'. *sigh*\nIn an unnecessarily long opening sequence we meet Reed Ricards and Ben Grimm meeting as kids, when Reed tries to build a teleporter. Skip forwards a few years and they are recruited by Professor Storm to assist his daughter Sue and maverick student Victor Von Doom to build a transport device to visit a different dimension. The lads decide to be the first to make the trip once the device is finished - but leave sweet little Sue at home. Unfortunately, the trip goes wrong, Victor is lost and the other three end up with weird powers. Sue has reached the lab at this point and gets hit with a blast too. Stretchy man Reed escapes but the others become government guinea pigs. Time to revisit the alternate dimension - but an old friend is waiting for them...\n\nThis film is not quite a bad as I thought it might be from the bad press. The problem is it has no humour and not much real excitement. The end battle is predictably crash bang but amazingly naff. Sue's floating bubbles look really stupid. The stretchy arms SFX is barely better than a cartoon and Jamie Bell's Thing is...well, just a lump of rock!  The pacing of the film is all wrong as we spend far too long with the build up to the kids getting their powers but hardly any decent USE of their superpowers. One nice gun battle with Miles Teller bending his way round bullets, but that is about it. Poor Kate Mara is mis-used about the worst, the script making her a very boring character - yet of course the young men must fall for her as she is the traditional comic-book token girl. Mara looks half asleep most of the time and barely cracks a smile. Miles Teller shows even he has him limitations. I've never been a big Jamie Bell fan. To me he's always been a one trick pony - a career made from one great role as a kid - Billy Eliot - and never been particularly good in anything else. Here he is barely onscreen as himself although if he is inside the motion capture suit for Ben I guess it gave him a job! \n\nIf there is one good thing to come out of the huge flop of this film, will it be for Hollywood to PLEASE try to see beyond comic books and action. There is a line of thought that the more creative and interesting work is being done on TV these days, and when you compare films like this uninspiring, turgid mess to Orange is the New Black, Transparent or Sens8 on Netflix and Amazon or Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones or even the much more interesting TV superhero shows like Arrow, The Flash, Agent Carter or Daredevil on Netflix, it is hard to see the relevance of Hollywood films like this if you are not a straight, young, white male.\n\nUninspired and uneven. Please don't bother with the sequel. PLEASE!",

For the first hour off the movie they slowly show you the characters and you get a sense of where they come from which is nice since this is supposed to be an origins story. Unfortunately they don't give you enough back story on them or give you a reason to care about them. After the first hour they introduce Doom and that's where the movie drops off. It just doesn't feel like it was where the movie was going. I hope Fox learns that what they did to this movie ruined it, and will hopefully either do better in Fantastic 4 2 or sell the rights back to Marvel.

Nothing really happens for the first hour, stuff kinda randomly happens for the second half hour, and then it's over.

Then they had the accident, and it all went downhill form there. The story was suddenly rushed, the undertones became painful overtones, the character choices suddenly made no sense, and they stuck the final peg in destroying what little semblance the characters had to their comic book counterparts.\n\nReed's character in the second half was inconsistent, Sue's bland as hell, Johnny's a selfish and rebellious ass, and Victor Von Doom is miles away from who his character is in the comics. The only one remotely true to the comics is Ben, but that's one out of five, which isn't good. Add to it that there's nothing that makes Sue and Johnny seem anything like they're siblings, the fact that there's absolutely no real feeling of them being a team until that five minute climax, and said climax and ending being so rushed it's like a case of whiplash, and you get a Fantastic Four movie that's even worse than the first one.\n\nIf they had taken the first half of the movie and extended it into something of its own design (along with some tweaking to the writing and characters), this would have been a great film about the discovery of another dimension. But no, Fox decided to grip onto the Fantastic Four copyrights like an eight year old refusing to let go of a toy and yelling \"MINE!\" They got greedy with wanting another comic book movie franchise and now they're paying the price with hilariously under-performing box office numbers and well-earned bad reviews, as they deserved.",

Fox have somehow managed to miss the mark with this franchise yet again.\n\nThe first feature length cinematic release of the Fantastic Four I thought was solid. I am in the small minority who actually liked the Tim Story Fantastic Four. Was it great? No. It wasn't even good, it was just solid, it gave a faithful origin story to Marvel's first fully formed Superhero family. Jessica Alba's casting aside I thought it ticked the right boxes for a Fantastic Four origin story even if it lost it's way towards the end, with lots of logic issues cropping up.\n\nNow fast forward 10 years, we get this piece of nonsense. This film is just meh!, that's what it is. The film is too dark for a Fantastic Four film with exploding heads definitely pushing the 12A rating's boundaries. The characters have very little personality. Yes it's more serious compared to the cartoonishness of the original, but still did they need to be so bland. \n\nIn the 2005 version Chris Evan's was a saving grace he captured the essence of his character, the prankster, the ladies man, the hot headed, the care free lifestyle in essence he made you believe in his relationships with those around him. In this film Michael B. Jordan's Johnny Storm is a hot head not much more, he's angsty with daddy issues and has no chemistry with Mara whatsoever.\nKate Mara, Miles Teller and Toby Kebbel are all solid with their roles unfortunately the story gives them very little to work with. Jamie Bell should have been the stand out, but unfortunately he is very lifeless in his stop-motion work, and his character reflects the darkness of the film. \n\nThe original film took a lot of flak for Michael Chiklis' character and the prostethics used, I personally thought he did well with his character and could be related to. This film sees him start off (ahem) grim and continue all the way through until the last five minutes. In general the film lacked the humour which was frowned upon in the original film.\n\nOverall an unengaging film too dark for it's own good, with serviceable action and characters, the actors and the audience really did deserve better.",

Jordan, Miles teller, Jamie Bell and Kate Mara\n\n\tPlot Summary\n\tReed Richards is a really good scientist - even at an early age.  During his school years, he creates a portal to another dimension.  But it doesn't work very well and it causes a black out.\n\tYears later, he's given a second chance.  Now an adult, he is able to perfect his portal to another dimension.  While the military and other big pocket companies watching, he successfully tests the machine, sending a monkey to the other dimension and back.\n\tBut Reed isn't happy when his work is going to be used by others - and not by him and his friends.  So he gathers up the other guys in the group - Johnny, Ben, and Victor - to be the first humans to visit the other dimension.\n\tWhen they get there, they start looking about at some strange goings on (a really bad idea).  And when they poke around at the energetic phenomenon going in front of them, things go wrong.  \n\tThere's lot of explosions and a whole lot of strange energy being tossed about.  Reed and company have to bail out.\n\tHowever, Victor doesn't make it back with the rest of the group - and when they do make it back, the trip fundamentally changes them (along with Sue who was remote piloting the device back from the other dimension)\n\tThis is how they become the Fantastic Four - and they are put in lockdown by the military (except that Reed escapes and is now a fugitive.)\n\tAnd things take a turn for the worse when Victor makes a re-appearance as Doom.\n\nSCORING\nMain Characters\n\tThere's not much going on between these four.  I get that Reed and Ben are best friends.  But outside of that, there's not much chemistry between the four of them - most notably between Reed and Susan.  SCORE: 4\n\nSupporting Cast\n\tDoom is supposed to be one of the most iconic villains in the Marvel universe.  But even though he has a great look, he comes across as your typical bad guy out destroying the world.  And the rest of the cast isn't much better than that.  SCORE: 2\n\nPlot\n\tThe first act of the story is great - when Reed and Company go into the other dimension.  However, the rest of the film feels like a Cliff's Notes version of a much longer story.  Main details are left out, and the main plot felt rushed. \n\tWhat's even worse is the final battle is a major letdown.  SCORE: 2\n\nOriginality\n\tThis feels like a second rate Marvel film - and there are a lot of them that's out now on demand or streaming or whatever.  SCORE: 3\n\nViolence Factor\n\tThere's a lot of scenes where the Thing and the Human Torch battle tanks and planes - but it feels like they should be fighting something more meaningful.  Besides the last fight is resolved via a bunch of mumbo jumbo rules that don't make any sense (to me).  SCORE: 2\n\nOther Moral Issues\n\tThis is supposed to be about how a group of friends and family form a unique fighting force for the good guys.  But they spend so little time together after getting their powers that the message is lost.  SCORE: 3\n\nFinal Score (out of 60): 16\t\t% Score: 26.67%\n\tThis is a Marvel Film?  Really?  It felt like a rushed project that is doomed - I mean Victor Von Doomed - to fail.",

I think my expectations are what's killing this, and let's be fair. Technically being a 3rd (if you count the mid-90's mess as the original) reboot for the franchise isn't helping at all.\n\nWhat it got right: I liked how they presented the powers. Compared to the last outing for FF where everything felt \"cartoony\", they did a good job presenting their abilities in the film. From Sue's ability to control things to Grimm actually looking more hardcore and beefy...I think they did the groups power sets justice. Also, the plot was ok...but read my next section for the downside of this. The characters were good and the acting was fine except for the occasional forced cheesy-ness.\n\nWhat it go wrong, sort of: They spent too much time in the beginning of the film trying to ground and flesh out characters without actually doing so. By the time you get to the meat of what you really came to see, it's way too rushed. The conflict is done in 20 minutes, leaving you with roughly an hour and 20 minutes of attempts to make the film overly serious. They could have done a better job fleshing out the characters and their relationships...and they honestly should have been able to do it faster. But even if not faster, they could've extended the movie easily by another 20-30 minutes and really fleshed out the conflict and ending, giving movie goers more to bite down into. The story wasn't bad, it was just far too rushed after the slow start.\n\nHowever, to say it was abysmal...that's a stretch. When I watched Elektra, I couldn't even finish it the first time. The second and final time I watched it, I regretted finishing it and wanted my wasted time back. Did I enjoy Fantastic Four? Sure. Could it have been better? Absolutely. However, I'm kind of upset because I didn't think it was \"that\" bad, and now that it's on a road to failure (critically), I'll likely never see this franchise again...which is kind of sad since it's one of my favorite Marvel groups.\n\nIf you like comic movies, and are just looking for a good time without oscar performances and the highest caliber story...then you'll probably enjoy this about as much as I did. If I had to give a reason \"not\" to see it, it's mostly because this input into the Marvel catalog of movies will unfortunately be forgotten and left for dead...so don't expect to see #2 in 2017 like it was originally slated.",

            "content": "We all have heard of the problems that were being reported about the Fantastic 4, and after hearing how bad it was before going to see it, I was really skeptical but very interested to see how bad it would be. Needless to say my expectations were at an all time low, especially after the films director tweeted that it wasn't his film we would be watching but a studio hack job that had been hijacked mid way through the filming and editing process.\n\nThe first hour of the film, I was thinking the critics were being too hard on this movie. The set up of the characters was actually well done, with the exception of doom and Johnny storm, the concept and tone Trank was working with did have a cool sci-fi horror thriller feel to it, but after the climatic trip to the \"other universe\" (not a spoiler it's in the trailer people) the film completely unravels and goes from the cool sci-fi horror flick and reverts back to the shitty campy movies from the early 2000's.\n\nThe biggest problem with this movie is that everything about this movie screams B-list SyFy movie of the week. For the most part the movie is boring, the soundtrack is dull, the action is almost non existent,  and whoever edited and worked on costume design on this piece of shit movie shouldn't be aloud to work on a super hero film ever again.\n\nThe outfits of the \"fantastic four\" weren't bad per say but they were very basic and forgettable; Doom's look on the other hand was horrible. He looked like a combination of the robot from Metropolis and Imhotep from the Mummy remake got a hold of some kryptonite.\n\nThe Thing didn't impress me like he seemed to everyone else, his look was just passible in my eyes and the sound of him matched with his mouth movement was god awful.\n\nI keep reading in reviews that this is by far the best Fantastic 4 movie and there I'm going to have to disagree. As bad the last two films were there was at least fluidity, humor,  and accessibility. Yes the movies weren't good but at least young kids, who watch shitty movies and TV shows anyway, could still watch it and have fun with them or at least it was a campy movie that the family can go pick up from redbox when the cable goes out, this film just sucks for everybody.\n\nI know what your thinking,  but the trailers looked pretty good, and I agree with you. I would say about half the things you see in the trailer are NOT in this film so if your basing your decision on seeing this movie on that, I wouldn't. This movie isn't Superman Returns type of bad but I put it is right on par with Ang Lee's Hulk, and by far is 20th century Fox's worst Marvel film to date.\n\nIt's too bad we will probably never see the film Josh Trank was making, and if the first half of this film is any indication of the route he was going, I'm sure he would of given us an interesting film like his 1st on Chronicle.\n\nI would pass on this one, unless it's to check out how much of an epic fail this movie is or just watch the first part of the film and leave, becuase trust me whatever you come up with in your imagination will be better than what happens in the second half.",

I think the reason it has scored so low is either because  the critics are five year old children who prefer the god awful, cheesy as hell Tim Story version which had an overweight middle aged short bloke in a halloween costume instead of The Thing, or they just wanted to be hammered with over the top cgi action scenes. What I think is that the critics haven't realised that It isn't supposed to be the same sort of film as the Avengers or Iron Man, which I do think are great films by the way, its just that this is a different type of film which although it does have good (if not many) action scenes it's more focused on introducing the characters and the origin story as a whole, which would then lead to an amazing sequel (if they make one). It's not cheesy, like the previous incarnation and it does have some amazing scenes. Yes it could have been better, maybe if it had extended the final battle, or kicked in a bit earlier on, but all in all the film worked for me, it was so much better than I expected it to be after reading the reviews. The acting was good, the film looked good and moved at a good pace. It is not really a children's film though, not that it's not suitable it just doesn't try too hard to be funny and it isn 't ridiculously over stuffed with action. I must also add that I read the Fantastic Four comics as a child and I am a big fan so I was aware of the fact that they did stray from the source material some what, but it didn't matter as I was already over this before I even saw the film, and it still worked.\nTo summarise I would say that it's definitely worth watching, and much much better that the previous version. Ignore the critics they are probably just influenced by other reviews and are jumping on the hate bandwagon.",

It just seemed rushed but I guess that's to be expected because the first movie in any franchise doesn't have that much action because it introduces you to the characters.

Miles Teller portrayed the iconic if not younger Reed Richards quite admirably I must admit though, as was Toby Kebbell's menacing performance as Doctor (Victor Von) Doom.  you can easily tell that the pacing of the film was all jumbled as the first act of the film was in fact the best part of the movie. \n\nDon't think I'll be sitting through this again, unless Director Josh Trank gives us a Directors Cut of the movie, as it looked obvious that outside interference had tampered with Trank's vision of the film.

It is not that bad as people and critics (whose opinion should not be taken) make it out to be. I say watch it for yourselves and make your own judgment. There are plenty of other very bad movies out there besides this one and this movie did not deserve to be trashed. \n\nNow that that is out of the way, the movie does have some story elements that do not make sense. I do not think it is feasable for a kid to teleport something using a science experiment to another dimension and that some one professional would come to a high  school science fair looking to recruit a genius when he could vet students at MIT or other schools to do so. This is where the movie starts to come into trouble is with the writing. Reed and his friend get recruited and help finish a project started by a former student named Victor Von Doom. In a short summary the team wants to be first to travel to another dimension and as a result, gain powers and are taken in government custody. The movie tends to use this to drive the movie forward and in the end, Victor wants to destroy this planet and start another one. The way in which Victor does so is not clearly explained and this is where many people thought the movie floundered is the final confrontation. It seemed that something was missing and the stakes were not that high. The plot hole of how the four heroes survive on the other dimension is not explained and so is many other things in this movie. \n\nTo say the least, the movie as it is, it is not that bad. I thought it was entertaining to an extent, but I was not overwhelmed or had that sensation of enjoyable emotion from other superhero movies like Man of Steel or the Avengers. I will recommend this movies to fans of superhero movies to rent to see and judge for themselves instead of listening to other people's opinion. It is worth a rental if not, wait for it to debut on cable.",

Director Josh Trank and Fox are all to blame for this hot mess. It is as if they purposefully did not want the film to be associated with the comic books. The team name and the nicknames of the team members are never uttered. It takes an hour before they all get their powers and when they do, nothing happens. The main villain doesn't appear until the 75 minute mark and then the climax is rushed into the last ten minutes and then it's over. There is no action or excitement. The cast, who are all talented individually, have no chemistry together and they are too young to be playing these types of characters. The dialogue is laughable and the films takes itself too seriously. A film like Batman can be dark, because it is Batman. Fantastic Four is hardly Shakespeare. Even the Jessica Alba/Chris Evans Fantastic Four knew it was cheesy and went with it. This reboot makes those films look like Citizen Kane. The entire experience was dull, boring, and uneventful. There is no sense of fun, excitement, wonder, and entertainment. You can't have a title with the word Fantastic in it and do the total opposite. I can't believe it was possible, but we have a comic book film that has little to no action or anything comic book related. This is not only the worst comic book film I have ever seen, but it is one of the worst films of the year. \n\nGrade: D-",

If I wanted gray tones, \"realistic\" showcases of superheroes, and an upbeat franchise grit it up, I'd just re-watch \"Man of Steel.\" Marvel films are often light-hearted fair, films like \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and the more recent \"Ant-Man\" seem to be aware how ridiculous the very concept of live-action superheroes is, they have fun with their premises and it reflects in the success of the films. \n\nThe Fantastic Four comics and cartoons have always been some of the silliest and light-hearted of Marvel franchises, and this film completely abandons that aspect. The film tries to be \"modern\" but really just goes for gritty and existential, showing how frightening the sudden changes the four go through would be in the real world. That is all well and good if you're watching a Cronenburg or Lynch film, but this is a comic book movie about four friends who get blasted by rays until they can punch through walls, and melt a tank with a flick of the wrist. The director, Trank, claimed on Twitter that a year ago he had a version of the film that was much better, but that we sadly \"will never get to see that version.\" The only response to Trank's whine about the film not doing so great critically is that he should've made that film instead. \n\nWhen news first broke of the re-boot, it was said that it would be a \"modern\" and more \"realistic\" or \"grounded\" retelling of the superhero group. However when it comes to superheroes, most people simply want to have fun. I don't want to look at the Human Torch and feel bad about how his powers have irrevocably changed his life and how he is a military tool, I cant feel sorry for a man who can fly and shoot fireballs (no matter the version, The Thing gets a pass on this). I want to see these all of a sudden powerful people take the gifts they've been given and use them to stand up for a world rendered powerless by the villain (of course Dr. Doom in this one).\n\nThe effects definitely look better than the first two FF films, though that's to be expected ten years later. Plot-wise this film was angsty and the characters rather dull, a disappointment especially when compared to the string of successes Marvel Studios has gone through in the past few years. The film is sure to get a sequel though, and we can only hope the next movie will make up for the problems that plagued this one.",

Most of the cool scenes you see in the commercials like the Thing dropping from a plane... are not in the movie.  the director has disavowed the movie as the studio as a don't blame me, but yet the studio yanked it from him because he was making this a horrible film. there is almost no action in the movie until the near end of exposition and back story. The studio spent movie re-shooting scenes since the movie they were getting was crap, so they put a little polish on this turd hoping to make some money back. Hopefully this director that had little care for the movie never gets handed a big budget film ever again, his handling was so bad, that Disney removed him as a scheduled director a new star wars film.  Don't see this movie where you'd have to pay for it. There is no comradeship among the Four, they barely ahve scenes together and Sue Storm  is hardly a strong female character like she should have been, instead she is a token woman cast member and even to get her powers she doesn't even get to go and teleport, they give her suit to one of the guys instead and she gets her powers by being infected by the team. She's an also ran.  Sad so sad this movie should have been so much better.  A lot of people say the 2005/2007 movies were bad, but I think they were pretty good, sure tehy could have been improved, but they got the characters right, the interplay of Johhny and Ben, and Sue over the boys.

This reboot makes the 2005 version look like an Oscar. In a way, I liked the 2005 version but I had just huge expectations for this one since 2005 was very flawed but Fox managed to make it worse. \n\nThe casting is all wrong. There is literally no chemistry between the actors and there is so many awkward moments that made me shake my head. The actors literally winged the whole movie and hoped for the best out of their acting. Also, the dialogue is so childish and horrible that I literally had to rub my head. \n\nAlso, we are in the freaking 21st century and somehow Fox manages to even make the CGI look like crap. As for the story, this movie shouldn't even be called Fantastic Four. The team doesn't even form till the last 10 minutes of the movie. Also, it takes like more than half the movie to get to the freaking point. Speaking of the end, the last 10 minutes is literally the only action you will get and even then the ending was just terrible. Also, this movie is cliche, boring and predictable.\n\nI can't even believe that I have to say that 2005 Fantastic Four is god. At least the 2005 version has a plot (weak and predictable but there) and actually had some enjoyment to the film with some humor. Also, there was way more action in the older one than this piece of crap. Also, Evans was made to be the Human Torch.\n\nDidn't think for second that I would find a Marvel movie as horrible as Wolverine Origins or Last Stand but this reboot just proved me wrong. Such a huge disappointment from a movie that I didn't have high expectations on but had some faith in. Way to blow it Fox. Hope MCU gets FF back and actually make a quality movie. If you want to see what the hubbub is about wait when it goes on HBO and watch it for free when you literally have nothing in life to do and want to pass about 2 hours of your time doing nothing.

When you ask someone :\"Name a vilain.\" Do you think \"Von Doom\" is in the Top 10? \nProbably not and the hero is as good as the hero is bad. Get a real vilain, nobody cares about Von Doom\n\nSecondly, travelling through space and seeing it (the flashy tube and all the clouds) is always boring in a movie. \nNobody took notes when they released Green Lantern in 2011.\nEven in the Stargate TV series they cut that part out and all they did was travelling through space\nIn the movie, they called it \"Interdimensional Teleportation\". They should revised the dictionnary a little bit. Teleportation involves desintegration.\nAnybody saw Star Trek ?\nIf the characters stay has a whole inside a force field and move inside a flashy tube. It is not \"Teleporting\", it is \"Travelling\".\n\nThird, we don't care how the characters get their powers. They should already have them at the beggining of the film so we can see some action\nThen you put a five minutes flashback scene that explain how it happened. Also keep it simple: Hulk = Radiation, Spiderman = Got bitten, Superman = Alien\nF4 = They build a thing to go somewhere and while trying the thing, something went wrong and bla bla bla... See my point?\n\nFour, for a superhero movie you must respect the basic plot: Fight the vilain and loose, enhance the superhero, fight again and win\nIn F4, they got Von Doom on the first try.  So Boring! I told you at point 1 that Von Doom was not up to the task. He's not a real badass\n\nBonus, Never use the plot: \"military trying to use the hero as a weapon\". It always failed in a movie, because miliary have to failed. \nYou cannot have a super hero turned into a weapon, it failed in the first two Hulk's movies, it is the boring scene in Jurassic world.\nDon't do that..ever\n\nThanks",

            "content": "I found the film watchable, there's some cringe-worthy bits but on the whole, I found it a huge step up from the last series.\n\nKate Mara will never be a good actress to me. She is statuesque, robotic, and has no charisma whatsoever. Any scenes she has with Miles Teller (who I happen to think is a good actor) are just the most awkward thing I've ever seen. She gives him nothing to work with.\n\nI like the actor for Doom. He did really well, but Doom's motivation and (villain) design had some major problems. Villain Doom looked like something you'd see in a puppet shop in Germany. The frozen face looked doll-ish and didn't allow the actor to emote whatsoever. Also, just how the hell did he manage to survive not only the fall, but for a year on a foreign planet with no oxygen or food or even the ability to eat/drink?\n\nThere are just some references and lines of dialogue that don't help the movie at all. \"Dr. Doom over here.\" was a completely unnecessary line. We get it, he's the bad guy, you don't have to bludgen us in the face. They should've downplayed that and made him more friendly initially towards the group, it would've made his transformation better.\n\n\"It's clobberin' time\" needs to go or at least underplayed. Even if Grimm's bully of an older brother had said that to him as a kid, that would've been fine. But it's ridiculous for a super hero to have a battle cry in this day and age.\n\nThings I did like: Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm. He did a good performance. I know this is a can of worms but I'm not sure why the change in ethnicity. You ask any professional writer, if you're going to make changes to source material, it needs to make the story better, you can't just change things in order to be showy. However, I enjoyed Michael B. Jordan as Johnny, so maybe the decision to make Johnny Storm African American was made after Michael B. Jordan killed it in the audition room. Maybe he did so well, they made the change after casting him.\n\nI liked none of the heroes aside from The Thing having hero aliases. The tone of the movie was too dark and dreary to include something as campy as \"Mr. Fantastic\" or \"Human Torch\".\n\nI liked the design on Ben Grimm as The Thing. It's certainly much better than the orange, rubber suit version we got in the last iteration.\n\nI liked how the team came together at the climax of the film. It wasn't over the top, or cheesy.\n\nOn the whole, like I said, it was watchable. Not anywhere near as good as it could've been, and that's not the fault of the cast (with the exception of Kate Mara) or Josh Trank. You could see the parts of the movie that were well written and then every once in a while you notice where good ol' FOX manages to shoe-horn in their own \"Hey remember these jokes\" moments and their dated and formulaic money-making strategies. It's simply a case of what happens when bad producers and executives get their hands on a good script.\n\nThis script could've been really well at a different company.",

The only 1 that had any practice learning how to use their powers was Sue, everyone else just seemed to get it.   Doom was weak, and I can't even imagine Teller as Reed, terrible actor choice. tThe fight scenes, the few there were, sucked. The story was lackluster at best. A definite waste of time and money.

            "content": "Ripping the latest Fantastic Four reboot seems to be the sport du jour. While the news about the impending negativity this movie would spark has been circling the media for nearly a year, my inherent fandom of comics in general made this a necessary film for me to see. While not a huge fan of the previous two movies (I've never seen the bootleg from the early 90s), generally speaking, Fantastic Four is a difficult story to interestingly bring to the screen. It's very cosmic in nature, has a long history of some very strange villains and story lines, and can be kind of boring. In the 2005 initial outing, the good things included a very good origin story, representation of Ben Grimm as a pilot and a perfect Johnny Storm. However, Dr. Doom was horrible. Not representative of the comic version at all. Jessica Alba's ethnicity came across strangely as a blonde woman. And, while looking like the very early 60's Thing, the orange suit was...just bad. The second movie, centering around Silver Surfer was a much better representation of the comics, in spite of the weird Galactus. The stories overall were very weak and too goofy. When I heard they were going to reboot it, I was ok with it, for the recasting of Dr. Doom alone.\nFast forward to the introduction of Josh Trank as the director. Someone who had done ONE film. Yes, it was a decent film, but given that he was handed the keys to the FF reboot AND a Star Wars film, I was confused. So...fast forward again to nearly a year ago when word came out that the movie was in trouble. Josh was acting erratic. He had destroyed the house he was staying in while shooting in Louisiana. Fox secretly told Disney that Josh would be a bad idea to keep on staff for the Star Wars movie. Then suddenly, Josh was off the Star Wars film while rumors were abound that he had abandoned the final steps in FF post-production. The studio had come in and held reshoots and was completely in control of editing. So much bad press that nearly no one was looking forward to this movie coming out. Marvel was grinning like a cheshire cat wanting to get the rights to making FF back in the House of the Mouse. Then word came that an embargo was being put on all screenings and release of critical reviews until 2 days prior to opening day, always the kiss of death to a film. Then...3 days ago, the embargo broke and the messages were loud and clear. This movie was horrendous.\nI still planned on seeing the movie, but after Sony destroyed anything interesting about Ghost Rider...twice...I wasn't feeling good. Expectations were in the toilet.\nSo, this morning, as I'm making my way through the surprisingly short (one hour, forty minutes) reboot, I was pleasantly surprised. The acting, even from the kids at the beginning, was very strong. The characters were coming together well. While the origin was different and the inclusion of Franklin Storm, Sr. and a mixed-race Storm clan was...well, unnecessary, it worked. I was buying it.\nThen they got their powers. From this point forward, it's like a completely different director and/or editor ran the film. There was essentially only ONE action scene. The end. And it lasted mere minutes. Without spoiling what led up to that one action scene, I will simply say that Doom was introduced. A very good Dr. Doom. Character and actor-wise, I very much like this flavor of Fantastic Four. And the tweaked origin introduces the potential for much more cosmic inclusion. The potential is exciting to this comic fanboy.\nThe problem is, from the point where they go their powers, which was on a planet that required CGI and special effects, I was confused as to where the budget went. The effects were some of the worst I've ever seen. Just awful. So many story points were shortened, sped up and left to the viewers interpretation and assumption. Weird considering how well-paced the story had been until this point and how well-developed the characters had been. For the final 40 minutes, character development evaporated. The effects were horrible. There was no story. Just...scenes. Leading up to a very short and shallow action scene. Then...it just ended. A short, quick wrap-up, not to mention dumb, especially considering how strong the film had been the first hour. I simply couldn't understand why the film shifted tone and pace so quickly.\nAs a result, I couldn't give it more than 2 stars. I believe Fox should give the rights back to Marvel or, at the very least, allow this film to have a sequel with a PROVEN director.",

While aesthetically the film is mostly pleasing, everything from the well performing cast to the great visuals should make this an enjoyable film. But it's the story's underwhelming and heartless feel that causes a big problem for this movie.  While the cool, youngsters feel coupled with it's mostly strong supernatural element do work, it is hard to back purely by the lack of interest in the characters. The cast is relatively small making for little variety, little cheer yet strangely little time developing who we do get. Johnny Storm is pretty passive, while Ben Grimm is massively sidelined with only Reed getting a decent slice of the pie. The lack of interaction between the characters is even more concerning, especially for a team film, where certain members don't even seem to utter two words to each other. The biggest flaw however is with the film's villain whose motives are pretty weak, but also looks silly and whose powers don't make sense. His enterance leads to a rushed and out of nowhere finale that has little to no build up, feeling the film doesn't even have a proper middle or end act. While the actors should be proud of how they helped this film, Fox can probably feel this franchise slipping from their fingers as Marvel rubs it's hands together for another score.",
