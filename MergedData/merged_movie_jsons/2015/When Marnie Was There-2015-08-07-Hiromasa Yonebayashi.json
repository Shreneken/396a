            "content": "From the director Hiromasa Yonebayashi of 'The Secret World of Arriety' fame. Based on the 1967 English novel of the same name and so the important characters borrowed the western names. This is what I call a fine adaptation, great transformation from the words to the motion picture. Actually, it suited for the narration from the standpoint of Japanese culture and lifestyle, especially for this anime version with the beautiful fictional coastal landscapes. Whenever I remember this film in the future, that Marsh house would be the first thing to pop out in my mind, an unforgettable landmark for sure.The movie promos were damp. The posters were not that impressive, but okay and the trailer was very ordinary. Studio Ghibli was the reason to go for it, so I expected nothing spectacular from the movie. Even while I was watching, I thought it was just an enjoyable mystery flick, but you know sometime the value of the whole movie comes at the end twist. Once the end was near my stance changed, especially after the hidden truth revelation. Some movies need a re-watch to terminate any doubts regarding characters and scenes. As for this movie, if your focus is straight, then it's does not require.Not a technical brilliance like the director's previous movie, but the story was strong and twisty. The characters were very interesting, suspense was the movie's influence for the audience to stick till the end. There is no loose end, certainly gives a few topics to discuss about, but the narration moves on a circular track and hits back like the boomerang. That does not mean it is a time travel or something. The narration bends and blends with the time. To realise what is real and what is not, you have to wait till the end. After seeing the film, I understood everyone's childhood memories could monopolize if we encounter same object, place, person and other things again in the later life. Yes, I had few minor experience in my life as well.The opening dialogue itself a hint of what kind of movie it is going to be. There are two prominent girls, Anna and Marnie in the story, like the Anna and Elsa from 'Frozen'. The narration flips on a regular basis to tell the multiple layered story. As this film was a puzzle in portrayal, obviously viewers try to solve it, including me. I tried my best. I thought Anna's childhood toy was something to do with all the fuss, but I was terribly wrong. That was a perfect divert if you observe it closely. In another perspective, I kept 'The Others' and 'The Orphanage' in mind, but was not even close to where this story was heading. Whether you succeed or not, very fun to solve a mystery, you know. Finally, it gave me full satisfaction like that indirectly I saw 'The Uninvited' once again.Feels like the Oscars was concluded yesterday, but I am already thinking about the next one. If I am not wrong this movie is definitely one of the contenders for the best animation race, along with 'The Good Dinosaur' probably. Absolutely, I would be disappointed if I don't see it in the final five. There is lots of time between now and then, so anything might happen, who knows. After all, this film has already won my little heart and millions of other's. I know no one can replace Mr. Miyazaki, but feels like Hiromasa Yonebayashi could come near if his future projects as much effective as his one. Best of luck to him and he's only a 41. But remember Isao Takahat is 80 and still in the race, yet to announce his retirement. And this film was very close to his 'Only Yesterday'.I love you more than any girl I've ever known.Studio Ghibli is like Disney Studio from the east. As we know, narrating a fairy tale having the tween girls in the lead is what they're famous for. The previous couple of movies were out of their trademark, so, happy they are back with this masterwork. At a same time I am very very very very sad, because it's their final movie after the 30 years of triumph. Since Hayao Miyazaki's retirement everything falling apart from the studio's management. They've given reasons and it is only a temporary, though hope the rise of 3D animation is not the one to halt the production, praying for the pause to be lifted soon.This film is not just passing through from this giant anime production house, but it is a masterpiece. As usual, it is a girly movie and that does not stop grownups, especially men from a watch. I loved it, every time when I like a movie I express my desire for a sequel and so I did for this film. Though it was one time story with nothing left over for further development, possibly some new thing can be attached to it. Whatever happens this movie will remain as one of the best from the studio and can compete with any modern animations and live-shot masterworks. Highly recommended, not just for anime or animation fans, but for mystery and who love the layers in story narration.9/10",

            "content": "One of the many pleasures you have when you watch a Studio Ghibli film is its colorful animation and When Marnie Was There is yet another perfect example of that. More impressively, the story the film tells is just as filled with colorful themes and plot points that you just wouldn't get from a Disney or Dreamworks animated film. When Marnie Was There doesn't pull any punches, but more importantly, the punches they throw at the audience mean something and will have an emotionally resonating impact for all viewers, not just kids. The film tells the story of Anna, a young girl who spends the summer with her relatives close to open water, and finds a mysterious and seemingly abandoned mansion across the water. After drawing numerous sketches of the mansion, she finds her way across using a row boat. What follows after that is a legitimately mysterious plot that keeps the audience guessing at every turn. Is Anna seeing things? Is this all a dream? Which characters are hiding what? And so on. For most of the film, that technique works very well. But there are a few times when the secrets and potential reveals get a bit tiresome.When Marnie Was There is a story about plenty of things like regret, loss, and neglection. But at the heart of the film is a story about friendship, and an unlikely one at that. Obviously, there's plenty of things about the plot that you can't reveal without spoiling anything, but Anna and Marnie's bond throughout is truly something special. It's a bond that is probably more satisfying when you watch it a second time and can appreciate it without having to keep your eyes pealed for the next secret to be let out.The film is complemented by a beautiful score and a heart wrenching end credits song that is sure to get even the most stubborn of people to get teary eyed. But it's also a different kind of sadness than say a Pixar or Disney film can give you (exceptions of course). When Marnie Was There has a dream like quality to the entire story, but the devastating moments hit you like a ton of bricks. Even in its most unrealistic instances, you feel the same sorrow and happiness that the characters do.+Score+Story has just the right amount of dark moments+Probably more depth than other animated flicks+Bond between Marnie and Anna-Mysteries perhaps get a bit tiresome8.7/10",

            "content": "This Movie touches the human soul at many level. It depicts a child who has been abandoned, by her mother and then grandmother and later partly by her foster-mother, so she feels she can not depend on adults for security. It also shows the value of family and love and affection within the family. Unlike American movies where no one seems to have a family, where the only expression of love is trivial and sexual, here the emotions are deep and adult.The movie elevates us to our higher beings, and that is why the experience is lasting, and enjoyable.What I also liked about this movie is that the movie is pure and clean, and suitable for families again unlike American shows where there is always some agenda from some interest group. Here you are free to be yourself. below is in response to a perverted reviewer with mind in gutter who thought this move was misleading. Please do not associate yourself with this movie. This is obviously made for people with human soul, and not you.",

The kind of feeling that your sorrow and loneliness nailed you down and you fell into the deep darkness alone, then you stood up, and finds sparks and sparks of lights appeared, leading you to the end of the nightmare, and when came out, you found the sunshine was warmer than ever? This is the movie \"when Marnie was there\".I like this movie. It's a story about two lonely girls, about family and the world, magical but real. As a OCD viewer, my left brain kept investigating who that girl is, and my right was eager to know what will happen next. The good thing is, however, both my brains were astonished and satisfied again and again, unlike how other Ghibli movies roll. This new film, which is the first one after the retirement of the two great founders, shows the skills and talent of the next generation Ghibli artists. Future is saved, or maybe better?And as many Ghibli movies, \"when Marnie was there\" is full of beautiful paintings and musics, voices recreating the characters vividly, and an unforgettable theme song in the end. The story, like I said, is fabulous. I don't like spoiling movies, and the secret in this case is the core and foundation of everything. I'll leave it to you to discover. Enjoy!",

            "content": "The last film to be produced under the Studio Ghibli banner before the acclaimed animation studio decided to take a break from filmmaking following the retirement of Hayao Miyazaki, When Marnie Was There is an elegantly crafted & gorgeously animated tale that intertwines dreams with reality as well as past with present, only to end up getting entangled in its own web.Based on the novel of the same name, When Marnie Was There follows Anna; a 12-year old girl who takes a trip to a countryside town for health reasons and discovers an abandoned mansion where she finds an unlikely friend in Marnie; a blond girl. As their new relationship blossoms over the next few days & both get to know each other better, it is unraveled that Anna is more closely related to Marnie than expected.Nicely directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi, When Marnie Was There is his sophomore effort following his debut feature, The Secret World of Arrietty, which remains my favourite Studio Ghibli film to be not directed by Miyazaki. And although his latest is no doubt an ambitious work, its pay-off won't be rewarding enough emotionally unless the viewers try to connect the dots all by themselves by doing a little digging of their own.The technical aspects are expertly carried out for each frame of it is sumptuously animated & vividly photographed from start to finish. Editing tries to juggle various elements of story at once & doesn't always succeed. However, there isn't any issue with the pacing for its 103 minutes of runtime never becomes tedious at any given moment. Also, the background score brims with tracks that infuse a soothing feel into the narrative.The Japanese voice cast is only as fitting as the studio's previous works. However, it's the beautiful relationship between Anna & Marnie that leaves the biggest mark. The film can be viewed as a coming-of-age drama that follows the journey of Anna from a lonely & anxious girl at the beginning of the film to a more confident person later in the story. Marnie herself exhibits an aura of mystery around her that not only allures Anna but us viewers as well.On an overall scale, When Marnie Was There isn't as magical as Studio Ghibli's finest films but its take on friendship & isolation nonetheless manages to cast a spell of its own in bits n pieces which makes its story captivating for a while. A love story, a coming-of-age tale & a deep journey into one's own past, When Marnie Was There may or may not benefit from multiple viewings but for now, it has to settle for an underwhelming experience in my book. Still, it's worth a shot!",

            "content": "Anna, a twelve year old girl, is living with her foster parents in Sapporo but she has asthma so they think it will do her good to spend the summer with her aunt and uncle in a small coastal town. Here she goes out intending to do some sketching; while out she sees an impressive mansion across the marsh. She paddles through the shallow water and finds a house that appears to have been abandoned. As she returns she thinks she sees a light in an upstairs window. She decides to return but the tide is high, however somebody has left a small boat on the dock which she uses to row to the Marsh House. Once here she meets a girl about her own age who tells her that she put the boat at the dock for her. We later learn that this girl is the Marnie of the title. There is something a little odd about her; sometimes it seems as though she just disappears and when she invites Marnie into her house it certainly doesn't seem abandoned.When one thinks of Studio Ghibli one instinctively thinks of great directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata but they have now retired and we can just hope the next generation of directors can provide us with more iconic films. Director Hiromasa Yonebayashi is certainly getting off to a good start; first he directed 'Arrietty' and now this. The story is told at a very gentle, some would say slow, pace but for me that just served to bring me into Anna's world\u0085 of course it helped that everything looked so beautiful. Anna is an unusual protagonist; she is fairly unhappy much of the time; at least until she meets Marnie\u0085 and then there is the sense that Marnie is quire real. Her exact nature is uncertain though; is she a figment of Anna's imagination or a ghost or is there another explanation? There was certainly a haunting feel to the story as we waited to discover just who she is. The eventual revelation was delightfully bittersweet. The film will probably not appeal to the youngest viewers as it isn't the sort of story that stuff constantly happens and it is a bit sad at times; however I suspect slightly older children and their parents will enjoy it\u0085 even though it isn't officially 'shoujo' I expect it will appeal more to girls than boys. Overall I really enjoyed this; I just hope it isn't Studio Ghibli's final film as has been rumoured.",

            "content": "I've nearly watched all animations by Studio Ghibli (and many others other than from this studio) and I can with certainty say that this one is the best animated one! It's like a live-action film with great actors :) Every single emotion is magnificently drawn! When you watch this animation, you shouldn't expect a thriller or scenes of action.. the story is widely dramatic and heartbreaking. It has lots of suspenseful moments that make you want to watch it till the end and the ending is really worth the wait! The anime is about family problems and a young & ill girl's way of dealing with it. One could say that it is her coming of age story which is not easy for her, so she finds a \"friend\", a mysterious foreigner who helps to find herself and make her see the world with different eyes ;) People who think animations are just for children or for younger generation are completely wrong! If you have prejudices, go and watch one and see it for yourself! I can recommend Spirited Away & Grave of the Fireflies. And I really can't believe that Studio Ghibli will take a break from filmmaking now... or will maybe never come back to it again. It's a mess! After seeing so much untalented people doing so many films and earning much money (especially those cheesy Hollywood animations), although for not deserving it, I'm aware of the fact that real artists should be praised! BTW: I don't easily give a film 10/10 ;)",

            "content": "This film has the honour of being the first anime film that I experienced on the big screen.I THINK the moments when I was walking out the door after the movie defined what I felt about the film: I overheard a teenage girl saying: 'Don't know about you, but I never noticed violin music in films before this.' Then she proceeds to hum Anna's theme out loud...note by note.OK, first of all, I don't know what films she has being watching before this, because pretty much every film I watched with a decent score had music I can remember. But even I must admit: The music is the hero in this film, its by far the loudest sound maker in the film, as the strings overwhelms you while the subdued virtual camera pans across typically well-produced Ghibli background art with a bit of light sound effects. I think this film has mastered musically silent scenes...by perfectly contrasting them with scenes where the music takes the reins. The feelings to dread, loneliness and the atmospheric feelings when Anna was exploring the marshes.I find it intriguing that Marnie's theme was hinted at the beginning, even before the appearance of Marnie, taking its full form about half way into the film, but was never given a full fanfare moment: its a tender woodwind led melody that usually takes the form of a bittersweet waltz, its really quite beautiful to see our two main characters dance to it. Anna's theme; definitely the most memorable theme of the film; is written sorely for tear-jerking. The second phrase of this theme takes the form of a 7 note motif, with the first note jumping almost an octave apart to the second before sliding down with the following 5 notes: vintage nostalgic and beautiful writing. Anyone who can survive these 7 simple notes must have a brick for a heart.And this basically sums up the music of this film: simple, beautiful and absolutely nostalgic: it is able to etch itself into your brain without the brute force of brass and percussion, relying mainly on tender piano and woodwind solos and a warm strings section. Even the credits song; interestingly sung and written in English; is practically created just to give you nostalgic feelings and tender melancholy.If I have to describe this film in one word, it would be 'sweet.' That's it. Sweet. Every character; no matter the amount of screen time they get, are awfully likable, the Oiwa family is fun to watch while they had the spotlight, Sayaka, who briefly appears as an adventurous and curious girl, is pleasant to see on screen, Anna and Marnie share a lot of sweet and cute moments, each one leaving you with a big smile on your face. The exceptions to this are characters mainly shown shown in flashbacks: the maids and a brief character called Emily. What I like about Ghibli films like this; a general lack of concrete plot timeline (see Kiki, Totoro and Poppy Hill); is just how...character-driven these films are: there's no plot points that taints and 'conveniently' motivates the characters, instead the plot is moved along by character motivation itself; even if some characters may appear for just seconds...they still somehow serve a profound purpose: The most brutal scenes in the entire film is when the elder Hisako tells her story to Anna and Sayaka: we get to see how Hisako, Anna and Marnie are connected through time.Granted, I would've like to see more of Marnie, Sayaka and Hisako; particularly Hisako; but what I got was satisfying.Needless to say, the art and animation is flawless, Studio Ghibli just utterly celebrates hand drawn animation...its backgrounds feels like vivid recreations of Monet paintings brought to life, the Marsh House drawn on pencil by Anna and oil painted by Hisako looked stunning on screen.So...is this a good film to farewell Ghibli in the foreseeable future? Yes. Is it a masterpiece? It succeeds in many ways but fails in some others. Like I said, the side characters have much more to bring to the table, Anna can be a bit whiny and annoying at first, but she grows like any main character should, Marnie feels too...perfect, and her backstory does not seem to fit her character at times...but she's still a likable presence on screen. Overall, a must watch if you want a easy segway to slowly get into Ghibli films. The soundtrack? Now, this is a possible masterpiece...I would rate score with 5* if its theme based rating only, but overall, its a 4.5*. I also recommend you to check out the included image album: particularly the Anna theme suite.",

            "content": "Following Miyazaki's retirement, the pressure was heavy on Director Yonebayashi as the next successor of Ghibli Studio. But in the Japanese multimedia, it was stated by the Former Director Miyazaki and Producer Suzuki that the future successor was finally decided after watching Yonebayashi's first solo directed movie \"When Marnie Was There (2014)\". Was this really the case? My answer - Yes.This movie is unique in a sense that the story revolves around two female protagonists \"Anna\" and \"Marnie\"; although it does remind us a hint of the nostalgic movie \"My Neighbour Totoro\" which starred \"Satsuki\" and \"May\", their relationship is far more complex. As the story progresses, their relationship becomes more clear and vivid to the audience, and the confusion of the intertwining reality and the dreamlike world starts to unfold. The two girls go on a journey as they discover each others past and dwells upon their current problems, and gradually develops an unbreakable bond that unites them stronger.Although the trailer did cause some confusing misunderstandings between the two girls in Japan, and at the same time my expectations lowered; after watching the movie it was no doubt a splendid and flawless piece of art both literally and figuratively.It is worth noting that Yonebayashi truly challenged the impossible, as even Miyazaki had once thought of making this novel into a movie but had backed down due to its continuous complex changes that occur in the world of the two girls. Furthermore, Yonebayashi has created his \"own\" depiction of the sky in this movie, and is no longer the \"blue sky\" and \"white clouds\" that Miyazaki has portrayed in his series of work. So we can expect to see his own unique world of Ghibli gradually bloom in the next upcoming years.To summarize the experience, it was astonishing how we, the audience ourselves can go on a journey together with the protagonists to overcome their obstacles. Paying attention to the changes in Anna's facial expressions is extremely crucial if you want to enjoy this movie. The succinct yet complex portrayal of these two girls really make you think of the depths of friendship.To conclude, I would like to end with Suzuki's logo that he had written for the advertising poster. The message of the logo is so sincere that to me there is no better way of epitomizing the message that the author and the director was trying to convey to the audience - \u300c\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5927\u597d\u304d\u300d- \"I love you\"; an unconditional love.",

            "content": "Joan G. Robinson's novel \"When Marnie Was There\" is a favourite of mine and has long enjoyed great popularity in Britain, but I was surprised to learn that it is also known in Japan. The original novel is set in a seaside village in Norfolk, but this animated version transfers the action to the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. The characters become Japanese rather than English, although the names of the two main characters, Anna and Marnie, have been retained. Rather oddly, Marnie remains a blue-eyed blonde, as she was in the book: Anna is a brunette, but nevertheless has large round blue eyes. Now characters, especially female characters, in anime often look surprisingly Caucasian, even when they are supposed to be Japanese. In this case, however, Marnie is the daughter of an English father and Japanese mother. (There is also an explanation for Anna's blue eyes, but I won't say what it is as that would be to give away too much of the ending).In this version Anna is a shy, withdrawn and introverted girl, probably aged about 12, living in Sapporo with her foster-parents, with whom she has lived ever since her real parents were killed in a car crash and her grandmother died soon afterwards. Because she suffers from asthma, Anna is sent away from the city to live with Mr & Mrs Oiwa, relatives of her stepmother, in a rural seaside town. Anna has always found it difficult to make friends; she feels that all the rest of the world is inside an invisible circle and that she is on the outside. At first does not seem any happier at the seaside than she did in Sapporo, but things change when she meets Marnie, a girl living in a large house by the sea.The two girls form a close friendship, the first either has ever known, but there is something strange about Marnie, who asks Anna to keep their relationship a secret and who seems to appear and disappear mysteriously. Nobody seems to know anything about her or her family, and her house, although obviously once grand, seems dilapidated and abandoned. Anna finds herself wondering whether her new friend is real, or a ghost, or a figment of her imagination. Eventually Marnie seems to disappear for good, but Anna is befriended by another family who have recently arrived in the village, especially their daughter Sayaka, and this leads to the truth about Marnie, and about Anna's own past, eventually being revealed.When I was younger, animated movies always seemed like something specifically American; Disney seemed to have the market in full-length cartoons sewn up. In more recent decades, however, Disney seem to have abandoned the traditional hand-drawn cartoon in favour of computer animation, and their mantle has passed to Japan, particularly Studio Ghibli. The Ghibli style, however, is very different from the Disneys which I used to love as a child- less stylised, more realistic and with more subdued colours. The visual look of \"When Marnie Was There\" is particularly attractive; I have never been to Hokkaido, but the mountainous landscapes depicted here conjure up the same sort of sense of place which Robinson achieved with her descriptions of the very different Norfolk coast.Much as I love Robinson's book, it does have a couple of minor weaknesses. She never fully explains why Anna is allowed to take so much time off school and what becomes of her biological father after his divorce from her mother. There is perhaps something of a slackening of intensity in the third quarter of the book, between Anna's final meeting with Marnie and the denouement. In the film, however, all these matters are addressed or resolved. Anna's absence from school is explained by her health condition, and Anna's mother is only married once; the man who dies with her in the accident is Anna's father, not her stepfather. The pacing is also better, with no perceptible slackening, possibly because Sayaka, who emerges as Anna's new friend and confidante, is a more well-developed figure than Priscilla, the equivalent character in the book.On the surface, Robinson's novel is a simple tale of the friendship between two young girls, but beneath that surface it is surprisingly deep, tackling the interrelated subjects of loneliness, friendship, bereavement and parental neglect. All of these elements are covered in as much depth in the film version which, I feel, in some respects even manages to improve upon the book. With this film Studio Ghibli have succeeded in the difficult task of taking a story very much rooted in one culture, transferring it to another, very different culture (with only a few minor changes to the plot) and producing something of universal relevance. A beautiful film. 10/10",

Not exactly, as this film soon came out...but since then things have been vague and at the very least, the studio is on some sort of hiatus. What's next? Who knows. But does this film give any weight to the argument that Ghibli certainly can go on without him? It did receive an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature....but is it good and does it meet the studio's standards?The film is about an asthmatic loner, Anna. She's a very sad young girl and has no friends. To help her improve her health, she's sent out to live in the country. However, she soon becomes obsessed with a seemingly abandoned mansion nearby as well as the young lady, Marnie, that lives there. But as the film progresses, the audience begins to wonder if Marnie even exists or if she's some sort of ghost. The real story about Marnie and how this all relates to Anna is something finally revealed near the end...suffice to say that you might just need some tissues. And, since it is such a melancholy film, I don't recommend it to young kids, as they won't understand what they are watching. But for everyone else, including adults, it's a very satisfying and beautiful film...and every bit as enjoyable as the best of Miyazaki. Because of this, I don't quite understand the hiatus. Why not continue the momentum and positive feelings this film will no doubt generate?! Overall, this is a very special and quite unusual film...one that probably has no chance against \"Inside Out\"...but still well worth seeing.",

The movie is similar to the Wind Rises in it's dramatic pulse, but the animation in The Wind Rises was able to help the story along far more than it did with this one. There was nothing about the film that seemed to be helped with the fact that it's animated. I know people who love movies like this but will not go see it cause it's a \"cartoon\" which is a shame.The story in itself is so good that I forget that the anime theme was what sucked me in, and I just take it in as the overall excellent movie that it is. It's just such a beautiful story about friendship and commitment, and the animators did do a great job in showing deep emotions through their moving pictures. A hard task, even to do in live-action, done perfectly by animators, so I guess for them the movie was an ultimate challenge in animating that they won.Definitely worth taking a look at and hope to see it at as a Oscar nominee in 2016.",

            "content": "'When Marnie Was There' may not be one of Studio Ghibli's best films ('Princess Mononoke', 'Spirited Away', 'My Neighbour Totoro', 'Castle in the Sky', 'Whisper of the Heart' and 'Grave of the Fireflies). But even when Ghibli are not at their best they still produce films that are better than most studios at their worst, while 'Tales from Earthsea' is from personal opinion their weakest effort it does have enough to make it watchable still. 'When Marnie Was There' drags a little at times particularly in the first half an hour or so, which is somewhat aimless, and some of the supporting characters could have been much better fleshed out. These flaws aside, 'When Marnie Was There' is still a real charmer, and ranks possibly around higher middle of Studio Ghibli's filmography. Its best assets have to be the animation and the music. The animation is simply wondrous, the colours are both atmospheric and ethereal, all the characters are appealingly drawn in distinctive Studio Ghibli fashion and the backgrounds are exquisitely detailed and gorgeously idyllic, was also really impressed by how Anna's facial expressions conveyed so much. The music is incredibly beautifully orchestrated and sears with emotion , nostalgia and atmosphere, often appropriately gentle and sometimes melancholic. \"Fire on the Outside\" is genuinely moving as well, not mawkish or over-sentimental at all. Scripting warms the heart and moves the soul, the lack of humour not being an issue at all, and actually considering the story it would have felt very misplaced if it was included. The story, centring around Marnie and Anna's friendship, is haunting, heart-warming and often incredibly poignant with the right amount of mystery, the central friendship being charmingly and sometimes heart-wrenchingly portrayed. The message is a strong one, and gives the film an uplifting quality, if one is wondering how the message is written here it does succeed in not preaching too much. Marnie and Anna are likable, well-written characters , while the voice actors fill their roles sensitively. All in all, not one of Studio Ghibli's finest but still a charmer. The DVD bought from Amazon was pricey, but at the end of the day it didn't feel like a waste of money. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "I went into this movie not expecting it to quite live up to the Ghibli standard as most of the films not directed by Hayao or Isao, tend to be among their weaker ones. Yet in terms of story and subtle character writing I would easily rank this among the upper level of Ghibli's films. The story starts off very simple yet it progresses into something very deep and as its mystery is gradually revealed it touches on concepts that are rarely captured in story telling of any medium. It is more than what it appears to be on the surface and it is far deeper than a typical plot about friendship and growing up. While those things are elements of the story, at its heart I would say that it is about the bonds that transcend generations. It is about how time can complicate relationships and simple decisions stretched out overtime can have unintended consequences. It's about discovering that the people we give so little thought to are sometimes far closer to us than we realize and are often experiencing similar hardships. It would have been easy for the story to end on an ambiguous note as so many stories like this do but thankfully the plot is fully explained and provides answers that make the story even more meaningful. Along with its deep and unique story the characters are also subtly crafted and express emotions that are true to life. It deals with very complex feelings such as self loathing and social insecurity in a way the is very natural and rarely captured. Many of the characters are people who have trouble expressing themselves honestly and just as in real life, that behaviour is far more subtle than words can express. Anna is kind at heart but she can also be unintentionally cruel. She is polite and yet dismissive. Other characters who appear strong on the surface are in fact vulnerable but won't show it in private. The movie does a great job of showing characters from slightly different perspectives to show that they are more than simply the face they show the world. The film very believably portrays the idea that people very rarely express what they truly feel, in a way that others understand and that is often what leads to relationships breaking down.As with most Ghibli films, the art direction here is also fantastic. The sets are beautiful and feel like real places. The tone and landscape are immersive and realistic. Its not only beautifully designed it is designed in a way that feels believable and serves a purpose. While this isn't one of Ghibli's most awe inspiring movies, it is one of their most realistic and most profound. It takes a simple relate-able story and takes it someplace rarely explored. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has an appreciation for real subtle characters, unique coming of age stories and stories about complex relationships. I think it is a great movie for families as it is really deals with understanding the people close to us better. It has a great message for people of all ages and it is accessible enough that it can be appreciated on many different levels.",

            "content": "I decided to watch this after seeing it's poster ad which showed two girls standing back to back close to one another, and, yes, the first thought that came across my dirty train of thoughts was, \"This must be shoujo-ai.\" That honestly what triggered me to watch it. Because, honestly, the sort of posters that come out under Studio Ghibli's works never (if I'm correct) features two girls hand in hand like the one depicted in Since Marnie Was There.But boy was I ever wrong for trusting my trashy sixth (or is it seventh??) instincts :-p The story is poignant at its best. It made me cry my eyes out almost all throughout the story, only because, I can relate to the characters' pain expressed and shared in the story very well, and I'm sure those who've experienced the kind of pain Anna and Marnie experienced in their lives.This is also the kind of story that makes you stuck in watching the show if only just to enjoy watching the beautiful scenic art and animations it could offer the audiences. I fell in love immediately after Anna arrived in the countryside. Gosh, the word 'beautiful' just won't do justice to how mesmerizing the art that depicts all those breath-taking scenery in this movie.And just listening to the ending song, made me bawl out ever the more, I had contain myself from making much snotty nose noises in my room, haha.In all seriousness, I want to applaud Studio Ghibli, for once, in their whole studio, for creating a story that doesn't center on LOVE between a girl and a boy, but instead, on grasping the essence meaning of the word LOVE itself, which is so much for than just a love story between a guy and girl. Love yourself, love and appreciate others, kindness, is important as well.",

When Marnie Was There will certainly go down as a \"smaller\" Ghibli film, like Yonebayashi's previous film for the studio, The Secret World of Arietty, but no shame in being smaller than Miyazaki or Takahata. I actually think I might prefer this one slightly to both of their final films, and I hope Yonebayashi continues to direct after this. The story involves young Anna, a sickly, depressed girl from Sopporo who moves in with family friends in the country one summer. While exploring the area, she comes upon a beautiful, seemingly abandoned mansion. One night she finds it's not abandoned, but a young, blonde girl named Marnie lives there with her rich parents. They become quick friends, but each new meeting seems more dreamlike than the last. Anna begins question whether Marnie really exists. Like most Ghibli films, one of the highlights is the score, here by Takatsugu Muramatsu. The English language song that plays over the closing credits, \"Fine on the Outside\" by Priscilla Ahn, is tremendously moving. Truly wonderful.",

            "content": "Presumably, if reports are to be believed as of this year (or last), When Marnie Was There is the final theatrical feature from Studio Ghibli (this on the heels of also presumed - for real this time - retirements for Miyazaki and Yakahata, who made their recent films as The Wind Rises and Princess Yaguya). This makes me sad, but mostly as this movie is itself so painfully sad all over. It's a tearjerker, without any equivocation, and that's not a bad thing as any movie if it's done right - maybe the greatest Japanese animated film ever made, Grave of the Fireflies, is a cry-every-other-minute film - but here, it's almost too much, and deals with pain and loss and alienation in such a way that it ultimately is disappointing that it ends up in a plot 'twist'. Or is it a reveal? This does, seemingly, take audiences to a more realistic place than some other Ghibli films - I was reminded of Whisper of the Heart, also a movie about an artistically talented girl who gets a connection to a special person, only for her own existential path to be more complicated - and that's certainly welcome. It follows this girl Anna who has asthma and is actually a foster child, and is sent by her Auntie to get some fresh air for the summer with relatives on a coastal island (I think it's an island). There, one evening, she meets Marnie, a blond-haired girl who lives in the mansion that Anna finds so beautiful. They become very close friends, but something doesn't quite seem right in some ways.Of course as friends they make it a 'secret' not to tell anyone. Who might Anna tell anyway? No friends really (she shoves some away due to her social awkwardness), and not her guardians (one voiced in the English dub by John C. Reilly, also welcome). But Marnie? It seems less clear - except that, if one can see pretty quickly, she's not exactly who she says she is. Is she an 'imaginary friend' as Anna comes to the conclusion once discovering new people moving in to the mansion? Or what about a ghost? In a manner of speaking, yes. But the details of why Marnie is no longer 'there' become the emotional cornerstone of the entire film, and certainly not an easy one to take.When Marnie Was There is unabashedly sentimental stuff. I wondered at times if I might just be, as a grown man, just not the right audience for this material. But then I've gravitated to most of the Ghibli library, even when there are characters outside of my frame of reference. And it shouldn't matter, the themes are universal, up to a point, of a little girl who is alone and feels alone and is with someone else who also feels alone and they have each other. That part I can get. What is a little distant this time around is... frankly, a certain low-key energy for at least the first half of the film. I hasten to say the word 'boring' because it isn't, and there is a difference with low-key, where things are just... moving along, a little slowly, leisurely, without any deference to anything or any major stakes.The second half picks up, to be sure, as the mystery of who Marnie is or where she was from, and the significance of the silo and what might have happened there. But by the end, as a sort of exposition dump happens and a major reveal happens about the past of Marnie, and Anna herself, it's slightly unsatisfying. Perhaps I should've expected this - I called that she was a ghostly figure fairly early on, and there's no real trace of fantasy stuff outside of it. On the plus side, as a given with Ghibli, the animation is breathtaking and sweet and sumptuous, and in all of the ways that are subtle and exacting of the place and time. This is warm summer with water and beaches and big mansions and the like, and it has the weight of this place much as Whisper of the Heart carried the simplicity of city life to a T.So what was I expecting that the movie didn't give me? I don't know. I can't not recommend When Marnie Was There for admirers of the studio, and I'm sure aficionados will seek it out anyway. I may be responding on a first watch to its elegiac tone (albeit at the core it's a movie about finding someone to love in a platonic sense, I think) and I wonder if there was any intention on the part of the filmmakers to finish off their studio's output (at least for now) on a story that deals with separation and loss (or lack) of identity and trust in adult figures. You can get the napkins and handkerchiefs ready, but it just wasn't totally great for me, at least up to the (admittedly) high standards of Ghibli, or even this director, who's previous film The Secret World of Arriety I liked very much.",

The two giants of the studio, Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata have both gone into retirement and the studio announced that they will not be making any more films for now. Takahata and Miyazaki are responsible for some of Ghibli's greatest films such as Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro and Grave of the Fireflies. When Marnie Was There is directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi and is about the introvert girl Anna who is sent to the countryside to live with relatives. She becomes obsessed with a deserted mansion and the girl who lives there who may or may not be real.Ghibli's films usually contains imagination and the focus is almost always on children but despite that, the films are not only meant for them and also often include deep meanings and thoughts. Ghibli has always been incredibly skillful in drawing and creating magnificent images and When Marnie Was There is no exception. The beautiful Japanese landscapes makes you want to travel there immediately and see the country for yourself. The film is told like a detective story and Anna finds and puts the clues together one by one. She is our guide throughout the film and what she experiences, we experience too.When Marnie Was There has a story I believe many can relate to. Not being able to find your own place in this world and to feel like an outcast. Anna searches like many children do, for their place in society and at the same time she's trying to understand her life and situation. The film is also about strong friendship and love and why we are drawn specifically to some people. It's always hard for me to try and summarize Ghibli's films and explain why people should watch them.

There she befriends a young girl with flowing blonde hair who she begins to build a close bond with. The two build a strong friendship, though the mysterious, ethereal Marnie clearly is more then meets the eye.The movie When Marnie Was There, appears from the outset to be a coming of age story, with the focus being a young girl discovering her past in a far off place, through the mysterious Marnie. However to contrast the tropes of the coming of age narrative, there is an unshakable sense of passing in this story, from the ghostly appearance of Marnie, to the mysterious boatman and the frail condition of our heroine Anna, we have a tale which is as much a story of childhood as it is of eventual adulthood and death. Much has been made of this movie for being the first Studio Ghibli movie post Miyazaki's and Takahata's retirement, both of whom were the founders of Studio Ghibli as we know it. Many have speculated as to whether this movie offers a glimpse of the future of Ghibli in younger hands, and from reading a few of the English language reviews already availible, many seem to contemplate whether this is a swan song for Ghibli or possibly a new dawn. Having just seen this movie, my overriding opinion is that Ghibli is alive and well and in the director Yonebayashi, they have a director who is a fitting heir to the masters Miyazaki and Takahata. The movie When Marnie Was There carries all of the hall marks of great Ghibli, as you would expect from Ghibli there is; attention to detail, a strong narrative, well fleshed out characters, a great score, gorgeous visuals. This list reads as a standard for Ghibli animation, but what we should appreciate is that most movies failed to attain any of the points listed above, Ghibli achieves this with each and every one of their movies, and this is not attained effortlessly, but what we see when we watch a Ghibli movie are master crafts man at the peak of their creative powers striving for perfection in hand drawn animation. There is a creative vigor on the screen, one which screams both joyously and artfully. When Marnie Was There fits nicely into this bracket, and proves that Ghibli will endure long after Miyazaki and Takahata has left the building.",

I'm happy to say that it wasn't a disappointment, despite not being directed by Hayao Miyazaki.The plot of the movie is actually really engaging. I found myself wondering 'why' or 'how' a lot, and I still think about it. By the end of the movie it has wrapped it all up relatively well, and your left feeling satisfied for the most part. The characters are the clear driving force of the movie, and they are actually quite good. Sure, they're relationship is a little rushed. One moment they're almost strangers, next they're best friends. Maybe I wasn't seeing the progression of time as well as I was supposed to, but they were a little rushed. It's explained at the end though, so it makes up for it. One of the best parts of the movie was the ending. It was very well- done, and wraps up the movie quite well. Not only that, but it gives some food for thought. Some things aren't completely explained, but if you just think about them they make more sense. I don't want to spoil anything, so you'll just have to see it to know what I'm talking about. Another thing that really jumped out at me right off the bat were the colors. There are lot's of them, all bright and beautiful. The scenery is also wonderful to look at. Visually, this movie is almost flawless. Unfortunately I found that there was a little too much green. Despite there being a reason for it, I found that it got to be a little hard on the eyes at times. My biggest complaint about the movie is that Anna trips all the time for almost no reason. It wasn't a big deal, but it just got annoying sometimes. The movie could be quite emotional sometimes too, and it's always great when a movie can actually make you feel something. Overall When Marnie Was There is fantastic. The plot is interesting, the characters are good, the art design is amazing, and the ending was fantastic. With a few little issues here and there, this movie is one of Studio Ghibli's best for sure. In the end I would certainly recommend When Marnie Was There to just about anyone.",

It's probably not really the best movie ever, but I love how we start the movie by seeing Anna's strengths and weaknesses. She is a great tween artist who struggles with terrible depression. I consider myself an artist and though I am happy now, I wasn't always, especially in my early teens. I have never connected with a character like I did her. After watching this movie I struggled to get to bed and was actually depressed the next day. This movie forced the questions on me; Who am I? What should I be doing with my life? Although it may be hard to recommend to people with very different problems, it really spoke to me, and is one of my absolute favorites.",

            "content": "Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 2.8/5 stars\"When Marnie Was There\" never fulfills on its grand promise of something profound. Based on the book by Joan G. Robinson, it's another fantastical tale from Japanese animation juggernaut Studio Ghibli. Director Hiromasa Yonebayashi sweeps the frames with the studio's quintessential ethereal brushstrokes, delivering an aesthetically superb piece. But there may not be enough meat to keep adults engaged, while the subtler themes of sexuality and gender will likely soar over little ones' heads.After suffering an asthma attack at school, out-of-place Anna is dispatched to a seaside town in Hokkaido. There she finds herself fascinated by a dilapidated mansion, perched on the edge of a marshland. She strikes up a fervent friendship with the house's enigmatic occupant Marnie, and the pair soon becomes inseparable, enabling the previously withdrawn Anna to open up. But in typical Ghibli fashion, things are never what they seem, and Anna finds herself charged with unraveling a family history mystery.The plot centers on female friendship, exploring \"tomboy\" and \"girly-girl\" archetypes. This is particularly interesting coming out of Japan, where femininity and innocence are inextricably linked and highly revered. Anna is a world away from the giggling schoolgirl stereotype, and while vague questions of her sexuality and mental health are hazily hinted at, they're never really raised, let alone explored. Understandable for a PG film, but in the end, it left me with more questions than answers. Anna and Marnie frequently abscond together in clandestine meetings, suggesting a rapport that is far more intimate. It reaches an apex when a jealous Anna questions Marnie about dancing with a boy. You're certain that something more will come of this, but eventually nothing does. Later there is a scary interlude that resembles a Gothic tale involving an old abandoned silo that terrifies Marnie. More suggestions of something deeper than what is actually presented. The denouement ultimately ignores all of these plot threads and settles into a resolution that doesn't effectively address the issues with which Anna is struggling. Psychologically, she was really messed up to begin with, and the reveal is totally disconnected from what this girl had been feeling. It seems all too rushed and contrived after a point.Maybe I'm being a bit demanding, but \"When Marnie Was There\" just feels more muddled than most Studio Ghilbi offerings - many of them classics in their own right. You sense that it boils down to a scripting issue, simply because the film doesn't earn some of its poignant scenes - for instance, Anna and Marnie declare their love for each other after one quick meeting, which doesn't evoke sincerity as the writers don't make us believe that the characters ought to be feel that way. Nevertheless, the movie is too visually hypnotic to ignore. Both the background score and sound effects enhance the rich milieu, which is spellbinding to begin with.With Ghibli announcing indefinite hiatus last year, \"When Marnie Was There\" marks the last film we'll see from the studio for some time. In that light, it's dimly disappointing and doesn't hold a candle to most of their erstwhile endeavors. But it's still worth a look for ardent anime fans and Ghibli devotees who'll be waiting a while for their next fix. It's visually alluring with some nice touches, but one does feel that it could, or rather should, have been much deeper in its narrative. I liked it. I just didn't love it.",

            "review_title": "Great story, but dialogue is heavy-handed and overly emotional",
            "content": "Being the last movie before Studio Ghiblis hiatus, I had big expectations for 'When Marnie was there'. Since the studio has produced nearly exclusively great films so far, 'Marnie' had to compete with giants like 'My Neighbor Totoro', 'Spirited Away' and my personal favorite, 'Princess Mononoke'. Leaving the theater, I was quite disappointed. 'When Marnie was there' follows the 12-year old, depressed girl Anna. She doesn't have any friends and her foster parents are overwhelmed with her, so they sent her to the countryside to visit some relatives. There she meets and befriends the mysterious girl Marnie.Since 'Marnie' is stylistically similar to 'The Wind Rises', the animators couldn't let their imagination go wild and create amazing fantasy worlds like in 'Spirited Away'. But this isn't really a problem, since 'Marnie' is more grounded and focuses more on the characters and plot and not the world they live in. Despite that, the animators are still able to pull off some great visuals that not only look great, but also serve the plot and characters.Ironically, this is the major problem with this film. While the plot itself is great and has some interesting themes, the friendship between the two girls is extremely superficial and barely explored. They meet and from one second to the other are best friends for life. To make it even worse, the dialogue is cringe-worthy at times, especially when clich\u00e9'd phrases like 'I will love you forever' and ' Always remember me' are used. This wouldn't be a problem, but since the mutual relationship is one major theme and not really developed, this dialogue seems heavy-handed and out of place. The next wasted opportunity was the ending. The buildup and especially the subtle hints throughout the film were well done, but it was completely ruined after they explained for the 5th time what the ending was about, in case somebody didn't pay attention for the last 10 minutes. Another minor complained would be the constant falling and tripping of the main character. Miyazaki always used some quirks like these to make his characters more real, but director Hiromasa Yonebayashi went way overboard with this and made Anna look clumsy and barely capable off walking.What makes this movie disappointing is not that it is a bad movie, but that it had potential to be great, and wasted it.",

Studio Ghibli makes a fine artistic advance in cartoon animation with this film, but the story is tiresome, even tedious at times. The imagination and wonder of their earlier stories never shows up. It's more like a soap opera for kids.For roughly the first half, the build up and mystery is there, but then the secret is revealed and revealed again, and again, and again, and that's pretty much all the rest of the film does while essentially putting the art and animation on a loop until the end.As a short, it would be tolerable.

            "content": "The opening sections of Omoide no M\u00e2n\u00ee get the film off to a very good start. Primarily this is off the back of how interesting Anna is as a character; she is not amazingly new in her teenage struggles perhaps, but they seem genuine, informed, and they show on her surface in a way that speaks to a lot more happening that is buried. With Anna as the base, the slow pace of the film did not bother me too much because I was interested enough in her to trust the film as it took us to a new community, set-up some interactions and the mystery of the mansion across the swamp.This doesn't last unfortunately, and the film doesn't built on that character so much as sit on the potential. There is a certain engagement in the way the mystery plays out and what Marine leads the film to. However as it goes it asks a lot but doesn't deliver too much; again one goes with this on the trust that it will be something the character deserves. I found it far too neat and tidy when we got there though, and the aspects that Anna indicated early on are sort of simplified more than I liked. It still offers something as it goes, but the destination didn't satisfy.Along the way it is as visually stunning as you expect, and it is as professionally constructed as the norm \u2013 but when it moved from an engaging reality into the more fantasy realm I expected it to soar with this as its base, however the pat nature of the conclusion rather grounds it instead.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that I am a huge Ghibli fan. I love Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away and Porco Rosso. But this film was very disappointing. The movie falls in the category 'but is was only a dream'-type of movie. You'll find out there's something about Marnie (not going to spoil it) but the way the story unfolds is so poorly executed you will most likely only enjoy it if you don't think too much about what is happening.Here's a few examples; the adults in this film are merely decorative. None of the adults have a purpose except for moving the story along. There's no real interaction and what interaction there is is just weird. How come Anna's guardians don't really care about what she's doing? Everything she does is fine and they never talk to her. We only see them being happy as campers and that's it.The whole focus of this film is on Marnie and Anna, and the world besides this doesn't come to life. There are shots put in of the environment and despite looking great they feel forced. Ghibli used to be great at this but they don't seem to be capable of creating this engaging world they so often showcased in other films. Also the one other character Anna interacts with also feels like an important pawn but nothing more. It's a very colourful character but the way she all of a sudden appears to be a major part of the plot makes no sense.And the last thing is Anna her clumsiness. Holy cow, she falls and stumbles and staggers so many times it's ridiculous! It happens so often that it distracts from the movie.So all in all it's just a hard to believe story. If you're good at ignoring details and fawning over Ghibli you'll enjoy it. If you enjoy proper story telling I'd suggest to skip this one and go for one of the other excellent movies Ghibli has made in the past decades.",

The film's derivative of countless other anime (\"Only Yesterday\", \"My Neighbour Totoro\", \"From Up on Poppy Hill\", \"The Secret World of Arrietty\" etc), all of which use bucolic idylls to delve into and so heal traumatic, tragic pasts.The \"tragedy\", in the case of \"Marnie\", involves the psychological and physical abuse suffered by several generations of related young women.

            "content": "I seriously thought When Marnie Was There (2014) was a romance film based around a lesbian relationship. I have no issue with LGBT films (in fact, I love them) but let me explain why I thought this to be the case and why it is necessary to discuss in this review.When I watch a film, I would instantly evaluate it based on what I actually detect from the viewing. I rarely watch trailers or read a lot about it beforehand so most of the time my mind is clean as I do not want to form preconceptions. That is why I couldn't help thinking Studio Ghibli had made a lesbian film, as it has a misleading story progression.The main character, Anna, is a shy and lonely girl who is often uncomfortable with people. She hates herself and probably everyone around her, as she could be seen hostile to others at times. However, she bonded so quickly with Marnie, whom she just met. Anna looks so dependent or obsessed with the girl. They secretly see each other for many nights. All of a sudden, Marnie says they would remain a secret. They quickly look like soulmates so after some time I thought they might be lesbians. When Marnie finally says she loves Anna more than any girl she has known, this reinforced the idea!Lesbian film or not, that is not the issue. The thing is, When Marnie Was There (2014) is quite a letdown because they had attracted my genuine interest; I thought this was going to be a special Studio Ghibli film which celebrates LGBT pride but in the end it is not. It is also not a romance nor a friendship film; it is something else and the progression is truly misleading. I guess they are just trying to make the film feel mysterious but this goes terribly wrong.Despite this, When Marnie Was There (2014) does have the ability to make us wonder about people from the past and everyone's unique story. There are some sad scenes and the ending is a little satisfying because a mystery is solved but all that cannot make up for rest of the time wasted on something that ends up feeling underdeveloped. I wanted to love When Marnie Was There (2014), but I just can't.",

            "content": "'WHEN MARNIE WAS THERE': Three Stars (Out of Five)A Japanese anime flick; which was nominated for Best Animated Feature, at the upcoming Academy Awards. It was written and directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi; and it's based on the 1967 young adult novel, of the same name, by Joan G. Robinson. The film tells the story of a young girl, that becomes obsessed with a mysterious young woman; who may just exist in her imagination. The movie received mostly positive reviews, from critics, and it's noted, by fans, for possibly being the last film produced by Studio Ghibli. I found it to be very slow-paced, but also charming.The film tells the story of a 12-year-old girl named Anna (voiced by Hailee Steinfeld, in the English version). She lives with foster parents, in Sapporo, but she becomes unhappy when she realizes her parents are paid, by the government, to watch over her. After a serious asthma attack, at school, she's sent to live with relatives, of her foster parents, in a seaside town. There she dreams of a girl named Marnie (voiced by Kiernan Shipka and Taylor Autumn Bertham, at different ages). She's stunned to see Marnie come to life (apparently), in an abandoned mansion near by. Anna then becomes infatuated with the strange girl.The story is very slow moving, and I can't imagine why most kids would like it (much). Not all animation has to be for children though; the book was written for young adults, and that might be a more appropriate age group for this. That's not to say there's anything inappropriate with the material; it's perfectly acceptable for kids, of all ages, to see. I think it also has a very positive (and upbeat) message, about coming-of-age. It's well made, and it has a very classic animated film feel to it (too). I found it to be (mostly) boring, but it's also slightly moving.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/A1MyBFioKXM",

            "content": "It's a shame that Studio Ghibli is going to stop making movies. While they never exactly said that they're done for good, it seems that with the legendary Hayao Miyazaki retiring, the studio knows that it needs to figure out what it going to do without their master at the head. I can understand their fear that they may not be able to go on without Miyazaki, Studio Ghibli has brought some of the greatest animated movies to the rest of the world, and not to mention has given Americans two things that we don't do for our own movies.First of all, the most obvious; the animation. Ghibli was keen on keeping their movies with a hand drawn look despite the advancing technology of computers and how every studio in America makes their animated movies in realistic CGI. There's still a beauty within it's high detail of paint and ink. The other difference is the tone. While most animated movies from America tend to go with louder that it's audiences want, Ghibli makes their movies quieter. The stories still feel large, but often their movies will focus on the smaller stories of life like moving or making friends. When Marnie Was There is a testament to friendship.The quiet twelve-year-old Anna (played by Haliee Steinfeld) is that girl we've all known to be so shy, that she shuts everyone out and has no friends. She even shuts out her foster parent Yoriko (played by Genna Davis) when it's found out that she gets money from the government to look after Anna. Anna suffers an asthma attack at school, so her parent sends her to relatives living in a rural seaside town to give her better air to breathe. It seems like a nice summer break, but Anna would rather not be a burden to anyone.She arrives with open arms from Kiyomasa (played by John C. Reilly) and Setsu, but still seems a bit closed off. They try to set Anna on a outing with a neighbor kid, but that proves to be a failure. When strolling through the town, she grows an attachment to an abandoned marsh mansion. She rows there one night to find a girl her age named Marnie, who lives there with her nanny. The once abandoned house is now a majestic home by the sea. As Anna meets up with Marnie more often, she starts to feel a closer connection then with anyone she's ever known.Studio Ghibli could have gone out with an epic, grand adventure to close off their stories, but When Marie Was There both something subtle, yet big. What I mean from that is that the story puts more time with the friendship of Anna and Marnie then the mystery that surrounds the movie. The scenes between the two are beautiful. Part of me wishes that the story could have been more focused on that then the more supernatural element in place. It's not that the mystery is bad, but it is really hard to follow.It took me time to figure out if Anna was really seeing Marnie or if Anna is the ghost of Marnie's world or what. I think Studio Ghibli was trying to make the most complex story to go around the friendship, but it comes off like an art-house wannabe.The good news is that like its other movies, When Marnie Was There has great characters and a nice atmosphere. Anna may be an introvert, but we understand her personality enough to like and wish she could connect with people. The town she stays in is so quaint that it reminds me of my favorite vacation grounds, Laguna Beach. I'll give this seven abandoned mansions out of ten. It's not the best Ghibli movie, but a nice one to end on. I hope that Ghibli manages to return to continue bringing it's beautiful looking stories to America. We're not going to do it, so Japan might as well stick around with this. If you're a Ghibli fan, see it. If not, see some other Ghibli movies first before catching this one.",

The scenery is drawn in such a way that I want to be there and the food in the movie always looks delicious. The music is also great, I could listen to the melodies in this film all day, they are really relaxing when they need to be, and quite sad when the time comes for that. The voice acting for the dub is also good, nothing much to report there, everyone does a good job with their characters. So all the technical stuff that you come to expect from Studio Ghibli are done well, how is the story...Now time for the negative. The main character, Anna, is sef-loathing, anti-social, ungrateful, boring, irresponsible and sometimes just mean. Understandably the movie needs a flawed character for the protagonist. That way the audience can see the way they develop and improve as a character. But I think they went a little too far with this girl, making her journey hard to get engaged with.The rules of this fantasy world are also very inconsistent. It is hard for the audience to gage the stakes of the situation if all that is going on turns out to be a dream or something like that.A lot of the film feels directionless, Anna will just sort of wander around and daydream about a house she sees. If they are trying to do a slow burn mystery plot, they need a better hook then simply: \"that house looks familiar\".The supporting characters are nice, but not given much time to shine. I was ready to call this Ghibli's worst, but the movie does salvage a lot if points with its ending. The last 15 minutes or so, help bring the story together in a nice package and leave the audience with a good feeling.It all comes down to how much you are willing to forgive from a good ending. For me, the good just about evened out with the bad. And the film walks away with a neutral score. Watch if you're a Ghibli fan, otherwise, you don't need to go out of your way to see it.",

With the exception of Wind Rises, the movies were overrated with simplistic Tale of Princess Kaguya (at the beginning, of course). I was pretty skeptical about this one. While it started off with a great beginning, it got boring and annoying when Sayaka showed up. She is a forgettable character who was kind of mean, yet so nice, she's clich\u00e9d.Anna bothered me for some reason, it was because of her boyish clothes but it was also something else, I don't know. Maybe she's just a stereotypical pre-teen. Marnie was the standout character of all the characters, she was perky, friendly, and mysterious.Anna befriends Sayaka which drops the ball because a lot of movies have characters befriending the clich\u00e9d nice girl. The art and animation were still amazing as usual, but I am very disappointed in Studio Ghibli for ending up like Pixar. The movie of course got cloying as it went on whether it's between Anna or Sayaka or Anna and Marnie. It also ended in a sentimental way. Maybe if they brought Hayou Miyazaki back to directing, he would save the studio and bring it back its glory.Also, I thought Sayaka's voice acting was a pretty bad job. The themes just didn't click with me, it was boring and sometimes not empathetic. Studio Ghibli tried too hard by throwing in creepy parts and an emotional ending to be like their other movies. The creepy parts did not blend well and ruined the pacing of the film.",

It wasn't that it lacked the fantasy, magical effect; on the contrary, it was quite enjoyable, with the beautiful landscapes and the detailed scenes. However, the story kind of dragged on. I guess it's is mainly me that was bothered by that and in general, this movie is quite good. The story is interesting, though it gets confusing with the way the relationship between the two girls is developed and the fact that Anna, although agreeing that there is something \"fishy\" about Marnie, on the very next scene she continues on like nothing has happened. Towards the end, things get way too obvious, but at least the ending was good and satisfying, as it didn't left any case unsolved and every story got a happy closure. So, 4 out of 10.",

            "content": "The great Hayao Miyazaki has announced his retirement from directing animated films with his Studio Ghibli a number of times, though he has often brought himself back to make just one more film. But now, it is not just the great man himself that is announcing closing for business, it is the Studio as a whole. Directed by one of the younger of six directors to have worked under the Studio Ghibli name, Hiromasa Yonebayashi, 'When Marnie was there' brings an end to three decades worth of anime, starting with 'Laputa: Castle in the Sky'. This film already, therefore, has a lot resting on its shoulders. Yonebayashi has worked on numerous Ghibli films in various animation roles, though his only previous film as a director with the Studio was 'Arrietty': not perhaps their strongest work. Like 'Arrietty' before it - and indeed other Ghibli films - 'When Marnie was there' is based on a British children's novel. The flat, isolated land of Norfolk has been replaced for the mountainous, isolated land of Hokkaido, with young, moody Anna, suffering from asthma, leaves her foster mother in Sapporo to stay with relatives in a small village from some much needed R and R. Troubled at home, Anna's troubles don't particularly ease, failing to fit in, lost in her imagination and sketch pad. Quickly she becomes fascinated by the 'Marsh House', an old mansion left in a state of disrepair. Becoming an obsession, she begins to imagine Marnie, the former daughter of the house many moons ago. Forming a bond with her imaginary companion, Anna begins to come to terms with her own situation at home.The film can be divided into three distinct sections for me: To start, as ever with a Ghibli film, the attention to detail is impeccable, with every pixel of the screen thoughtfully considered, making the animation as true to life as possible. It's once we move toward the film's middle that the level of visual detail starts to decrease a little as the storyline develops. This is where we hit the film's weakest point. As it's a Ghibli film, many might see this as magical and moving in a coming-of-age tale, though for me 'When Marnie was there' gets far too soppy, borderline lesbian and a little bit of a bore. Luckily, as the film draws to a conclusion, it is rescued somewhat as the storyline is rounded off.Up until the new millennium and 'Spirited Away', the direction of Ghibli films was tackled by-and-large by founders Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata. Since then, however, younger directors have, at times, taken the reigns, leaving the films, while on the whole satisfying, a little more bumpy and inconsistent.But with the two founders now both old men, well deserving of the title 'retired', rather than letting the Studio slip into the hands of others, perhaps calling it a day is called for.politic1983.blogspot.co.uk",

            "content": "I found out about this Japanese cartoon movie, from Studio Ghibli, mainly because of its inclusion in the Oscar nominations, I was always going to watch this, both to see if I agree with this accolade, and as a fan of many films from the studio. Basically shy 12-year-old Anna Sasaki (Hailee Steinfeld) lives with her foster parents, Yoriko (Geena Davis) and her husband, in Sapporo, she is distant and unhappy, for health reasons she is sent to spend the summer with Yoriko's relatives, Setsu (Grey Griffin) and Kiyomasa Oiwa (John C. Reilly), in a rural seaside town. While there, Anna is fascinated by an abandoned mansion, dilapidated and overgrown, across the marsh, she wonders why it seems familiar to her, it has been empty for a long time, but Anna has visions of the house looking well and people residing in it. One night, following an argument, Anna runs away, she finds a boat and rows across to the mansion, there she is greeted by beautiful, good-natured blonde girl Marnie (Kiernan Shipka), Anna tells her about her dreams, but Marnie assures her she is not dreaming now, they agree to keep meeting in secret, but the next day, when Anna plans to see Marnie, the mansion has returned to its abandoned and dilapidated state. A week later, while sketching, Anna meets older woman Hisako (Vanessa Williams) who paints pictures of the mansion and marsh, she comments that Anna's sketches look like a girl she used to know when she was young, and she used to live in the mansion, which is being renovated for someone moving in. Anna returns to the mansion, she meets a girl named Sayaka (Ava Acres), she discovers Marnie's diary in a drawer, it includes text about a party Anna may have been part of, several pages of the diary are missing. The next day, Marnie reappears and talks to Anna about her parents always travelling abroad, her nanny and two maids and their physical and psychological abuse, Anna wants to help her confront her fear of the silo, where she used to be threatened of being locked in, Anna falls asleep, and is upset to find Marnie has abandoned her in the silo. Meanwhile, Sayaka and her brother finds the missing diary pages, including mention of the silo, they find Anna there in a feverish state, during which she dreams of confronting Marnie, who apologises for leaving her, and telling her she can no longer see her, Marnie begs Anna for forgiveness, Anna vows to remember Marnie as she is swept away by the tide. Anna recovers from her fever, Sayaka shows her the missing pages and a painting Hisako gave to Marnie, Hisako tells them Marnie's story. Marnie married Kazuhiko, who died from an illness, they had a daughter named Emily, Marnie was committed to a psychiatric hospital and Emily was sent to boarding school, when Marnie was released Emily was upset for her abandoning her, she ran away and had a daughter of her own, she and her husband were killed in a car accident, Marnie raised her granddaughter until her death, the girl was put in foster care. It is the end of summer, Yoriko is taking Anna home, she gives Anna a photograph of the mansion that belonged to her grandmother, she realises she is the daughter of Emily and Marnie's granddaughter, this revelation brings Anna closure of her identity, she bids her friends of the town goodbye, and sees the mansion and Marnie one last time as she is taken back home. Also starring Catherine O'Hara as the Elderly Lady, Ellen Burstyn as Nanny and Kathy Bates as Mrs. Kadoya. The cast dubbing the voices into English are all chosen well, it is a fairly simple story of a pubescent tomboy girl unknowingly going back in time to meet the younger version of her relative, it is perhaps more realistic than previous films from the studio, no magical and fantasy elements as such, it hasn't got quite the same charm as these other films, but the animation is fantastic, overall its not a bad animated drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year. Worth watching!",

            "content": "I'll just start by recounting the things I appreciate and think this movie did well: The main character Anna's unreality blending with reality. An abandoned mansion across a lake in a quiet village. The tides that open and close a path. Pencil sketches. The decay of a mansion. Illusions from a past. A dance with the flower girl. A haunted silo on a hill. Plenty of sentimental strings. Excessive use of windy field recordings (why else would you watch anime). Self- loathing introvert Anna. Dreamy rich secluded girl Marnie. An old taciturn fisherman. A nighttime picnic with juice and cookies. A classy suits-and-dresses party. \"Fine on the Outside\". Anna passing out in ditches (I'm stretching it now). The whole movie is visually pleasing. I always welcome peaceful depictions of a countryside. I loved that the mystery of the mansion and who Marnie was, lasted long. Patient storytelling is a huge plus. Unfortunately I disliked some things too. Mostly the ending. Anna's self-hatred is neglected by the end. Her character arc doesn't make a lot of sense. She just transforms into this new happy girl, or at least I was left with that impression, which is just the same. It really felt like a gimmick when they faded away the background noise right as the super obvious plot twist was revealed. It's like they're telling us \"you're supposed to be awe-struck now!\". It's effective when you don't see it coming, I guess. But I had figured that Anna already made that connection when she listened to Hisako's completely revealing story. Perhaps she didn't know she was in a movie where nothing can be a coincidence. In the end, the writers mess up a good socially anxious character by embracing, excuse my cynicism, typical family-movie-level optimism. It carefully maneuvers around realer, darker matters (like that of what seems to be her escapist delusions) by stuffing the viewer's throat full of parental love and finding happiness and friendship. All timeless clich\u00e9s, but so uncalled for here, given the mysterious setting and mature tone of the first three fourths of the movie. Why remain on the surface when there are deeper waters waiting to be explored?You see it's hard for me to find virtue in Marnie and Anna's relationship now that I know the outcome and know who Marnie is. Especially when I know who Marnie is. Tell no one this, but I had my fingers crossed for their relationship to blossom (Ghibli doing yuri would be a sight to behold). Or at least for something more daring and mature to happen. I learned afterwards that this is indeed based on a British children's novel from the 60s, so that explains a lot I guess. Ech. How naive I was to think this was an original and recent creation. Oh well. At least finding solace in illusions is still a beautiful sentiment.",

Pointless?We see the main character, Anna, having to travel to a small village for a while due to a health issue and her having to breathe fresh air. The whole plot revolves around her coming into contact with Marnie, which has a mysterious past and a rough childhood.Most of the movie consists of fairly harmless scenes about their friendship, which is cool, but doesn't push the plot forwards at all. Near the end of the movie, we finally get the answer to who Marnie is, but it's some of the most underwhelming reveals I've ever seen.The plot feels like it's leading up to something that's not really there, and the ending feels like a weird \"and then everything everyone lived happily ever after\" situation that doesn't feel earned at all.That said, I did kind of enjoy this movie. The animation is gorgeous (VERY gorgeous!), and the scenes were good enough to keep me interested on what'll happen next.

Like all Ghibli productions, the animation is lush, detailed and fluid. The voice work in the English version I watched is good despite being somewhat flat and generic at times. I very much like Studio Ghibli movies but find in general that anime adds more to fantasy films (where it can make unreal real, such as \"Howl's Moving Castle\" or \"Spirited Away\") than it does to more 'realistic' films such as \"When Marnie Was There\". Despite that, and being both the wrong gender and decades away from the target audience, I really enjoyed, and would recommend, \"When Marnie Was There\".",

Hooray the Miyazakis are making films they want to make! But yawn it's not something I want to see. But boy this was a treat to my eyes, ears and, yeah yeah, heart.With a plot that might sound like a psycho-sexual horror thriller if told by wrong voices (In evil Cumberbatch voice: A sick girl is lured into an abandoned mansion by a mysterious blond woman who has some dark secrets and her own motives), this film has classic Ghibli elements: A young girl with problems. Well-meaning adults. (Beautiful) Country side. Supernatural (?) friend. You spend the first half hour just enjoying the beautiful pictures and ticking off your To-See List for a Ghibli film.Very very slight spoilers ahead.Then Marnie appears. I realized what the film was doing but was still mystified by it. Got to admit the change of scenes didn't really feel connected. I guess it was hard for the makers too since they resorted to \"stuff disappeared while the heroine dosed off\" clich\u00e9. However this is not faulting the contents but the glue.There was a moment where I smiled and whispered \"Aha!\" 15 minutes before the final revelation and ended up proved wrong with a clever twist on the twist. Wow. What a pay-off it had. The obligatory explanation sequence was turned into something powerful and resonant and it's thanks to the build-up that may have baffled you earlier.It's a shame that this film lost out to the annual regurgitation of tired old Pokemon: The Movie series. The director Yonebayashi made Arrietty for Ghibli which easily trumps Goro Miyazaki's attempts at direction. Hope the next film he makes doesn't take the same step of his two previous works and go for a whole world of fantasy.",

The Wind Rises, From Up on Poppy Hill, and now When Marnie was there.Now don't get me wrong. I LOVE Ghibli movies. Kiki's delivery service, the Cat Returns, and Castle in the Sky are some of my favorite movies of all time. However, this one, I sadly have to say, it is the ONLY ghibli movie I have ever shut off halfway through due to boredom.I don't know what it is about recent Ghibli movie and their aversion to using magic, but it doesn't help their cause.Ghibli unfortunately is like every other studio. They are not infallible. They make mistakes.The biggest issue I found with this movie is that the main character is an annoying little whiner. Every problem she has in the movie is due to her being a whiner. (except for the asthma) She goes to the new place, and she's mopey. People try to make friends with her, and she's a jerk and mopey again. Then when the kids in town get annoyed at her for being a jerk, I think the movie is trying to get you to feel bad for her? But I can't. Every single time something bad happens it is entirely her fault. The first half of this movie was just a test of patience to see if you didn't punch this girl in the face. Then Marnie shows up but the problem is, you hate the other girl so much by that point you don't even care if she makes a friend. I sure didn't.Ghibli's music and animation are never brought into question. No matter how terrible their movie is the art and music are always breathtaking. That doesn't change. But the main character was so unlikable, there was a lack of overt use of magic or wonder, and I did not give a single care about the story this girl went through as every single problem created was of her own doing.I actually read the ending of the movie on wiki because I just felt like knowing how it ended but I didn't want to invest more than 30 seconds doing so. And I still don't care.I do not like some Ghibli movies. I know this may sound blasphemous, but I just can't get into some. However, on the flip side, some of them are breathtakingly amazing. But I have NEVER shut one off halfway through before. That is something amazing all in itself. Tales from Earthsea and from Up on Poppy Hill are BAD but I didn't shut them off halfway through. Because as bad as they were, at least they weren't BORING. And that is the greatest sin a ghibli movie could have. So it with a heavy heart that I have to give When Marnie was there, a 3, out of 10.",

So how does it hold up? Surprisingly well. You can definitely see that Yonebayashi is still learning the trade. This shows most clearly in that the film doesn't flow quite as smoothly as it should. Part of that is due to the original story, which has a lot of complex elements and transitions between dreams and reality, but some of that is definitely due to pacing problems.On the other hand, there's a lot of really good stuff showcased as well. The animation, for one, is very high quality, even for Studio Ghibli. All the characters move beautifully, the backgrounds are simply gorgeous and the use of colours and styles evokes the image of paintings, fittingly keeping with one of the themes of the movie. The film also has great mood and atmosphere. The storm sequence, near the end of the film, for example. Whenever thunder strikes, you will shiver in primordial fright.I also like the two main characters, Anna and Marnie, who are both bright, independent yet fragile young girls, and their friendship is the one carrying the story and the whole movie. Yonebayashi is very skilled in showing us their similarities, but most importantly their differences. All of their shared scenes are very good.Unfortunately, this brings us to the problems with the film. It is simply way too slow. The film makers were clearly going for mood and atmosphere building over a more event driven film experience. And they do that very well, but the fact still remains that you find yourself wondering when the actual story will begin. It is often a very delicate balance to juggle both the story and the needed space for character development and atmosphere, but in this case that tightrope act is more than a bit wobbly.Nevertheless, I definitely do think that this film is worth seeing for all fans of Studio Ghibli and animation in general. It looks great, has great characters and even though the pacing could have been better, it will still leave you with a soft smile on your face.",

You're born into a gorgeous middle- class family, have two loving guardians, have people who want to befriend you despite your empty and soulless personality. It must be terrible living in such a beautiful, hundred-acre house with a garden and surrounded by mountains, lakes and forests. Unbearable, I say. What's that, you immediately dislike a girl you didn't know other than the fact that she looks 'ugly and fat'? You insulted her as well, after an attempt to be your friend? Gosh, I can't imagine how miserable I would be if I were her. Then you meet a pretty rich blond girl and you instantly become friends? That's cool.First of all, can we really say Anna is a role model for girls? Doesn't she just inspire you with her boringness? She is constantly depressed and humourless, not to mention emotionless most of the time. This girl lives a sheltered, well-provided life and she's bitching about it because her foster parents are getting child benefits. She's never faced a single true hardship about life, not even her sickness.

It's really a fantastic ride we get to enjoy with this one. While the animation style seems to remain the same (simplistic some may call it), it has always been about the characters and the story. So while there have been advantages and new styles and what not, the Animes may still look the same, but they do feel fresh",

This movie is very good because the animations are astonishing, the music is very good and fit perfectly in the moment, the main characters feel true, and by that I mean they fit perfectly into their world, and the story is just perfect. BUT if you are going to watch this movie be prepared to feel like crap for 2 to 3 hours after watching it because it is not a light movie and you understand it in the first 30 minutes.Tl;Dr You must watch this movie at least once in your life but be prepared to feel like crap.",

            "review_title": "Mixed feelings, but a good film",
            "content": "I tend to watch everything produced by Ghibli because their movies are astounding: the glorious artistic animation, the magic lighting, the wonderful colors, the picturesque landscaping, the attention to the detail, the way they capture daily life no matter the stories happen in urban or rural settings. Besides, the people at Ghibli do spend as much time on drawing the movie as on creating the story and developing the characters. Their stories are always a mix of the mundane and the celestial, the worldly and the dreamy, the ordinary and the extraordinary in life, the matter of fact and the inexplicable. Ghibli's movies are always sentimental, emotional, dramatic and fun, all at once.When Marnie was There is no exception. The film is based on Joan G. Robinson's children eponymous book published in 1967. The story is really lovely, and goes in a full circle to explore the feelings of alienation, angst, lovelessness and loneliness of the main character, Anna, a tomboy girl who hates herself and her life and has bouts of asthma out of stress. Most of the story occurs in her relatives' country house, where Anna's auntie and foster mother sends her to see if she recovers her health and joy for life. There, in this remote and pristine area of Japan, in an abandoned house, she meets the almost-Disney girly girl blonde Marnie, who becomes her best friend and does the miracle of opening Anna's heart to love. Kids and teens who experience this sense of abandonment, loneliness and alienation, will certainly connect with Anna's struggle to be herself, to open up and overcome her fear of rejection, and to opening to love, romantic and non romantic. Adults will love the magic realism of the film, the inexplicable synchronicity that leads to the end, and the overall spicy sweetness of the story. My mixed feelings about the film rely on the apparently queer relationship of the two teens. This wouldn't be a problem if the story didn't end as it ends, or the story was one with explicit queer love. I haven't read the book, so I don't know whether the relationship was expressed the same in the novel or not, but it was a distraction for me. For young queers trying to find their identity and fit in the world, the film will be a thrill, but for those who aren't it will be mostly a what-is-this-doing-here? moment. If Ghibli wanted to explore that part, great, no problem, but if that is the case I expect the story to be open about it, clearer about it, the characters to be related differently and the movie to end differently. I think part of the problem with the lack of success of the film it is just the apparent lack of inner congruency.I felt that Sayaka was a wonderful character to explore, but we barely get to know her. The same can be said about Anna's hosts the Oiwa, who are truly a funny interesting couple, and of the character of Marnie's childhood friend and paintress Oisako. On the other hand, the story is mostly an exploration of Anna's character, and the film does so perfectly well.Overall, this is a beautiful movie to watch with many layers of meaning and interpretation. Not a movie for children unless under supervision, and more for young adults and adults.",

Robinson, this anime film from Japan's celebrated Studio Ghibli transposes the setting from Norfolk, England to modern Japan, and tells the story of lonely 12 year old Anna who is sent to live with relatives in the country for the summer for the good of her health, after she suffers an asthma attack at school. She soon becomes fascinated by an old mansion nearby, and Marnie, the strange girl who lives there. This may well be the final Studio Ghibli film, and if so, while it may not be among the very best of Studio Ghibli, then this is still a fantastic note to go out on. This is a visually stunning film, with a heartfelt and affecting story about friendship and family. I would say that it might be disturbing for very young kids, because it is very dark in places. For anyone though, this is a beautiful, heartwarming film, that is sure to bring some tears by the end.I just hope that this is not the end for Ghibli.",

I'm not sure it's one of the studio's best films, seeing as how I haven't seen many from them, but it's definitely very much a worthy entry into their cannon.

If you want to watch this film, you must get out the tissues. because it is a wreching movie.\"When Marnie was there\" is the last film from the Studio Ghibli that directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi and addapted from Joan G. Robbinson's book. it decidely British ghost story, a withdrawn teen girl, a mysterious blonde girl who may or not actually exist.The film is about a girl named 'Anna' who is clinically depressed. she said \"I hate my self\", so she hopes that she was dead. and she said \"there are some people who fit in the circle and there are some that are outside\". This is kind of deppression. she is an orphan who is being rase by a foster mother. that makes she can't get along with other kids at school, and she got breathless. therefore, her foster mother was so worried her, and decide to sent anna to a village to help her asthma and get her emotions back from this dark place. Anna's hobby is sketching. Finally, in the village she found a teenage girl like her. her name is Marnie. she has long blonde hair, blue eyes and seems like almost a ghost on the lake. Actually, when i see marnie i think she is a ghost but not. I think she like a shadow.In here, you can see how beautiful friendship is. Friendship and knowledge is what gives us hope and makes Anna realizes that she want to love herself and be brand new. This animation is so gorgeous in the countryside. i'm very appreciate ghibli's creature. this is the best.The best also is the soundtrack !. The sound is excellent. so pure like real life. I can feel the sound of nature in the countryside, moreover the sound of rain, thunder, wind, and water are so authentic. I feel like i was there. and the soundtrack is so calm, nice and very suitable for this film. the song is Fine on the outside by Priscilla Ahn. this is one of my favorite songs too.The mystery surprised me at the ending this film. it overwhelmed me. because the story, animation, and sounds are stunning.Like the previous Studio Ghibli's movie are 'Spirited Away' that the best than this film. Although, 'When Marnie Was There isn't up to the incredibly high standard of the best Ghibli films. it still beautiful and sweets. i like it.The last creature by Studio Ghibli is great and makes us remembered always. 'When Marnie Was There' is truly a Studio Ghibli classic guranteed to warm your heart.thank you.",

It's a really good movie.All of the characters, even the minor ones, were so well defined and likeable. Anne was great, Marnie was great, Anne's Caretakers were great, the little girl in Marnie's old home was great, and that painter lady was great. Even though I don't remember their names right now, I still know that they were great.The plot, while confusing at times, was super interesting and incredibly emotionally investing. And it all came to such an amazingly powerful and satisfying conclusion. And there was a really cool plot twist in there as well. I wouldn't have seen it coming if it wasn't already spoiled for me. It was still really cool to watch though.It goes without saying that the animation was great. I loved the music as well. The end credits song \"Fine of the Outside\" is going to become one of my favourites. I can already tell.I also have very few problems with the dub. Everyone does a pretty good job. It's not perfect, but I'd say it's probably better than most of the other anime I've seen. Any moments that felt off were very brief and never godawful.But what really sells this movie is the relationship between Marnie & Anne. It's just really nice. Very cute.There's really nothing more to say except restating that I loved it.",

I decided to watch this after Earwig because I wanted to save the best for last, and holy cow was I right. This is probably the best Studio Ghibli movie that I have watched.Throughout the movie, the audiences were in a mystery drama where the main girl, Anna, who was introverted and depressed, spent time with Marnie, a mysterious friend from a mysterious house. I loved this mystery because it kept me invested and wanted to figure out the twist.The friendship between the two main girls were beautiful. They slowly learned about each other, and became dependent of each other. This friendship was elevated due to the gorgeous hand-drawn animation. The sceneries were breathtaking and hypnotizing.And when the twist hit, this movie became one of the most heartbreaking and emotional plots I have ever watched. I was on the brink of just letting all the tears out. When I figured out what was happening, I felt like sinking and in awe at how impactful and beautiful the storytelling was. The last shot was both beautiful and made me even more sad.Overall, a simple story with less fantastical elements than a typical Ghibli movie, but its effective storytelling and heart-wrenching revelation made for the only Studio Ghibli movie that made me cry. It's mature, but can be very helpful to young kids who are going similar times as the characters. This movie will stay with me for awhile. 10/10.",

            "content": "\"When Marnie Was There\" has the unenviable task of representing Studio Ghibli's first production without the involvement of either Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata. These two men, Miyazaki in particular, are synonymous with Studio Ghibli, which left \"When Marnie Was There\" needing to reassure movie-goers that the company would continue in the fine traditions of its founders.The result is promising with slight reservations. There's a lot to like here. The main character, Anna, is a complex central piece to a fairly complex story. She is emotionally distant from those around her, owing to the early loss of her parents and the loss of familial connection this brings her. This makes her genuinely unpleasant to some of the people who try to reach out to her, an ambitious choice by the writers for a character that we need to connect to in order to care about the film. I found that this really worked, and provided an intriguing and sometimes unpredictable character to focus our attention on.The story that unfolds around Anna, involving her fascination with an abandoned house and its former occupants, is beautifully presented to us but with few scenes that really dazzle dramatically. A gripe that I had with the film was that some slowly simmering plot points, such as the sinister grain silo, didn't really deliver on their early promise, and overall the film ties off a lot of plot points fairly rapidly which left me feeling slightly dissatisfied. Overally I was left suspecting that there were probably a lot of plot holes that wouldn't take a lot of poking to reveal, if one spent the time.This wouldn't matter to me too much if the film's emotional core was solid and it is, again, for the most part. As is fairly typical of a Ghibli film, my eyes did well up a few times during the movie and some of this was certainly due to the emotional connections that were developed throughout. However, I couldn't escape a nagging feeling that at times the film used some fairly cheap tricks to elicit these reactions from me, including the swells of a very unsubtle score and the buckets of tears produced by the on screen characters.The film's key strength is in visuals and accompanying sound as it is a delight to experience. Director Hiromasa Yonebayashi and his animation staff deserve enormous credit for conveying the sensations of the main character with such tactile clarity. When Anna crosses the bay to the abandoned mansion for the first time in the low tide, the animation and sound combine to such an effect that I could practically feel the cold water around my ankles and the uncertain contours of the bottom underfoot. These are the moments that really carry the film and display the talent still on offer at this illustrious animation studio.",

About a young girl Anna, who's socially an outsider, being an orphan and is sent to the country to rediscover herself. There, she makes new friends and one in particular is Marnie, the girl who lives in the supposedly derelict Marsh House. There's an instant bond but a haunting feeling behind it all. It's all a mystery and even though you think you might have guessed it, all is not what it seems. As expected, the animation is glorious with parallax scrolling and beautiful sceneries. However there's no wondrous weird characters that normally populate Studio Ghibli films. But there's still the lovable characters in human form such as the Oiwa's and Sayaka. Takatsugu Muramatsu composes the score but is sadly not quite the enchanting Joe Hisaishi some of us might expect but nevertheless it suits the film and sets the scenes nicely. There has been speculation that this might be the Studio's final film after the famed Hayao Miyazaki departure, retiring. There is a planned prolonged break while the studio decides what to do but there is nothing final about it closing down. This is a fine example of the animated features the studio can produce, an enchanting mystery that's emotional and heart-warming. A great film for all to watch, especially the kids but some might find it long, a little slow and doesn't have the usual magic Ghibli films have.

            "content": "This is a beautiful story, but the way in which it is delivered is slightly confusing at times...The story starts with a girl (Anna) who is riddled with insecurity and self doubt, struggles with her emotions and has bad asthma. Her guardian sends her away one summer to live with some of her relatives in a quieter seaside town... At this stage the story is all about Anna coming to terms with who she is, and is quite similar to a lot of teenage \"coming of age\" stories.Then the story shifts gears and Anna befriends a girl called Marnie, who lives in a seemingly abandoned house across the water / marshes. It is here that the story lacks a bit of consistency and becomes a little less compelling, if not more intriguing. Marnie may not be quite what she seems, and through her Anna may find answers to the questions which plague her and fuel her self doubt / emotional pain.The story here just feels a bit lightweight and thin, when it should really be heavier and more emotionally heavy hitting, drawing you in. There are moments which succeed, but some of the dialogue is a little flimsy and cliched, and Marnie's character is a little too one dimensional.The animation is Ghibli at its absolute best, there is genuinely no film with better animation in their back catalogue than this, and the soundtrack is very pretty.A really lovely film with a great story, it's just a shame they didn't give the story more of the power that it deserved.",

The character development is a bit strange and the plot is not always predictable but also not interesting.",

            "content": "Problems I have with this movie:\nIn the beginning of the movie, it was mentioned that Anna had asthma. It was partly the reason that she was sent away to her aunt and uncle for the summer. Her mother sent her there in hopes that she will get better and that she will find happiness. However, nothing related to her sickness was ever showed during her entire stay there.It was obvious that Anna was struggling with depression. She had also been causing a lot of problem for her aunt and uncle. She was always home late, found multiple times unconscious on the streets, she even insulted someone who was just trying to be nice. In results of that, her aunt and uncle were the ones to get blamed for not keeping an eye on her properly. However, the both of them never confronted her about it. They also never asked her if everything was okay. Maybe they didn't want her to feel uncomfortable, but it's as if they don't care what she does. Someone even said that she pointed her child with a knife (which was untrue), but they let that slide too.SPOILER ALERT! Later, we find out that Marnie was actually Anna's dead grandmother. However, their relationship before that discovery was more like lovers instead of friendship or family love. There were multiple times that Anna was seen jealous of Kazuhiko, her GRANDFATHER. I get that she didn't know that at the time, but it's still weird. Anna had also tried to get Marnie in her room, implying that she want something more than friendship (?) She was also seen multiple times blushing around Marnie and Marnie seems to be enjoying her reaction.Despite all of these, I think this movie portrays perfectly of how a depressed 12-year-old would act. She might appear ungrateful to most people because she has such a loving mother, yet she never appreciates her. She didn't even bother to write back to her mom when she was clearly worried about her. She had also been causing trouble to her aunt and uncle during her whole stay. On top of that, she was being mean to people who were just trying to be her friend. Yet, she was also so relatable. All she ever cares about is Marnie. Yet, she was also so relatable. I think at some point in life, everyone thinks that the world is against them. But she grew out of it. Marnie made her view the world from a different perspective.The artwork and soundtracks? As expected from Ghibli Studios! MESMERIZING!!",

When there was a mere hesitation about who Marnie was, it occurred to me that the director was actually trying to unveil the true self of hers.We're starting to fathom who she was for Anna after some particular details about their connection are disclosed. It is seen how Marnie was beloved by Anna and had only sweet and heart-warming memories about their past years. In fact, reflecting her past experience on the present ones turned out to have a favourable impact on her individuality. Namely, not only did she reminisced about their pastime with each other, but also cherished every single moment spent together.Frankly, this is a great piece of work for those who try not to socialise with others. Also, that anime would be rather enlightening for those who do not fully conceive the importance of family bonds or try to disregard them.",

The main draw to this movie was its emotional content, and by golly it delivered on it, i havent felt this much emotion in an anime movie since wolf children, i honestly cant decide if i like wolf children more than this movie right now (and believe me, thats saying something) it was somewhat sad in a way, but it was also uplifting and beautiful. I dont really want to spoil much but believe me, this movie will tug on the heartstrings in more ways than one\nabsolutely recommended, check this one out if you like anime, or even just emotional stories in general, because this one is fantastic.",

But, I knew there was more to her, and I knew that she was experiencing pain, trauma, unresolved childhood issues, that only she can experience... everyone you meet, everyone you walk past, they're all fighting their own battles and, and the way the artists told this Ana's story was really amazing, and heartfelt, it resolves in such a beautiful way.This film must viewed to the end to resolve.It's not spirited away, or any of the other cult classic ghibli's, and it's not trying to be, it's \"when marnie was there\" and it's amazing story if you give it a chance.",

I don't read the original story, but its sure a good story made by Joan G. Robinson. To transform a foreign story and mixed it with local culture, this is a good example of solving the race problem for audience to relate. Some other movie just adapt a story from foreign country and use local actors to replace their original name, even completely killing the character like we found in The last airbender and hopefully not for Ghost in shell. From now on, Marnie is a part of my life that i'll never forget, even though she's just a fictional character. Ghibli made this character so unforgettable with her strong character. His childhood is really sad, when we know even the maid bully her and she rarely met her parents. This made a link between her and audience, we really felt sorry for this girl and so sad even more when we have told the complete story, her old days are even sadder.",

The one thing you do get from the film is something that is very prominent in many Ghibli films and that is the convincing portrayal of the main character having to 'find themselves' to discover who they are, which is always a great message to put out there.For me personally it's not up there with the Studio's best with some of the tones a bit too twee for my liking and hey I'm not afraid of a bit of Ghibli whimsy but they've done it so much better in the likes of From Up on Poppy Hill (which I feel is greatly underrated) and The Wind Rises that embrace the personal drama, humor and whimsy in equal and affecting use, considering also some of the films themes this may explain away why there wasn't as much humor in the film.It has to be said Ghibli always make interesting films & even with this being not one of their best it still has plenty to offer & I could still see it connect with a young adolescent girl audience.I hope that this (given the rumors) is not their last film for a while as their films make the animation landscape such a more vibrant place to view interesting films.",

I think one main reason why people felt that way is because they had certain expectations even before playing the movie. That's why they watched the movie from a very different point of view. They only looked for clues to support their views and discarded all the others.Another reason may be that people don't have a good understanding of \"Love\". As it is often mistook by sexual desire. That is what happened in this case. People thought Anna and Marnie's action towards each other as sexual. From way I understood, it was not it.For Anna, she went to Marsh house as it felt familiar to her. Yes, it was weird that she talked and danced with a little known girl quickly. But as story unfolds it became apparent that Marnie knows Anna from before. At the ending, you should have realized why Marnie and her tune felt familiar to Anna. Also, why she kept coming back to Marnie.For Marnie, think of this way that she has given a small chance to come back to the world to talk to her granddaughter. But what would she do when Anna don't recognize her? Anna at this point, lost all trust to adults. So, she came as same aged as Anna. And she wanted to help cure Anna's problems without telling who she was and get forgiveness for her absence.Lastly, the type of bond Marnie and Anna showed is what you may have with your very close siblings, relative and best friends. You can also have such with your partner if you connect well. But, if sex is the only reason of your union with your partner that you will not have a lasting bond.",

In fact I surfaced from this film wondering if it may just be the most perfect Ghibli of all time. How on Earth can this have lost to Inside Out in the Academy Awards? It's just on another level. Sure it's less fun and cartoony and probably dull for kids to watch, but in terms of artistry, depth of plot, and sheer magic...well, comparing IO to WMWH is like comparing fart jokes to Shakespeare. Not since the first ten minutes of Up have I felt so emotionally drained from watching an animation. And in a good way: the ending doesn't leave you with tears caused by tragedy (Grave of the Fireflies springs to mind) but with those of pure, bittersweet joy. It's a movie that explores the true meaning of love so many ways; friendship, family, fostering and even same-sex relationships. It says more about the uncertain and fearful psyche of a lonely teenager than Inside Out ever could. It is Ghibli's perfect demonstration that one needs to look beyond the superficial, to forgive people for their insecurities and that if you truly care for someone then neither blood, gender or time can or should get in the way. 10/10",

            "content": "I think the secret to Ghibli films is to immerse yourself in the experience and just enjoy it. Don't get too cute. Visuals are a big part of it. Enjoy the views. Enjoy the sounds. Don't worry too much about the plot (were they lesbians?). If you do you get distracted instead of just experiencing what you're seeing and hearing and feeling, you miss the simple pleasure of letting yourself enjoy.Best example is Totoro - visuals to sounds to experiences - makes you feel good. Marnie is just as sensorially intense, but in a different way from Totoro - more an adolescent frame than a child frame - quite ingenious how they do it with hand-drawn animation.With Marnie that's exactly what you get - a film to be enjoyed as it is - rated 9/10 (Totoro's a 10).",

If you want to watch this film, you must get out the tissues. because it is a wreching movie.\"When Marnie was there\" is the last film from the Studio Ghibli.The film is about a girl named 'Anna' who is clinically depressed. she said \"I hate my self\", so she hopes that she was dead. and she said \"there are some people who fit in the circle and there are some that are outside\". This is kind of deppression. she ever got breathless. therefore, her mother was so worried her, and she sent her to a village to help her asthma and get her emotions back from this dark place.\nAnna's hobby is sketching. Finally, in the village she found a girl like her. her name is Marnie. she has long blonde hair, blue eyes and seems like almost a ghost on the lake. Actually, when i see marnie i think she is a ghost but not.In here, you can see how beautiful friendship is. Friendship and knowledge is what gives us hope and makes Anna realizes that she want to love herself and be brand new.\nThis animation is so gorgeous in the countryside. i'm very appreciate ghibli's creature. this is the best.The best also is the soundtrack !. The sound is excellent. so pure like real life. I can feel the sound of nature in the countryside, moreover the sound of rain, thunder, wind, and water are so authentic. I feel like i was there.\nand the soundtrack is so calm, nice and very suitable for this film. the song is Fine on the outside by Priscilla Ahn. this is one of my favorite songs too.The mystery surprised me at the ending this film.\nit overwhelmed me. because the story, animation, and sounds are stunning.The last creature by studio ghibli is great and makes us remembered always.\nthank you.",

For the first half of the movie I mostly loved it everything. I wanted more and more interactions between our protagonist and Marnie and I was certain at one point, given how Anna acted around Marnie and how certain scenes were, that Anna was having a crush on her. Given that, I was really taken aback by the plot twist that it was actually grandmother.From the scene with the tower that Marnie started breaking down I was kind of lost and struggled to really understand the events happpening but continued watching. By a certain point I felt as if the movie had already ended but somehow kept going. I felt like it was dragging quite a bit towards the end.Overall, it's a movie absolutely worth watching but I think it's one that kids wouldn't really enjoy as it does get kind of heavy for a movie of its kind so I'd suggest to watch later on.",

'When Marnie Was There' drags a little at times particularly in the first half an hour or so, which is somewhat aimless, and some of the supporting characters could have been much better fleshed out.\n\nThese flaws aside, 'When Marnie Was There' is still a real charmer, and ranks possibly around higher middle of Studio Ghibli's filmography. Its best assets have to be the animation and the music. The animation is simply wondrous, the colours are both atmospheric and ethereal, all the characters are appealingly drawn in distinctive Studio Ghibli fashion and the backgrounds are exquisitely detailed and gorgeously idyllic, was also really impressed by how Anna's facial expressions conveyed so much. The music is incredibly beautifully orchestrated and sears with emotion , nostalgia and atmosphere, often appropriately gentle and sometimes melancholic. \"Fire on the Outside\" is genuinely moving as well, not mawkish or over-sentimental at all.\n\nScripting warms the heart and moves the soul, the lack of humour not being an issue at all, and actually considering the story it would have felt very misplaced if it was included. The story, centring around Marnie and Anna's friendship, is haunting, heart-warming and often incredibly poignant with the right amount of mystery, the central friendship being charmingly and sometimes heart-wrenchingly portrayed. The message is a strong one, and gives the film an uplifting quality, if one is wondering how the message is written here it does succeed in not preaching too much.\n\nMarnie and Anna are likable, well-written characters , while the voice actors fill their roles sensitively.\n\nAll in all, not one of Studio Ghibli's finest but still a charmer. The DVD bought from Amazon was pricey, but at the end of the day it didn't feel like a waste of money. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

Ghibli's legendary hand drawn animation looks gorgeous, especially for all the splashes of water and glowing moonlight. The slick modern style mixed with Ghibli's heartfelt colors and lively motion look resplendent. When Marnie Was There is certainly one of their best looking features. Hiromasa Yonebayashi directs When Marnie Was There with sincere sympathy for his young heroine just trying to find herself and a friend. I thought he did a wonderful job following up Ghibli's then retired animation director god Hayao Miyazaki. When Marnie Was There is deeply touching character arcs, endearing charm, and thoughtful representation of the shy.\n\nJoan G. Robinson's original novel When Marnie Was There is a brilliant mystery book with a fantastic twist ending and a series of cleverly hidden clues, so it's no surprise that Ghibli bring the book to life with an earnest appreciation of mystery and intrigue that holds you in suspense.  Hiromasa Yonebayashi, Masashi Ando, and Keiko Niwa's writing for When Marnie Was There perfectly blends realistic dialogue and behavior of preteen girls with thoughtful reflections on friendship. When Marnie Was There asks us to be brave and make friends, enjoy parties, appreciate the rain, and live life to the fullest with no fear. All the simple pleasures of life are on full display in When Marnie Was There and Yonebayashi's innovative direction keeps you captivated by Robinson's narrative and Ghibli's cute animation.\n\nRie Matsuhara's gentle editing only cuts from scene to scene with a relaxed pace for a brisk 104 that never wears on you. Everything keeps moving along plot wise, but you get to enjoy the fun friendship between Anna and Marnie immediately, alongside Anna's journey into confidence. Atsushi Okui's cinematography is beautiful with wide shots of forests, swamps, moonlight, and mansions. He gives equal grace to water reflections and rowboats with his intimate close-up shots. I love how he frames the girls' faces throughout When Marnie Was There.\n\nYohei Taneda's production design has this realistic groundedness for the average homes and gorgeous lavish furnishings for Marnie's mansion. Yohei Taneda also did the art direction with a nice focus on the window light and moonlight appearing to make Marnie shine. Takeshi Imamura, Masashi Ando, and Akihiko Yamashita's visual effects are cool for characters fading in and out of light sources, the camera frame hazing for a dream sequence, and cute sudden splashes of water.\n\nTakatsugu Muramatsu's score for When Marnie Was There is affectionate and alive with a symphonic splendor that fits Studio Ghibli's animated bliss. Muramatsu uses the emotionally harrowing moments as music cues for heartfelt strings and tranquil piano melodies all throughout When Marnie Was There's endearing score.\n\nI adore the English Dub's voice cast for When Marnie Was There. Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic as the lead Anna. She's genuine, awkward, endearing, frightened, shy, and confident all in one profoundly relatable role. Steinfeld's soft voice captures Anna's wallflower personality as well as her important desire for friendship with her voice full of longing. I love Kiernan Shipka's chipper and likable voice for Marnie. She breathes life into Marnie with her sublime voice acting and immediately loving voice. Shipka is a talented voice actress for sure. She makes the difference in making you believe that this girl is friendly and fun.\n\nGeena Davis is quite nice to hear as Anna's worried adopted mother. John C. Reilly is fun and kindly as Anna's nice carpenter uncle who takes her in for the Summer. Ellen Burstyn cameos as Marnie's mean nanny. You can hear Vanessa Williams' voice full of fondness as Hisako. Kathy Bates and Catherine O'Hara also have cameos. Lastly, Grey DeLisle is great as Anna's sweet Aunt who is nice to her for the Summer.\n\nIn the end, I think When Marnie Was There boasts riveting storytelling from director Hiromasa Yonebayashi. It's simply a lovely film that engaged me in the innocence of childhood and the scary fears of growing up.",

In her mind, she has ever reason to believe this is true - she was abandoned when her parents died, and has just found out that her adoptive mother gets subsidies to care for her. The movie then brings you on a journey with her to show her that she really is loved.\n\nHow? Spoilers: Her grandmother, Marnie, loved her and the entire movie is putting her into the love story between her grandmother and grandfather. I know some people see this as incestuous but it's not...It's just Freudian. I view it as her grandmother's love coming through to her.\n\nOn top of that, Anna is clearly gay. I remember watching this film the first time thinking it was subtext. On a rewatch, I was wrong. It's not subtext. It's supertext. It's so very clear that Anna is gay. Between her love interest relationship with Marnie and the fact that she feels so ostracized to the story taking place during Japanese Valentine's Day (Tanabata), which is based on two lovers separated by a river.\n\nAnyway, this film is a masterpiece. A masterwork in how to tell a story simply, beautifully, and profoundly.",

I found myself tuning out very quickly. I was looking for a reason to get into it but it never grabbed me.\n\nCharacters: 8\nYou immediately sympathize with Anna. She's an introvert with seemingly no place in the world. To make matters worse, she's prone to panic attacks. From the very beginning, she's a character you wish you could reach out to and protect. Learning her history and the source of her pain is the best part of the film. There were a few other characters that were memorable as well, but none so much as Anna.\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 10\nAnother strong suit of the film. Animations were crisp with strong attention to detail. One scene inside of an abandoned silo particularly stands out. The blend of darkness and destructive winds really place you in the moment and breathe life into a film that was otherwise dull.\n\nConflict: 4\n\nGenre: 8\nThe film isn't a favorite by any means and won't hold up against some of my other animated classics that I love. HOWEVER, I appreciate the animation style of the film and I also respected that it attempted to try something different. Even though it was a total miss, I give it the proper credit for daring to be different and take a chance. \n\nMemorability: 6\n\nPace: 1\nThe word \"snail\" comes to mind here. A huge mistake was made here in merely focusing on the day-to-day of Anna. There wasn't a lot of conflict that dictated the pace. I was waiting for something to happen, ANYTHING. Before I knew it, I was begging for it to be over. As the story progresses there is no real momentum building that can give you a reason to keep your attention solely on the film.\n\nPlot: 0\nUnique or not, I had a hard time buying it in its entirety. Had this been a real situation, Anna probably would have been put in a nut house 10 minutes into the film. She was given an awful lot of freedom for someone known to not be adjusted to the world. That didn't make sense to me, neither did the fact that Anna couldn't somehow piece the whole situation together a little bit faster. Maybe the whole idea was that she couldn't piece things together because she didn't want to? I don't know. What I do know is that sometimes even the best intentions can yield some bad results. Perfect example.\n\nResolution: 10\nBest part of the film and, no, I'm not being sarcastic. You essentially find out the mystery behind everything going on and I have to say it's a really nice payoff. Extremely touching, it makes the film 100 times better than what it could have been. I won't give anything away but it resolves around finding your place in life and appreciating who you are. While I loved it, it infuriated me at the same time. WHY COULDN'T THE REST OF THE FILM BE LIKE THIS???\n\nOverall: 57\nI have seen a number of films that get off to a great start and fizzle out at the end. When Marnie Was There does the opposite and the feeling it leaves you with ends up being far worse. Had the rest of the film hit home like the ending, this would have been a wonderful classic.",

            "content": "Following one year after the retirement of legendary anime film director Hayao Miyazaki, Studio Ghibli's rising director Hiromasa Yonebayashi (\"The Secret World of Arrietty\"), is still going strong with the last film the studio would make before going on hiatus, \"When Marnie Was There\". Fans of Ghibli and those not familiar with Japanese animation can enjoy this movie alike.\nAdapted from Joan G. Robinson's 1967 novel, it tells the tale of Anna Sasaki, an orphaned, 12-year-old girl who feels estranged from her kind foster mother and keeps her at arm's length. After a particularly bad asthma attack, Anna is sent to live with warm-hearted relatives for the summer as a form of therapy. \nAnna's character may come across at first as unlikeable to some, but as someone who can see my past adolescent self in her character, she's quite accurately written for a depressed, withdrawn, socially anxious pre-teen with low self esteem. Anna says hunched over after a spat with a local girl, \"I look like just what I am...ugly, stupid, moody, unpleasant. That's why I hate myself.\" These are almost the exact words many young people may have uttered to themselves.\nBut Anna doesn't spend the whole movie feeling sad, she starts to change when she meets Marnie, an outgoing girl living in a seemingly abandoned mansion across the marsh. The two instantly bond, but all is not as it appears. Encounters with the mysterious Marnie are dreamlike and transient, and as the story unravels, their relationship is further revealed to be something deeper than Anna could have anticipated. \nThe setting, which was originally England, has been shifted to rural sea-side Japan, and is drawn typical of many Ghibli movies. A warmth pervades the small town and detail is paid to every aspect of the painted backgrounds and designs of the countryside homes. The animation is as always exceptional, with grass looking wonderfully lush and water appearing as soft as silk. Marnie's golden hair and dangling earrings bouncing as she runs down the stairs, or the many birds shown in the marsh lands are just some of the many details that make watching Ghibli's animation a treat for the eyes. \nIt's something that many dubbed films struggle with, the English voice cast is unfortunately mediocre. Hailee Steinfeld as Anna sounds appropriate for the reserved young girl, but Kiernan Shipka as Marnie sounds too similar to Anna. There were times it wasn't immediately discernible who was speaking when the two were on screen together. Both characters suffer from stiff, controlled voice acting, although it works better for Anna due to the nature of her character. Other cast members perform their roles well however, and no one was terrible.\nAs other Ghibli films that take place in less fantastical worlds tend to be, this is not a movie packed with action, but a patient one that focuses on emotional exploration. However that isn't to say this film isn't filled with imagination.Yonebayashi spins a tender, well-executed story of adolescent despondency, self-discovery, friendship, family, and love with a hint of melancholy.",

It's a little weird, as the film and the dialogue are Japanese, but several of the characters have  Western European featues . maybe there's a message here abut connection that is also pan-racial.\nIt starts with socially awkward Anna expressing the thought -\n\"In this world, \"there's an invisible magic circle. There's inside, and outside. And I'm outside.\"\nThe film tells the story of Anna's troubled journey through self -hating and loneliness to loving  connection and friendship, and it does so in a mature and unsentimental way that had a lot of the audience (of adults) in tears at the end-  a lot of us know how it feels to be \"on the outside\" and the film deals carefully and honestly with the subject  - Anna makes the situation worse for herself many times through the ideas she fosters about herself, but the ideas stem from real and troubled incidents in the past that she had no influence over-  Anna is open to change, but needs help from people's lovingkindness and acceptance as she is - rather than reaction and condemnation - she finds this when she is sent to stay with relatives in the country  and also  through connection with the  natural world, the past, and simpler pleasures such as boating, sketching, and playing.\nThere's a message here that is probably timeless - the film takes us back to a previous age, but it's as relevant today as ever\n\nA charming and mature film, beautifully executed",

The film is refreshingly beautiful and soft to the eye. \n\nBased on Joan G. Robinson's modern essential classic novel of the same name. The story is moved from Norfolk, England to the Countryside of Japan without losing the core of the storyline. About a young girl Anna, who's socially an outsider, being an orphan and is sent to the country to rediscover herself. \n\nThere, she makes new friends and one in particular is Marnie, the girl who lives in the supposedly derelict Marsh House. There's an instant bond but a haunting feeling behind it all. It's all a mystery and even though you think you might have guessed it, all is not what it seems. \n\nAs expected, the animation is glorious with parallax scrolling and beautiful sceneries. However there's no wondrous weird characters that normally populate Studio Ghibli films. But there's still the loveable characters in human form such as  the Oiwa's and Sayaka.  \n\nTakatsugu Muramatsu composes the score but is sadly not quite the enchanting Joe Hisaishi some of us might expect but nevertheless it suits the film and sets the scenes nicely. \n\nThere has been speculation that this might be the Studio's final film after the famed Hayao Miyazaki departure, retiring. There is a planned prolonged break while the studio decides what to do but there is nothing final about it closing down. \n\nThis is a fine example of the animated features the studio can produce, an enchanting mystery that's emotional and heart-warming. A great film for all to watch, especially the kids but some might find it long, a little slow and doesn't have the usual magic Ghibli films have.  \n\nRunning Time: 7\nThe Cast: 8\nPerformance: 7\nDirection: 9\nStory: 8\nScript: 8\nCreativity: 7\nSoundtrack: 7\nJob Description: 5\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 0\n\n66% 7/10\n\nTwitter: SpoilerAlertRV",

Following an introverted girl, outcast by her peers at school and being diagnosed with asthma, Anna is sent away to a relatives house in the country. Filled with trees, water, and an environment that she will feel at home in, we begin to see more of the inner-Anna as the film progresses. At the films core, it is about a young orphan girl, who is looking to find herself. She comes across a young girl named Marnie and their friendship blossoms quickly and fiercely, leading to plot twists that will have you in tears. \n\nThis film is truly magnificent for everything it sets itself up for, and the payoff is emotionally satisfying in every way. This studio always knows how to write a compelling story and execute it in such a beautiful way. As always, the animation is crafted to perfection and each element has meaning. Of all the films I have had the pleasure of seeing in 2015, this is definitely one of my favourites. I truly do not have any complaints about this picture. Any questions or concerns you may have throughout the duration of this film, will be answered by the time the credits role, and if you end up enjoying this film as much as myself, you will not want that to happen. I wanted this film to keep going and going. \"When Marnie Was There\" is one of my favourite films from Studio Ghibli and one of the best films of 2015.",

It's more magical-realism than outright magic like a lot of their works, but it's nice to have a simpler film.  The main character Anna is really an interesting lead.  She's a loner, she's depressed, and she's a bit of a jerk.  She's really not your typical leading lady, but I think a lot of people will be able to relate to her.  From her opening monologue which ends in \"I hate myself\", I was invested in her character.  Her friendship with the mysterious Marnie is very charming and the heart of the whole film.  If I had one complaint it's that their friendship can feel a little awkwardly romantic at times, but I think that might just be a cultural thing in how we express our emotions.\nThe film is also just plain gorgeous.  It's from the director who did The Secret World of Arietty, and while I love that film it was clear it was from a first time director.  Here he's mastered his craft, and shown how subtle and gorgeous he can make things.  You could take any frame of this movie and hang it in your living room as a portrait, it just looks that good.\nWhen Marnie Was There is a gorgeous and emotional journey.  As secrets are unraveled, the film leads to a climax that left me speechless.  It's an almost heartbreaking film that still has a sense of wonder and hope.  Simply put, it's just a great film.  If this is Ghibli's last, at least they had a helluva swan song.",

            "content": "The last Ghibli film. \nThis in itself gives the film melancholy undertones. Beautifully animated and directed, the film aches with sadness and tenderness. Whether or not director Hiromasa Yonebayashi knew this was to be the studio's swan song does not matter; the film feels definitive and lasting, a goodbye-of-sorts to something dear. For this reason, \"Marnie\" is something extra special. Yonebayashi should be proud, and he may be the most talented rising anime director whose last name isn't Hosoda.\n\nCalm and tranquil, \"Marnie\" plays out like a stroll through the park. It is never in a big hurry to get anywhere. Its splendid moody visual imagery incorporates natural elements; my favorite sequence is the rising tide preventing our protagonist Anna from escaping the old house Marnie lives(d?). It is very reminiscent of the rising river appearing in \"Spirited Away.\" \n\nThe main protagonist, tomboyish Anna, is a troubled child plagued by not only asthma attacks, but depressed, knowing her foster parents were accepting money from the government to keep her. For this reason she feels like a useless commodity for most of the film. Until she meets Marnie, that is. This character interplay is very reminiscent to Sean from \"Arrietty,\" who also moved to the countryside to recuperate (and found a peculiar friend in the process.) \n\nMarnie being a living memory was not so much a shocker because I was already familiar with Joan G. Robinson's children's novel. However, what initially confused me was Marnie's sudden (and unrelenting) emotional attachment to Anna. While the third act explains everything, the first half of the film gave strong vibes that Anna and Marnie were lesbians. This isn't a bad thing, as such a twist would have been bold would have vaulted this film to the top of the Ghibli roster. But alas, filmmakers decided to play the safer route, which was still charming and unexpected in its own way. \n\nThe music score thunders with emotions, and this is the best soundtrack to a Ghibli film since Yonebayashi's previous \"Arrietty.\" The only real issue I had with the film is the character design, which is often bland, apart from the title character of Marnie, the first and only blonde protagonist in a Ghibli film. The film is not perfect, but it worked in all the ways a Studio Ghibli film is supposed to work. It certain did not let me down, unlike a couple recent efforts like \"From Up On Poppy Hill\" and \"The Wind Rises.\" While the two aforementioned films were sold as \"big\" films that felt small in minuscule, \"When Marnie Was There\" was sold as a \"small\" film but it roared with emotion and felt \"huge.\" The only other time I felt this way was when I first watched \"Whisper of the Heart,\" one of the studio's most awesome efforts. \nFarewell Studio Ghibli. At this point in time, it is hard to say for certain if they will ever return to feature films, but just in case they do not, \"When Marnie Was There\" is a fine period at the end of their sentence, the end of a majestic era...",

            "content": "One of the many pleasures you have when you watch a Studio Ghibli film is its colorful animation and When Marnie Was There is yet another perfect example of that.  More impressively, the story the film tells is just as filled with colorful themes and plot points that you just wouldn't get from a Disney or Dreamworks animated film.  When Marnie Was There doesn't pull any punches, but more importantly, the punches they throw at the audience mean something and will have an emotionally resonating impact for all viewers, not just kids.  \n\nThe film tells the story of Anna, a young girl who spends the summer with her relatives close to open water, and finds a mysterious and seemingly abandoned mansion across the water.  After drawing numerous sketches of the mansion, she finds her way across using a row boat.  What follows after that is a legitimately mysterious plot that keeps the audience guessing at every turn.  Is Anna seeing things?  Is this all a dream?  Which characters are hiding what?  And so on.  For most of the film, that technique works very well.  But there are a few times when the secrets and potential reveals get a bit tiresome.\n\nWhen Marnie Was There is a story about plenty of things like regret, loss, and neglection.  But at the heart of the film is a story about friendship, and an unlikely one at that.  Obviously, there's plenty of things about the plot that you can't reveal without spoiling anything, but Anna and Marnie's bond throughout is truly something special.  It's a bond that is probably more satisfying when you watch it a second time and can appreciate it without having to keep your eyes pealed for the next secret to be let out.\n\nThe film is complemented by a beautiful score and a heart wrenching end credits song that is sure to get even the most stubborn of people to get teary eyed.  But it's also a different kind of sadness than say a Pixar or Disney film can give you (exceptions of course).  When Marnie Was There has a dream like quality to the entire story, but the devastating moments hit you like a ton of bricks.  Even in its most unrealistic instances, you feel the same sorrow and happiness that the characters do.\n\n+Score\n\n+Story has just the right amount of dark moments\n\n+Probably more depth than other animated flicks\n\n+Bond between Marnie and Anna\n\n-Mysteries perhaps get a bit tiresome\n\n8.7/10",

The look of the film is nice, and I enjoyed the mystery of it all, but something about the structure just doesn't engage me. One of the things that I find most difficult to deal with is the slow pacing of these films. They glory in the minutiae of repetitive and uninteresting things to an excessive degree. Also the culture doesn't translate all that well, so I find it hard to see why certain things are handled in such unusual ways. I must admit that the characters are interesting, though. I cared about Anna, and I was captivated enough to watch until they revealed what was going on with Marnie. The film is entirely built on this intrigue where we are left to decide if Marnie is a real person, a figment of Anna's imagination, a ghost, or something else. Because of this framework for the story you are almost forced to hang in there and see what is actually going on (whether they offer a satisfying answer, I'll let you decide.) One big struggle I had with this movie was character transitions seem to occur without reason. Certain characters undergo a complete transformation by the end of the film, and I don't understand what prompted this change. Again, it must be something about the story-telling in these Japanese films, or quirks of the Japanese culture that I don't comprehend. For those who are fans of Miyazaki films, based on my limited exposure, I bet you would also connect with When Marnie Was There. For people like me, who aren't enchanted by Anime, I think you can give it a pass.",

I actually think I might prefer this one slightly to both of their final films, and I hope Yonebayashi continues to direct after this. The story involves young Anna, a sickly, depressed girl from Sopporo who moves in with family friends in the country one summer. While exploring the area, she comes upon a beautiful, seemingly abandoned mansion. One night she finds it's not abandoned, but a young, blonde girl named Marnie lives there with her rich parents. They become quick friends, but each new meeting seems more dreamlike than the last. Anna begins question whether Marnie really exists. Like most Ghibli films, one of the highlights is the score, here by Takatsugu Muramatsu. The English language song that plays over the closing credits, \"Fine on the Outside\" by Priscilla Ahn, is tremendously moving. Truly wonderful.",

This made the announcement that the studio wasn't making any more feature films upsetting to me. This is the only studio that still creates hand-drawn animation and now they were no more. When they announced their last movie in the film festival, I knew I had to watch it and lucky enough, I was able to get tickets on time.\n\n\nBecause this was a movie that is part of the festival, the first release in the UK and it is shown on a Saturday, a day when families usually go out, I assumed that they would show the English version. I didn't know that because it is part of a film festival that supports worldwide cinema, they would show it in the origin. \n\nI got there a few minutes late but still, it was incredible. I love watching movies as part of a festival because at the end, everyone clapped. Even though we had to read the subtitles, everyone had a reaction at the same time. The movie was strange but at the end of the day, it was my strange. It's about a girl who just wants to feel loved by a family or friend and finds out that she had that all along, whilst discovering some history. \n\nThe animation style was spectacular as usual. I'm really going to miss it. I even found myself crying at some parts because it was emotional as a whole. There were surprisingly some scary scenes so I think you would have to be careful if you would like to bring young ones to see it. \n\nIn the end, I was glad that I got to watch it before January and it is a great end to a fantastic studio that will live on forever.",

This movie was great as it was based on a novel by Joan Robinson and Hideo Miyazaki chose it was one of 50 of his favorites children's book. What's great about this movie is the illustration and the internal family story of the house where Marnie lives. Anna was lost at first and when she moves in with her aunt and found the mysterious house and got curious. The yellow house is where the magic happens where she finds out more. It's a great movie and I don't think this movie will not be understandable for little kids but overall it's an interesting animation. I do recommend this movie for all Studio Ghibli fans. If you like Spirited Away, give this a try. I will give this movie a 4.5 out of 5 stars. The music is soothing and artwork design animation is fantastic.",

The tale is that of Anna, a girl with social anxiety and an upsetting past who is sent off to a rural town on the ocean to help ease her condition. There, she befriends Marnie, a mysterious and charming girl her age, who has secrets of her own. From there, we learn along with Anna who Marnie is. The narrative is what really makes this movie outstanding. Slow and methodical, it is told from the perspective of Anna. Coupled with her condition, this makes for an emotional and personal point of view that I found absolutely hypnotic although somewhat unrelatable. While the film does falls short of the magic and wonder of the other regularly mentioned Studio Ghibli pieces, it also makes no attempts to be such. It is also utterly heart rending to realize, at the end, that this is almost certainly the final Studio Ghibli film. This is also evident throughout as there are several nods to other studio masterpieces. Finally, this is a movie to watch with a loved one, but perhaps not the children. While it doesn't contain any mature or questionable moments, it does assume a slow pace and is ultimately focused on the complex relationship between Anna and Marnie. There is also some symbolism that may be lost on those less familiar with Japanese mythology. This movie is everything you would expect from Studio Ghibli. If that sentance has any meaning to you, then go and watch it.",

With the exception of Wind Rises, the movies\nwere overrated with simplistic Tale of Princess Kaguya (at the beginning,\nof course). I was pretty skeptical about this one. While it started off\nwith a great beginning, it got boring and annoying when Sayaka showed\nup. She is a forgettable character who was kind of mean, yet so nice,\nshe's clich\u00e9d.\n\nAnna bothered me for some reason, it was because of her boyish clothes\nbut it was also something else, I don't know. Maybe she's just a\nstereotypical pre-teen. Marnie was the standout character of all the\ncharacters, she was perky, friendly, and mysterious.\n\nAnna befriends Sayaka which drops the ball because a lot of movies have\ncharacters befriending the clich\u00e9d nice girl. The art and animation\nwere still amazing as usual, but I am very disappointed in Studio\nGhibli for ending up like Pixar. The movie of course got cloying as it\nwent on whether it's between Anna or Sayaka or Anna and Marnie. It also\nended in a sentimental way. Maybe if they brought Hayou Miyazaki back\nto directing, he would save the studio and bring it back its glory.\n\nAlso, I thought Sayaka's voice acting was a pretty bad job. The themes\njust didn't click with me, it was boring and sometimes not empathetic.\nStudio Ghibli tried too hard by throwing in creepy parts and an\nemotional ending to be like their other movies. The creepy parts did\nnot blend well and ruined the pacing of the film.",

            "content": "'Marnie' is the best closing chapter of Ghibli that I could've asked for. Going back to the roots of its best films - a young, female protagonist encountering another world and coming of age (and adapting a Western novel again, for good measure) - Ghibli makes it's most blubber-inducing film yet. It's brave in a way kids films rarely are, daring to depict darker and sadder aspects of childhood. Anna is deeply relatable as she deals with childhood depression, alienation, and loneliness. When she falls under the charismatic spell of a girl in similar straits, it's hard to tear your eyes from their mysterious, yet cathartic encounters. \n\nMany people have complained to me when a story or book is set somewhere else in its adaptation. And while it's true re-setting a story in order to make it more 'relatable' can erase key parts of its cultural aesthetic, I believe that the opposite can be true. Marnie is one such film, reworking the book's original English setting into a Japanese one, giving the story and characters wholly new dimensions and connections. Marnie and Anna's alienation is made even sharper by their foreign appearance in a country with so few immigrants. The undertones of xenophobia are not overt, but present enough to make Marnie's and Anna's struggles even more timely and compelling. It's a great change that serves the story well. \n\nOn the other hand, some points of the story seem to conflict with the second half. Without spoiling too much, I'll just say that there was some tension between Marnie and Anna that was somewhat confusing, and hard to ignore. I liked this tension, but considering the resolution, it does seem a bit odd. If you see the film, I'm sure you'll get what I'm talking about. \n\nAll in all, this is already one of my favourite Ghibli films, and the fact that it's the last I'll see for awhile made it even more blubber-riffic. \n\nTake a bow on a film well done, Ghibli. (But we all know your retirement can't last. )",

She is having trouble interacting with other kids (or adults) because she's very shy.\n\tSo when her asthma acts up, she is sent to visit relatives in the country in hopes that the quiet life and fresh air will alleviate her asthma.\n\tOnce there, she does a bit of drawing (actually she does a lot of drawing).  But she finds a very odd house nearby, and soon she meets up with a girl her age named Marnie.  They become instant friends and they start sharing secrets about what life is with their families.  \n\tIt seems that Marnie and Anna are different because Marnie is part of a wealthy family, and Anna isn't.  But after spending several hours together, they seem to have a lot in common.\n\tBut Marnie is very odd - she appears and vanishes in an instant, and everyone else isn't sure about who Marnie is.\n\nSCORING\nMain Characters\n\tI like these two as girls who just want to be friends - and I really like Anna as the girl who has to break free from her shyness.\n\tBut there are parts of Marnie that just ... doesn't interest me.  Her family, her house, her parties - just seem to be nothing more than filler.  SCORE: 7\n\nSupporting Cast\n\tThe rest of the cast doesn't add much to the mix - they're just a bunch of friendly neighbors/family members.  I know that Marnie and Anna are supposed to be the driving force of the movie, but there's really not much support here.  SCORE: 4\n\nPlot\n\tI had some fun watching Marnie and Anna become friends and do some playful activities around Marnie's house and on the river.  But the main conflict wasn't properly developed.  Instead of an amazing climatic scene, I get way too much exposition near the end of the film.  Some of the questions should've been answered sooner instead of forcing one character to answer all plot questions all at once.  SCORE: 3\n\nOriginality\n\tFilms about friendship between girls aren't all that original, but these two have a spark that puts a nice twist.  But just like some other films for girls - this one spends a bit too much time with the girls having fun instead of pushing a plot.  SCORE: 5\n\nViolence Factor\n\tThere's nothing really violent going on here (except for a woman getting locked in a room and girls huddling in a building to stay out of a nasty storm.)  SCORE: 8\n\nOther Moral Issues\n\tThis film does a great job on how girls can forge friendships, but the movie hides the problems the girls have to deal with for a bit too long.  Sometime you have to speak up to someone if something's wrong.  SCORE: 6\n\nFinal Score ( out of 60): 33\t\t\t\t% Score: 55%\nThis film has a pair of great girls, but the story just drags on too long - and the conflict not fully developed (thus a need for a long, boring speech near the end of the film.)",

I love that this is a movie for kids but it doesn't talk down to kids and is quite an emotional story about finding where one fits in and what makes a family.  I was fine until the last ten minutes of the film when I wished I brought tissues.  It's almost unfair to nitpick this one thing, though.  This movies tries a little too hard to be mysterious.  Most questions are answered at the end but you had to go with parts of the film that felt disjointed and trust that the souffle would rise, so to speak.  I'm still unsure how Anna's blackouts played into this because they seemed to happen whenever Marnie arrived or left.  That's minor, though.  I may go back and watch it again in case that was explained and I missed it through my tears.  8^)",

            "content": "From the director Hiromasa Yonebayashi of 'The Secret World of Arriety' fame. Based on the 1967 English novel of the same name and so the important characters borrowed the western names. This is what I call a fine adaptation, great transformation from the words to the motion picture. Actually, it suited for the narration from the standpoint of Japanese culture and lifestyle, especially for this anime version with the beautiful fictional coastal landscapes. Whenever I remember this film in the future, that Marsh house would be the first thing to pop out in my mind, an unforgettable landmark for sure.\n\nThe movie promos were damp. The posters were not that impressive, but okay and the trailer was very ordinary. Studio Ghibli was the reason to go for it, so I expected nothing spectacular from the movie. Even while I was watching, I thought it was just an enjoyable mystery flick, but you know sometime the value of the whole movie comes at the end twist. Once the end was near my stance changed, especially after the hidden truth revelation. Some movies need a re-watch to terminate any doubts regarding characters and scenes. As for this movie, if your focus is straight, then it's does not require.\n\nNot a technical brilliance like the director's previous movie, but the story was strong and twisty. The characters were very interesting, suspense was the movie's influence for the audience to stick till the end. There is no loose end, certainly gives a few topics to discuss about, but the narration moves on a circular track and hits back like the boomerang. That does not mean it is a time travel or something. The narration bends and blends with the time. To realise what is real and what is not, you have to wait till the end. After seeing the film, I understood everyone's childhood memories could monopolize if we encounter same object, place, person and other things again in the later life. Yes, I had few minor experience in my life as well.\n\nThe opening dialogue itself a hint of what kind of movie it is going to be. There are two prominent girls, Anna and Marnie in the story, like the Anna and Elsa from 'Frozen'. The narration flips on a regular basis to tell the multiple layered story. As this film was a puzzle in portrayal, obviously viewers try to solve it, including me. I tried my best. I thought Anna's childhood toy was something to do with all the fuss, but I was terribly wrong. That was a perfect divert if you observe it closely. In another perspective, I kept 'The Others' and 'The Orphanage' in mind, but was not even close to where this story was heading. Whether you succeed or not, very fun to solve a mystery, you know. Finally, it gave me full satisfaction like that indirectly I saw 'The Uninvited' once again.\n\nFeels like the Oscars was concluded yesterday, but I am already thinking about the next one. If I am not wrong this movie is definitely one of the contenders for the best animation race, along with 'The Good Dinosaur' probably. Absolutely, I would be disappointed if I don't see it in the final five. There is lots of time between now and then, so anything might happen, who knows. After all, this film has already won my little heart and millions of other's. I know no one can replace Mr. Miyazaki, but feels like Hiromasa Yonebayashi could come near if his future projects as much effective as his one. Best of luck to him and he's only a 41. But remember Isao Takahat is 80 and still in the race, yet to announce his retirement. And this film was very close to his 'Only Yesterday'.\n\nI love you more than any girl I've ever known.\n\nStudio Ghibli is like Disney Studio from the east. As we know, narrating a fairy tale having the tween girls in the lead is what they're famous for. The previous couple of movies were out of their trademark, so, happy they are back with this masterwork. At a same time I am very very very very sad, because it's their final movie after the 30 years of triumph. Since Hayao Miyazaki's retirement everything falling apart from the studio's management. They've given reasons and it is only a temporary, though hope the rise of 3D animation is not the one to halt the production, praying for the pause to be lifted soon.\n\nThis film is not just passing through from this giant anime production house, but it is a masterpiece. As usual, it is a girly movie and that does not stop grownups, especially men from a watch. I loved it, everytime when I like a movie I express my desire for a sequel and so I did for this film. Though it was one time story with nothing left over for further development, possibly some new thing can be attached to it. Whatever happens this movie will remain as one of the best from the studio and can compete with any modern animations and live-shot masterworks. Highly recommended, not just for anime or animation fans, but for mystery and who love the layers in story narration.\n\n9/10",

You're certain that something more will come of this. But nothing does. Later there is a scary interlude that resembles a Gothic tale involving an old abandoned silo that terrifies Marnie. More suggestions of something grander than what is actually presented. The denouement ultimately ignores all of these plot threads and settles into a resolution that doesn't effectively address the issues with which this poor kid is struggling. She was really messed up and the reveal is totally disconnected from what this girl had been feeling. Sill, the picture is too visually hypnotic to ignore.

However, other details, like background characters, little crabs moving in the water, and tiny little things like that more than make up for it. Definitely worth checking out.",

The story was very emotional roller coaster, and I was amazed and interested the whole way through. \nHiromasa Yonebayashi did a very good job. He improved greatly since Arrietty, which I think was sub par. I went into this movie with high expectations, and I'm glad to say it is worthy of being Ghibli's final film.

While I enjoyed The Wind Rises and Kaguya, both paled in comparison to the amount of heart and sincerity that Marnie shows. Created by the new generation of Ghibli apprentices and based on a children's book few have heard of, it's no doubt that the critics would be more lukewarm about it than some of the Ghibli movies with more pedigree or gimmicks (sorry Kaguya). \n\nPut quite simply, Marnie is about a universal human experience: lonliness. Young Anna is an orphan who feels alone in the world, a gap between her foster parents, her friends at school, even her surroundings. She's a great artist for her age, and as she moves out to the country for health reasons, she falls in love with a lonesome, colorful house on the far side of the marsh. The story unfolds from there as Anna sees it, in spurts and stops, as Anna befriends a dream-like girl in the house, their friendship allowing Anna to come to terms with her own feelings of lonliness and disconnection. \n\nChances are you will not be able to guess the true source of Anna's disconnected feelings or the nature of Marnie. The movie does make you want to know the answer to these questions, but its only through the movie's vibrant secondary characters can we truly come to know them. Children and adults alike can understand and appreciate the themes of the movie (also unlike some of the recent Ghibli faire), because everyone can understand lonliness and isolation. \n\nIf it's playing a theater near you, see it, if it's not, then buy the video when it comes out. Such beautiful stories deserve the support.",

Reilly) after she suffers a really bad asthma attack. While at the country side she explores the surrounding area and discovers a mysterious marsh house. Supposedly the marsh house has been abandoned for years, but Anna meets a young girl there named Marnie (Kiernan Shipka). Anna and Marnie immediately become great friends and have a bond like no other. Anna keeps visiting Marnie, but eventually uncovers the true mystery of Marnie. The animation here first off is amazing. I really hope this isn't the last Studio Ghibli film because I want generations of people to be able to experience the true beauty of these films. The cinematography is well done with some very touching moments. I will say that the film has some pacing issues. The middle of the film especially after meeting Marnie has a lot of scenes that don't progress the story too much. It redeems itself by having a fantastic ending that is a bit of a twist and really touches the heart. Overall, another good Studio Ghibli film. I hope this isn't the last film!!!

Anna is an orphan but I always got confused on who the two elderly were, but it's not important: what is important is that Annah is sick and prefers being alone and drawing, and during a summer festival (which I forgot the name...I apologize but I'm not very good at those japanese names) she offends another girl and flees to a lake she saw earlier, where a big western looking house resides: in this place she'll encounter a young blonde haired girl called Marnie, together creating a bond of true friendship...and hopefully nothing else, considering some  scenes were quite weird to look, with lots of hugs and intimate moments such as dancing, blushing and (in my version), even telling her \"I love you\". Whatever it's the case, it doesn't go any further which is sort of a lost potential of self discovery, especially in terms of gender but instead it focuses on the friedship aspect, which is confusing to say the least.\r Until the very end, we never know who or what Marnie is and the viewer just think she's a ghost...and I won't spoil this of course but once the ending approaches, -everything- will fit to its place and finally Anna will become self aware and fully complete of herself, finally understanding her anger and her solitude.\r Overall, I loved this movie and despite it's missed messages, its confusion and sometimes boring parts I truely enjoyed this movie, and I'm glad that they left us a fine piece of art before taking their momentarily break from movie making.\r Such a shame we will have to wait a long time before we can witness another great work of the Studio Ghibli, but as an \"final\" movie for the moment (again, momentarily) it's a very good one and I highly recommend it.\r Just be careful: you might be confused the first time watching it.",

It's a puzzle movie. I adore this film. This is one of only a few movies I have ever seen that made me tear up, and make me want to cry. While it's probably aimed mostly at mothers to watch with their daughters, anyone who enjoys good films should love this masterpiece.I do have to say though that I prefer the Japanese version with English subtitles to the English language version for two reasons.\r 1: While I think Hailee Steinfeld is an amazing young actress (no one will ever play Mattie Ross in True Grit better), she is too old to play the lead character, Anna, in my opinion. Her voice seems too deep. Again, nothing against her, she's an amazing actress.\r 2: There is one specific line in this film that made me tear up and get a big lump in my throat. In the dubbed version, the line is spoken softly, which is fine. But in the original language version, the line is almost screamed, and is just way more emotional. It's like a knife to the heart, whereas the English version lacks the same level of emotion.\r But whatever version you see, it is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, not just story-wise, but also in the gorgeous hand-drawn animation, and the emotional score. I very strongly recommend When Marnie Was There. I am upset that this could be Studio Ghibli's final film, but it is certainly a good way to go out.",

The characters are designed brilliantly, it\u2019s just an all round excellent film and it doesn\u2019t appear that too much has been lost in translation between Britain and Japan.\r If this is to be the final film from Studio Ghibli, they are going out on a high because this film was excellent and really should have won the Oscar for Best Animated Film.  I liked Inside Out but for goodness sake, this film was way better.  This is just a lovely movie, I cannot recommend it enough if it is playing in your area and it doesn\u2019t matter which format you see it in because the dub cast do an excellent job with their performances and I am certain the Japanese cast do an excellent job too from what I have heard.  It\u2019s up there with the best Studio Ghibli movies, like Spirited Away, Howl\u2019s Moving Castle, The Wind Rises and many others.  It really deserves to be in with them.\r When I left the cinema I was both happy and sad because I knew this was the last time I got to see a new Studio Ghibli film in the cinema and while I am glad to have seen a great movie, I am sad to see this studio go because I know there will probably never be a collective group of creators like them in my lifetime.",

Based on the 1967 English novel of the same name and so the important characters borrowed the western names. This is what I call a fine adaptation, greatFrom the director Hiromasa Yonebayashi of 'The Secret World of Arriety' fame. Based on the 1967 English novel of the same name and so the important characters borrowed the western names. This is what I call a fine adaptation, great transformation from the words to the motion picture. Actually, it suited for the narration from the standpoint of Japanese culture and lifestyle, especially for this anime version with the beautiful fictional coastal landscapes. Whenever I remember this film in the future, that Marsh house would be the first thing to pop out in my mind, an unforgettable landmark for sure.\r The movie promos were damp. The posters were not that impressive, but okay and the trailer was very ordinary. Studio Ghibli was the reason to go for it, so I expected nothing spectacular from the movie. Even while I was watching, I thought it was just an enjoyable mystery flick, but you know sometime the value of the whole movie comes at the end twist. Once the end was near my stance changed, especially after the hidden truth revelation. Some movies need a re-watch to terminate any doubts regarding characters and scenes. As for this movie, if your focus is straight, then it's does not require.\r Not a technical brilliance like the director's previous movie, but the story was strong and twisty. The characters were very interesting, suspense was the movie's influence for the audience to stick till the end. There is no loose end, certainly gives a few topics to discuss about, but the narration moves on a circular track and hits back like the boomerang. That does not mean it is a time travel or something. The narration bends and blends with the time. To realise what is real and what is not, you have to wait till the end. After seeing the film, I understood everyone's childhood memories could monopolize if we encounter same object, place, person and other things again in the later life. Yes, I had few minor experience in my life as well.\r The opening dialogue itself a hint of what kind of movie it is going to be. There are two prominent girls, Anna and Marnie in the story, like the Anna and Elsa from 'Frozen'. The narration flips on a regular basis to tell the multiple layered story. As this film was a puzzle in portrayal, obviously viewers try to solve it, including me. I tried my best. I thought Anna's childhood toy was something to do with all the fuss, but I was terribly wrong. That was a perfect divert if you observe it closely. In another perspective, I kept 'The Others' and 'The Orphanage' in mind, but was not even close to where this story was heading. Whether you succeed or not, very fun to solve a mystery, you know. Finally, it gave me full satisfaction like that indirectly I saw 'The Uninvited' once again.\r Feels like the Oscars was concluded yesterday, but I am already thinking about the next one. If I am not wrong this movie is definitely one of the contenders for the best animation race, along with 'The Good Dinosaur' probably. Absolutely, I would be disappointed if I don't see it in the final five. There is lots of time between now and then, so anything might happen, who knows. After all, this film has already won my little heart and millions of other's. I know no one can replace Mr. Miyazaki, but feels like Hiromasa Yonebayashi could come near if his future projects as much effective as his one. Best of luck to him and he's only a 41. But remember Isao Takahat is 80 and still in the race, yet to announce his retirement. And this film was very close to his 'Only Yesterday'.\r I love you more than any girl I've ever known.\r Studio Ghibli is like Disney Studio from the east. As we know, narrating a fairy tale having the tween girls in the lead is what they're famous for. The previous couple of movies were out of their trademark, so, happy they are back with this masterwork. At a same time I am very very very very sad, because it's their final movie after the 30 years of triumph. Since Hayao Miyazaki's retirement everything falling apart from the studio's management. They've given reasons and it is only a temporary, though hope the rise of 3D animation is not the one to halt the production, praying for the pause to be lifted soon.\r This film is not just passing through from this giant anime production house, but it is a masterpiece. As usual, it is a girly movie and that does not stop grownups, especially men from a watch. I loved it, everytime when I like a movie I express my desire for a sequel and so I did for this film. Though it was one time story with nothing left over for further development, possibly some new thing can be attached to it. Whatever happens this movie will remain as one of the best from the studio and can compete with any modern animations and live-shot masterworks. Highly recommended, not just for anime or animation fans, but for mystery and who love the layers in story narration.\r 9/10",

Especially the images of the countryside. Talented group of illustrators. About the story, it was a little confusing - and dry. At first I thought the story was going to be about gender exploration. I initially thought Marnie and Anna had something going on - she always blushed, and the director would focus in on the romantic sensuality between the two girls... but... I'll stop here.

On paper the plot of the story sound like pure perfection, and utterly flawless. But how the story was executed was not flawless. A good example are the dream scenes. They start amazingly, but after the half way point they start to get muddled, and pretty pretentious because of what direction the plot is taking. When you get down to it, this film only has one true criticism. It's not long enough to flesh out all of its themes and characters. not including Marnie. But despite that heavy criticism, the film overall is enjoyable. After the first watch you'll definitely have mixed feeling, but by the second watch you'll definitely have a much better time.

It was a very fulfilling movie as the art was great as expected from Studio Ghibli. The story at the start and end was very interesting but the middle part was only ok. The parts with Anna and Marnie were great but there were sometimes I got confused. There are some side character but they show up once or are in a side plot that is not resolved or built upon till the end and it is over in a few sentences and one character who knows something is only given a little to explain at the very end. Anna has some development and she does grow a little bit but I felt like most of it happened at the end. In total even though there are some things that I don't like I still think that it is a great movie and the ending really makes it for me since all of the mystery's and side plots are resolved at the end. I feel like they should have made it a little longer to go more in depth about everything. But it is an experience that I do not regret watching.

So, to cure this illness, she has to go with her uncles to a small rural town. In this town the story repeat the moments that she had with others.

If the movie starts really hard with a considerable amount of emotions it soon becomes more fairy tale-like and suitable for children.'When Marnie Was There' is another dreamy and twisted feature in witch two little girls get in touch and become friends through time. It clearly benefits from the pros of every other Studio Ghibli movie: great animation (even if jerky from time to time), colourful design, lovable characters, precise feels, incomprehensible scenes and meaningful ending. However it surprisingly manages to lose a significative part of itself in useless scenes and trivial events. It clearly belongs to this category of films you can simply summarize by the sentence 'it was just a dream'. The film is disturbingly sometimes an inch away from endorsing the lesbian romance genre, and then finally not.In the end it feels like director Hiromasa Yonebayashi tried to force what Studio Ghibli were widely known for, ruining the magic by the same actions.",
