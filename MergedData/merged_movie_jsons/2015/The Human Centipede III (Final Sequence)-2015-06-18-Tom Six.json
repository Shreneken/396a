            "content": "What is there to say at this point in the game? Tom Six really exists only to disgust his audience to the best of his abilities in bad taste. Does 'The Human Centipede III' live up to this lofty goal at reaching a new level of disgust and bad taste? Not really. 'Centipede II' was far more disgusting but this one may be much harder to sit through. It's far more successful at being loud and obnoxious than it is at making me want to throw up. I think Six' core audience of torture porn fans will probably be very bored with this one. It just doesn't do anything. His detractors though who see him as a cinematic Antichrist are going to have a blast with 'Centipede III'. It's disgusting, offensive, and really a waste of film except in the fact that it will tick off a lot of people. In an odd way I have to give Six credit for this...I've seen the other films in this horror classic trilogy and so in a way I sort of wanted to see what horrible things Six could conjure up to end this trilogy. Six is much more a freak show host than he is a filmmaker, trying to get people to shed their decency to indulge in debauchery even with the realization that a lot of his audience are going to the film to advertise their disgust with it. I thought the first film actually had some merit to it. It was really well shot and Dieter Laser is outstandingly campy as the mad doctor. 'II' was gratuitous but in all honesty that was the point. 'III' tries to up the ante with the size and scope of everything. The fact is that freak shows aren't as interesting when they are big. It's a little more interesting when it's smaller and filthier. 'III' is a victim of trying to fill up a large canvas with the stupid centipede idea that can't really hold it. For the most part the movie is Laser on steroids.Dieter Laser constantly looks like he is on the verge of convulsing into a stroke into this film as he shouts out the horrific racist dialogue. I'm torn between saying wow and wanting to turn the thing off. This is pretty much all the film is. I thought his performance in the first film was campy and over the top but it's incredibly subtle in comparison (dried clitorises anyone?)Is 'III' disgusting enough though? Not really. The whole centipede subplot doesn't come until the end. There's a horrific rape dream sequence with Laser that really is so over the top that it doesn't elicit anything. It's just blah. Sticking a gun in a stoma hole is gross but with the over punctuation by Laser and Six it just becomes \"We get it already\"...I think I would have found some level of enjoyment of the film if I had viewed it with an audience at a midnight show scenario. This movie is utterly worthless being streamed or watched on DVD. It's a movie that's entire appeal comes from reading the bad reviews and watching your fellow audience members squirm. I would trade the ninety minutes I spent watching 'Centipede III' for ninety minutes of watching others watching 'Centipede III'.",

            "content": "I've been a big supporter of writer/director Tom Six and his taboo-busting Human Centipede films since the beginning: I rated the first film 8/10, and gave the jaw-droppingly twisted sequel 9/10. The only reason I didn't give Part Two full marks was because I believed that Six still had a few tricks up his sleeve and would probably surpass himself with his third film.As it happens, I was wrong.As far as the controversial content is concerned, the film delivers numerous scenes that live up to Six's notorious reputation, kicking off with some sexual abuse, before proceeding to serve up such sordid treats as the torture of a prisoner with pans of boiling water, a nauseating castration scene, the insertion of a gun barrel into a man's stoma, the consumption of human testicles and dried clitorises, some wound-rape and coma-rape, and, of course, the creation of not just the biggest human centipede yet, but also a human caterpillar, the surgical process for both depicted in graphic detail.But while the film doesn't wimp out on the deviancy, it does suffer from two major problems that make it a very unsatisfying experience overall. The first is the prison setting, which is so implausible that it renders the whole movie utterly ridiculous. The first two films, while unlikely, were at least vaguely plausible: it was possible to believe that a raving lunatic might try to stitch a few folks ass-to-mouth out of curiosity, but the notion that the head of a large correctional facility could do the same, with the co-operation of his staff, is absurd in the extreme and seriously detracts from the film's overall effectiveness as a shocker. Even when viewed as a black comedy, it's still a dumb premise.The second issue I have is with Dieter Laser (the actor who played Dr. Heiter in the first film): his performance as sadistic warden Bill Boss is hugely irritating, the guy drawing out every single syllable at the top of his voice to the point where I would have liked to have seen HIS mouth sewn to someone's ass just to shut him up. Laurence Harvey (bug-eyed star of the second film) is also crap, but at least he's not quite as annoying. Both guys are out-acted by porn-star Bree Olson, who is also a whole lot easier on the eyes.If the subtitle 'Final Sequence' is to be believed, this film sees an end to the Human Centipede series; it's a hugely disappointing way to wrap things up. Let's hope that Six's next film sees the director back on form: we need something to flush away any memories of this rather obnoxious mess.",

May i first ask who wanted this movie to be made? What? No-one? OK, THEN WHY ON EARTH DID TOM SIX DECIDE TO MAKE THIS Piece OF GARBAGE??? There is no way, any sane human being would believe that this was in any way imaginable a good idea. It has some of the worst acting i have ever seen in my entire life from every single person in this film and will someone tell Dieter Laser to STOP BLOODY SHOUTING EVERY DAMN SENTENCE LIKE WE ARE 100km AWAY, JEEZ. And on top of the god- awful acting it comes accompanied by the worst scripts in history, and a plot that made absolutely no sense whatsoever, in fact, there was no plot for 90% of this thing. This is 'The Human Centipede' right? SO WHERE WAS THE CENTIPEDE FOR THE FIRST HOUR AND 20 MINUTES??? I honestly do not know which was more difficult to sit through, the surgery (or lack thereof) or that piece of garbage that was the culmination of bad acting, writing, directing and everything else. There were a few times where the film showed signs of trying to be satirical and even self aware but it was so ridiculously dumb that by that point you just want to gouge your eyes out. I don't even know why i am still wasting my time talking about this when i just wasted an hour and 40 minutes of my life watching it. So here's the score and if you want to subject yourself to torture be my guest because i'm out. - 0.3/10",

I missed out on the sequel and only watched this one because I had the opportunity of seeing it free and contains the bizarre casting of Eric Roberts and former porn star Bree Olson. On top of all that there seemed to be a meta-fictional aspect of director Tom Six playing himself and the trailer looked good . What's wrong with investing a couple of hours in blackly comical horror ? Well to be fair the trailer is accurate in a way of \"Meglomaniac abuses power and really pushes the boat out\" but the execution is dreadful . Dieter Laser looks totally camp in the trailer as Bill Boss and while the performance is bearable in a two minute trailer it's not in a feature length film . I can understand that he's not supposed to be taken seriously for a moment but that's not really the point as he shouts , squeals and uses lots and lots of swear words while inflicting violence on people . It's not satire we're watching but absolute farce and Laser becomes painfully irritating , so much so that you find yourself looking forward to Eric Roberts appearing if only to see a calm and reserved performance . Yes chaps you read that right - Eric Roberts probably gives the most calm , rational and realistic acting performance in the entire movie . I suppose you could also give Tom Six a back handed compliment in making a sequel that is a billion light years removed from the original movie but nothing about it really works and in cinematic terms it feels like a juvenile delinquent who wants to shock the adult world but just ends up looking silly . Take this insult: \"Not even the corpse of a spastic would want you . Now f--k off\" That's probably the most witty line in the film and I've come out with funnier compliments throughout my entire life which hopefully says more about THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE III than it says about me",

But foremost he is unable to get the respect he thinks he deserves from his inmates and the state Governor. He constantly fails in experimenting with different ideas for the ideal punishment to get the inmates in line, which drives him, together with the sizzling heat, completely insane. Under threats of termination by the Governor, his loyal right hand man Dwight comes up with a brilliant idea. A revolutionary idea which could change the American prison system for good and save billions of dollars. An idea based on the notorious Human Centipede movies, that will literally and figuratively get the inmates on their knees, creating the ultimate punishment and deterrent for anyone considering a life of crime. I LOVED the first two....especially the second which was really surreal.Trust me...this movie is horrible. It's made for three dollars and all it really can be distilled down to is a screaming pseudo Nazi.There is no real plot like the first two.The production values are way inferior as well.I was SO hoping this would be good.It's not.In the slightest.",

Tom Six seems to not understand this and only wanted to make a comedic sequel just for the sake of it being \"different\". I've seen this happen with other horror sequels, and it never turns out well. The comedy itself was in bad taste.. as a few others have pointed out.You know a movie is going to be bad when you have a porn star (Bree Olson) as one of the main cast.",

They were disturbing and, in many ways, were unique.This final installment was just annoying to watch. It did not shock and the actual, 'centipede' part didn't even happen until very late in the movie.This movie was a massive let down and the radical departure from the stylistic form of the first two movies ruined it in my eyes.Let us hope this really is the last sequence.",

            "content": "The standard for torture porn isn't exactly high but it isn't so low that you can substitute being a passable well made film with torturing the viewer with boredom, which this final installment does. The first two at least had some kind of passable narrative and were decently shot and edited. This on the other hand can't get the basics right. The acting is god awful. Its worse than just being flat because the main character, governor Hughes, yells out every damn line he has. Even after this it still somehow has the problem of NOT BEING ABLE TO HEAR/UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE SAYING. The audio is pretty poor. The dialogue at times is muffled by the soundtrack, which is pretty pathetic. How long is the film? 2hrs and 20 minutes! If you are going to make a piece of crap then at least make it 1hr and 30 max. So what about the \"plot\"? Governor Hughes is shown the first two films first thing in the film. You would think that the main character, Hughes, a over the top Texan loudmouth psychopath who abuses his prisoners, would get the idea that he has been shown the film because his accountant wants to do it for real. Nope. Instead we have a long drawn out tour of the prison. There is though a decent message to the film about the state of prison abuse and the contempt of the Americans to actually care. Sadly it beats you over the head with it in the final 20 minutes of the film. As for the gore there are two decent scenes. There is a waterboarding with boiling water and a mutilation. I would not watch the film just to see those scenes simply because it is surrounded by 2 hrs of yelling and boredom. Human Centipede is a sad, and surprisingly tame and boring, end to the series.",

There's an unexpected side-step as the filmmaker decides to both make a new centipede film and change the setting and plot. This is definitely more over-the-top and humorous than the straight out gore and psychological horror of the other 2.In the end, that makes it a smarter, more enjoyable film for those looking for more than a film testing their ability to watch through the most painful, gruesome, and disgusting scenes.Tom Six steps out from behind the pen and camera to become an active character in this film to both openly acknowledge his fame and to create a sense that this is actually happening. Like the other films, the ending definitely isn't happy. It is, however, consistent with the earlier films and bizarre enough that it should please those seeking the horror/gore originality that probably got them to watch it initially.",

This was one of my anticipated horror films of 2015 and I must say I was really disappointed. With the film's big premise and ambition, it turns out to be ultimately dull throughout with little entertainment here. The film is filled with perversely sick moments, immaturely psychotic performance, and shocking GORES that's intended to make you puke and gross you out instead of making a gleefully enjoyable one to watch. One of the main problems here is the performance of Dieter Laser which make him looks like Marlon Wayans going pull psycho which is amusing to watch for like 5 minutes and the rest is just childishly annoying and just dull, making the film laughable and looks like a parody of itself. Another problem is how the story drags out and we have to sit through the whole psychotically dull act and vulgarly racist dialogue before the final sequences happen which is nothing that surprising since most of them are already shown in the trailer. Overall, The Final Sequence is crude, vulgar, perversely sick, over-the-top in its violence and chessily insane performance, yet still ends up too dull to enjoy even for the fans of the genre.>>C-<<",

            "content": "My quick rating - 4,1/10. Don't listen to any nonsense about how violent/gore filled this is. It just isn't. The movie leads itself to being a sequel within a new movie premise taken a step further from how part 2 was to 1. Kudos to Tom Six for making sequels that don't follow the traditional role, but smack him at the same time for being so pretentious to think a film fan won't see right through his arrogance. Multiple scenes of what Tom considers humor point this out entirely by being long, drawn out scenes with Deiter Laser (Bill Boss) acting like a complete jackass overacting a joke to the point that would make Jim Carrey cringe. Basically the story in a nutshell (about all you need) is a deranged prison warden (Laser) decides at his last straw to use the ideas from the Human Centipede movies to punish criminals and deter further offenders to ever break the law. This revelation is made when the governor (played by, wait for it, Eric Roberts) gives Boss 2 weeks to get his prison in order. What better way then take all the prisoners and sew them ass to mouth together, right? Anyway, back to the gore, a scene or two MAY have been considered \"gross\" years ago, but there is nothing to raw at all. Some of the humor is quite funny in a very dark way (his idea of health food is one of them) but the overshadowing of the poor acting is a deterrent (in other words, yes, it is a b- budget movie BUT it was so painfully obvious the actors were purposely acting bad to become a b-budget movie) So again the numbnut,Tom Six, thinks he is outsmarting the audience with this backasswards attempt at laughs. These laughs tend to come more from suggestion and the cheesy attempt at being an exploitative film(women should love a secretary named \"Tits\") All and all, it has the pros but is to outweighed by the cons. Good news, it was only supposed to be a trilogy, so we may be spared of another one.",

Basically psychotic prison warden William \"Bill\" Boss (First Sequence's Dieter Laser) watches The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) with his accountant Dwight Butler (Full Sequence's Laurence R. Harvey), Bill says he hates the films, he enjoys sexually assaulting his assistant Daisy (porn star Bree Olson), to the dismay of Dwight watching, who tries to pitch a \"brilliant idea\", before being interrupted. Bill and Dwight are summoned to the prison to look at the aftermath of an assault that occurred, an officer was stabbed by an inmate, Bill punishes the prisoner, Inmate 178 (The Fifth Element's Tommy 'Tiny' Lister), by snapping his arm, exposing his bone and causing immense pain, Bill hurls several racist slurs at him, and promises to do this again when his bones heal. In the Warden's office, Bill receives his package, specially imported dried African clitorises, which he eats 'for strength', next Bill waterboards Native American prisoner, Inmate 346 (Jay Tavare), disfiguring him with boiling water. Governor Hughes (The Dark Knight's Eric Roberts) threatens to fire Bill and Dwight if they do not clean up their acts, desperate to gain respect Bill orders all prisoners are castrated, he graphically castrates a prisoner, Inmate 297 (Robert LaSardo), himself. Bill next eats the prisoner's cooked testicles for lunch, Daisy is forced to give him fellatio, while Dwight watches and angrily stamps his papers in the corner, after she swallows he offers her something to take away the taste, she eats one of the dried clitorises, mistaking it for candy. Dwight is finally able to pitch his \"brilliant idea\", he suggests all prisoners should be surgically connected, mouth to anus, forming giant human centipede, saying it will save them money, and it will be the ultimate deterrent for anyone considering a life of crime. Bill initially opposes the idea, because of his hatred of The Human Centipede films, dismissing the idea as impossible, and claiming the films director Tom Six has a fetish for feces, after a drunken argument with Dwight, Bill has a nightmare of the prisoner he castrated raping him in the kidney. The director himself, Tom Six, is summoned to the prison, Bill is warming to Dwight's idea, Six confirms that it is \"100% medically accurate\", Six gives permission to use his Centipede idea, but he wants to witness the operation. The first two Human Centipede films are screened to the prisoners in the prison canteen, showing them what is going to happen, a riot breaks out, several guards are injured, the prisoners spread, trapping Bill and Dwight in the Warden's office, one inmate beats Daisy into a coma and another masturbates watching, backup arrives and manage to herd the prisoners back to their cells. Bill readies all prisoners, going to each cell and shooting all inmates with tranquilisers, but some prisoners are not compatible for the centipede, one prisoner has a stoma, and one prisoner is disabled, Bill kills them both. They also discover a prisoner has Crohn's disease, causing constant diarrhoea, Bill orders the prisoner he castrated and raped him in his dream is attached to him as further punishment, Bill and Dwight visit Daisy who is in a coma, Dwight tells Bill he loves her, Bill ignores his protests and rapes Daisy's motionless body. Tom Six returns and is met by Bill and Dwight, touring the cells the trio discover a mentally unstable prisoner eating his own feces, wanting to be sewn into the centipede, not wanting anyone to enjoy the centipede punishment Bill kills the prisoner, they next observe the operation going ahead, including the death row inmates being dismembered for a \"special project\", Six vomits seeing this. The five-hundred person human centipede is complete, Governor Hughes arrives and is disgusted by what he sees, not only a Human Centipede has been created, but also a Human Caterpillar, made up of prisoners serving life sentences, with all limbs removed, meaning they cannot move, also Daisy has accidentally been sewn into the Centipede, Bill and Dwight detail the saving of money for tax payers and other benefits from it, but Hughes concludes they are insane and should get the death penalty, before leaving in abhorrence. Bill murders Dr. Jones (Clayton Rohner) in anger, then Hughes returns to the prison and has had a change of heart, he claims the Centipede punishment is \"just what America needs\", the end sees Bill and Dwight celebrate their success, but Bill shoots Dwight for trying to take credit for the idea, even though it was his idea in the first place, and Bill is seen naked dancing and screaming from the watchtower over the prison centipede. Also starring First Sequence's Akihiro Kitamura as Inmate 333, Bill Hutchens as Inmate 488 and Carlos Ramirez (identical twin brother of Efren from Napoleon Dynamite) as Inmate 109. The casting of stars from the previous two films as actually a clever idea, Laser is fantastically exaggerated and sadistic, while Harvey is amusingly eccentric and authoritative, the appearances of Roberts, Olson, Lister and even the film's own director Six add a little something as well. I questioned if this final film in the trilogy would have as many cuts by the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) as the second film did, it certainly doesn't hold back on the violence, body mutilation or other disgusting things going on, you could argue that some of it is done for comedic value, depending on your opinion of the series, certainly not to be watched if your squeamish, and it satirises politics, racism and sexism, I admit it's no quite as good as the previous two, but it's not a bad satirical horror. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel. Worth watching!",

In the second movie the first movie was made out to be exactly that, just a movie. In this one both the first and second are supposed to have been movies.Still with me?Adding an element of humor this third part is undeniably memorable but not for the right reasons. It aims to shock once again and pulls out all the stops in doing so.Credit where credit is due, the lead takes the character and makes it his own and saves the film (To an extent). The Human Centipede III is disgusting, and there is barely a story but it has moments that are very hard to get off your mind so it at least succeeds there.Not for the faint.The Good:Dieter Laser certainly makes for an interesting character with Billy BossThe Bad:Shock for the sake of shockNo real storyline",

            "content": "The original 'Human Centipede' was a brilliant idea for a film. The trailer alone was truly shocking and made any horror/gore fan adamant that they had to see it. The idea alone was enough to carry the film and the results were indeed brilliant and shocking. Then there came the problem that writer/director Tom Six wanted a sequel, in fact a couple of them. The idea alone was no longer going to be shocking enough to carry them. He had to up the ante. And that's exactly what he did with 'The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)'. In fact he upped it possibly more than he needed to. It truly was an incredibly shocking film, with one scene in particular really standing out in my memory. The only problem was that made upping the ante again for part three even tougher. Did he manage it? All I can say is he gave it a hell of a try.The movie really is carried by the lead character of Bill Boss, played by Dieter Laser who also starred in the original. In what must have been an exhausting performance to pull off, he is simply going full throttle from scene one to the dying seconds of the film. He gives it his all and he pulls it off. The character is captivating to watch and wonder what he is going to do next. Laurence R. Harvey, the star of part two, also returns in a little more toned down role this time, as do some other actors in smaller parts. In fact even Tom Six himself makes an appearance this time around.It goes without saying that this film won't be for everyone, however I absolutely loved it. A number of scenes are again truly shocking and the overall plot of the film is nothing short of fascinating. It's far from highbrow, Oscar winning cinema, but then it never sets out to be anything of the sorts. It's there to entertain its audience and that it does in spades.",

Because of this passion, I have seen every movie in Harry Medved's \"The 50 Worst Movies\" and nearly all of IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list. However, of all these bad films, one I simply could not bring myself to finish was \"The Human Centipede II\" as I found it so overwhelmingly disgusting, stupid and awful that I simply couldn't finish the job. This made my watching \"The Human Centipede III\" something I really did NOT look forward to doing! Should I have paid more attention to my brain and simply refused to see this third film? To put it bluntly...yes.When the film begins, you can't help but marvel at Dieter Laser as he plays the crazy Warden. I couldn't believe how bad an actor he was and what a horrible performance he could give as this very, very stupid character. Warden Boss is like a cartoon character....so evil he's utterly ridiculous. He overacts constantly and is so dumb and awful you just need to see and hear him to believe it!\nAdditionally, his heavy German accent simply made it sound as if he'd JUST learned English a few minutes before attempting this role! Is he completely to blame? No...the writer and director must own some of this as well, though I strongly suspect they were penguins as I cannot imagine a person directing or writing THIS poorly. His character is 100% sadism and 100% stupid....to the point where he becomes tedious....and dumber than Tor Johnson in \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\"!Overall, this movie was SLIGHTLY less disgusting than the prior film but the utter stupidity of the script and Laser put it in a class all by itself. I would clearly place this in a list NOT of the worst 100...but worst dozen films ever made. It' THAT bad...that pointless...that offensive...and that amateurish. A truly awful pile of dog vomit of a film...with a loud, brash, obnoxious no-talent leading it all in the form of Warden Boss!",

And yet, no such luck. The final film was such a let down that I really feel the 2nd one should be the 3rd film as it is by far the hardest to watch.The only 2 things that show that this is the 3rd one is the fact that we see clips from film 2 at the start and the centipede in film 3 is bigger. Otherwise we are 'treated' to this western-sheriff guy who is over-the-top dramatic and controlling and... wait for it... that's it.Big big big let down Tom sorry to say :(",

Before that, several unconnected gory scenes are presented, just to show how sadistic the protagonist is.Unlike the first two films, this one has a comedic touch added, like the appearance of its director, Tom Six, as a character of himself. Unfortunately, it doesn't work in either direction: it's not thrilling, suspenseful or creepy, neither is it funny or entertaining.The film drags so much that, at a certain point (around 59min of running), after the prisoners are forced to watch \"The Human Centipede\" films, the character of Akihiro Kitamura (Inmate 333) stands and says, \"this trash occupies a world where the stars don't shine.\" It comes out of nowhere that I laughed aloud! I was really not expecting that. Unfortunately, the joke only works because what comes before is too boring (if you fast forward to the joke, it won't have the same impact, I'm pretty sure). Almost one hour of build-up for a single joke is just too much.After that, the film goes back to dragging, until it ends, finally showing the human centipede (plus, a human caterpillar, made of prisoners whose limbs had been removed). All main characters, except the protagonist, die (well, the secretary is joined by accident to the centipede, so, well...)Is it worth watching? Definitely not. Downloading for free and watching fast forwarding is not a good option, as much of the impact of the film is lost (and the only joke). This really belongs to a place without stars...",

There's less suspense than the first movie because it focuses less on the victims. Also being in a prison means you automatically know no character will believably escape, meaning a good chunk of suspense is just thrown away.

Bush Prison is ruled over by the Warden Bill Boss, a sweat-soaked shaved- headed sadist brainwashed with delusions of madness and brutality.Boss' 'Igor' is his accountant, Dwight, but the prison's real problems are High costs, inmate fights, guard injuries and other numerous failures.Boss has his own ideas for how to fix the place, shouting incomprehensible waffle in his garbled English, but mild-mannered Dwight keeps on mentioning an even better idea. If Bill would only watch these two horror movies to see how it might work \u0085Third times the charm right? It's absolutely not in this abomination of a film, easily the worst film of the year, directed by Tom Six, who must be laughing all the way to the bank with his trilogy of trash.The concept of the original movie was a good enough idea, but it was executed poorly. The second one was more meta, and a better movie, but that's the same as saying that losing an arm is better than losing your sight, which would be beneficial in this films case.So we have Laser as the warden, barely making any sense literally shouting his lines throughout looking like he is on some sort of substance. Seriously, this is one of the poorest performances I've seen in a film, I don't know what he was trying to channel, but my goodness, his performance is painful.Harvey fares a little better, but he looks like Stan Laurel, at least he pulls the reins in on his performance. The film is exceptionally offence, sexist, homophobic, culturally incorrect, and so wrong on so many accounts.Six appears as himself, and even he vomits due to the quality of his own creation.In trying to be shocking, Six fails on every level imaginable, shock doesn't mean to offend all the time, shock should stay with you, make you think, not make you want to press the off button.When the unveiling of the titular experiment is finally revealed, your still recovering from the insufferable poison the previous hour showered you with.And this is supposed to be a black comedy too? That sentence in itself is funnier than anything present on screen.The jokes on us unfortunately, as the 'auteur' cemented his name in legend, because this film will be remembered.......for all the wrong reasons of course.But I'll give credit where credits due,there are some landscape shots that are truly psychedelic.It's really really really not worth 100 minutes of your life.

I know some fans of the Will Ferrell comedy cult would disagree on that last point, and if this is you then I can only say: Just keep on smoking your dope, drink your Jaegermeister, and don't ever leave your mother's house! Unlike the first sequel, which had superb acting talent, this one failed completely on that point with all characters excepting those who played the convicts (victims). Not even creepy Dieter Laser could follow up the mad-scientist acting skill which he displayed in the original to this series, he just isn't suited for the Texas Prison Warden role, and it was painful to watch him fall down on that.As for reality, and the claims which Tom Six makes to how any of these turds reflect this, \"The Final (Insult)\" takes itself much too seriously on it's medical and political ideas, and anybody who thinks otherwise needs to be locked up before they try anything so stupid. I'm no physician, nor have I any sort of medical training, but then I don't have to be in order to disprove the accuracy of Tom Six's medical claims. Considering that the Millenials grew up with all of the world's information available to them at the click of a few buttons, to see that generation making and accepting such ideas as true is the true horror which this movie causes.Well, kids, it's not actually true that human life ca be sustained by eating feces. I would have thought that everyone down to 10 years old would know through osmosis and even TV that urine is indeed sterile, while poop is heavily laden with bacteria which will kill you if ingested. The bacteria exist safely and usefully within your colon, but if your colon leaks or you eat poop, you will become infected and you will die! Which is something to consider if you ever find yourself tempted to join that ass-rimming cult of sexual stimulation (make sure there isn't any fecal matter present).You may have seen your dog eating his own poop when he's hungry, but this is normal for dogs and some other animals with short intestinal tracts. On account of the shortness, their digestion is much less efficient for them than it is for humans and other primates. Therefore, there is enough food value remaining in their feces that it makes sense for them to re-digest it when they cannot get better food, or somebody forgets to feed them. A dog can do this safely because it is descended from wolf stock, which has been evolving antibodies against bacteria and other pathogens for millions of years longer than primates have, and in much harsher climates. Humans have such efficient digestive systems that even if it weren't for the deadly bacterial hazard there is less nutrition in our poop than is worth the energy to digest it. Therefore, if you were put in a human centipede and you were the second in line behind the one who gets fed any sort of edible food, there's no chance that you would survive, and the last few people in a line of 500 would not even taste any s***, they would begin starving immediately.Don't ask me how I know the above, just go look it up for yourself. I'm not saying believe anything you see that's posted on the subject, far from it - make sure, before you believe anything, that it's agreed upon by multiple, and qualified sources who present their facts in a level-headed manner without any hype, ad-hoc nonsense arguments or other manipulative tactics.As for how this warden's lunatic idea won even a Texas governor's approval...I know there are some who would smile at that idea, but they could not expect that their voters, so many who have imprisoned family members, would not destroy their political careers.",

Comedy horrors are extremely hard to get right because it combines the most difficult genres to get right, not everybody laughs at the same things and not everybody is scared of the same things. This movie relies on shock humor and extremely exaggerated acting. I find Dieter Laser as Bill Boss hilarious and same goes for Laurence R Harvey as Dwight, they're a very funny duo and very memorable characters. But then again, if screaming profanities and saying the word \"cock\" every two seconds isn't your humor and ball cutting scenes aren't your type of horror then you're going to hate this movie.I'm giving it a 10 while acknowledging that this movie isn't for everyone, but that doesn't make it a bad movie that just makes it a controversial movie. You might love it, you might hate it, there's no in between and I think Tom Six doesn't want an in between, he wants strong reactions and that's exactly what he gets with each of his movie.

With 'The Human Centipede 3', writer- director Tom Six takes this self-referential angle even further, focusing on prison staff inspired by the first two movies who invite Tom Six to supervise their construction of a real prisoner human centipede. Dieter Laser - who was the lead actor in Part 1 - is the prison warden and has several amusing lines as he declares that the first two 'Centipede' films \"stink\" and calls Six \"an infatuated toddler\". Six's cameo is a lot of fun too; same goes for his choice to retain Laurence R. Harvey playing a totally different character. Six trips up though by giving Laser free reign to go as over-the-top as he likes as the warden, driven insane by heat. It is a distracting exaggerated performance and one that unjustly takes up most of the screen time, with the construction of Laser's centipede left to the final quarter of the movie. In short, those who liked the self-referential elements of Part 2 will still find a lot to like here, but those in it for the shocks and graphic imagery may be disappointed.

His assistant eventually persuades him to copy Tom Six's idea from the Human Centipede films, and hook all the prisoners together ass to mouth, creating more of a 'human caterpillar' than a centipede.Given the massive furore over the last film, which struggled to secure a certificate in the UK despite being more of a post modern, tongue in cheek variation on the original and far less upsetting, this third and , we're promised (hopefully, really) last instalment in the HC franchise, has arrived with far less fanfare and, as such, probably far less anticipation. Since neither of the first two got really great reviews (especially, quite rightly, not the terrible second part!) it could be that the demand for the third part simply isn't through the roof, and in spite of having the most excessive and disgusting idea of them all, there's been no attempts to ban it. But it's a strange cookie all of its own.This time round, the emphasis seems to be purely on laughs, with references to the first two films included, and everything played up for the most campy effect possible. Even the HC concept has been blown to the most outrageous lengths imaginable, and has more of a silly element attached to it, which, with less sympathetic victims isn't so unthinkable, even if the poster itself is enough to twist your mind. There's certainly no way lead star Laser could be doing anything but playing it for laughs, turning in the most hammy, overboard, comical performance you can imagine. The irony of having him, as the star of the original film, co starring with the star of the sequel in totally different roles isn't lost on anyone either, especially not, it seems, director Tom Six.This is a series that certainly hasn't played out in what you'd call the 'traditional sense', gradually turning into a bizarre parody of itself as it's gone along, but it's secured something of a cult following for itself anyway, and this is probably the most enjoyable entry, coming from the angle of a non sick, easy going mind. ***",

There are many sick moments for you sick gore hounds who crave sick guilty pleasures, one, the first or second bloody moment, ala Zero Dark Thirty, only with hot water. The story almost has you, dangerously contemplating on whether performing the practice of joining 500 violent unruly prisoners, head to bum cheek, forming the biggest centipede yet, would work in the real world. But it would have some prison guards heavily contemplating this too. But this is totally inhuman, where here's a prison that's way understaffed, inundated with bedlam. But hey, this is a movie, and quite a sick depraved, repellent one, where our leads, from the previous two return. The man running the show is (Laser HC1) who's consistent and inane shouting, really got on my goat, the truly most annoying thing, may'be the only annoying thing in this film. Playing the assistant governor, is (Harvey HC2) donning a Southern accent, again, playing a pathetic pitiable character. And we have a hot female blonde receptionist with big jugs, who sternly obeys Governor Laser's commands, mostly of sexual services and whims. Eric Roberts is wasted as a visiting governor. This third centipede may not be as bad as you expect it to be or not. There are predictiabilities in plot, as in Roberts change of heart, and Laser's betrayal in the finale. What we're left in with the Human Centipede 3, besides 500 pi..ed off actors with bad backs, act are a lot of tasty sick instances in a mess of a film . Even director Six, gets in on the act, playing himself, but throwing in quite a good performance as himself, the film maker, seeing at first hand, if the operation of 500 bad buns joined together, will work.

It arrived at the tail end of an era of torture porn horror films, including the final entry of the Saw franchise a mere six months later, but took the genre in a new direction with the inclusion of a mad-scientist angle. Dieter Laser chewed the scenery as Dr. Heiter, carrying out an experiment that Six still insists to be 100% medically accurate.If The Human Centipede was shocking in concept and followed through with execution, the sequel somehow managed to increase both creativity and shock value. The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) has moments of absolute brilliant excess in the actual nitty-gritty of the film's abuse and degradation under the thin pretense of medical experimentation, but the real genius comes in the actual concept of the movie's plot. Rather than keep the same villain from the first film, the sequel is about a nearly mute psychopath named Martin (Laurence R. Harvey), whose obsession with The Human Centipede film leads him to carry out his own makeshift experiment. This time around, the promise was for carnage that is 100% medically inaccurate.Here's where things get tricky; now I have to review The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence) having already explained that the first sequel doubled down on both creativity and shocking gore. Anyone who has experienced the first two films will first and foremost want to know if the film manages to top the prior two. The answer is yes, but not in the ways that you would expect, and likely not the way most horror fans would have hoped. In terms of shocking sequences, The Human Centipede III comes nowhere close to the previous installment. On the other hand, this is the most striking in terms of political and social satire, fittingly given the tagline \"100% Politically Incorrect.\" And the film still has its hand at excess, though this time it comes in the form of Dieter Laser's delightfully over-the-top performance.For the rest of the review and more visit www.rizayreviews.com",

Director Tom Six presents the third installment to the repulsive franchise (The human Centipede) fingers crossed it truly is the \"final sequence\". It's offensive at all measures, unforgivably insane and transparently foolish. This film rebelliously dismisses the boundaries of film-making and goes overboard purely for shock factor. Dieter Laser's performance was unnecessarily over the top and gave me a headache, however his insults were priceless. There were no character developments resulting to thin emotional attachment towards the leads, but that's obviously Mr. Six' intent as he only cares about its obnoxious content which still lacked fluency and substance. The cinematography was descent but seemed like it was heavily inspired by Robert Rodriguez' style. The practical effects were extremely realistic and the lighting really set the tone which promoted the environment. With these few excuses of my 3/10 rating out of the way, what annoyed me most about this film besides its shameful acting, and crummy direction. Is the fact that Tom six proves to me how cocky a film-maker can become, he plays himself in this excuse of a film and there are literally scenes where characters praise his previous movies and asks for his autograph, like SERIOUSLY?This film is like a bad hangover, it leaves an unforgettable after taste of discomfort and dread. The unintentionally hilarious dialog is its saving grace but at the same time it's no way near forgivable for its constipated plot and pacing. This film takes everything the previous films left out and gives them laxatives and then splatters them onto the screen, is this what you call art Mr. Six, take a good hard look at your career and tell me if you're proud to put this on your resume? After my viewing I brushed my teeth twice and had a long shower. A terrible movie in terms of entertainment and quality, at all costs stay away. Final Rating (Popcorn Metre) 9%",

            "content": "I can't believe we have a third film in 'The Human Centipede' franchise. This is supposedly the final film, but I hope there will be others or director Tom Six will come back after a long hiatus and do a fourth film. If you are unaware of 'The Human Centipede' films, allow me to give you a little background. The first film was more or less a straight horror film thru and thru. It had a psychopathic surgeon (Dieter Laser) who kidnapped a few twenty-somethings and sewed them ass to mouth as to form one long digestive track.It was original, unflinching, and fun as hell. It became an instant cult classic, where genre fans like myself would do anything to see the film again and show our unsuspecting friends. A few years later, the sequel came along and was shot all in black and white, with the exception of a certain brown color. I'll let you fill in the blank there. Keeping with the original ideas, this sequel had a sick and twisted individual (Laurence R. Harvey) who was shun by society who saw the first film, and decided to make his own Human Centipede. That brings us to the third film dubbed 'Final Sequence'.This plays out a little different than the previous two films in that this might be Tom Six's most politically charged film, but of course it's all a satire. Part III takes place all inside a prison called 'George H.W. Bush' prison where perhaps the most vile and most horrible man to ever live calls himself the warden. This warden is played by Dieter Laser, the sick doctor from the first film. To compare him to Hitler would be an understatement with this third film. The warden who goes by Bill Boss is as sick and twisted as they come. He eats female clitoris's for breakfast, his inmates testicles for lunch, and is not above sexually or physically abusing his staff or inmates to a psychotic degree on a consistent basis.His character is so over-the-top, you can't help but laugh all the way through the film. Bill Boss runs around literally screaming all of his lines and obscenities, shoots his gun at will inside the prison, and never rests for even five seconds. His goal in life is to hurt and torture others. When the Governor stops by (played by Eric Roberts), he tells Boss to get his act together with the problems at the prison or there will be hell to pay. So Boss tells his assistant and accountant Dwight Butler (Laurence R. Harvey) from the second film to castrate every inmate at the prison. Instead, Dwight informs him of 'The Human Centipede' films, and suggests this form of punishment, which Boss eventually agrees to.It's not until the final act, that we see the centipede formed, which might not satisfy some, but rest assured, there are plenty of gross out moments prior to the 500- person centipede, including actually seeing up close the surgery, guts and holes and all. Some will say that director Tom Six has no idea what he's doing or even call him a filmmaker, which is sad, because he's a brilliant filmmaker. He has the balls to show the dark side of humanity and what we are truly capable of in the form of a black comedy and satire with an unflinching and gutsy style. It's original, entertaining, sick, depraved, and smart in a filmic way.You'll have to agree that you've never seen anything quite like it, such as the people back in 1975 when they first saw 'Salo', which is now part of the incredible 'Criterion Collection'. It's only a matter of time. While Dieter Laser's constant yelling can get a bit tedious, it is none the less funny. The final scene of the film should stick with you for days too, as it's something that is rarely seen in American cinema, which leaves 'The Human Centipede III: Final Sequence' definitely worth seeing if you can stomach it.",

The actors were absolutely brilliant especially Dieter Laser (Bill Boss) He played a foul mouth, racist, violent and sexually frustrated prison warden who's failing to run a prison. I found Bill Boss extremely funny as he shouted every offensive word that came in his mind. Laurence's character (Mr Butler) played an totally opposite character, which I found funny as hell (especially if you've watched Part 2). Plus Eric Roberts and Bree Olson was in this movie; so extra points! I noticed little Easter eggs to the last two movies, which was brilliant, I loved pointing them out and would make great drinking game! YAR! The colour grading was perfect and gave a new and exciting feel to the movie and at times the movie did make me want to scream (Castration Scene) and the Coma rape was just as bad but just as funny. I applaud Tom Six for going too the extreme again! The overall movie was brilliant in my opinion and that Tom Six has ended the trilogy in style.\"This is exactly what America needs\"",

            "content": "A brutal, deranged prison warden, Bill Boss, knows no limits or laws when it comes to maintaining discipline in his prison, and in carrying out his sadistic urges. Then, influenced by watching the Human Centipede movies, his sidekick Dwight suggests that he create a human centipede out of the prisoners. It will cut their food costs...The original The Human Centipede was disgusting in its plot, but not very graphic. This was a redeeming quality, as it left a lot to the imagination, and left room for a plot. While not good, it turned out to be not as bad as expected.The second film had far less redeeming qualities. It was graphic in its violence, surgical scenes and centipedal scenes, and very disgusting, and gratuitous. Plot was quite basic. Overall the movie was pretty bad.This, the third movie, is even worse than the second. Concept is even more gross than the first two movies and the movie is quite graphic. Plot is close to non-existent - things just lurch from one random scene to the next, with the only plot aim being the creation of the centipede.So, far incredibly bad. However, taking the movie to new heights (or its it depths?) of craptacularity is the performance of Dieter Laser as Bill Boss. I have not seen a worse performance in the history of cinema, or anything (and I've seen Kristen Stewart \"act\"). His \"acting\" consists entirely of shouting and massively overacting. Yes, some of this is the director's fault, but there is a limit. Even insane people do not act that deranged.Awful beyond belief.",

            "content": "'THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE III (FINAL SEQUENCE)': Zero Stars (Out of Five) The third (and supposedly final) chapter in writer/director Tom Six's notoriously famous body horror flick trilogy (dating back to 2009). It has both the lead actors from the previous films (Dieter Laser and Laurence R. Harvey) playing different leading roles in this installment. The movie also features supporting turns from Eric Roberts, Tommy 'Tiny' Lister, Bree Olson and Robert LaSardo. The story deals with an insane (and very sadistic) warden, that decides to turn his entire 500 inmate prison population, into a human centipede. The idea for the madness comes from his accountant; who was inspired with the idea, by watching the first two films (obsessively). The movie has been severely panned by critics, and movie watchers alike; it has a 9% positive rottentomatoes critic score (with an average rating of 1 out of 10) and an average IMDb user rating of 3.5 out of 10! I admire movies that push creative limits; but this film is far too offensive, to give it any real credit. Bill Boss is a racist, sexist and completely insane prison warden (Laser); who's constantly trying to gain respect from the inmates, he watches over. He tries several different sadistic techniques, to beat the prisoners into submission (including castrating one, and disfiguring another, by water-boarding him with boiling water). When his job is threatened by the governor (Roberts), his right-hand man, and prison accountant, Dwight Butler (Harvey), suggests the idea that they turn all of the prisoners into a 500 person long, human centipede. Boss sees the idea as the ultimate form of submission, and loves it. The movie is about as vulgar, crude, disgusting and offensive as a film can get! I saw both previous installments, which I gave both zero star ratings to, and although this installment isn't quite as dark, and gory, as the others; it's still even more disgusting and tasteless. Like the other films, in the trilogy, it's one that will always stay with me, in a very haunting and disturbing way. I respect filmmakers that try to push the boundaries, of what's acceptable and normal, but these films are far too immoral to give the writer/director (Tom Six) any credit for. The only purpose any of these movies have, is to get an uncomfortable physical reaction from the viewer; there's nothing intellectual about them at all (no hidden meaning). I wish I could like these films, and admire them for being so bold, but I can't. 'THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE III (FINAL SEQUENCE)', like the other two chapters, is one of the worst movies I've ever seen!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/vvaTQ0fcFUQ",

Both were enjoyable and very different films.Being the third film in this series I expected something different yet again. What I didn't expect was one of the worst horror/comedies I've ever seen. This film had none of the charm of the first two films. It looked like it was shot on a poor digital camera, the acting was absolutely atrocious (now I understand why Dwight was mute in the second film.. dude cannot act) and the story was just about a dull as anything I've seen.I'm saddened that such an interesting series ends with a whimper, not a bang.I'm looking forward to the next Tom Six film nonetheless.

This movie honestly takes the cake.I felt the first in the series had some really twisted ideas, it wasn't brilliant but it was OK. And then I felt the second film was a really well made horror film, it was stylish, twisted and most importantly truly sickening. One of my favorite parts was the only part in color - the brown sh-t. I was eagerly awaiting the third film in the series. How let down was I!I am so glad the copy I watched had English subtitles as the German lead, Dieter Lasar, (playing a Texan) was truly awful. If there were no subtitles I would have had no idea what he was saying. Most of the movie is this absolutely awful actor ranting and raving at the top of his lungs in what can only be described as the worst dialogue I've ever heard. The rest of the cast is actually pretty good (Laurence Harvey and Bree Olsen particularly, even Eric Roberts is likable). Unfortunately Lasar completely sinks the ship.Now if you think I'm lying about his ranting and raving going on for what seems like forever, you don't actually see the \"centipede\" until 86 minutes into the movie, that's right, 86 minutes in! And then its only for a brief few minutes!The \"film\" (?) lacks any real gore, other than an early castration scene that's fun. Other than that its pretty tame... And boring. And to top it off we have the director, Tom Six, making an unwanted appearance as himself (Tom your not that famous) with characters asking for his signature! I really am shocked at how much of a dud this one was. I gave this film a 2 out of 10 and honestly, that's generous.",

Harvey banding together as a new villainous duo aspiring to connect over 500 human bodies together.Do any of you remember my review of The Human Centipede 2 where I said I'm not going to watch the other one just because I was that grossed out and angry at the time, and I also didn't know they were making a third movie at the time of that review. I just found out a couple of days about this movie and how it was the final which I had the thought of \"Oh god I'm going to watch no matter what I'm I\", and I sure did. I know some of you are thinking \"Matt why on earth would you watch this movie since you hated the last two movies and what are expecting from this disgusting film series\". I know I should know better and I originally had no plans on seeing this one since I still think the second movie is the worst horror movie ever made, but since I already seen and review the first and second movie I thought to myself \"Why not finish this horrible franchise of torture porn\". These no surprise this movie sucked big time but what really surprise me is how boring the movie is.I hate the fact that this movie is self aware of the others movies as the character's watch and talk about them and how they look like them even when it's the same actor. The other thing that really grinds my gears while watching this movie is how the character's treat the movie director Tom Six (Yes he's in this movie playing himself) like a god to film making, even when he's not and he's just another Eli Roth clone.Dieter Laser makes a return in this movie and his acting in this movie is so over the top crewing up the scenery that it got to the point that it annoyed the crap out. His character in the movie is so annoying I mean oh my god although the movie he never stops yelling and he was being a total tool to everyone around him. I mean every scene this guy is on he's always screaming, knocking things over and yelling on the top of his lungs and it really got on my nerves to the point were I turned down the volume just to enjoy the silence.The whole movie is deep inside and out ugly just ugliness. Everybody in this movie is awful human being and how this movie treats women is unspeakably awful.Now Human Centipede 3 isn't as horrid or disgusting as the second movie I mean I almost throw up watching that movie. Yeah you get your graphic and gory violence in this one, but this time I didn't feel the need to throw up and take a shower every minute like the second made me do.Overall The Human Centipede 3 is a dull mindless Peace of sh*t gory feast that only sick in the head people would find enjoyment.",

            "content": "How many franchises can you say managed to realize their potential and hit the nail on the head with their third and, in this case, final film? The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence) is the only example I can think of, as it works off of two contemptible predecessors that did nothing but squander such a grotesque but devilishly intriguing premise. While the first film ran out of gas after about thirty minutes, and the second, despite attractive, saturated black and white cinematography, found itself nothing more than a tired array of vignettes bearing shock value, the third film takes a more slowburn, structured approach to the concept of a human centipede. It relies on character development, commentary, and a cross between the disgusting and the humorous to make a film that exploits its concept for just about the last ounce of energy its able to muster before we conclude one of film's most perplexing trilogies.Opening by showing the end credits to The Human Centipede II, in a manner to how that film opened, we find ourselves inside a prison complex run by Bill Boss (Dieter Laser). Boss is a loud, domineering, and unbelievably miserable guard, demanding respect from his inmates who, in turn, return nothing but the same hatred he shows to them. Alongside Boss is Dwight Butler (Laurence R. Harvey), his chubby and more level-headed accountant, who usually supplies him with the brains he's lacking, and Daisy (Bree Olson), his secretary who also serves as his sex slave.Boss spends most of his days making life a living hell for the inmates who disrespect him at every turn, and it isn't until Governor Hughes (Eric Roberts) visits the prison and orders a cleaner, more humane atmosphere does Boss realize he may need to straighten himself and the prison up. With that, Dwight, in the mix of his fascination with the first two Human Centipede films, suggests to Boss that, in order to create a less violent atmosphere and discourage crime all together, the two of them could hire surgeons to create one long, five-hundred person human centipede out of the inmates at the prison. Boss loves the idea and immediately gets to work, even going as far as hiring Tom Six, the real-life director of The Human Centipede films, to offer his own personal input.Laser gives his most intense and hilarious performance to date, going absolutely over-the-top with his role, making his \"mad doctor\" performance in the first film seem minimalistic in comparison. Laser is a force of nature in this film, constantly yelling or looking as if the veins in his skull are about to rupture, making for a performance of true power and conviction throughout the entire film. Harvey, in addition, creates another character that is interesting by his very nature, only this time, he's given more of a developed role than what was seen in the second film. Together, the two form a sick, twisted, but often very amusing, duo that impress in nearly every scene.What The Human Centipede III achieves that the previous two installments couldn't bother to muster is some resemblance of narrative order rather than capping out on senseless shock value or running their own premises dry. Six takes more of a slowburn approach to the story here, allowing us, the audience, to explore the prison environment with Boss and Dwight, and find ourselves inside an environment rather than being onlookers or observers into it. Despite numerous situations being disgusting, the film, like its predecessors, is remarkable in how grounded and professional it remains in look and feel. These films do not feel like low-budget, low-grade cheapies, but bear a distinctly clean, accomplished look that some medium/high-budget horror films can't normally achieve.But most importantly, the fact that The Human Centipede III takes story, character, and even societal commentary about the prison system and institutional punishment all into consideration makes it a more enjoyable film rather than a sick exercise in depravity. This is a film one can actually enjoy as a film rather than being mystified at the shock value behind the idea. There's more to appreciate about Six's craft and the talent of Laser and Harvey that surfaces because of the care and attention brought to the forefront here.I'm sure many who will read this review will roll their eyes in confusion and disbelief. In my opinion, that's one of the milder reactions one could have to this film and a positive review of it. But it's important to recognize the series's original roots and how it has evolved with its final installment. I've long held the belief that a good film can be made from just about any, if not all, premises under the sun and Human Centipede III only makes me affirm that belief. It came from being shock that couldn't sustain an entire film and shock value that only grew more and more tiresome when built upon continuously to something truly worth remembering and praising. The Human Centipede, with its third and final film, surpasses the stigma of its gut-turning idea and becomes a realized and convincing story; it's the definition of a series that ended just as it was getting going.Starring: Dieter Laser, Laurence R. Harvey, Bree Olson, and Eric Roberts. Directed by: Tom Six.",

            "content": "Tom Six's Human Centipede 3, though being the weakest film in the trilogy, is by no means a disappointment. Tonally it is a mess; the film can't decide whether it wants to be a comment on the justice system in America or a B movie shlock fest or a twisted 80's sitcom. Where the first two films were stylistically consistent; the first a cliche 2000's horror movie and the second a black and white shock fest, this film never seems to find its feet. The comedy rarely lands, the lighting choicing creates a strange cheesy tone and the dialogue see saws from entertainingly bad to just bad. The performances vary in quality also. Dieter Laser as Warden Bill Boss, screams and yells his way through the film to the point where it becomes annoying; starting somewhat entertaining and eventually he just becomes a headache. Not only chewing his way through dried clitoruses, but every scene he is in. These movies arent about subtilty and nuance but the character work here is simply poor. He lacks the intensity and sinister demeanor of which he so brilliantly portrayed in the first film. Laurence R. Harvey on the other hand is a scene stealing charm as Bill's accountant Dwight Butler. Though the accent comes and goes, the characters twisted mindset is so subtly undermined by Harvey's fantastic portrayal of a man struggling to balance keeping his job whilst pleasing his sadistic boss. The less said about Bree Olson's Daisy, the better. As for the infamous human centipede itself, the concept falls horrifically flat, the idea itself is brilliant however the execution, less so. The titular \"creature\" does not show up until very late in the film and is rather underwhelming when it eventually rears its ugly head. The human Caterpillar on the other hand was chillingly cruel. What saves this film is its sheer vulgarity and reliance on shock factor. A brutally graphic castration, a scolding water boarding session, a kidney rape and the amount of blood shed are sadistically entertaining. Never holding back, the gore and shock comes from all angles and, although somewhat corny, always made me squirm and laugh all at the same time.\nIn short, if you go into this film knowing it is going to be a poorly written, poorly acted, blood orgy and you are just along for the ride, you will enjoy this 100 minute mess of a movie.",

He was perfect in the 1st one as a mad German doctor. That worked fine, but not in this movie. He and the circumstances just don't match. Also he is neurotic through the ENTIRE movie. He screams and yells and curses everybody from beginning to end. He shoots holes in the ceiling and walls of his prison, as well as the prisoners and even his own assistant. What kind of government would appoint someone as insane as he is to the position of a prison warden? HE is DANGEROUS, for gods sake...also that chick that plays his secretary would NOT - in real life - DRESS like she does....she looks like a porn star! This movie is just too ridiculous to be taken seriously. I didn't much appreciate Tom Six using this movie as an attempt to make a \"movie star\" out of himself either. Tom Six claims that this movie is the sickest one yet. I totally disagree. The special effects are not nearly as graphic and disturbing in this movie as they were in part 2. While I am on the subject of part 2, I might point out too, that part 2 was just as ridiculous as this movie. 1., the movie was shot in black and white (in this day and age of HD why would anybody want to revert to b/w?), 2. The star of the show never said ONE WORD in the entire movie, 3. The star of the show wasn't even a DOCTOR. He was a damn parking garage attendant. What did he know about making a human centipede? He used common kitchen utensils and a STAPLE GUN, for gods sake. There is NO WAY a staple gun would hold human tissue together, the way he was using it. A totally STUPID idea. The movie was made purely for shock value, as, otherwise, it made no real sense.",

If you want gore, watch martyrs, Salo , a Serbian film, etc. They have accomplished this in a much more refined, intelligent and coherent manor with a plot that stands on its own.If you want gross out camp, watch any of Waters films.In closing, I can't really say outside of boredom and curiosity that there is a reason to watch this. Although, if their aim was to create a movie you would never recommend to anyone, well, they've hit their mark.Edit: For those wondering, I actually liked both predecessors, with the sequel being my favorite.

            "content": "The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence) (2015)* 1/2 (out of 4)Sadistic warden Bill Boss (Dieter Laser) and his assistant (Laurence Harvey) are under pressure from the Governor (Eric Roberts) who is wanting some changes done. The warden continues to physically abuse the prisoners, which is leading to higher medical costs so the assistant comes up with a plan to build a 500 man human centipede.THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE III (FINAL SEQUENCE) is without question the sickest movie in the trilogy but at the same time it's also the worst for a number of reasons. Tom Six's trilogy has certainly gone down in history as one of the most notorious ever made but there's no question its bad taste has many most people sick without even seeing the films. This third one got released to a storm of hatred from people who seemed to really want to crucify the director and those involve with the production.I'm really not sure why the series drew so much hatred because it's basically just an exploitation movie that built enough buzz to where it got itself known and watched. So, what's so wrong with this third movie? The biggest problem is the fact that it's just rather annoying. This is certainly true because of the lead character and the non-stop, over-the-top screaming from Laser. He's obviously just delivering the type of performance that was asked of him but it's extremely annoying to the point where you're hoping he'll just shut up. The idea of having the two mad men from the first two films working together was fun as was the cameo from the director and of course seeing someone like Roberts here. It just doesn't add up or help the movie.Another major problem is that the film simply runs way too long. At 102 minutes this is the longest of the series but there are just so many boring scenes where you just sit there seeing a bunch of bad scenes that don't add up to much. Of course, the reason people are going to be watching this is for the gore and it certainly delivers there. The film offers up some rather graphic scenes of violence including one disgusting incident with testicles. THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE III (FINAL SEQUENCE) is a bad movie that only has the gore going for it.",

            "content": "Oh, Tom Six. How I admire you. For all of the grief people give you over your films, it cannot be denied that you have a drive and ambition, and have been instrumental in bringing body-horror one of its most unique franchises of recent time.And I certainly cannot speak ill of the man's talents. The first two films in his infamous \"Human Centipede\" trilogy are oddly and undeniably solid pieces of cinema, with good, competent direction, wonderful visuals and even some great self-aware meta-humor. (I particularly admire the second film, which I find to be a tragically underrated and misunderstood piece of pitch-black satire.)But unfortunately, it appears Icarus may have flown too close to the sun during this third outing, as \"Human Centipede III (Final Sequence)\" suffers a slew of issues and problems that hold it back as not only the worst film of the trilogy, but also one of the most disappointing horror and comedy films of recent memory. It's honestly surprising how much of a step-down the film is.The film follows prison warden Bill Boss and his assistant Dwight Butler (played respectively by Dieter Laser and Laurence R. Harvey, who both portrayed villains in the previous films). Boss is a violent, depraved, cannibalistic nutcase who believe extreme violence and torture are the only things that can keep his prison under control (just wait till you see what he eats for lunch!), while Dwight is a meek man forced to go along with all of his schemes. However, upon seeing the first two \"Human Centipede\" films on DVD, Dwight hatches a plan to control the inmates- put them all into one of the titular \"Human Centipedes\" (Which connect multiple people via a seamless digestive system by connecting the mouth of one to the anus of another) to make them easier to control, and make them the ultimate deterrent to those who would otherwise consider a life of crime. While this is indeed an interesting-enough set-up for a climactic and insane finale, the fact is, the film crumbles under it's own desire to be depraved and up-the-stakes presented in the first two films, all while also trying to do something new. The film reaches too far and stretches itself thin from the first moment to the anti-climactic finale. (Don't worry, I won't spoil anything, but I will say fans of the first two films will likely be let down by the final 15 minutes.) Actors over-act madly, gore is thrown in by the bucket-full, language goes full-bore into nonstop profanity, the \"ick\" factor is piled on with taboo after taboo being broken... yet it feels so vapid because it's so far over-the-top it can no longer be identified as either horror or comedy. And as a result, the film becomes too cartoonish (and thus feels shockingly tame in comparison to the previous two) to be taken seriously in any way. Even as a self-parodying comedy, which its clearly striving to be, it's too much.Particularly Dieter Laser... Good lord, Dieter. You were the best thing in the first film, yet in this third entry, you single handedly destroy the entire film with your scenery chewing. Laser's Bill Boss is the \"Jar Jar Binks\" of horror- a cartoon that wouldn't appeal to anyone over the age of 5 due to nonstop \"silly antics.\"Really, the only good things about this film to me were a humorous cameo by director Tom Six himself, and one brilliant joke revolving around whether or not the concept of a human centipede would violate a doctor's Hippocratic oath.I'm really disappointed by this film. I enjoyed the first and adored the second. And I do admire the intent behind this third film- bringing the series even further into the realm of broad, perverse, satirical comedy. It just doesn't work because it doesn't know when to slow down or stop.I give it a 3 out of 10.",

Don't even get me started on the forced, fake American accent the accountant put on throughout this shocking excuse for a film. Seriously, what was all that about? I like gore in a movie. I do. I am a horror movie addict, but even the scenes of torture were not even scary. Maybe I'm just desensitized now, but I just found the first 'Human Centipede' to be much sicker.

Human Centipede III (Final Sequence) - Fecking hilarious (if you're twisted)From the messed up mind of Tom Six comes the final chapter in his Bodyshock trilogy, The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence) and it goes out on a bittersweet high note.HCIII (Human Centipede III) has taken a left turn to its canonical prequels, this time being much more comedic in overall tone. Set in an American prison, and (bizarrely) starring Dieter Laser (the antagonist from HC First Sequence) and Laurence R. Harvey (the antagonist from HC Full Sequence.) I say 'Bizarrely' as the actors are playing two completely unrelated characters. Also to note, like in the preceding movie, The previous HC films (including the DVD cases) are used as plot devices and referred to as acts of fiction.BASIC PLOT Warden Bill Boss (Laser) is a man just over the edge of sanity who is unable to rehabilitate his prisoners. Shadowed by Boss is Dwight Butler (Harvey) who's job is to reduce the costs of government spending. Under pressure by Governor Hughes (Played surprisingly by Eric Roberts) Boss is ordered to get the prison up-to standard or else face being fired. Boss, a severely unhinged man from the start, becomes more and more frustrated and completely loses grasp of reality. Boss' frustration leads him to begin maiming inmates in hope of rehabilitating them, these acts include :- melting an inmates face with boiling water. Castrating and eating an Inmates testicles. Snapping the masturbating arm of Tommy 'Tiny' Lister (Twice) all to no avail. Becoming concerned that Boss is creating too much medical expenditure, Butler suggests an alternative method of Rehab......One he saw in a certain movie.From this point on, I think you can guess whats going to happen but, surprisingly, in its own twisted way, it kinda makes sense. Inmates are unable to runaway, unable to talk back, it will save the state a great sum of money in food and also (not mentioned) save money on plumbing and waste disposal....think about it.CAST It's great watching Lasers' psychotic overacting although his sustained yelling gets rather grating after a while. Harvey should have just kept mute...seriously...the fake (Texan?) accent he dons is beyond awful. Casting Bree Olsen, yes the Porn Star, as your female lead should also give you idea of how badly acted HCIII is. You can tell Tommy 'Tiny' Lister is having so much fun on set and Eric Roberts is just Eric Roberts in everything he does. Tom Six makes a cameo as a consultant for the creation of a real Human Centipede (nice 4th wall touch) The rest of the cast just serve as unused gore fodder.BAD POINTS HCIII takes SO LONG to get going, there is surprisingly a small amount of gore in this movie, as most of it is suggested e.g. Bill Boss has a jar of dried clitoris' he likes to munch on. Its also very loud, you just wish Boss would shut the f$ck up sometimes. A large portion of the acting is just dreadful. Not necessarily a bad point, but its confusing to see actors who have appeared in previous HC movies return as unrelated characters, e.g. Dr. Sebring from HCII. The last bad point is that the cover art for the film gives away just how big this centipede is going to be.GOOD POINTS Hidden in there somewhere, there IS actually a narrative. There gore effects are well done and never seem too unreal. Despite his constant yelling, Dieter Laser is so much fun to watch. It acknowledges genuine problems with creating a Human Centipede and introduces the Human Caterpillar.OVERALL This is still a pretty bad movie. Tom Six announced this was going to be the 'Sickest' of all his movies.....I think that title goes to HCII Full Sequence. I like that all three movies have their own individual style, the first having a clean stylish look. The second having a cold black and white look and HCIII having a bleached heat look. I think it would have been great to this movie have a low-budget Grindhouse look.If your a gore-whore and like schlock horror, check it out. Six has put some great black comedy in this film unlike HCII (which you gain nothing from watching)FOOTNOTE If he makes a Human Caterpillar movie...I'll check that one out too.",

Okay, so it wasn't Shakespeare, but then it wasn't meant to be, was it? It was meant to push the boundaries and generally gross us out. And it did just that. So I classed it as a success. And so did the public in general, as it spawned a sequel. Granted the next instalment took a very different path, but I enjoyed that one too (to my shame).Therefore, I was always going to give the third one a crack. And, from the start I was actually quite impressed\u0085 the film chose to reunite the (wonderfully creepy) stars of the previous two films and put them together on screen. How could this film possibly fail? It did.It was rubbish. I'm sorry. I know I should try to back my opinions up a little more eloquently than that, but I really can't think of anything else to say. I was so disappointed. If you've seen the first film (and if you're considering watching a story about human test subjects being sewn together in the most disgusting way imaginable I suggest you start there) then you'll know the lead was the evil German doctor. Like I said, he's back here (only as a new character) and yet all he does is shout. Loudly. Rinse and repeat. In fact, he shouts so damn loudly that I could barely hear what he's shouting about due to his accent. It seems that he's been told to act like a lunatic and he does just that. Unfortunately, it's too over the top to be believable and it totally ruins the whole film. Well, that's the start of 'Part III's' ruination.Then there's the gore. Or should I say 'lack of it?' Seriously, these film's selling points are that they gross you out. Most of us who invest our time into them are happy that there won't be a gripping and thought-provoking story with deep and emotional character development. We just want sickness. And we don't get it from Part III. It's just more of the same, only less graphic. We've seen it all before in the past two instalments and we've therefore seen it done better.If you're as weird as me in that you actually enjoy watching films like this, stick to the first two. Ignore this one. It really is pretty bad. Or watch Kevin Smith's 'Tusk.' Even that was better and at least had some snappy dialogue added to the mix.Part III = avoid.",

If you have a twisted sense of humor this movie is going to have you rolling on the floor laughing. It was literally one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I just couldn't stop laughing: The whole movie was basically a succession of clever jokes that were occasionally interrupted by a couple of nasty and gross torture scenes. Conclusion: this movie isn't really part of the continuity that the first two movies shared but rather a movie that's supposed to be a grand finale.The first movie was pretty much a thriller and had you rooting for the people who fell victim to Dr. Heiter's insane experiment. The sequel was just messed up and featured mental abuse as well as self- mutilation. All in one it was very disgusting on all levels possible. The third installment of the franchise however is in my opinion a well thought out comedic take on the prequels. Furthermore Tom Six (the director) had a cameo appearance which made for some good meta- jokes. Something that is rarely seen on screen these days. It suffices to say that I liked it very much.

I am a huge fan of the first two parts, just because the psychological analysis of a serial killer is something that makes for a really good splatter and horror movie.But this movie is different, the movie starts with the actors of Dr. Heiter and Martin, which was odd but I kinda liked the idea. The movie however then started to taper off really quickly. You can tell from the get-go that Tom Six just ran out of ideas, he just wants to show offensive violence for the sake of offensive violence. You can most easily compare this to a child not being obedient and doing something bad just to get attention from his parents. This is exactly what this movie feels like, there is no hidden message in this one that made me watch the movie twice (or fully even once for that matter) just because of the way how dull and stock this movie is.The main character is merely an over-exaggerated clich\u00e9-psycho which does not fit into the human centipede series at all. Dieter Laser was a whole lot better in the role as Dr. Heiter, it was just suited for him. He was a somewhat introverted, deranged psycho-doctor, which was great. He fitted perfectly into his old role, this just looks like a brute-forced attempt to plaster a new, completely unauthentic image onto him which has him feeling like: \"Hey, I do this, because it looks weird, this is how the average person would describe a psycho, I am so original right now, please give me attention, I am such a psycho\".Making him a prison-warden does not fit him, half of the time you can't even understand him properly through all the tirades and conniptions of futile and pointless yelling with which he tries to convince the audience of his authenticity as a clumsy cartoon psycho. The only thing he will convince you of though is that he is NOT suited for this role and that you can even give bloody \"Toy Story\" more credit for it's realism and authenticity.The only impressive thing about this entire movie is Laurence R. Harvey, after the second Human Centipede movie I just really came to realize what a great actor he actually is. His role in the old movie was so fitting for him, in this one he almost seems like a new person, just an incredibly good actor. That's about the only upside this movie has. Poor, Tom Six, really, REALLY poor. And I was a fan of the series. Couldn't even get to the actual \"Centipede\"-part, since this movie bored and grossed the living hell out of me. Not because of the splatter but because of what they did to this otherwise incredibly good series of movies. In other words: The only really cruel thing that happens in this movie is that all the work and reputation Tom Six built himself up is getting splattered through this one blight in an otherwise great movie history.Don't watch this if you are a fan of the series, seriously, you will just pull down your own opinion about the entire sequels.",

            "content": "I've been here since IMDb was born, but just registered to show my appreciation and counter the hate for this movie.I watched the previous two, because I LOVE Horror movies, although these fit more into the SAW/Hostel Kinda gory stuff genre, without a story or anything, just a truly disgusting idea put to screen by Tom Six, none the less, while not good movies on their own, I enjoyed them as this was a first for movies anywhere and everywhere to go there, and i enjoyed the coldness of Dieter and the sickness of the 2nd guy, even though I found myself looking away at the ultra gory stuff.After taking so much heat for the first two films, especially for mentioning they are \"medically accurate\", Tom Six is just having a blast with this one, This is more like a South Park episode or a story line. Tom six is completely self aware, and crapping on the continuity of the first two films; He cast Dieter Laser and The 2nd guy as totally new characters, with nothing to do with their previous selves, and they even watch the 1st and 2nd movies! logically they should be either the actors in the previous movies if they were fiction, or the same two guys from the movies if they were real, somehow survived and got together under hidden identities... well it's not! Completely different characters, running a prison, that seems out of the reach of any authority. Tom Six doing this is a brave move and a satirical response to all critics that it's a movie, not to be taken seriously, or as seriously as some reviewers and critics took the 1st and 2nd film.The overacting of Dieter Laser as a hateful, racist German warden in an American Prison, with an unmatched anger problem, is simply wonderful and hilarious, and the way the whole prison, inmates and employees, react to him is magnificent, the dialogue is very funny and serious and the way it is delivered by all characters terrifically, in a nonsensical, awesome B movie style.In the first 30-40 minutes it was like watching a Tarantino movie, because this movie is SOOO self aware of its B-movieness and nonsense, that it hides it so well, among the magnificent, silly, inconceivable plot. It has the soul of the 1980 Flash Gordon, but funnier and less cheesy.Even Tom Six shows up, and he disgusted by everything he sees, and yes he is aware him being in the film might be mistaken as a chance to redeem himself and answer critics for the first two movies, but it is not, he is just there just to serve the plot purpose.Forget about the first two movies or the plot or disgust, if you want to enjoy this movie more, watch the first two just to see what the hell is going on so you relate to the actors and how Tom Six spins the whole thing into a whole new concept. Other than a couple of disgusting scenes, this is by no way as gory as the first two filmsI am a huge fan of B movies, and have watched and laughed to countless ones, they are best watched with friends, a lot of people don't get the B movie thing, and this is ONE OF THE BEST/FUNNIEST B MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN - Highly recommended for anyone with a sense of humour or a b-movie goer.",

It's one thing to voice an opinion that is not popular, it is another thing to combine rape and feces fetish into one movie and pretend that repulsion to those things is just a matter of political correctness.

Now if those jokes make you laugh, you might be onto something. Unfortunately even in being \"funny\", this misses out on character traits. Why would the boss act like he doesn't like Human Centipede when he is exactly the same character like the one we are seeing in the movies? So while this is a movie within a movie within a movie - it is rather juvenille than clever.The director is a funny bloke and Dieter Laser is channeling him or his reactions to critics of his movies. Whatever the case, he relishes in everything thrown in his way, so me rating this 1/10 makes him happier than if I had gone 4 or 5. You're welcome Mr. Six! A nod to another critic (Ebert with a non score for the first Centipede, not the only movie that did not receive a rating by the way) is also part of the movie.So again, you may find certain things funny (and he is inventive, if rather explicit and vile), but overall this never really does anything other than try to provoke the strongest possible reaction (laughing out loud or feeling the puke running through your veins). The casting is quite nicely - with quite a few familiar faces",

            "content": "I must admit that I had some great reservations about sitting down to watch \"The Human Centipede III: Final Sequence\", especially since the first movie was mediocre and the second movie was even less entertaining than the first movie. So the third - and hopefully last - installment in the franchise didn't exactly have the cards dealt to it in its favor.The cast in \"The Human Centipede III: Final Sequence\" was of somewhat a mixed handful. It was so bizarre to see cast from the first two movies in the franchise return to the movie, but in different roles. That just made for some very confusing associations. And Dieter Laser had a very peculiar way of acting and performing which seems comical and so out of tune, which added a distracting element to the atmosphere of the movie. Much of the time it was like watching a spoiled child trying to lash out in frustration and anger. Actually, it was very disruptive to the rest of the movie, because it was hard to take him serious in the movie. And just how they got the likes of Eric Roberts and Robert LaSardo to show up in a movie such as this was just beyond me.At least the dialogue was very much in tune with the rest of the movie, being every bit as forced, ridiculous and weird. Most of it didn't really make much sense, and it didn't really help that most of it was delivered by a whacked out Dieter Laser. It should be said that there is some pretty hefty racial slurs, profane language and such being used in this movie, so do take that into consideration if you are easily offended by such foul language.The characters were entirely weird and offbeat, especially most of the inmates in the prison. I mean, their behavior was just so strange that it would happen only in the movies.There are some very graphic stuff taking place in the movie, and that might be upsetting to some viewers. But then again, going into watching a movie such as this, then you know what you are getting yourself into, of course. I am a seasoned horror and gore veteran, but even I was finding myself cringing at some of the scenes portrayed in this movie.Now, I don't really understand the idea or concept of putting the actual DVDs of the former two movies into this third movie. Sure, I get it that it was to present the idea that the events in this movie was based on the events taking place in those movies. But come on, that was just unfathomably cheesy, even for this franchise.It was clear already in the second movie that director and writer Tom Six should have stopped with the completion of the first movie, because it has been a steady decline down a steep hill since then. And \"The Human Centipede III: Final Sequence\" didn't prove to improve on the franchise in any particular way.This 2015 third installment into \"The Human Centipede\" franchise had a few moments of cringe-worthy visuals, but it was hardly a movie that stood apart from the previous two, and it didn't bring much of anything new to the franchise.I have seen it now, and color me unimpressed.",

Even though I find them repugnant films, they had a certain audacity and a level of super B movie atmosphere. They were certainly original. Human Centipede 3 makes the other 2 films look like masterpieces.Human Centipede 3 is probably the worst 100 minutes I have spent watching a film in a very long time. This film's tone is more satirical. But it is not sharp or funny to make it interesting let alone disturbing. I had felt with the 1st 2 films that Tom Six was just a filmmaker out to shock and disgust his audience. And he did, but he did show some talent for suspense and black comedy. Human Centipede 3 is such a terrible, boring, repugnant film that any notoriety of the others.The story of this one takes place in the US in a Texas prison. A warden played by Dieter Laser named Bill Boss. Yes, he played the maniacal but funny Dr. Heiter in the first film. That performance was really over the top but effective, memorable. This performance is even more over the top but absolutely horrific. He plays Bill Boss as a crazy, cruel warden but for laughs. I didn't laugh once. Also, Lawrence Harvey who played Martin in the second one is back as Dwight Butler, assistant to the warden. Again, his performance in the second film was really disturbing and weird. He had no dialogue but it was effective. Here he is also going for comedy here even rocking a Hitler mustache. Just terrible. The whole film is about how cruel the warden is to the prisoners. We see all sorts of torture and violence even before the human centipede is seen. It is not shocking, it's just a filmmaker having nothing else to do but daring you to watch, nothing more. Like in HC 2, the other films exist. Butler shows Bill the films and wants to get him to agree to attempt to make a human centipede using the prisoners. He resists at first, but in the end he agrees. We don't see the centipede until the last 20 minutes of the film and it is just anti climactic. Of course it is gross and violent seeing it being put together but what came before was so annoying and slow that it didn't really matter. Tom Six even appears as himself and is so bad that he makes Quentin Tarantino look like Robert De Niro. I get that he thinks that this self awareness is clever but it just added runtime to a film that was already a chore to get through.I think Tom Six made the other 2 trying to dare the audience to look at how far he would go to disgust them.i think this film was Six daring the audience to sit through a completely aweful film for 80 minutes and then tack on the human centipede because that is the title of the film. I didn't see any of these films in a theater. If I would have paid a cent to see Human Centipede 3 I would have felt totally robbed.Just Aweful.Grade: F",

I must admit to being a fan of the films and enjoyed the first two very much. Part 3 is the final part in the Centipede trilogy. Like the second film it is connected only by the human centipede theme. Very much in the style of a human centipede itself. Each 'segment' is unique but linked together with the other parts. Part 3 is brash, over-the-top, crazy, ludicrous, revolting and hilarious in equal measure. It's probably the most humorous of all the films with the dark comedy mixed in with almost theatrical farce. The film is a parody of itself with Tom Six giving the middle finger to those all thought the topic and subject matter of 1 and 2 was objectionable and 'should be banned'!Possibly the best thing about Part 3 is the performance of Dieter Laser from the first movie. His portrayal of psychotic prison warden Bill Boss is quite something. Almost exhausting to watch but gloriously offensive.Chances are that you won't see anything quite this crazy on film for some time. Granted, it's not going to be to everyone's taste. I think you have to 'get' the humour of Tom Six to enjoy it but if you have seen the first two and enjoyed them then this is a must see.",

Its as if the guys who dreamed up this jewel had moved to Colorado and had spent all their time getting high which has obviously broken their minds completely. To call it crap is to be way too nice-I don't think anyone has ever made such a bad movie in the entire history of cinematography. Its absolutely disgusting. The plot of the film revolves around how the entire population of a small maximum security prison are basically killed by the warden-a bad man played so badly it was like really watching a madman at the controls. Films like this one should not be shown anywhere, especially in the current climate of pop up violence that has frequently happened in relationship to cinemas. I wonder if this film or something like it was playing in the cinemas that were part of the recent spate of cinema shootings in America. This film is dangerous.

The sequel had its moments, much of the inspiration had gone but the casting of Laurence Harvey was good. I like the black and white but it appeared Tom was beginning to run out of ideas and simply riding off the first movie.Then comes this repugnant amateurish pile. Where to start with its problems? The acting is beyond terrible, the dialogue even worse, you cannot make out what Dieter Laser is saying most of the time which is surprising since he shouts almost every single line. Laurence Harvey worked well in the second movie but not in this one, he is not a good actor and his attempt at an American accent is laughable. Bree Olson is what she is, a porn actress trying to get into mainstream, I kinda feel sorry for her as she is extremely ill treated throughout the film and Eric Roberts chews the scenery like never before despite his brief appearance. One or two of the inmates do OK but in general the acting is as bad as you could ever see. Not a stellar cast by any chance but they should be capable of more, in my opinion this is down to dreadful direction, what Tom Six was thinking when he extracted these performances I will never know. Did none of the actors or film crew take him to one side and explain how ridiculous it was? The story is incoherent and without substance but even the best storyline couldn't hope to come through with the performances as poor and over the top as they were. There are a couple of gore scenes which are decent and certainly make the eyes water, Tom Six at least maintains that.It is a shame that this franchise has ended so weakly. I hope it isn't the end of Toms career but he needs to prove he isn't just a one sick trick pony. However, one thing is certain, I will remember Dieter Laser for the most ridiculous, over the top performance of all time.",

Lawerence Harvey's acting wasn't as good as his performance in the second movie, but he is still believable as a semi reluctant accomplice to Dieter Laser's character. I also enjoyed the reddish tint to the screen throughout the movie and the gore scenes.

Again, there is no real script here but a context and a cause. The context is the prison world and the cause is the madness and insanity of the guards and prison director who decide to build the \"centipede\" with hundreds of prisoners whom they think should be punished more severely. The mistakes continue, that \"medically accurate\" crap is no longer convincing and is clearly being used with sarcasm and the characters are deeply void.Repeating what I wrote for the second movie, I've never been a fan of gore movies, despite being an admirer of horror movies. Blood and fluids do not scare me, and I honestly do not feel like watching a movie if I suspect it's going to make me throw up my lunch.

His chubby assistant is a nice juxtaposition here, too. This is one of those flicks where we can't make serious commentary. We can't be offended. We can't complain how awful it is...because it transcends all that. It really goes to another level completely. Its nice to be able to just let go when watching a movie. None of it is plausible. None of it is real life. It's a big tripped out, bloodied violent mess and is very fun!If you're even remotely feminist (whatever that really means today) I would suggest not watching this because you will be very angered by what you see. The sexy office secretary is basically beat and raped through the whole movie and, well, she doesn't escape. Speaking of rape, there is an acute gay erotica quality here that is very quite refreshing, particularly between the warden and the attractive man with the tattoos on his neck. Not to mention the endless ass to mouth stuff. So watch this movie! Especially if you are a dirtball freak scumbag like myself. Invite your friends over, make some popcorn (but I suggest nothing with pasta sauce or mushrooms...you'll thank me later) and laugh your asses off. If you have sensitive friends or if your Mom's home, make sure they are in the other room. It's just one of those kind of movies.

There numerous scenes where he was seemingly making random noises rather than acting out a script. Bill Boss is definitely up there with the worst movie characters of all time.Laurence Harvey was dreadful. I thought he put in a really good performance in the Human Centipede 2 so I'm not sure what happened here. Bad Day at the Office? Perhaps, but this is one film he'll want to forget he appeared in. Bree Olson - who until watching the Human Centipede 3 I had never heard of her - probably puts in the best performance. Make of this what you want.The plot? Nothing really happens until around the hour mark and there is very little screen time for the human centipede itself. The majority of the gore serves no purpose other than to repeatedly re-enforce that no other form of punishment controls the prisoners; by the time the human centipede is introduced you won't really care anymore.In short this is hands down the worst film I have ever seen.

Of course, the result was nowhere near as horrific as many had thought. While it may have featured a scene of characters passing faeces directly from bottom to mouth, the whole thing was rather amusing, if ineptly made. Director Tom Six was keen to ensure that the hype wouldn't die down for the sequel, and did so by creating one of the vilest and most humourless shockers in horror history, and undoubtedly one of worst excuses for a movie ever made. It's a relief that humour has found its way back for part three, as is the presence of the word 'final' in its title. But that's where the positives end, as this is yet another button-pushing, attention-seeking vanity-project for Six.Psychopathic prison warden Bill Boss (Dieter Laser) rules over his inmates with an iron fist, punishing those that step out of line by breaking bones, removing testicles, and waterboarding with boiling water. With the violence spinning out of control, Governor Hughes (Eric Roberts) pays Boss a visit, informing the maniac that if he doesn't get a hold on things soon he will be fired and replaced. Having seen his brutal methods fail to bring the prisoners under control, Boss finally listens to his diminutive accountant Butler (Laurence R. Harvey) and his problem-solving idea. Armed with DVDs of The Human Centipede 1 and 2, Butler's scheme is to force the inmates to live out their sentences arse-to-mouth with their fellow incarcerates in one long, horrifying... well, you get the idea. With disgraced, struck-off prison doctor Jones (Clayton Rohner) on board in the hope of keeping his job, Boss and Butler even bring in Tom Six himself to discuss whether or not the director's claim of the procedure being 100% medically accurate is in fact correct.It was admittedly an interesting move to make The Human Centipede 2 about a disturbed individual's reaction to seeing the first movie, but performing the same trick again simply reeks of narcissism, especially considering Six's decision to place himself within the narrative. While the second entry aimed to simply upset and disgust its audience with no trace of nuance, part three is all about the humour. Although rather than laughing, you'll be checking the running time to see how much you have left to endure. To Six, comedy is all about shouting, and Laser screams, rants and swears for the 100 minutes, stopping occasionally to munch on some dried clitorises imported from Africa or force his assistant Daisy (porn actress Bree Olson) to perform oral sex on him. Anyone voluntarily watching this film are here for one reason - to see the human centipede. It appears around the 85 minute mark, so there's a lot of arm-waving and general unpleasantness to get through before the big pay-off, which only appears on screen for about 5 minutes. I never thought I'd complain about the lack of poor souls being monstrously stitched together to form one grotesque digestive system, but that's The Human Centipede for you. Hopefully this series can now be laid to rest on the cinematic dung-pile.",

It'd been a solid 3-film centipede sharing plot, characters and one unique storyline, even if the film within a film within a film trick could be deemed a bit lazy.Despite a premise that wasn't too bad (the 'prison centipede'!), the execution was simply not good. I was bored at times, fed up with Dieter Later shouting CONSTANTLY, the comical moments were not funny, Laurence Harvey was a joke compared to the chilling monster he played in part II. The gross moments felt gross just for the sake of it; it wasn't nightmarish like in part II, but simply disgusting (I'm thinking of the 'death rape' scene...) Some scenes dragged on forever, like the one in the yard. The plot loses all sense when the Boss starts shooting people randomly and no one seems to care that much. Even for a storyline that's always been over the top, it's just doesn't hold together at all Shambles, really. Especially disappointed because I REALLY wanted to like this movie!",

            "content": "Six's third and final instalment of the centipede debacle, branded 100% politically incorrect, dishes up an expectant cacophony of corpulence and coprophagia. Sewn into the inference of its counterparts, the rearing head of the centipede trilogy gleefully satirises the judicial system in an exploitative penal perpetration that ebbs and arcs between impish lampoon or artistic gravitas. Final sequence, for all of its faults, is an ingeniously crafted film. Soaked in a self- referentiality that equates to numerous storeys of ontology, Six's penultimate feature is a delectable conflation of actualities and realities rendering the spectator so far down a rabbit hole, its a never-ending abyss. For its complete relegations of historicity and symptomatic entwinement, the film never truly admits as to who is being exploited - a notion complicated further by Tom Six's acting involvement in the feature - rather it is the 'what' being exploited. Nee, the receptive essence of film itself, an implication undeniably ratified by dialogue as actors blurt out actual trolling reviews of Six's work.The film itself is a queer arrangement. Stripped bare, its a garishly postmodern 'Frankenstein' (leads Dieter Laser and William Harvey are comically synonymous to Dr Frankenstein and Igor) with explicit repugnance its garnish. Whilst Six promised to 'go Dutch' in gruesome gratification - and seldom fails - the abhorrence of the feature is not just contained to its inextricable moments of disgust, though also its racial slurs, slander of stereotype and political ethics. Six inadvertently challenges us to interpret - and choose - as to what can be qualified and quantified as controversy - the 500 man centipede, or the reason why. As to whether the film can be conceived as a 'good' film is an other and arguably irrelevant question, because it is not intended to be evaluated in the same way as other films. Its intention is to be paradoxical, to be avant-garde, to be different - and this it does well. But, to dictate by taste, it is both caviar and cack. For some, the hysterically inclined bellowing barbarian that is Dieter Laser will annoy, for some he will ensnare in all his enunciating glory. For some the film will be ridiculous, for others influential. Some will love it. Some will hate it - and then probably hate on the people who love it into getting them to say they hate it!The purpose of Six's work, much alike Lars Von Trier, is to remonstrate. The centipedic body of texts is an intricate welding of artistry that surpasses the purpose of film to purely entertain. It is to be examined, to be visually consumed and independently contrived. One only has to consider the anti-authoritarian texts of the past to understand that the valorisation of cultural detritus - in the literal and the formal - is an art form in and of itself. Lobotomising conventional fodder, the darkly comedic and controversial 'Final Sequence' belongs to a stand-alone genre of shock ahead of its time.",

It also doesn't help that the two leads (Dieter Laser and Laurence Harvey return as new characters, because oh we're so freakin clever) are really struggling to get through this material. Laurence Harvey was actually pretty good in the second one, but he easily has the worst American accent I've ever heard. And I could barely understand Laser when he spoke slowly and with a normal voice, I sure as hell can't understand all his yelling in this one: I can't even make out when one word ends and the next one begins, let alone laugh at whatever his lines are. Oh, and the one actual clever idea Six had, the one he somehow based three movies around?

Laser's constant screaming did make it difficult to understand what he was saying, but his body language made up for it. As some have criticized, it does take a bit long to get to the sequencing, and you don't see the detail that the other films had, but by this point, since most have seen the other two films, its more the idea that's important than the execution of it.

The Acting is bad. Dialogue is awful. Writing is overall horrendous.The thing i hated the most about this film was the main-character, i could not understand a word that he was saying because every single word that came out of his mouth would be him shouting at the top of his lungs.Compared to the second film, this one is pretty tame in terms of gore/violence so don't expect it to top the second.It's a shame because it could have been a decent trilogy and would have been fun to marathon with some friends...but alas.

The lead character is loud obnoxious and racist to the point it seems as if the 4 chan neo nazi edge lords posts on the internet seem like Disney. This doesn't get any better as the film progresses and the ending is just racism again. Of course this guy wins. Imagine viewing this film through the eyes of the alt right neo nazi movement, they would be cheering him on and laughing. The character is also heavily misogynistic, even raping a woman as she's in comatose after being beaten up. There are no other attempts to flesh out his character, no biting satire. Just a nazi rambling and doing offensive stuff for the sake of it. It's like a glorification of it. Whatever subtext that pretends to be about American justice systems falls flat as it's not explored enough and the racism seems by the numbers for Hollywood Institutional racism.

            "content": "The first film in this trilogy certainly had its' share of haters and I can certainly understand. To pretend that the style of horror boasted by THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE would be for everyone would be a gross misunderstanding of people. To me, there are a few ways to make horror truly effective in a way that will capture the attention of a jaded horror fan. Naturally, the first way and, certainly, hardest is to create a truly effectively chilling horror film that sends shivers down the audience. Another way is to bathe the audience in blood and appeal to the gorehound in us. For those of us willing to walk the razor's edge, though, another way to really create a memorable film is to push the envelope and give us something we haven't seen before. I felt that the original CENTIPEDE did that quite well. Of course the whole idea of \"butt to mouth\" surgery and the creation of a human centipede would have drawn in the curious thrill seekers. The fact that I found it, also, to be a good horror movie is what make it memorable. Any two-bit hack could have made a D-grade movie with that concept that would have been worth of Troma. Tom Six, though, brought up a tensely made thriller that especially utilized the talents of a masterful villain in Dieter Laser. The combination created a twisted body horror Frankenstein for the modern horror fan. I'm not going to sit here and tell you it was a masterpiece, but it was certainly a horror movie that created something that was able to stir emotion in a horror fan, which is by no means easy to do nowadays.The first sequel to the movie really brought nothing new to the table. It felt like a rehash of the same ideas, minus the mad doctor who made the first movie so good. However, many of the things that brought down that sequel could be said of just about any sequel in the history of horror. It was just an attempt to take the same idea of make it bigger and better.This sequel is just a giant mess, though, that I found myself fighting through in an effort not to turn it off, not due to any envelope pushing revulsion, but out of sheer boredom. The biggest problem with this sequel is that it fails to do what this series made its' name upon, which is pushing the envelope. Beside one castration scene, there is nothing here that would make even a general audience squeamish. We barely even get to the centipede itself and the monstrous surgery until the final few moments of the film. Most of this film feels cartoonish and over-the-top and not in any fun way. It's just over amplified nonsense. Far too much of this movie is spent on dialog, most of it in the same office set. It started to feel far too much like a thank you to Dieter Laser for participating in the series by giving him as much screen time as possible. He screams and shouts and carries on, mostly in a dialect so thick it's hard to understand his English. That would be fine and dandy were he not supposed to be a Texas warden. I can think of hundreds of actors who would have been better suited to this role, but to bring in a guy with a strong German accent and try to pretend that he's a warden in some deep south prison makes no sense in a genre where I'm used to nothing making sense.We get cameos from a number of actors you'll recognize, such as Eric Roberts, Tiny Lister, Clayton Rohner and Robert LaSardo, but none of them are given anything to do except fill cutout caricatures that are needed for nothing more than to be a sounding board for more of Laser's screaming.Tom Six is very fond of going on social media and blasting anyone who denounces his work. After the first movie, I found myself rooting for him. After all, stomach-churning horror is not going to be for everyone, but that doesn't make it any less valuable as cinematic art. Creating something truly revolting in today's age that can make a fan still feel real horror is not easy to do. By now, though, Six deserves every bit of the poor rating that this movie has on this site and others. Tom Six, apparently, had one good idea in his film career and is willing to just keep going back to that same well until it runs bone dry.",

The actors tried hard as possible, but how great can a movie be that makes a throw back to the first two movies every four minutes. The first two movies are classics, but this one is worse than Jason X. Jason X makes fun of itself, but at least shows some decent gore. It would be better to be left in the middle of the human centipede at the end of the first one than to have to sit through this movie again.Maybe now that we watched this movie we can volunteer at a nursing home or soup kitchen, just to know own human existence is more than one disappointing Tom Six movie.",

The third installment was just crazy bad, very bad acting, clich\u00e9 Tom Six scenes, stupid rape jokes, boring and the list goes on and on.The bigger is not always the better, since the movie is so extremely over the top it is not interesting. You already know that they are going to create a 500 people centipede, so what? It is not more epic than a centipede of only a dozen people, because we have already seen the same thing 2 times in a row, just adding hundreds of people to the centipede are not going to make it more exciting.The most obnoxious thing was the warden, an extremely annoying character, just plain awful, his extended screams were just horrible, could not bear them. I get it - maybe Tom Six was trying to make his third movie to be a comedy/parody, even if that was his goal, it failed miserably, it was just boring and predictable.The only reason i rated this movie 2/10, not 1/10, was because the ending is so insanely stupid it made me laugh a little.",

The answer would definitely look like the final installment of the Human Centipede series.From highly-improbable scenarios to disappointing technical issues, Human Centipede III is a lesson on the things a movie should not do.I'm certain that HC fans were expecting the most bizarre and graphical depiction of the creation of the ultimate mouth-to-anus chimera, but practically only a glimpse of the beast was shown during the anti-climax. Same with the \"Human Caterpillar\". Probably as a black comedy this movie could work: Dieter Laser character's yelling lines were absolutely hilarious, as well as the scenes where he pushes his secretary out of the office. Also, when have you seen a Governor that looks as unkempt as the one in the movie? Even the appearance of Tom six himself was risible (remember the music that played every time he drives his Mercedes into the prison?). Conclusion: If you have watched the previous HC films and you are bored to hell, watch this. If not, well, don't bother and watch the first one.",

It does stay true to the first two films as being completely devoid of any entertainment value.This time the production quality far worse! Worse than the first two films? How bad could it really be? I'll sum up the production quality this way, it's the worst I've ever seen for a Bree Olsen film! Yeah, that's bad! I've actually heard some defense of Tom Six's film making as being \"realistic\" and \"gritty.\" NO! It's just lazy. If the director doesn't care about the camera being in focus, the set being lit, off set noises remaining on the soundtrack, or actors missing their lines and not doing a second take it's just lazy. It shows the director doesn't care and the audience will respond in kind.Dieter Laser returns in the lead as a Southern prison warden. A German actor doing a bad Southern accent fails for laughs on every level. NONE OF THE ATTEMPTED HUMOR works on any level!!! And this is 75% of the movie, Dieter Laser acting like Boss Hogg.The other 25% are attempted gross out scenes of prisoners being raped in their kidney's and the cannibalization of human testicles. True to the first two films this gore is just plain silly rather than disgusting or morbidly humorous.So what does any of this have to do with the human centipede? As the poster reveals, the warden concludes that the best way to maintain order in the prison is to create one giant human centipede. He gets his inspiration from watching.... 'The Human Centipede.' Because a movie within a movie worked so well in the second film.Hence the few brief moments of the human centipede are only seen in the climax, which you could have gotten by just looking at the poster.So if you're having any morbid curiosity of seeing this film.

What seems really saddest of all though is that he, his co-stars and director Tom Six - who makes the most self-aggrandising cameo in cinema history - seem to genuinely believe that they are making a seriously important work of art.

Of course the first two films where vile and had their fair share of shocking scenes, but this one...well this takes a whole new shape, and makes me question if Mr Six should be put in a straight jacket and thrown in the looney bin. The first film was all about a disgraced surgeon and his delusional, yet accurate, curiosities about the medical possibilities of a human centipede. The horror that followed was all in relation to that initial idea.The second was that of a fanatic and his urge to duplicate and elongate.This however, boasts racism, sexism, barbarism. It is full of torture, gushing with grotesque analogies (those i could understand)and just a film full of hatred that has clearly been clogging Mr Six's disturbed mind. Yes, many of these topics have been highlighted in countless films, but in most, they have purpose or are handled with decency. There are scenes in this film that are quite simply horrific: Rape, Castration, kidney intrusion.It's perverted and verges on being inhuman. The prisoners are stereotyped in the most blatant way, in what people will describe as an attempt at humor is just an insight into how this directors mind works.But worse than all of that, is the acting. Yes the most important part of a film. Dwight Butler (Played by \"Human Centipede II\"'s very own fanatic Laurence R Harvey) is horrific. His Texan accent is atrocious and he is made to look like a bald, bloated Hitler. He was slightly effective in the 2nd film because they played to his \"strengths\"; he was creepy and... well ....that's about it. Dieter Laser also comes back to the \"franchise\", now playing Bill Boss, the wicked warden. It is his acting that is the worst, i say again...the WORST acting i have ever seen. No exaggeration, this is abysmal. All he does is scream nonsensical, indescribable, psychobabble throughout. Be prepared to turn on the subtitles, because you'd have more chance breaking the enigma code than understanding what he is saying. I have to wonder if in the midst of twirling about acting like a complete imbecile, if he thought he was creating an acting masterpiece. Well folks, i can assure you he wasn't. As for Tom Six, well i can only hope he is committed.",

Well,not like \"Citizen Kane\" amazing LOL. I found the absence of color and no dialogue from the main character to be interesting choices for Tom six to make. It was very very graphic though and i found myself enjoying the tamer scenes of for instance Martin sitting at the dinner table as his mother verbally abuses him and finding out what made him into a psychopath as opposed to the scenes of him putting barb wire around his penis and having sex with the unfortunate girl at the end of the centipede. Anyway,I would give the 2nd film an 8/10. Now, onto the 3rd film. The film stars the 2 doctors from the previous films playing different characters. The doctor from the first film is the warden of a prison where he is struggling to maintain order. The doctor from the 2nd film proposes the idea of making a human centipede from all the prisoners to teach them a lesson. The film has sort of an exaggerated color scheme which i found to be appealing although some have complained it looked \"cheap\". I didn't find the main characters to be annoying as others did either. It was a good blend of horror gore and comedy in my opinion.",

I was a fan of the first two just because of how twisted they were, and after hearing Six say that this was going to be the most gruesome yet, I was very eager to see it. What a disappointment.I made it through the first 17 minutes before I got incredibly irritated with Dieter Laser screaming all of his lines (seriously, everyone who's said that that's all he does is not lying. he LITERALLY screams ALL of his lines) and I started to just fast- forward to all of the gore/torture/death scenes to see what was in store. huge huge letdown. They're few and far between and they're total crap. There's little to no gore and they're very under- dramatic, if you consider that a thing. In my opinion, part of a good torture/death scene is the pain and suffering of the victim and there is just none of that. These people must have botched pain receptors.This whole movie is a mess and a failure. I hate to say that because i really love Tom Six, but this should have never happened. It's like he spread the word that there would be a third movie and when it came time to start filming he was like \"damn, i really don't even feel like doing this anymore\" and he just let it go and let whatever happen. There probably wasn't even a solid script and everything was likely done in one take, whether it was satisfactory or not. Everyone involved just wanted it to be over.

Was it SUPPOSED to be so awful that it was almost unwatchable as some sort of in joke?? It's hard to know where to begin. The plot (clearly a rather clumsy satire of the U.S. Penal system as run by the likes of the notorious Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio) makes no sense, even as a comedy. The acting, by everybody concerned but particularly the 2 leads is beyond excruciating- it's painful at times to watch. Even gore hounds will be disappointed- the actual centipede seems like an afterthought, not appearing until 10 minutes before the close, and the occasional disgusting moments (a castration, colostomy bag being ripped out etc) utterly fail in their attempts to shock- quite simply because the film's badness is more shocking than anything that could possibly be put on screen. Is it worth seeing as a curiosity, to see how a movie COULD be this bad? Possibly, for the first few minutes, but then boredom quickly sets in- this isn't one of those films that's so bad it's funny.

If you loved the first movie, you will most likely watch this and ask yourself \"Why?\" Not why you watched it, but more why they even made it. The trilogy started its decline with the second film. The first one was fun, had an interesting idea, and was pretty well executed; the second one went in a completely different way, leaving the intellect out of it and going with a straight up gore-fest. Take it for what it is and it could be a fun film, if you're into that sort of thing. With the final sequence we see the return of both main actors from the previous films. Lawrence Harvey is a lot easier to look at this time around, and out of the two I found his obviously put on accent more realistic. His character was actually kind of fun, and I thought he put on the best performance in the film. Dieter Laser has an American accent for about the first half, and then somewhere around the middle he just drops it, probably as he got more and more into his insane character. He still has that creepy, strangely disproportionate face and smile of his, and his character is not only evil but disgusting as well. Behind the over the top scenes, characters, and direction, there is a story there. Even though the centipede makes its debut towards the very end of the film, the story leading to it makes sense in some strange way. The gore is few and in between, but the scenes that do have it flaunt it. I like that Tom Six played himself in the movie. The previous films do play important roles to the development of this story, but the constant pushing of them on Blu-ray was obnoxious. I'm not sure if this was the way Mr. Six wanted his films to go, or if he's just trying to constantly cash in on his original idea. In any case I will repeat my previous advice: Leave expectations at the door, and just enjoy this POS as is.",

I will be the first to admit I actually like the first movie, despite the premise of course not medically accurate, it managed to get black comedy in the middle of disturbing scenes. The second, while uncomfortable to an extent when it began getting repetitive after a while and I don't care for the characters or the acting in it. However, the direction, cinematography and Laurence R. Harvey saved the film giving it a grim, unclean environment. Now (for the final time we hope), Final Sequence this time is about the Warden Bill Boss (Dieter Laser from the first) of an unpopular prison that is threaten closure from many riots, medical costs and staff turnovers by Governor Hughes (Eric Roberts). Bill is a drunk, insane, loudmouth individual who rants and drinks throughout trying to control the prisoners and the fear of termination. However, his right hand man Dwight (Harvey returning from the second) suggests the possibility of creating a human centipede of 500 people as a solution. So the idea of this movie is it is a self aware satire on the series and American Prisons. Tom Six in an interview stated this will be the sickest Human Centipede film yet. Ironically, it actually turns out to not be very gory and oh boy, it's bloody tame (for some people, I think it could be an advantage). The gory moments are brief and really not shocking because we're not interested or care about any of the characters. Honestly, the whole movie is ranting, drinking, suggestion to make Human Centipede, Bill rejects the idea, some brief scenes of the prisoners, sexism to the character of Daisy (Bree Olson) and it repeats over and over until the last 30 minutes. The production values are completely cheap in comparison to the previous with the colour grading of orange to the over-the-top acting mainly from Laser (who was uncomfortably disturbing, yet darkly comic in the first) gives one of the most exasperating performances in recent years.The self-awareness of the fact how they mention the fact the previous movies are messed up feels like a cheap excuse of defending the film and forces it throughout to the point a cameo from Tom Six comes in to giving an impression that he wants the series to be over! Lastly, because of the repetition of the plot structure, the pacing truly drags and feels more lifeless as it goes on. In conclusion, I wasn't offended by the film, that must surprised you. However, I state this film is smug, tame, repetitive and lifeless! Really, I don't want this film to be banned at all, instead how about we watch the great controversial films and remove this as a popular controversial film!",

            "content": "Director Tom Six returns to end his groundbreaking trilogy \"The Human Centipede\". Many people will think that, just like \"The Godfather\", after raising the bar so high with the first two installments, he won't succeed with the third, these people are wrong. Six proofs himself as a master writer with this one, he comes with the surprising and clever idea of increasing the people in the centipede. The film benefits greatly by its fantastic cast, especially Dieter Laser who shines in a low-key, smooth performance as the prison warden, his acting is skillfully supported by the eternal Eric Roberts (despite his busy schedule being in 40 movies this year according to IMDb, all good) and Laurence R. Harvey (not to be confused with the less classier Laurence Harvey from \"The Manchurian Candidate\").This Oscar-bait story follows the sensitive and kind prison warden Bill Boss (awesome name), who tries to improve the conditions of his inmates and at the same time help his politician boss win the next elections for the wellbeing of the community. Sadly his good intentions and compassion remain misunderstood by his neo-nazi, \"Allahu Akbar\" screaming inmates and he is forced to use (for their own good) some perfectly legal methods of keeping them calm like mass castration, boil-water water boarding or breaking a guy's arm (twice). When this doesn't seem to work, he and his accountant decide to sew \"mouth to anus\" all the inmates in a giant centipede (didn't see that coming). Contrary to the popular belief all this is achieved through an intelligently written dialog, suitable for the whole family.The next scene - a heartbreaking dream sequence in which Mr. Boss is captured by the inmates and he recites Pacino-like Shakespearean monologue, unfortunately misunderstood again he suffers sexual intercourse in his stomach. What fallows is the best \"breaking the fourth wall\" scene I've ever seen - the director Tom Six enters the movie and talks with the characters how cool his movies are. After he and the doctor talk about how the operation is 100% medically accurate, the doc gives a brilliant line I'll remember for a long time: \"Well, the feces wouldn't be contaminated by outside bacteria, because it would be going from one digestive track to another. So it wouldn't be harmful. But there wouldn't be much nutritional value.\" Then some gore medical treatment until the last 20min when the centipede is finally revealed and Eric Roberts (reminding everybody why he is an Oscar-nominated actor) declares:\"This is exactly what America needs\".",

It is just a shame that the director made a 3rd part with the unique intention to offend. The movie had a good chance to make a good horror comedy, grindhouse style. Dieter Laser is a good actor, he could have delivered a great character with a better script. Laurence Harvey is a face made for a horror comedy, Eric Roberts is a Hollywood pun face, Bree Olsen, well, she is hot and Tom Six is a no boundaries director. But this 3rd part is just a boring, chauvinist, racist movie. What is the point of the raping parts and the constant degradation of Bree Olsen and Laurence Harvey? Make us laugh? Make us feel shocked? It just offends everyone, and I think this was the director mission and the reason I give it a 4, he accomplished his mission.

Was i surprised by this one; I enjoyed human centipede1 for simply the train wreck of it all, but felt it wasn't that entertaining and certainly horrible in terms of its acting outside of Dieter Laser. But more about him, in a few...This movie was the most enjoyable movie i've seen this year; no joke. I laughed from the first moment; I sensed that Tom Sixx was trying to make political statements with this film, and he did, and that he had to go over the top to be poignant, was appreciated.Dieter Laser, who is in his 70s(!) and plays the racist sadistic sheriff, is absolutely riveting. I simply cannot believe how great and BRAVE of a performance he gives in this film. From interviews on you tube, where many (speculate that Dieter is also vile) you get a sense that he poured his soul into this role, and all the passive aggressive feelings he had about Nazis from his youth seeps thru in this role. One cannot see him in this role, and not be reminded of the third Reich, and what it takes to simply have no humanity. Tom sixx does not shy away from showing the very real sexual deviancy connected to how we seek punishment. Also, Dieter Laser reminds me of sheriff joe from my state of arizona. Its uncanny, especially the ego and bravado by which he devours everything around him like the snake he imagined when playing this role (more info discovered from his interviews on you tube.) That is why he wears snake cowboy boots; its a nod to the animal he used as homage to his performance via his method acting.If you go into this movie hoping for loud techno, and boobies, and one liners, and feeling good for some hero to rise up and triumph...thats not this movie. If you want to watch perhaps the blackest comedy i've seen in many years, which is also a mirror imo for our culture and the joy we take in the torture of prisoners... well... this is your movie.I still can't believe how much i like it. cheers world",

            "content": "Ended up watching this on Netflicks, before I go into it let me 1st go into past history. The first film :The Human Centipede was introduced to me by someone at work. Well being 24 and not having much sense I decided to see just how gross this film was and, well it didn't make me throw up , it was a silly movie with a vile concept. I haven't seen :The Human Centipede 2 and after seeing clips of from a reviewer I have no intention of watching it anytime soon . Fast forward sometime later and i see :Human Centipede 3 advertised on Netflicks. At first I thought this was a wind up as the 2nd movie was banned in the UK for its vulgarity. And a movie about inmates in a prison who get sewn up ass to mouth should be more fitting and less offensive than bystanders being sewn ass to mouth. Well I was wrong on both accounts.The Story : William Bill Boss (Dieter Laser) is a deranged prison warden in a maximum prison. Having been told he faces the threat of being fired if he cannot keep the inmates under control, Boss takes more severe measures before being finally convinced by his accountant Dwight Butler (Lawrence R. Harvey) to sew them all ass to mouth. A few minutes into the film it's clear that Tom Six the director of these films wants to do : create easily the worse film possible in a blaze of infamy. The film is done in a satire (poking fun at itself ) the acting is intentionally awful from virtually everyone, which brings me to the conclusion that everyone involved in this film were trying to payoff their debts. I've got to say I found Dieter Laser entertaining in the most perverse way possible, hearing him mutter lines and racial epithets was just downright z movie hilarious,yet at the same time I'm fully convinced he's a psychopath, he sweats profusely ,constantly looks disturbed or gleefully sadistic. The film is just made as humanly ridiculous as possible, anyone want to try :Water boarding with boiling hot water? For most of the film I couldn't really feel offended by it, as it was graphic but at the same time just felt so obscene and unnecessary it just made me laugh. I can only come to the conclusion that there is something drastically wrong with me. Now here is where it stopped being a so bad its good necessity, and repulsed me more than anything : a rape scene in the movie. Up until then I hadn't been particularly bothered with the film and there was a lot that should have bothered me but didn't, however the rape scene just really disturbed me. Its not that I haven't seen it in films before (just look at films like A Clockwork Orange, Deliverence, Pulp Fiction, The Crow etc) its that normally films will have at least the decency to either cut away from the scene , or if it is graphic;at least have the victim gain some form of retribution (basically it doesn't glorify the act). However Human Centipede 3 the victim doesn't gain any retribution and worse is still unconscious during the act without so much as an after thought, which is something not even bad acting can make right. After seeing this scene I couldn't watch the last 28 minutes where the prisoners get sewn ass to mouth I'd had enough and switched it off. Tom Six certainly succeeds in every way possible in making the worse film possible both in quality and offensive material. Everyone involved in this film would be wise to keep this off their C.V including Eric Roberts , who I swear these days does everything he's in for a pay check and nothing else, the usually reliable Robert LaSardo who's a long way from Nip/Tuck's Escobar Gallardo and Tiny Tom Lister ,remember him in The Dark Knight as the prisoner who selflessly sacrifices his and his fellow prisoners own well being in order to save the citizens of Gotham? Ultimately Tom Six succeeds in making the worse film possible. Can't really say more than that. Tom Six ultimately goes too far and should be ashamed for making shits and giggles out of a rape scene the way he did in his movie. This is the Trojen Horse of bad movies avoid if possible!",

While the various components like acting, camera and more are not the worst I've seen the plot alone makes this movie a zero star piece of crap. The first two movies were bad enough but this one beats you harder than life itself. Watching this movie is equal to rubbing my eyes against a cheese grate while swallowing curdled milk that sat out for a year. Some people compare this tripe to other gory movies but this makes every other movie a dream in comparison. The entire time watching this I didn't just feel like retching, rather I felt immeasurable guilt for wasting my time watching it. I kept thinking \"I could go and learn a new language or help homeless people or just watch another damn movie. Stay away from all three movies at all costs. Even if the first had any merit for some sick man, the two that follow can be enjoyed by anyone besides someone who likes torturing people for his amusement. For all the awfulness that are these movies, I have one positive thing to say. They. Are. Finished and thank god for that.",

            "content": "I was expecting this film to be the most shocking and gruesome one so far, but was totally let down. There is no 'centipede' part until right at the end of the movie (half way through I was wondering if I was watching the right one!), and the centipede idea has been changed so it's much tamer than the first and second movies. Plus, the shock factor is over in the first half of the movie with the whole torture theme, so when the centipede theme comes in, it's just uninteresting.I also came very close to turning it off several times because of The Warden's incessant unintelligible shouting/shrieking. Completely over the top, drawn out, and genuinely very annoying to listen to.",
