            "content": "Greetings from Lithuania.\"Mandariinid\" (2013) is very good movie. Very realistic (well, maybe bonding between two characters was a bit to quick), with beautiful cinematography, very strong acting, tight and simple but very involving script and top notch directing, this is a true movie gem.The story itself isn't complicated, although the background in which it takes place maybe is not very well know in Western countries. Nevertheless, it is told with simple and universal language.Overall, \"Mandariinid\" is not much a war movie - it's antiwar movie in every sense. The isn't much action, but at running time 1 h 22 min this movie is superbly paced, doesn't drag for a second and is very enjoyable for those who like quite but powerful stories.",

Ivo is a remarkable character for the virtue to remind old known truths. it is the merit not only by actor or scriptwriter, director or image. it is a merit of viewer who see the wise man who drives , always, the tensions from a space of conflicts to the necessary end.a film of silence and words as signs of it. a film who impress. for the smart manner to not be a lesson or only a good movie. but a necessary parable. about the deep essence of life.",

            "content": "Ethnic and/or religious armed conflicts are always particularly painful, \"realpolitik\" vs. history, perceptions vs. actual circumstances, victims vs. profiteers, etc. The War in Abkhazia (1992\u201393) was one of the first post-Soviet gory confrontations, with tens of thousands dead, ethnic cleansing, and included the biggest successful rescue operation so far by the Estonian government to save compatriots, not even citizens, as their forebears settled there in 19th century... Many smaller nations, like Estonians, did not choose sides, they just tried to survive and carry on, splendidly expressed through tangerines in the film, but remote weaponry reaches everywhere and does not ask questions (Estonians were not considered hostile by both sides). All this is nicely presented in this Estonian-Georgian film, where Estonian actors used are all famous film actors (the Georgian ones were unfamiliar to me, but they were convincing), and characters seem very realistic. As far as I know, the topic of honour and keeping word are holy among the Caucasus nations, enabling to depict scenes and events odd and even improbable among the Western, \"civilized\" nations. The venue is limited to the remains of a village, but as everything is so properly constructed and performed, you do not feel embattled, and can follow and emphasize with all characters, significantly widening the audience and letting ponder on and over the essence of warfare. PS The film is totally \"male\", only actors were present, no actresses, but the less than 1,5 hours pass tautly.",

            "review_title": "Anti-War, Pro-Humanity",
            "content": "This film is flawless and one of the highlights of the Montreal World Film Festival 2014. It also was recognized with many international prizes in Europe, North America and even Israel. It captures the incoherence and inhumanity of war from the point of view of innocent civilians and of dehumanized soldiers. The pace and plot are crisp, compact and conscious-elevating with a spectacular, yet simple screenplay. The cinematography and music match and enhance the emotional and philosophical human drama. The acting from the all-male cast is poignant and powerful in its restraint. Zaza Urushadze's text comes to life like a play in this sometimes claustrophobic confine which only heightens the inherent tension between the protagonists. The directing does however balance this with the sad beauty of rural Abkhazia conflict zone. The simple sets set the mood and this movie is shooting for the moon.Alexander Kuranov returns as the editor after teaming up with Zaza Urushadze for the excellent multiple story Three Houses (2008) and gets every cut and emotion right. The dialogue, like the film, is raw, unpredictable, mysterious and profound. It brings you the very core of humanity's hopes and fears. The theme of pointless war has rarely been portrayed so perfectly. It surpasses even seminal South Korean The Front Line (2011) and does so in a intellectual and emotionally effective way. Beyond that it is a human drama about people stuck in a conflict and how they decide to deal with it and each other. Is there a glimpse of hope or some guidelines we can learn from?Be sure that I will be looking for Zaza's previous and next work. This is cinema at it's best.",

Surely, it's not a \"happy\" film, but it's lovely in its themes that it reinforces by the end and what it's ultimately trying to tell us.

As if we're watching the actual events taking place before us. This isn't a result of inaptness, this is a deliberate decision to let the story stand in the limelights on its own and avoid anything that could divert the viewers attention from it. You won't find any elaborate shots, any amazing breathtaking sights, no fireworks showing the director's technical mastery. Urushadze tells us about the follies of war and he makes sure that's what we'll get when we see his film. He's aided by superb actors, mainly Lembit Ulfsak playing the strong minded Ivo, a man of few words that makes every word of his count. Reserved, strong willed and determined, a role calling for acting of the highest quality and Lembit Ulfsek is up to the task. In fact there's nothing else to speak about regarding this movie, only the actors, and the director's lean approach to cinematic story telling. Thing is, even when that's all there is if it's done at such level of perfection it's a must see movie.",

In the same vein as films like \"Enemy Mine,\" this film explores the well-trod ground of war and how it affects individual civilians and combatants alike, but does so on a much smaller, more intimate stage than usual war films.The story throws together men with different ages, nationalities, and religions, and asks whether there is something more basic or more important than these distinctions. What happens when the faceless enemy in the woods becomes a man with his own thoughts and problems? Kudos to the director and all of the actors for portraying realistic characters and for allowing us to believably grow with the characters. Lembit Ulfsak is particularly stellar as Ivo, the \"moral man.\" I think that scriptwriters too often give their characters weight and authority by giving them some defining moment or backstory. Not here. Ivo is defined, instead, by what he does and says in the confines of the film, and it is his moral compass that lead the rest of the characters, and, by extension, us to question our own prejudices.All in all, a beautiful story beautifully told.",

            "content": "\"What is wrong with you, young men? All the time, I will kill, I will kill... Who gave you the right for that?\"I wasn't familiar with Estonian cinema before Mandariinid (Tangerines), but I will definitely be keeping my eyes open for Zaza Urushadze's upcoming projects because this was a fulfilling experience. I know the Academy doesn't always get it right, but at least it gives me a chance to check out films that I wouldn't have heard of otherwise. Urushadze's greatest strength as a director here comes from focusing on the story, which he also wrote. It is a simple anti-war film with a powerful narrative and strong performances that benefit from an interesting premise. Urushadze doesn't try to astonish the audience with great visuals or overload us with gruesome action scenes like most war films, but rather focuses on the humanity of each character and does so by centering the story in a small local community where only two men remain. He reduces the Civil War taking place in the Apkhazian region and focuses it on how it affects two local Estonians who have decided to stay in their farmland instead of seeking safety back in Estonia. Ivo (Lembit Ulfsak) and Margus (Elmo Nuganen) are neighbors who work together. Margus has a tangerine plantation (which explains the somewhat terrible title) and Ivo is a carpenter who makes the boxes for their transportation so they collaborate together. Since the war broke out, everyone in the land has returned to Estonia, but these two men have decided to stay. Ivo is a determined and wise old man who doesn't take sides in the war. When a conflict breaks out in front of their home, two soldiers are seriously injured and Ivo takes them into his home. The soldiers (Giorgi Nakashidze and Misha Meskhi) are enemies and we are expecting the tension to break out once they fully recover. Ivo knows this, but he also believes he can teach them a lesson through his acts of kindness during this terrible time of war. The film is effective and accomplishes its purpose of delivering its anti-war message by focusing on the humanity of each one of the characters. Lembit Ulfsak delivers the best performance of the film. He gives a quiet and calmed performance. Despite all the hate and hurtful things the two soldiers say to each other, he is always the voice of reason reminding them that they all share the same land and have equal rights. Ulfsak expresses this inner peacefulness very well from the opening scene in which some local soldiers come searching for food. He is the kind of person that would help anyone, even those that consider him an enemy. Elmo Nuganen is also solid as Margus who has a strong relationship with Ivo and looks up to him. When the two injured soldiers appear at their doorsteps the balance is disrupted and the war comes knocking home. So we clearly see how war takes its toll on everyone, even those who have nothing to do with the fighting, affecting their business and their lifestyle. Giorgi Nakashidze and Misha Meskhi deliver solid roles as these enemies who call a truce out of respect for Ivo while they are in his home. I found the simple premise for this film as a strong way to carry out its message by reducing the big scale of the war to a small local village, but still portraying it as something terrible. Some might consider this too simple of a story or too improbable, but I think it was a quite affecting way to deliver its message. I enjoyed how Zaza Urushadze decided to approach this material and would definitely recommend it.",

It deals with the war in the Apkhazeti region of Georgia in 1990 and centres on an old man, a farmer growing tangerines, who gets caught up in the conflict. It's a very simple picture and a very humanist picture. The old man, Ivo, and his neighbour Margus don't want to take sides; the soldiers who die on their doorsteps are not enemies but simply other human beings, deserving of their care and respect. When two soldiers from opposing sides are wounded, Ivo tries to save both of them.It's a reasonably short film and it has the feel of a good short story and although set in the not-too-distant past it feels remarkably prescient, perhaps depressingly so for while the film deals with good people doing what they can for their fellow man, that goodness is not replicated elsewhere. A remarkable piece of work that should be mandatory viewing.",

            "content": "I've always been of the opinion that if you took any number of children at birth of diverse nationalities, ethnicities and religions, and allowed them to grow up together without any preconceived biases, they would grow up respectful and tolerant of each other, and more importantly, attain a friendship among themselves. I think that's what's at the heart of \"Tangerines\" once you strip away such connotations as 'Chechen', 'Georgian', 'Abkhazian' and 'Russian'. Because after all is said and done, people are just people, and have no reason to hate each other at face value. It's only when one's particular background is revealed that someone of a differing circumstance begins to exhibit prejudice and bias. The film, and the actions of Ivo (Lembit Ulfsak), Margus (Elmo N\u00fcganen) and doctor Juhan (Raivo Trass), in overlooking the enmity between Chechen Ahmed (Giorgi Nakashidze) and Georgian Nika (Misha Meskhi), help the two enemies see each other as humans on the opposite side of a struggle for which there will ultimately be no winners or losers when it comes to the finality of death. Particularly poignant is the final scene, in which we learn the reason why Ivo will not return to Estonia, while offering his assurance to Ahmed that he would just as soon have buried him next to his own son in the same manner as Nika (only a little further away, to add an element of ironic humor to the story). I thought this was a thoughtful and provocative film with a discernible message of tolerance in a hate filled world, though at the same time, I have no illusions that a message as simple as the one delivered here, would have any impact on the those whose ideologies take precedence over humanity.",

It seems as if we have Russians, Abkhazians, Georgians, Estonians, Chechens (also calling themselves Caucasians, I think) involved. How Estonia comes to be a home base for extended families living in Georgia is not explained as it is as far from there as are China, India, France and Somalia. The story revolves around two Estonian farmers (tangerine farmers) who are staying put until the last harvest is in while their Estonian neighbors have left for Estonia and as the conflict escalates. A wounded Georgian and a Chechen end up recovering in the farmhouse. The rest of the film centers on mediation (by the Estonian) of the hate between Georgian & Chechen as well as, a perhaps, a shared understanding, but \u0085 An aside: Perhaps American politicians can learn a lesson from this film and spend less time coming up with reasons to hate differences, and more in understanding the roots and unique values in differences between people.",

I mean not in the literal sense but just on human level.I think, almost always, majority of the people who are fighting a war are not personally affected by its cause. It's something that's just inculcated in them. They are taught to hate the opposite side.This movie, with a handful of characters, in just so little words, in such a short time, makes you realize that you can empathize with anyone. You should just have the will to do so. Humanity is capable of so much love that there can be no place left for hatred, but sadly we're too busy fighting, every day, every where, in one or another part of the world.This is a captivating movie from the first frame to the last.

            "content": "Crafted poignantly by writer-director Zaza Urushadze, Tangerines is a simple but gripping look at human side of conflict. Set in 1992, it tells the story of an Estonian tangerine farmer who is awaiting harvest when the battle between Georgia and Abkhazian separatists comes to his doorstep. Although set in a specific time and place, the film's message about human life is universal.Right at the peak of hostilities, we are introduced to two Estonian immigrant farmers - Ivo (Lembit Ulfsak, both commanding and compassionate in his performance) and his partner Margus. While most of the population has escaped to safer ground, the pair stay to harvest their tangerine crop. It's an almost impossible task for two, but it's one they tackle, not for financial gain, but because it would be a travesty to see such a fine crop left to die. Their farming woes are trumped when a skirmish outside their homes leaves several dead and one wounded soldier from each side: Ahmed, a Chechen mercenary; and Niko, a Georgian volunteer. Ivo takes in both injured men to tend to their wounds, bringing the ethnic tensions under one roof. His only rule is that they must set aside their instincts to kill each other until both are healthy. The film hardly ever strays from its one set location - Ivo's farmhouse looking like a leftover from another century - allowing the tension to brew unobstructed as both men slowly regain their health. It's during the healing process that the men begin to look past political manifestos, religious doctrines and social convictions to see that they really aren't that different. The mutual ceasefire forces the soldiers into a pocket of peace \u2013 the same peace they've been fighting for. Despite threatening to kill each other once they are ambulatory, their enforced propinquity fosters tolerance if not friendship, in a mutual show of respect and gratitude towards their savior.With this simple premise in place, Tangerines uses its small scale to say something big, converting the initial suspense into something more thematically and philosophically powerful as the hypocrisy of war is smoothly laid bare. Except for brief outbursts of violence, Tangerines is, like its hero Ivo, a stoic and introspective thing. The story moves slowly and methodically, tempering the expected rapprochement between enemies with a more acerbic outlook about human nature. Although there are moments of quiet humor, Tangerines is mostly a tragedy, told via looks exchanged between heated adversaries and their imperturbable intermediary. Over the course of the film, those looks soften from glaring mistrust to acceptance to heartbroken endurance in the face of the meaninglessness and inevitability of death.For anyone looking for an uncomplicated anti-war argument painted by historical insight, superb performances and airtight direction, 'Tangerines' is a must-see. Just like a tangerine, it is a delicious mix of sweet and acidic flavors.",

            "content": "Mandariinid, known as Tangerines in the US, is a thought provoking Estonian anti-war film set in the early 1990s.An Estonian elder named Ivo has stayed behind in the Apkhazeti region of Georgia despite the advancement of the war around him. Most Estonians have left the region for their homeland, but Ivo remains and is helping his friend Margus who is staying to harvest a large crop of tangerines.With the battle between Georgians against the Abkhazian side closing in around them, their homes become caught in the crossfire that leaves two surviving fighters from opposing sides badly hurt but alive. Opposed to the brutal siege and futility battle, Ivo takes both men into his home to nurse them to health. As they recover the tension and desire for vengeance returns. Vowing to respect Ivo's home and refrain from shedding blood under his roof they resume the animosity with a verbal onslaught, opening a dialogue to compare their similarities as members of humanity.There is something about the film Tangerines (Mandariinid) that is immediately unnerving, which must be a deliberate decision from the writer and director Zaza Urushadze for this obviously anti-war film. The perilous reality of war in what is supposed to be a safe and tranquil countryside sets a looming tone of dread. Certain shots and scenes seem to foreshadow imminent malicious actions between the characters and that the film will simply not end well. In Urushadze forcing the viewer to feel unease he simultaneously forces the viewer to become engaged and invested in the characters and their story.Initially I did not want to watch this film. The summary gave me great anxiety and quite frankly, I watched enough war films and there is enough war going on in the world that I felt I reached my threshold. Luckily, Tangerines is not really a war film and is, in fact, far more broad of an intellectual examination regarding wartime, and the nonsensical nature of it all within its tangible confines. Further, in being more philosophical, the film allows almost any viewer to relate and take a message from it. You don't need to know about the region or the specifics regarding the War in Abkhazia to understand its sentiment and intentions.Tangerines is a beautiful gem of a film that feels more like a play, and unfortunately they do not make films like these anymore. The setting of the story is rather small, almost constrained to the small quarters of Ivo's quaint home. There is a minimal quantity of characters and the plot resides in the simple but thought-provoking dialogue exchange between these disparate individuals. The relationships between the characters are complex, distinct and fully-formed and compelling, thanks in part to he acting of Lembit Ulfsak, Misha Meskhi and Giorgi Nakashidze.Though the film is about war, and the war never truly dissipates entirely to the background, there is a dry humor to the film. In its simplicity and clear vision, Tangerines succeeds in examining extremely complicated and tense subject matter with a heart felt and resonating effect.All I can say is I hope it wins for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars against other films with more exposure - because it is a stand out as a gripping feat of thought provoking cinema.Please go to our WEBSITE to read all the REVIEWS of recent releases and awards contenders.",

            "content": "Though generally categorized as a war drama, the newest picture from Georgian director Zaza Urushadze only uses war as a background to its moralizing and mightily effective story. There is a war, but it takes place within one household and is fought with words not weapons. Tangerines takes place in 1992 in a small village during the infamous War In Abkhazia, in which the mentioned country is trying to separate itself from Georgia. Only two men live in this secluded place, Ivo and Markus, Estonians whose daily lives consist of picking tangerines from the trees, in order to sell them later and earn money that will help them get back to Estonia and survive the war.One day, just in front of their homes, a fight ensues. After it's over, it seems that the only survivor of the deadly battle is Ahmed, a Chechen mercenary on a mission to keep Georgians out of the Abkhaz soil. The two villagers take the wounded man home and decide to bury the rest, but suddenly, in the middle of the burial, they realize that there is another survivor - a young Georgian soldier. They place him under the same roof with Ahmed. What follows is an intense and intelligent, but also spot-on hilarious, bloodless war between two fierce enemies, all the more engaging due to the fact that although there aren't any effective explosions or gunfights, the splendidly story knows how to keep the blood pumping.Tangerines is filled with many unexpected laughable situations and amusing taunts, but at the same time has some intense scenes that remind the viewer of the war that takes place off screen, and a few heartbreaking moments that may easily bring tears to one's eyes. But the most important aspect of the whole scenario is the bonding between all the characters. Under Ivo's watchful eye, the two enemies gradually become close to each other when they finally recognize the true power of compassion and kindness. It takes time, but after lots of insults and death threats the two men begin to see that prejudice against people is only a fictitious creature made by hatred and it can be quickly defeated by opening one's mind to new experiences.The moralizing side of the whole story might seem simple, yet the way it's delivered through that really well-written script is imaginative and profoundly touching. By seeing the enormous change that the characters go through in those tough times, one might actually ponder the true meaning of humanity as a entirety, without any boundaries caused by such trivial matters as different nationalities, races or religions. It's actually quite fascinating to observe how universal the story really is, and how easily adaptable to all sorts of flash points in our hate-ridden world.The premise is interesting, but the final effect is truly stunning. Honestly, I consider Tangerines to be the most captivating European feature I saw during Warsaw Film Festival this year and it should definitely be screened in more countries. By the time I finished the review, I knew that Zaza Urushadze won the festival's best director award, which is well deserved considering how his visionary approach to a hard and controversial topic made the movie an enormously enjoyable treat.Patryk Czekaj, Contributing Writer",

It turns out, unlikely as it may be, it is the film I will be rooting for to win the big prize come Oscar time.The time is 1992. It is a time of war in the Abkhazeti region of Georgia. In a mountain village, only two men have stayed behind while their family and compatriots have all return home to Estonia. Ivo (Lembit Ulfsak) makes crates for the tangerines that his friend Margus (Elmo N\u00fcganen) grows. One day, a deadly encounter happens in their village. Two men, Ahmed (Giorgi Nakashidze) and Niko (Mikheil Meskhi), were left alive when the battle was done. Ivo is forced to take them into his house and nurse them both back to health. Big problem though, because Ahmed is a Chechen mercenary, and Niko is a Georgian soldier. These were the two sworn enemies in this war.Writer and Director Zaza Urushadze has created this effectively tense fable with four main characters who need to interact within a very confined space of Ivo's house. The slow but steady development of the story built up to a very satisfying climax. The main topic of the story is simple, and the execution was elegantly direct to the point. Ironic for a film set in the midst of a heartless war, \"Tangerines\" profoundly showed us the meaning of humanity. 9/10.",

            "content": "In the Georgia, Apkhazeti region of summer 1992, Georgians were warring with Estonians, forcing them back to their homeland. In Tangerines, an intriguing Oscar nominee for best foreign film, Estonian carpenter Ivo (Lembit Ulfsak) stays behind to make crates for harvested tangerines with his gentle farmer neighbor Margus (Elmo Nuganen). The ensuing drama pits warriors from both sides, who must peacefully co-exist while being tended for their wounds by the caring Ivo at his home.The story of enemies becoming friends has been writ many times before, and in Tangerines these enemies do not go gently as Muslim Chechen mercenary Ahmed (Giorgi Nakashidze), fighting on the Abkhazi side, badgers Christian Georgian Niko (Mikheil Meskhi), who gives back as good as he gets. Meanwhile Ivo's role is to comment on war's absurdities and injustices, like a chorus reflecting writer/director Zara Urushadze's philosophies about war:Ahmed: \"I will avenge my friend. This is a holy thing for us, Old Man, you don't understand.\" Ivo: \"Killing a sleeping man, when he is unconscious, is that a sacred thing too? I didn't know.\" Included in his wisdom is some well-placed sarcasm that serves the anti-war thoughts of everyone watching this film.The most remarkable trait of Tangerines is Ivo's humanity, an aging farmer with a world vision that allows him to care for two enemies without taking sides and create an environment that makes them devotees of peace and brothers. The setup tends toward the stagey with speeches dramatizing the universals amid the dung of battle, set in a confined area that could have been out of a Sam Shephard drama. Other virtues of this unassumingly powerful film are the claustrophobic farm house and its rough exterior, as much an evocation of Winter's Bones's impoverished Appalachia as it is of proud but poor Georgia. The actors are every bit as rough-hewn as the fence that keeps no enemies out. The exception is the generous Ivo, whose soft face and meek mien are the markers for peaceful survival amid the dirty and dangerous landscape of farm and humans. Like Ivo, the tangerines are a promise of peace's nourishment, an easy metaphor for the contrast between the toxic battle and the bounty of peace. The crates emphasize the tribal environment which can rot only too soon if not tended. Similarly, the oft-referenced photo of Ivo's lovely granddaughter reminds us that beauty still exists somewhere even if it seems unattainable.",

The extraordinary film \"Tangerines\" chronicles the grim atrocities of this vicious Eastern European conflict. At the same time, however, the story brings to bear the uniquely insane folly of a civil war. In this case it is one in which many of the combatants on both sides are unaware of the history of the people tens of thousands of them will die fighting for.Lembit Ulfsak is remarkable as Ivo, an elderly woodworker and tangerine grower. Ivo remains behind in a small village while the rest of his family have fled to Estonia. After the war literally comes to his front door, he winds up taking in and caring for a pair of soldiers morbidly wounded in a deadly gun fight. The two men are bitter enemies. Each wants to finish the job on the other. In his own quiet manner, Ivo strives to inject humanity into a crucible of hate and resentment. \"Tangerines\" may well leave you asking, \"Were it this simple?\" Or perhaps, as Director Zaza Urushadze impresses here, the question will rather be this alternative.\"Why CAN'T it be this simple?\"",

This is something so good everyone can agree on. Everything counts for something, there is nothing there for nothing. And not for mere symbolism, but everything has a reason to be in the film - there are no stock characters, no stock conversations and no stock props.Every word counts for so much that you couldn't cut out one second of the film without flinching. It is neither slow nor rushed, neither pro-Georgian nor pro-separatist, neither pro-settlement or pro-exodus... very few people could've made this same movie with this same script without ruining it with political biases like anti-Islam, anti-Russia, anti-Georgian, anti-Caucasian, anti-Communist, anti-separatist sentiment (or pro any of those). This movie is about the people in it and it does it well without the director getting caught up in tit-for-tat us-vs-them situation nor does it show some premonition of what is to happen 10-20 years from then.It's a story about the early 1992, not 2001 or 1941. It's a story about an Estonian man living in Georgia. I personally know directors that would see this script and add so much history and awareness of the future that it would ruin it. This director goes without cheap attempts at referencing bigger historical events for the sake of contextualization.Everything here is weighted and is kept in the movie after careful consideration, from the car to the cassette, from the photo to the guns, from the shrapnel to the shish kebabs.No clich\u00e9s, no stock characters, no distractions - just a great story.If I had to say a bad thing about it - the music (the main theme), although great, gets repetitive after a while.Easily film of the year and in my personal top 10.",

            "content": "Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 5/5 starsSmall-scale and poignant with an accessible antiwar statement: that if two soldiers or just about anybody from opposite warring factions are brought together through circumstances, and lack of better alternatives make them stay in proximity over a few days, bonding over soup, shashlik, and a hard-boiled egg,; they'll eventually cease to care about the animosity and conflict uninitiated by them, set their differences aside, and if not become friends, they'll at least have each others' backs. \"Tangerines\" is a most effective antiwar movie with a simple yet profound message expressed lucidly and explicitly.The film takes place during the 1992 civil conflict between Georgia and the autonomous state of Abhkzia within Georgia (though its autonomy was not recognized by the UN at the time the film is set). Once ethnic/nationalistic strife commenced in the wake of the Soviet Union's dissolution, a large local minority of Estonians who lived in the area but returned to their homeland. Save for two men \u2013 Ivo and Margus \u2013 an Estonian village within the mountains of an Abhkzian province has been completely vacated; carpenter/grandfather Ivo (Lembit Ulfsak) has stayed behind to help neighbor Margus (Elmo Nuganen) harvest his annual tangerine crop. While they are going about their business, they get caught in the crossfire between two small bands of rival soldiers. Two of the fighters survive \u2013 Ahmed (Giorgi Nakhashidze), a Chechen mercenary on the Abkhazian side, and Niko (Mikheil Meskhi) a Georgia soldier. Both are badly wounded, but Ivo takes them in and nurse them back to health. Although the two rival combatants vow to kill each other once they have recovered, their time spent convalescing softens their belligerence \u2013 the long period of forced cohabitation during recovery has a humanizing effect. While the protagonists can't prevent the outside world from wreaking further havoc, they gradually grow connected to each other in ways that transcend geographic, ethnic, and religious demarcations.Although the subject of civil war within the former Soviet countries has been tackled in other movies, this retelling is one of the most concise and affecting. Perhaps the reason it works so well is because it crystallizes the entire tragic history of the region by focusing on a few characters. And all the four actors chosen for these meticulously crafted characters leave lasting impressions.\"Tangerines\" balances humor and seriousness in deft fashion. Shot in the western Georgia region of Guria, the film, with its gorgeous landscapes, further underlines the pointlessness of organized human bloodshed in the larger context of nature's bounty. Writer-Director Urushadze films the rural landscapes with a poetic but unsentimental eye, so that when the bucolic scenes are blasted by gunfire, the impact is even greater. The wistful, melancholic score by Niaz Diasamidze subtly enhances the film's power.I'm pretty sure I've never seen an Estonian film before \u2014 or a Georgian one, for that matter; this is a joint production \u2014 but if they produce films even remotely similar in quality, I look forward to many more such gems in future. \"Tangerines\" is a great example of how powerful and universal small but well-crafted stories can be. It slaps an honest, emotional sincerity and a dry, almost humorous pragmatism in the face of macho posturing and identity tribalism.",

Georgian is not spoken at all.The story is simple. Two old Estonian tangerine farmers are the last inhabitants of their village (everybody else has left to Estonia because of the war). As the war comes to their doorstep (literally) they are forced to take care of 2 wounded soldiers from different sides of the conflict.It is quite slow-paced, depressing and lacks energy like most Estonian movies.

I wouldn't say that this film is underrated, it is rated 8.3/10, although I'd give it 9.5/10, this film is still an unknown gem. 60% of voters on IMDb gave it 9 or 10. It is only a matter of time until it enters the IMDb top 250.This film reminds me a lot of No Man's Land, but this one lacks that absurdist Balkan element. Balkan films have strong threads of absurdism, comedy and tragedy coming together, but this film doesn't have that. It's a darker, more somber piece. This film is not a moralizing sermon that's against war. It is not a contrived Lifetime/Oxygen movie that plays like a public service announcement or some educational film shown in schools.It's a real film, cinematic and subtle. It has the perfect balance of dialogue, action/events, space/pacing and music. It is not an action film with a moral message between battles. It is not a sermon interrupted with events. It is not a music video showing the beauty of the country. It is a film, it is what cinema everywhere should be.This film is also not tragic porn. A lot of films just add tragedy after tragedy to pull at our heartstrings. It doesn't use sad music to manipulate you, doesn't have this pile-on of tragedies to make things sad. No orphanage for mentally handicapped cancer kids getting hit with artillery strikes.It's a simple, yet very powerful story. It is a snapshot of time. People criticize films like this for not being encyclopedias of a conflict. They want all sides of the story to be represented and given equal time and weight. \"Why didn't they This is pointless. This film is not an encyclopedia of all sides, it's just a single chapter in the life of a man, or three men, when all their lives intersected.Perhaps the target audience for this film is limited. Not many people know where Estonia is, forget them knowing of Abkhazia and what all these things mean. I see that the highest rated bad review talks about \"cardboard villain characters of Russian soldiers\", even though there are no Russian characters in this film. I highly recommend this film. Watch it with someone who knows a bit about the Caucasus if possible or brush up a bit on the history of that conflict post USSR. You don't need a history degree to understand it. It's a clear cut conflict, it's just that for many, it's an unknown conflict from an unknown part of the world. No rounding up. This is 10/10.",

The war soon arrives at their doorstep and Ivo and Margus are faced with two injured soldiers \u2013 one from either side. They take them both in and care for both.The problem is that Ivo has now brought the war under his roof and he will have to deal with the consequences as best he can. Now this is one of those films' that is both simple and complex. Simple in that it is dealing with the often seemly black and white situation of a conflict \u2013 you have to be on one side or the other. And it is complex in that it shows the very complex issues of 'grey area' that arise when kindness and decent humanity are placed before all.This is a genuinely moving film that has a great anti war message at its heart but it is also very positive in many ways. Brilliantly acted by all \u2013 Lembit Ulfsak as Ivo is particularly effective. It is also simply but effectively shot and is a testament to small budgets that can be devastatingly brilliant. This is why World cinema and new European cinema should be applauded \u2013 absolutely stunning.",

            "content": "There is subtle humor that overlays the tense drama about a pacifist Estonian who gives refuge to a mercenary and his war enemy, a Georgian, in the '92 war of Abkhazia.And that makes the viewing interesting. The story unfolds rather slowly, revolving around the pacifist's cozy house and a huge farm bearing tangerines (orange-like fruits). The message is clear - that war affects the innocent as well as the players, and the only way to react is to be a pacifist, just like our protagonist. Human relations are dealt with pure realism here, and that is propelled by some good writing.This is no extraordinary film, yet so captivating that you will ache for it. The characterization is very fine, and so is the attention to details. I won't say much about this all-male-cast film that is the most subtle yet deafening film I have seen in weeks.BOTTOM LINE: Tangerines aka Mandariinid will appeal to even non- speakers of Estonian/Russian, not because it is a clever message- conveying drama, but because it urges you to embrace the truth. 7/10 - recommended!",

            "content": "War certainly never changes. And no matter what reasons make people leave their regular lives and go kill each other, it all boils down to the blind rage and bloodthirstiness. There are no noble causes, no right and wrong, just \"us\" and \"them\" and killing them before they kill us.The ugliness of all this mess is best noticed when put against the pure beauty of the land the people are fighting for. Against the nature that knows no war and against people who only wanna live in harmony with it and reap what the land yielded for them. And that's the essence of the story behind Tangerines: a dying Estonian settlement in the Caucasus region, with only a few people left who try to gather the tangerines while there is still time, while the war breaks all around them about which country this land should belong to.The beauty of Tangerines is in its simplicity. It doesn't try to judge, to separate right from wrong, to label people for what made them go to that war - money or duty. It cares for none of it. The only thing that matters is that we are all human, and killing each other is a pointless and senseless thing per se. That the person you are so desperately trying to kill today might become your only friend tomorrow. Because that's what war does: it makes everybody blind, and the only way to start seeing again is to reject it altogether.The naivety of that pacifist message may be endearing, but it also demands for an oversimplification. Preaching peace is only possible if you ignore all the complexities that led to the war in the first place. In fact, Tangerines tries a bit too hard to avoid any complexities at all, nipping them in the bud. Why are the Abkhazians fighting for their independence? Why are the Georgians so eager to keep them from getting it? Why are the Russians and their blood money involved? Why is Ivo so reluctant to leave his village and move to Estonia to his family? What will he do when the rest of the settlers leave? The answers to these questions are either blurred or not even hinted at, as if the whole world has suddenly shrunk to these two Estonian guys, their unexpected guests and a tangerine garden.And while that reclusiveness - both physical and spiritual - may be a powerful personal stance, it deprives Tangerines of a certain cinematographic depth. Of course, there may be no obvious solutions to all the big problems of our world, especially when it comes to war, but sometimes it's simply not enough to put a flower into a barrel of a rifle to fix it all. Even if it's a tangerine blossom.",

Whatever one might think about the Soviet Union, its collapse in 1991 created a lot of human suffering and conflict. One of these conflicts was the Abkhazian war of 1992, between the newly independent Georgia and the breakaway Republic of Abkhazia (which is not recognized as a sovereign nation by the international community).Ivo (Lembit Ufsak) is an elderly Estonian carpenter living in a isolated house in Abkhazia. Most Estonians living there have left the place, but Ivo has stayed building wooden cases for the tangerine crop of his Estonian neighbor farmer Margus (Elmo N\u00fcganen). But the war reaches their immediate surroundings when a gunfight occurs between Georgians and Chechen combatants fighting for Abkhazia, that leaves three dead and two wounded. Ivo and Margus bury the dead and care for the wounded: Chechen fighter Ahmed (Giorgi Nakashidze) and the more seriously injured Georgian Nika (Mikhail Meskhi), whom Ahmed is bent on killing at first opportunity in retribution for his fallen comrades. However, Ivo has declared his house a neutral zone, and both men give their word they'll respect it. And as they convalesce, Ivo's house see a tense truce between the two soldiers.Heavy on dialogue, Tangerines probably should have worked better as a stage play than as a film. Despite this, it is well made, though even at a running time of less than an hour and a half, it seems unnecessarily extended.",

Ahmed is a Chechen mercenary and Niko is the Georgian. Villager Juhan comes to treat the wounded.I applaud the movie's message. There is only one problem. I don't buy Ahmed's change of heart. The movie starts with great tension as Ivo deal with his unasked-for Chechen guests. Everything goes well until Ahmed falls under Ivo's spell and change his character.

            "content": "\"Tangerines\" (2013 release from Estonia; 87 min.) brings the story of a conflict being played out in the early 90s in the countryside of Georgia (the country not the state), involving Georgians, Chechens, and Estonians who have lived in Georgia for many years. As the movie opens, the fighting is going on and we learn that many Estonian families have returned to Estonia. Not Ivo of his neighbor Margus, however. Margus is about to harvest his crop of tangerines, and Ivo builds crates to held them. Then one day, small groups of Georgians and Chechens are fighting nearby Ivo's house and as it happens, one Georgian and one Chechen survive. Ivo sees no other solution than to take them both into his house. At this point we're a good 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, despite the occasional fighting, please do not mistake this for a \"war\" or worse, an \"action\" movie. Most of the film plays out in Ivo's house and the burning question is: once they both realize what their situation is and, more importantly, who the other guy is, what will the Georgian and Chechen guys do? (No worries, I'm not going to spoil). So this movie has as much a feel of a theater play than it feels like a movie. Having now seen \"Tangerines\", I have now seen all 5 movies that were nominated for this year's Oscar for Best Foreign Movie, and I must admit that, given the strong crop of contenders, I'd probably rank \"Tangerines\" at the 5th of this group. That does NOT mean that \"Tangerines\" is not a good movie, it's just that the other 4 were even better.I saw \"Tangerines\" in early May at the Landmark Bethesda Row Cinema (suburban Washington, DC). The matin\u00e9e screening where I saw this was PACKED, somewhat to my surprise I will admit. But I think this is great news, as it proves that there is an audience out there for top-notch quality foreign movies. If you are in the mood for a tense theater play-reminding movie that examines the human side of conflicts of war, I'd readily suggest you check out \"Tangerines\", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",

The scene is simple yet gripping one, where all three characters (Johan, Margus and Ivo) are trying to hide the truck but they don't want to be seen.Margus a simple man trying not to ruin/ left a corpse of Tangerines in the war zone. Ivo, the main character, is helping him out but in doing he is trying to find a normal life. Everyone else has either left or about to left (like in case of Johan, the doctor). Then there is Ahmed (Chechen mercenary on the Abkhazian side) and Niko (Mikheil Meskhi), a Georgian volunteer. Because of fire exchange both are badly wounded and Ivo is not taking care of both of them. Both lives in Ivo's house with one condition where they won't kill each other in his house and after some time both want to let each other go. An indication of the deep desire of Ivo where he wants things to move back to normal and for some time they do seems normal but for only a short time.Every things changes when some passing Russian soldiers stop to inspect Ivo's house and they falsely accuse Ahmed of being on the other side and decide to execute him on the spot. Niko sees this from the window and opens fire on the armed soldiers in order to protect Ahmed. During the gun fire exchange a stray bullet kills the innocent Margus, and Niko is also killed after he steps out of the house thinking all are dead but was killed by a wounded officer laying on the ground. Ahmed then finishes off the wounded officer. Ahmed and Ivo then buries Margus and Miko.The movie shows us a desire of a normal person against the desire of waging war. Forgiveness versus ruthlessness. Humanity verses Incomprehension. Brotherhood and hatred are thrown together by the situation and we start questioning what is gained by fighting.Acting is very good but special praise for Ivo (Lembit Ulfsak), Ahmed (Giorgi Nakashidze ) and Miko (Mikheil Meskhi ).

            "content": "Tangerines (2013) :\nBrief Review -This Estonian-Georgian Classic is a major breakthrough for changing the face of War films. Foreign Language cinema is ahead of Hollywood when it comes to taboo breaking regional concepts and i have witnessed many films which proved it. War genre has seen a lot of classic films and carries a legacy and popularity. Check Oscar Winners list, IMDb Ratings, Rotten Tomatoes Lists, Critics favourites and where not, you will find so many War films everywhere. Tangerines is not like that, neither it is biographical nor has any visual grandeur. But still it has special message told in some specific way which is enough to change the face and dimensions of War films. All War films made since 30s have showcased what happens on field or how people suffered from it or brutal massacre or victorious tales but how many war films do you remember who have focused on reconciliation of enemies? None, i guess. The recent classics in War genre i remember are '1917' and 'The Hacksaw Ridge', the former being a technical sensation while the latter one was about greatness of one man. Here, Tangerines is about an old man who saves mercenaries of both the sides and tries to make peace between them by explaining how War is harmful to everyone. Some brilliant ideas like this make me believe that yes cinema can be innovative and socially important even today. Tangerines doesn't even try to show any violence or brutality that happens in war zones but it simply tecahes about it by references. The last 10 minutes in this film takes it very high, on that High which was not even supposed to be taken place before it appeared. All the actors does their natural best, the writing powerful, screenplay is impeccable, storytelling is realistic and the direction is artistic. If i was ever to imagine a taboo braking war film in world cinema then i was sure it would have came from foreign language cinema and not Holywood, Tangerines proved me right.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "In many ways Tangerines is a small film.A film focused on a small group of individuals, held up mostly within the confines of elder statesman Ivo's farmhouse, the scope of Zaza Urushadze's film is intimate and human centered but its grand themes of acceptance and humanity in the face of wartime and differing views creates a universally relatable tale that will move and inspire in equal measure.Filmed in Estonia, Tangerines is one of only a handful of films from the small European country to be nominated for both and Academy Award and Golden Globe and while its initial release may've seen the film garner interest of a small-scale around the globe, its stature as one of the modern era's most interesting and moving war set dramas has only grown over the years, showcasing what can be done with nothing more than a bright idea, some great actors and a tale of fruit in the heat of bloody civil wars.Getting straight down to business, Tangerines quickly introduces us to determined farmer Ivo and his business partner Margus, two men trying their best to push forward with their farming dreams despite their country raging war between Estonian's and Chechen's citizens, a situation made even more complicated when the two men must help save two soldiers that have been wounded in their abandoned village who just so happen to be fighting for warring sides.From here on out Tangerines set's about a tension riddle tale as Ivo tries his best to ensure these two soldiers, Ahmed and Nika survive their wounds but also each other as they recover in Ivo's humble home and learn to appreciate the fact they are in fact not so different to one another.The film ticks a number of familiar narrative boxes off as it paces along at a steady and brisk tempo in a short sub-90 minute runtime but Urushadza film offers up a number of surprises along the way and delivers everything in such a heartfelt manner than you will be enthralled for the most part of this moving and unique drama.Accompanied by some great scenery and a memorable score from composer Niaz Diasamidze, Tangerines is a fine example of foreign film-making and touching example of the power of the human spirit when used for good.Final Say -A small film with a big heart, Tangerines is a war drama with a difference and an absolute delight to watch. It may not break any new ground along the way, but this is a little seen gem you'd do well to seek out.4 cups of tea out of 5",

It compartmentalises the war in several rooms at Ivo's house, a neutral Estodian who picks tangerines for a living, as he cares for two wounded men both from either sides of the war. It's a very interesting concept for a film, perhaps one that would work very well for the stage, but it feels like it needs a wiser writer behind the pen. What could be thoroughly profound or feverishly tense is simplified and conflict is shown through passive aggression. However, it doesn't make the bonds of the men any less touching even if not as identifiable. Despite the majority of the film being calm and dialogue driven, its intense scenes certainly make up for it. The film's finest aspect is its rich photography, and the film knows it too as it constantly glides through the picture making the small scale very cinematic. I do wish the distracting score didn't cut through the powerful moments though, it was one step too far. Although Tangerines may be unfamiliar territory for some regarding the war, but its pacifist message is one that we can all empathise with.7/10",

            "content": "It has a simple, straightforward story, but it's told very well and gave me quite a bit to ponder over. Ivo is effective as a father figure who tries his best to keep the peace between Ahmed and Nika, believing that all people are equal and hoping for his kindness to rub off on the two of them before it's too late. It also has some great anti-war themes which show that not only can the men from the opposing sides potentially get along with each other in the right setting, but given the serenity of Ivo's home and the tangerine groves, the violence in the film seems tragic with the knowledge of what the soldiers are either ignoring or missing out on. Really, this is a rare case where the violence feels senseless rather than exciting.",

            "review_title": "\"Mandariinid \u2013 a movie that reminds oneself of the profoundly childish nature of war\"",
            "content": "Mandariinid is a, mainly, psychological film co-produced by Estonia and Georgia, and is focusing on the themes surrounding the futility of war and the importance of peaceful coexisting. War is, by nature, like a childish play. The causes and the reasons are there, but they can never justify losing a human's life over their successful completion. A war is, always, initiated for imperialistic causes disguised as matters of national spirit. The only meaningful approach to a born juxtaposition between two or more nations, always, is a mature discussion on the matters concerned. So, one of the things that this movie manages to portray skillfully is this exact nature of war. The presentation of the two \"enemy\" soldiers as children fighting with each other under the same roof and under the surveillance by a considerably older and wiser individual, reminds us of this nature.However, war is an important worldwide phenomenon. It never seizes to exist, and as much time humans exist, there will be war. Another of this film's strengths lies in successfully establishing this brutal truth, when simultaneously manages to land a strong blow of satire and dark humor concerning the main theme. Even if it feels conceited midway through, in the last half you realize that, even though there is hope for human coexisting, the dehumanization of war always prevails.In addition, the acting was superb. When tackling an important theme like war in a bold and satirical manner, considerable acting talent is needed. Fortunately, the pre-established requirements are met with the chosen cast. All of them manage to give a career-defining performance, considerably fleshing out their characters and making them intimate and multi-dimensional. Of course, the highlight is Lembit Ulfsak's performance as Ivo, a kind old man that tends to help anyone in need without any doubt, while his wisdom is critical on making the other characters reflect on their past actions.In the end what makes this film important is not only the virtuosity of cinematography and composed music displayed or the exemplary acting, but the inspired portrait of humanity's ever changing mask: It can represent a peaceful coexisting, leaving a sweet taste, or a dehumanized atrocity that is war, leaving a bitter taste. But\u0085 doesn't this bittersweet taste remind you of freshly-cut tangerines?",

Two enemies in one house, fighting without guns. They in the end see themselves in each other, empathise with each other and even respect and protect each other. This is a movie which doesn't tell you who is \"right\". It only tells you that in war everyone thinks they're on the right side and that enemies are humans too just like we are. It is a story about friendship, understanding and respecting even your own enemy. Movie is very symbolic, for example many of you might not know that in the end there's a song named \"Me gadmovcurav zgvas\". It is Irakli Charkviani's song and it is about conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia. Meaning of this song is that the author will swim across the see and get back home, in Abkhazia, which is a part of Georgia. Niko had been fixing that tape for the whole movie and Ahmed took it with him and listened to that song in the end while getting back home. It is a symbol of respect, of sharing something from your enemy which no longer is your enemy, because now you understand that maybe you're both the same and you both want to go home as it is said in the song.",

            "content": "This is the first time i see a Georgian movie and i find it to be an amazing debut for me to get into Georgian cinema. At first i thought it was going to be a normal war movie, but while the movie kept running I was more and more into it. The film stars Ivo an old man that loves his land and doesn't want the war to affect the way he lives. He lives next to Margus who seems to be his life-friend. Margus a middle-age man that loves life and his tangerines. The war has come and both of them are the only ones remaining in their homes since their families have left to Estonia. It's fascinating how these two man keep loving their village even though they are running a big risk of get killed. My favorite scene comes in shortly after they hear fire-guns near their houses. Here appear the characters that make this movie show us how wise, peaceful, pacifist, kind, Ivo is most importantly wise. Here we have to know an important fact and it's that the war was between Abkhazian and Georgia in the 90's. Ivo and Margus see two young mans laying on their war buses wounded almost dead, Ivo decides to take them both home and heal them. Ahmed whose in side with Abkhazian it's told by Ivo that the other guy they saved, Niko whose Georgian, it's laying on the other room but hes even more hurt. Ahmed at this point can only think of killing the Georgian Niko, but Ivo makes him promise that under his roof they won't kill anyone. I gotta say that i find the music of this movie lovely in such a situation. My favorite actor it's gotta be Ivo, the way he makes these two guys see how stupid fighting for a land is, and how frustrating can get to be for people like Ivo and Margus who are living a peaceful life, but even like that Ivo has not complains about them, he knows they are young and he wants to make them see how human everyone is, even if they are Georgian or Chechen. While the movie keeps going both of them get to see Ivo as the wise old man that he is and they understand that killing each other won't do anything. I loved Ivo. I give this movie a 9/10 simply because i don't speak the language, and you may find this as an stupid excuse to not give it a 10 but i think that movies can be stronger when you understand the game of words. Other than that i could say this can be one of my most favorite movies, the acting is simply amazing, the movie is not too long which I find it nice. Everyone should see this movie, it has an strong message on war, on how we get to forget we are all the same, the same specie, and that we should always give the hand to anyone that needs it, since they may be needing that push from reality that some have. Touching movie.",

            "content": "I found out about this Estonian-Georgian film possibly mentioned briefly on a film review programme, but mainly because it was one of the foreign films getting attention during awards season, I hoped it would be worthy. Basically set in the early 1990s, in a rural village in Abkhazia, most Estonians have returned to their homeland upon the outbreak of war between the Georgian government and the Russian backed Abkhaz separatists, leaving settlements virtually empty. One of the few Estonians who has remained is elderly Ivo (Lembit Ulfsak), he is building crates for his Estonian friend and neighbour Margus (Elmo N\u00fcganen), who is harvesting his lucrative crop of unpicked tangerines before he will return to his family back in Estonia. The money will be good, but Margus admits he stayed so the fruit will not go to waste, he has made an arrangement with the military to assist in harvesting the fruit at a given date. One day outside Margus' property, opposing forces have a small battle, three soldiers die in the conflict, two remain and are seriously wounded, Georgian soldier Nika (Misha Meskhi) and Chechen mercenary Ahmed (Giorgi Nakashidze), Margus and his local physician friend Juhan (Raivo Trass), the two men still alive are nursed back to health. The two men regain consciousness, they realise they are from opposite sides, but they agree not to have conflict while in the house, Ivo has to make sure they will keep to their word, but also hide any evidence of the battle that took place, with the dead bodies being buried, and evidence of the two surviving soldiers. If the Georgian soldier or Chechen mercenary are discovered by either side of the fight, all of their lives will be jeopardised, but a firefight occurs, Margus is killed, while Nika is shot dead by a wounded Russian, Igo and Ahmed bury their bodies, Ivo reveals that his son is buried near Nika's grave, this is the reason he has not left, Ahmed leaves as he misses his family. I will be honest and say that I lost track a little bit with what was going on, probably because of having to concentrate on the subtitles as well, but I do know that the leading elderly actor gives a good performance, there are some beautiful colours, especially from the fruit picking moments, what I did follow was interesting, and the obvious loud sequences definitely got my attention, overall it is a worthwhile drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Good!",

But once it started, it was slow and boring, and I almost fell asleep numerous times.

I hope the Oscar nomination was a shot in the arm for film-making in Estonia, and that's always a good thing. But the film itself? Skip it, and watch \"No Man's Land\" instead if you're in the mood for a film like this.Finally, at least in the DVD in the United States, the subtitles were super-small, making it difficult to read.",

It is a slow film, yet it is not hesitant in its message that love is ultimately stronger than hate.A well-deserved effort that resulted in both Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for best foreign film.

            "content": "I wasn't familiar with Estonian cinema before Mandariinid (Tangerines), but I will definitely be keeping my eyes open for Zaza Urushadze's upcoming projects because this was a fulfilling experience. I know the Academy doesn't always get it right, but at least it gives me a chance to check out films that I wouldn't have heard of otherwise. Urushadze's greatest strength as a director here comes from focusing on the story, which he also wrote. It is a simple anti-war film with a powerful narrative and strong performances that benefit from an interesting premise. Urushadze doesn't try to astonish the audience with great visuals or overload us with gruesome action scenes like most war films, but rather focuses on the humanity of each character and does so by centering the story in a small local community where only two men remain. He reduces the Civil War taking place in the Apkhazian region and focuses it on how it affects two local Estonians who have decided to stay in their farmland instead of seeking safety back in Estonia. Ivo (Lembit Ulfsak) and Margus (Elmo Nuganen) are neighbors who work together. Margus has a tangerine plantation (which explains the somewhat terrible title) and Ivo is a carpenter who makes the boxes for their transportation so they collaborate together. Since the war broke out, everyone in the land has returned to Estonia, but these two men have decided to stay. Ivo is a determined and wise old man who doesn't take sides in the war. When a conflict breaks out in front of their home, two soldiers are seriously injured and Ivo takes them into his home. The soldiers (Giorgi Nakashidze and Misha Meskhi) are enemies and we are expecting the tension to break out once they fully recover. Ivo knows this, but he also believes he can teach them a lesson through his acts of kindness during this terrible time of war. The film is effective and accomplishes its purpose of delivering its anti-war message by focusing on the humanity of each one of the characters.Lembit Ulfsak delivers the best performance of the film. He gives a quiet and calmed performance. Despite all the hate and hurtful things the two soldiers say to each other, he is always the voice of reason reminding them that they all share the same land and have equal rights. Ulfsak expresses this inner peacefulness very well from the opening scene in which some local soldiers come searching for food. He is the kind of person that would help anyone, even those that consider him an enemy. Elmo Nuganen is also solid as Margus who has a strong relationship with Ivo and looks up to him. When the two injured soldiers appear at their doorsteps the balance is disrupted and the war comes knocking home. So we clearly see how war takes its toll on everyone, even those who have nothing to do with the fighting, affecting their business and their lifestyle. Giorgi Nakashidze and Misha Meskhi deliver solid roles as these enemies who call a truce out of respect for Ivo while they are in his home. I found the simple premise for this film as a strong way to carry out its message by reducing the big scale of the war to a small local village, but still portraying it as something terrible. Some might consider this too simple of a story or too improbable, but I think it was a quite affecting way to deliver its message. I enjoyed how Zaza Urushadze decided to approach this material and would definitely recommend it.",

I don't demand intricate stories to tell such simple, yet important lessons like the futility of war, but there's a difference between simplicity and predictability.The great interpretations from the cast (especially from Lembit Ulfsak (Ivo) and Giorgi Nakashidze (Ahmed)) and the compelling visuals of \"Tangerines\" can't save the film from its thin argument, and even though I don't doubt Urushadze's integrity to tell a story that touches such sensible topics from Estonia's recent History, he can't turn it more compelling than any given Hollywood war movie.",

It is a conflict from the early-1990's that was barely mentioned in certain history classes and quickly forgotten about by many. But for those were involved, as with any conflict, it was a very big deal.The film delivers a fictional narrative within this setting, about a man who stays behind in the warzone to harvest his tangerines, which are his livelihood. He inadvertently becomes involved in the conflict on a small scale.It is a moral tale and one we can all learn from. What makes it so good is the fact that it feels so real. Storytellers of the past told such moral tales in the forms of allegories or metaphors, with big overarching moral themes that disrupted the suspension of disbelief. Shakespeare, for example, wrote characters who acted like characters in a play. They were two-dimensional and had a single goal and spoke in verse.In Tangerines, however, the characters and their actions are totally within the bounds of normal reality. Although it is fictional, it could very easily have happened exactly as told in the film. I believe that is what makes it so effective, and I recommend this film to anyone willing to give it a watch.Thanks for reading!",

'Anti-war', 'despite different nationalities our values are the same' kind of movie. It sounds banal, we all know that, but it the movie it is shown more subtle. Few days later i still remember it and think of fate of Ivo.Despite all my critics i still think it is definitely worthy of being watched and give it a ten.Talking about Oscars Not sure if it is really worthy of being nominated for Oscar. To be fair, the only movie worthy of being nominated for Oscars was 'Leviathan'. 'Leviathan' is has better cinematography, more impressive scenes. Tangerines is noticeably inferior, than Leviathan movie. However it beats all other nominees.",

It can even be a great one in parts.  It's not what I would call a great movie from beginning to end, but I do think it offers a really compelling and satisfying story.  Part of it is the fact that the story really is very simple.  I don't mean that in a derogatory manner whatsoever, I just mean the fact that the story is simply told.  The film takes place during the Chechen-Georgian war and has two characters from each side injuring themselves after a small conflict with each other and being taken in Ivo into his house until they heal up accordingly.  The film deals with these two having to co-exist in the same house despite the fact that both want to kill each for, literally, no reason other than the fact that their respective sides are at war.  So it's an interesting, but not necessarily unique, approach.  I wouldn't say that this is so much an anti-war movie as much as it is accepting of the fact that these things will keep on happening until the end of time, but it explores simple themes about peace, conflict and how war doesn't really solve anything.  It only begets more and more violence.  The fact of the matter is that these two, Nika and Ahmed, the soldiers, would have kept at it if not for the fact that Ivo's wise ways got through to them.  The film isn't sentimental in any way whatsoever, so I do think that it reaches the natural conclusion of Nika and Ahmed gaining some small aspect of respect for each other despite their varying differences.  I like how despite the seriousness of the film, they do give you these little moments of calm and even comedy.  Those moments never last.  In fact, on almost every occasion, something worse happens.  So the movie keeps you on your toes, anything could happen at any time.  That's how volatile the situation the characters find themselves in.  The film definitely has a really strong message, but, the great thing about it is the fact that it doesn't force its message down on you.  It has its moral and all of that, but it never forces you to think alike.  You make your own conclusions.  I've always been anti-war, so the film provided a message I agree with, but not because it was forceful or heavy-handed in getting it across.  The film also benefits from some really strong performances.  Like all around.  Lembit Ulfsak, who plays Ivo, is phenomenal here.  He's understated yet powerful all at the same time.  Strong character development is also prevalent here.  So, really, not much to complain about when talking about this movie.  I felt there was something missing that would've pushed it into greatness, but this is still a really strong movie with a great performances and really good storytelling.  It's on Amazon Prime, so get to watching.",

Why? Because a movie should leave you with things to talk about and this movie didn't make me feel any emotions different than the ones I was experiencing while going to see the movie. I'm happy to say that it's well acted, but I also have to say that this movie is really boring, and it's actually the most boring movie that I've seen so far this year. On top of that, it's only 87 minutes including credits. I've said this before and I'll say it again: I have no problem with slow movies. Some of my favorite movies of recent years--Under the Skin, Foxcatcher, Somewhere, The Rover, etc.--are very slow movies where the progression of their stories aren't verbalized and instead focus on small, peculiar things that other movies don't. Tangerines, however, focuses on the same kind of stuff that we've seen before, but does it without ever fully engaging its audience. I'd be hard pressed to think of a full two minutes where I was fully involved in what was happening because the movie's themes aren't particularly unique. There are two characters that hate each other and a neutral third party that seems to bridge the gap between the two, and the movie examine their relationship from an anti-war angle. That's fine, but it becomes such a wasted concept in how uninteresting the entire movie is. Even the final ten minutes or so--the only part that really works--don't work like they should because the proceeding 75 minutes did nothing for me. When a movie makes absolutely no impact on you other than its solid performances, it's pretty clear that it didn't do its job. Instead of thinking about the movie while leaving the theater, I was wondering why The Academy nominated this for Best Foreign Language Film over Mommy or Two Days, One Night, and it in turn made those movies look even better in comparison. 4.3/10, bad, two thumbs down, below average, etc.",

Tangerines is an Estonian film directed by Zaza Urushadze nominated this year for the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. It is, essentially, a film about the collateral damages and stupidity of war, shown in an extremely small scale.\n\nIvo, the protagonist, is just a person trying to keep his tangerine business in the midst of yet another pointless war. This time between the Abkhazians and the Georgians in 1992. Almost alone in the countryside, Ivo's family was forced to go back to Estonia but he remains there because he still believes there is some goodness in humans. Thanks to the war and some wounds, Ivo takes care of an Abkhazian militant and a Georgian soldier and makes sure they literally don't slaughter each other, striving for tolerance above all like a citizen of the world would do.\n\nI'm not Georgian, nor Estonian, nor Abkhazian. I'm not even European. However the beauty of Tangerines is that I can identify with the characters and at the same time, join the cause for tolerance, because that is supposed to be a universal value. As Ivo said, it does not matter that we come from different places. Characters like him should be celebrated worldwide because through him we can see global awareness, respect, and tolerance.  The world needs more movies like this, honestly, the world just keeps getting worse, but maybe art can make a difference. Tangerines is definitely one of the best films I have seen this year.",

I know the Academy doesn't always get it right, but at least it gives me a chance to check out films that I wouldn't have heard of otherwise. Urushadze's greatest strength as a director here comes from focusing on the story, which he also wrote. It is a simple anti-war film with a powerful narrative and strong performances that benefit from an interesting premise. Urushadze doesn't try to astonish the audience with great visuals or overload us with gruesome action scenes like most war films, but rather focuses on the humanity of each character and does so by centering the story in a small local community where only two men remain. He reduces the Civil War taking place in the Apkhazian region and focuses it on how it affects two local Estonians who have decided to stay in their farmland instead of seeking safety back in Estonia. Ivo (Lembit Ulfsak) and Margus (Elmo Nuganen) are neighbors who work together. Margus has a tangerine plantation (which explains the somewhat terrible title) and Ivo is a carpenter who makes the boxes for their transportation so they collaborate together. Since the war broke out, everyone in the land has returned to Estonia, but these two men have decided to stay. Ivo is a determined and wise old man who doesn't take sides in the war. When a conflict breaks out in front of their home, two soldiers are seriously injured and Ivo takes them into his home. The soldiers (Giorgi Nakashidze and Misha Meskhi) are enemies and we are expecting the tension to break out once they fully recover. Ivo knows this, but he also believes he can teach them a lesson through his acts of kindness during this terrible time of war. The film is effective and accomplishes its purpose of delivering its anti-war message by focusing on the humanity of each one of the characters. \n\nLembit Ulfsak delivers the best performance of the film. He gives a quiet and calmed performance. Despite all the hate and hurtful things the two soldiers say to each other, he is always the voice of reason reminding them that they all share the same land and have equal rights. Ulfsak expresses this inner peacefulness very well from the opening scene in which some local soldiers come searching for food. He is the kind of person that would help anyone, even those that consider him an enemy. Elmo Nuganen is also solid as Margus who has a strong relationship with Ivo and looks up to him. When the two injured soldiers appear at their doorsteps the balance is disrupted and the war comes knocking home. So we clearly see how war takes its toll on everyone, even those who have nothing to do with the fighting, affecting their business and their lifestyle. Giorgi Nakashidze and Misha Meskhi deliver solid roles as these enemies who call a truce out of respect for Ivo while they are in his home. I found the simple premise for this film as a strong way to carry out its message by reducing the big scale of the war to a small local village, but still portraying it as something terrible. Some might consider this too simple of a story or too  improbable, but I think it was a quite affecting way to deliver its message. I enjoyed how Zaza Urushadze decided to approach this material and would definitely recommend it.",
