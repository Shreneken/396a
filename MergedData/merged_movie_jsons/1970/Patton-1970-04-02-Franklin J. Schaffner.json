            "content": "It's a splendidly done movie. Scott's performance is powerful. He does everything but reach out, grab you by the shirt, and shout in your face. Karl Malden is likable and full of common sense, but he is the only person in the movie whom we can grasp as a character -- except for Scott himself. Scott is as good at his job as Patton was, and in fact the quality of his performance is less volatile than Patton's own, with virtually no weak spots.That's part of the problem. Patton himself. I suppose that like most people he had a \"good\" side -- loving family, played with his dog, collected stamps and whatnot. But as good and aggressive a general as he was, he wasn't a particularly likable guy. It's easy to demand that everyone in your command have shoes as shiny as yours -- especially when you've got some black PFC doing your shining for you.The movie is noticeably slanted. Patton's weakness, like Coriolanus's, is ambition. Sometimes it's played for laughs. He carried the stars of a Lieutenant General around with him until word of his promotion comes down, then immediately has them pinned on. But only three times is his meanness illustrated without tongue in cheek. (1) During a conversation with Bradley he reveals that he's disobeyed orders by sending his army on a mission to beat Montgomery in taking Sicily. He calls the attack \"a reconnaissance in force\". He receives an order to get his troops back where they belong and tells his aide to send the message back because it's garbled. \"A simple old soldier,\" Bradly comments disapprovingly. (2) He orders General Truscott to stage some amphibious landings which will help him take Messina before Montgomery. Truscott complains that they're not prepared to do that without heavy casualties. Patton lies down and threatens to fire Truscott and get someone else to do the job. (3) While visiting a hospital and presenting the wounded with decorations he comes across a soldier whose nerves are shot and who is weeping, and Patton slaps him twice and sends him back to the front.His mean streak went beyond those incidents. He used to practice his arrogant, threatening scowl in front of the mirror. Whether or not it improved the GI's morale to wear neckties in combat is, at best, arguable. (What would Patton make of the Israeli army?) But the simple historical fact is that the movie pitches even these \"mean\" incidents at the audience like softballs. He didn't just slap a soldier who was feeling sorry for himself, which is the picture the film presents. He slapped two soldiers on separate occasions, one suffering from combat fatigue (which is no joke) and the other from malaria and other illnesses. Patton also enjoyed an intimate relationship with his niece, a Red Cross donut girl, who accompanied him in England and France, much to his wife's displeasure.Those slapping incidents cost Patton a bit in the way of professional esteem but it didn't cost any lives. And it didn't cause him any remorse. Even in his \"apology,\" he claims he was trying to \"shame a coward.\" What DID cost lives was Patton's cobbling together a small task force to liberate a POW camp in Germany shortly before the war's end, when such a dangerous move was no longer necessary. \"Task Force Baum\" was recognized by its leaders for the lost cause it was, a plunge deep into enemy territory without any backup. There were 53 vehicles and 294 men. All the vehicles were destroyed or captured. Twenty-five of the men were killed, 32 wounded, and almost all the rest captured. The purpose of the mission, it was tacitly agreed, was to rescue Patton's son-in-law.His fitful harshness towards his troops is usually justified in the movie, even if it looks excessive. The soldier-slapping scene is preceded by one in which Patton kneels in the hospital, whispers something to a soldier whose face is covered by bandages, and lovingly places a medal on his chest. Next thing he encounters: Tim Considine, fully dressed, sitting up, and sobbing with self pity. Earlier, when Patton asks a cook why he's not wearing sidearms, the cook laughs genially and replies, \"Sidearms? Why, hell, General, I'm a cook!\" I missed the part where cooks learn to laugh in the face of orders from a general, but it gives Patton a chance to tear everybody a new one.Everyone paid for Patton's ambition and vanity, even those not under his command. The gasoline and other supplies he diverted to his own forces during the run through France helped him alright, but they were also needed elsewhere.The movie's subtitle is \"Salute to a Rebel.\" Very stylish for 1970 audiences, but the material is presented in such a way as to leave us with a lingering admiration for Patton's genius and bullheadedness. What kind of \"rebel\" was he? He was more of an authoritarian Arschloch than anybody else in his greater vicinity.What the writers, the director, and George C. Scott have given us, to paraphrase someone else, is not a warts-and-all portrait but the suggestion that there is something heroic about a wart.I gave the movie high marks because it's as well done as it is -- disregarding its relationship to Patton himself. I didn't mind so much that the wrong tanks were used and that the production could only find two Heinkel 111s in flying condition. The location shooting is great, the cinematography crisp and unimpeachable, the score one of Goldsmith's best, and Scott's performance deserved whatever awards it got.",

            "review_title": "A fine epic about a \"pure warrior.\"",
            "content": "The war epic was revived with Franklin Schaffner's admirable 'Patton.' Schaffner's control of his film is impressive, and the various campaign sequences are strikingly photographed through an audaciously wide lens...George C. Scott was commonly referred to as a 'character actor' in view of his remarkably extensive range... Oddly for a character actor, Scott was almost always the same person on screen vigorous to the point of pugnacity, acting with his chin the way other actors do with their eyes-yet revealing, in his own eyes, unsuspected depths of humor and intelligence...Now few actors have ever been so convincing in such a powerful and colorful character... Only Peter 0'Toole's eccentric T.E. Lawrence comes immediately to mind... Both, he and Scott, create their characters out of complementary contradictions... Lawrence detests the savagery of war but embraces it... Patton cannot separate the conduct of war from his own personal glorification, and both actors are given large canvases upon which to work...Screenwriters Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North and director Franklin J. Schaffner introduce a 16th-century warrior lost in contemporary times... He is a brilliant and military historian, with a hazardous speech...Magnificently uniformed, and wearing his ivory-handled pistol, George S. Patton steps up, against a backdrop of the Stars and Stripes, before an unseen gathering of soldiers defining himself in unambiguous terms as a man who revels in war... The scene is cut to a close shot of two scorpions crawling across the body of a dead soldier at the Kasserine Pass, Tunisia... The camera then pulls back to reveal a harsh look at American casualties with dozens of Arabs busily stripping more bodies...The American Army has just suffered its first defeat at the hands of the Germans... Patton's first job is to restore the morale and discipline of the dispirited troops of his new command... His experience with tanks led General Dwight Eisenhower to place him in charge of one of the three task forces invading North Africa in 1943...According to his theory of war, Patton would drive all the way to Palermo on the northern coast of Sicily, slicing the island in half... But his finest moment comes during the massive German counteroffensive in the Ardennes... By the time the Germans feared him above all other Allied generals... Schaffner turns to the Germans for comments on Patton's abilities... They expect him to lead a major invasion... When he was sent to Corsica, the Germans were convinced he would lead an invasion of southern France... When he was sent to Cairo, they feared for an invasion through the Balkans...Patton is seen reprimanded by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for indiscreet political statements... As an able tactician who promotes himself to three-star general before it's officially approved by the U.S. Senate, Patton proves himself as the most effective American field commander of the European war... Behind his audacity lay an imaginative planning and a shrewd judgment... Patton knows that loyalty to a leader would inspire his men to take on objectives against all odds... His strict discipline, toughness, and disregard of classic military rules, contributed to his advance across France and Germany...The modest and conscientious Omar Bradley, commander of the U.S. 12th Army Group, who had served under Patton in Africa and Sicily as a deputy commander, found Patton to be a superb combat general, but hotheaded, profane, and unpredictable... Bradley ends now as Patton's superior... It was soon apparent that the two make a superb team... Patton's dash and drive in the field is a perfect complement to Bradley's careful planning...With the help of Bradley, Patton prepares to re-engage German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel... After he defeats Rommel's 10th Panzer Division at El Guettar thanks to his analysis of Rommel's published strategies, he shouts one of the greatest lines in war films: \"Rommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!\" At the same time, his rivalry with his Field Marshal Montgomery (hero of El Alamein) becomes more intense... Patton was motivated by a pride to reach his target before his British colleague, sometimes not for the purpose of the Allies...Karl Malden has the film's only other significant leading role, as the most capable, yet unpretentious general... Malden could be deduced from the number of major directors with whom he has worked... These include Cukor, Hathaway, Kazan, King, Preminger, Milestone, Vidor, Hitchcock, Brooks, Mulligan, Daves, Brando, Frankenheimer, Ford, Quine and Schaffner... In his best and most personal work he has succeeded in exploring depths of moral ambiguity rare in commercial cinema...Schaffner illuminates various sides of Patton's remarkable personality, presenting a dashing extrovert and attractive general, with a compassionate side...Touring an evacuation hospital in Sicily, Patton slaps an enlisted soldier twice calling him a 'yellow,' and threatens to shoot him, before two men forcibly remove him from the tent... The incident occurs because Patton's views of bravery and cowardice are so severely limited... The fighting general who has the imagination to write poetry and to believe that he has been reincarnated, in ancient Greece, at Carthage, and Moscow, cannot conceive of a psychological wound that he cannot see... The incident occurred after he prays at the bedside of one man severely injured... Patton whispers some words in his ear which the audience doesn't hear, then lays a medal on his pillow and gives him a gentle touch on his head... The portrait is so compelling that it's easy to overlook Patton's own final words in the film, \"All glory is fleeting.\"Franklin J. Schaffner's motion picture reveals an effective portrait of three men: Patton, Bradley, and the unseen Dwight Eisenhower... The film is a fine epic about 'a pure warrior, and a magnificent anachronism,' who loved war... The Academy Awards saluted 'Patton' capturing eight Oscars, including best picture, best director, best actor (Scott declined his well deserved Oscar), best screenplay, best editing, and best production design...",

            "content": ". . . and it's not even about the war.  There's no wall to wall action.  In fact, World War II is merely the setting \u0096 a backdrop so to speak \u0096 and the battles are all downplayed in favor of giving the audience a glimpse into the brilliance (or insanity) of the historically significant character, Patton.  From the script on up, everything plays out wonderfully to bring the famous general to life on screen, and after watching George C. Scott deliver his Oscar-worthy performance, I find it hard to believe there were a number of actors on the list above his name.George C. Scott's performance of Patton is one I consider the greatest given of any war film.  Patton is a champion for freedom while sometimes equally as much of a tyrant as the ones he's trying to put down, he's a monster and a hero, and neither he nor the filmmakers give a damn about political correctness.  I found the character to be an overly harsh prick, myself, but in some strange way, very likeable and sympathetic, and when watching the movie again I don't look at the screen and say, `Hey, there's George C. Scott.'  Instead it's, `Hey, there's Patton.'  Not very many film characters have a personality strong enough to overtake the actor playing them.  I appreciate that depth and that degree of realism, this attention to detail on the parts of Scott and Schaffner.  Schaffner surprised me by somehow managing to capture my interest on a subject matter I'd ordinarily write off as too silly (Planet of the Apes); two years later, he applied that same technical know how, craft, and intelligent storytelling towards a film whose subject appeals to me from the get go, and once again I'm impressed.  There are some great war films out today; however, Schaffner's take pursued the most unique perspective in all realms, and captured my imagination with such ease . . . I can't help but come back to it over other war films.And I have to comment on the score, which is not only one of my favorite Goldsmith scores but also one of my favorite war-film scores.  Jerry Goldsmith matched point for point the brilliance of Franklin Schaffner's vision, the depth of George C. Scott's performance, and somehow managed to captured the essence of both musically.  A good music score is one that tells the story of the film in its own unique voice.  Goldsmith's score has such a prominent voice in the experience of Patton, that to remove it would be the equivalent of removing Schaffner's direction or George C. Scott.   \nLastly, how accurate is the film?  Not a clue, and even if it is completely false, I don't care.  I've never been about writing history papers based on cinema experiences.  All I know for certain is that Patton is a very entertaining and well balanced movie that holds up very well thirty years later, and it's a film that can be admired for its craft.",

            "content": "This is a long but interesting character study of a real-life person: General George S. Patton, who also was a real \"character.\" Gen. Patton was one of the most famous military men of World War II, a super gung-ho leader who admittedly had an intense passion for battle. How much of this story is fact and how much is fiction, I don't know. Knowing Hollywood and knowing when this was made - during the heyday of the anti-war (Vietnam) movement - I have my suspicions, but for the sake of the review, I will assume all of this is true.Whatever political bias a filmmaker might have, Patton made for a good movie subject anyway and the story is interesting all the way, thanks to the acting of George C. Scott, who was astounding as Patton and gives one of the more memorable performances ever by an actor.Not only is Scott's acting superb, the widescreen photography is also good. Thank goodness DVDs came out so films like this could be seen in the aspect in which they were filmed. I can't imagine viewing this on formatted-to-TV images. I think much of this movie was filmed in Spain.I think the filmmakers also did a nice job of not overdoing the action scenes. When overdone, violence can get boring. The explosions and machine-gun fire was realistic, especially for a film that is now 36 years old. Going back to what's true and what isn't, if it was then Patton was a poor excuse for a Christian, which he claims to be here. For one thing, Christians don't believe in re-incarnation at Patton claims he did in the film. There are other comments, too, which shed a poor light on his \"religion,\" something Hollywood loves to point out.Nonetheless, if you enjoy character studies, this is one of the best. Patton's opening 6-minute speech before this huge American flag is a famous scene in movie history. That, and the rest of his performance and this movie in general, is one you won't forget.",

I thought the movie was very nicely tied together and I thought the reflections of Patton on the past was very necessary. Patton believed in reincarnation so in looking back at historical battles you can see how Patton developed his strategy. He was a student of great leaders and commanders and the movie developed that thought really well. The movie presented the characters, the actual war history, and the Germans extremely well and it is no wonder this movie received the awards it did. After watching this movie over and over again, I'm convinced that no one could have played Patton any better than George C. Scott. You can tell from the movie that he put everything he had into the character. My father-in-law was an officer under Patton in the 3rd. Army and has said over and again how realistic the movie is. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for an excellent re-telling of WWII history.",

Scott gives the performance of a lifetime if Patton watched this film he couldn't tell the difference himself. Scott portrays him the way he was, not the way he should be or the way we would like him to be. Patton is Patton, tough, resilient, fearless, sarcastic, angry, witty, cultured, charming, bull-headed, uncompromising, temperamental, and more patriotic than Uncle Sam on the 4th of July. The speech at the beginning with him in front of the American flag sets the tone. It's his way or the highway. And Patton is driving. His antics tick off the high command and rankle his subordinates but they all can't argue with his success. Karl Malden is his good friend and at times adversary General Bradley who is as resourceful as Patton is eccentric and they make a great pair. Every time Patton has a victory he screws it up by way of his gargantuan mouth. But he keeps going. When disaster strikes he always manages to pull defeat out of his rear and strike a blow for the 2nd Corps or the 3rd Army or whatever army he's commanding. His soldiers love him, his soldiers hate him, but his soldiers fight for him regardless because they know he's the best. Patton's rise is like Patton's fall, momentous. His last line is the most telling of all. \"They remind us that glory, like everything else, is fleeting.\" Glory may be fleeting but this movie won't be. Perhaps the best war movie in history.",

Answer: when you've got the character down so good you can say with assurance what he would have done given the chance. This is the movie bio to end all movie bios, a perennial on my all-time top ten list, with a career performance by Scott that defined Patton as much as Patton ever did. The film takes us from Africa through Sicily to the climatic run across France towards Germany, along the way exploring the general's complex and textured character. Picks and chooses among the real general's most notable moments, passing on his celebrated potty break on the crossing of the Rhine into Germany and his ill-fated attempt to relieve a POW camp. I suspect the portrayal is a tad overdone but forgivably so - Darren McGavin's later portrayal of Patton as a whiny weasel was much further from the mark. Supporting cast-mates Malden as Bradley and Bates as Mongomery are spot-on. I can't speak for you, but this movie is long and I'd still stick around to see more of George in action.",

My father fought in the Ardens during the Battle of the Bulge and he said the scene when Patton was marching up to get the 101st, with the heavy snow in the trees and the 88's blasting the tops of the trees off, took him right back to the heavy fighting where he was severely wounded.

            "content": "RELEASED IN 1970 and directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, \"Patton\" stars George C. Scott as the charismatic general during his WWII campaigns in North Africa and Sicily, as well as France & Germany following the Normandy invasion. After the invasion of Sicily, Patton was reprimanded for slapping a cowardly soldier suffering battle fatigue (in real life it was two soldiers on separate occasions in the course of eight days in August, 1943). The fiery general was removed from command for eleven months while his junior in age and rank, Omar Bradley (Karl Malden), was selected to command the First United States Army for the invasion of Normandy.Meanwhile, Patton was assigned to London as a decoy to deceive the Germans in a sham operation called Fortitude. The ruse was successful because the German High Command respected Patton more than any other Allied commander and deemed him crucial to any plan to invade mainland Europe. Immediately following the successful invasion, he was put in command of the Third Army in the final Allied thrust against Germany where the headstrong general, once again, proved his mettle as his forces favored speed and aggressive offensive action.Patton was an interesting character who maintained a flashy larger-than-life image in order to encourage his troops; and he didn't hesitate to get his hands dirty with them. While other officers tried to blend-in with the troops on the battlefield, Patton brazenly displayed his rank insignia. He was a romantic who valued bravery and tenacity above all. All this is effectively conveyed in this ambitious war flick. It's interesting to observe the North African and European theaters of the war from the standpoint of the Allied generals, mostly Patton and Bradley, rather than the typical perspective of the infantry.THE FILM WAS WRITTEN by Francis Ford Coppola with additional material from Edmund H. North (based on the factual accounts of Ladislas Farago & Omar N. Bradley). It runs 172 minutes and was shot in Spain, Algeria, Morocco, Crete and England, with the opening speech filmed at Bob Hope Patriotic Hall in Los Angeles.GRADE: A-",

            "review_title": "Fascinating portrait of the Allies' greatest general",
            "content": "A few years ago, I had the pleasure of reading \"The Patton Papers,\" a collection of Gen. Patton's diary entries and letters edited by Martin Blumenson.  Having seen the movie, I think that no actor has ever better captured the spirit of a man better than George C. Scott, nor has any movie better portrayed that spirit than PATTON.Patton was a man who lived for war.  World War II was the high point and culmination of his life.  He didn't fight for any principles, he didn't fight to defend freedom or democracy or any abstract idea; he fought because he loved fighting.  In his diaries you can read of his fear of flunking out of West Point; the prospect terrified him because he was certain that he would never be good at anything except being a general or a leader of a country.  As a leader of men, he was exceptional.  His speech at the beginning of the movie is vintage Patton, an almost exact reproduction of a speech Patton actually gave to Third Army.  It's tough, and no-nonsense; Patton lets you know in no uncertain terms that he is here to win, to destroy the enemy, and by God you'd better be too.  I don't know if Patton actually directed traffic on the roads as he is shown doing in the movie, but it was a very Pattonish thing to do.  Patton did on at least one occasion get out of his staff car and join a squad of G.I.'s in heaving a vehicle out of the mud. Try to imagine Montgomery doing that; the very thought is hilarious!Patton's character explains his treatment of his men.  To those who had been wounded fighting for him he was always kind and considerate.  But to those whose minds could not stand the horrible strain that war imposed on them, he was merciless; he could not comprehend the fact that other people didn't share his love of violence for violence' sake.  PATTON shows this aspect of his character very well.Karl Malden's Omar Bradley is shown in an almost father-like role; he sees and recognizes Patton's immense talents as a general, and uses them in spite of Patton's natural ability to antagonize everybody around him.  Not shown in the movie is Patton's unloveable characteristic of turning on his subordinates once they surpassed him in their careers.  Patton had nothing but good to say about Bradley, until Bradley was promoted over Patton's head, whereupon Patton savaged Bradley in his diary.  Patton did the same to Eisenhower.A general can have no higher compliment than the fear and respect of his adversaries, and as PATTON demonstrates, Patton was more feared by the Germans than any other Allied general, at least on the Western front.  As one German officer observes all too prophetically, \"the absence of war will destroy him [Patton].\"  And although mankind's single greatest stroke of good fortune in the 20th century was that Russia and America never came to blows, it is still hard not to feel sorry for Patton as he desperately seeks his superiors' approval to carry the war on eastward into the Soviet Union - anything, just to have a war to fight.  Patton is like an addict to a destructive drug.Hollywood has rarely given us such a textured and human portrait of a great man: cruel, often foolish in his relations with others, rude, and psychopathically attached to violence, but brave, dedicated, and loyal. Certainly those who, like myself, have Jewish blood, or who were otherwise marked for death by the Nazi state, all owe him a great debt of gratitude for his pivotal role in destroying that state.  And yet, had he been born German, Patton would surely have fought just as devotedly for the Nazi side. I'm glad he wasn't.Rating: **** out of ****.",

            "content": "Here is George C Scott in the role he was surely born to play. He fits the part as well as Paul Schofield fits Thomas Moore in 'A Man For All Seasons'.Scott's presentation of an ambitious, single-minded, overbearing man brimming with self-belief is wonderfully realised. You cannot imagine that he is anything but the general he pretends to be. At times likable and loathsome, we nevertheless care about him and his sometimes strange contradictions.. If not for his unpromising face and gravel-crusher voice GCS would surely have been one of the leading hero/ladies-men of his day. Yet despite the punished-looking expression, and the Dalek-with-a-sore-throat delivery, every feature and vocal tone manages to carry some subtle nuance of emotion and thought. Scott is a real actor, from a time when acting carried more weight than good looks. Ernest Borgnine cut a similar figure.This is a movie about a general. War takes second place. We get to know the kind of man responsible for the lives of thousands. We learn about his own personal and political wars, his likes and dislikes, and those who like and dislike him. There's a lot more of the latter. He shows us that heroes can sometimes be insufferable. They are often driven men who drive others just as hard and this excites resentment. Worse still it excites ingratitude. For however much we may despise them, they are needful to the hour. Without them we would be lost.There is war, and the action is perfectly adequate for the movie's vintage. But the real war is Patton's own. His victory is the victory of personal ambition.Other actors pale into insignificance. And maybe this was intended by the director. The only other instantly recognisable face is Karl Malden's, which is scarcely more ornamental. The budget is big and deservedly so. location-work is expansive, filming, lighting and editing all hit their targets.War-mongers like Patton may be discountenanced now in this politically-correct age of left-wing liberalism. But when the enemy begins banging at the gates - who ya gonna call? Very highly recommended.",

            "content": "My only complaint with this film is several of the battle scenes play way too long. The first one in N. Africa, especially, is tension-less muddle. Due to the narrative focus on the affairs of the generals the battles are not very good and after are hard to follow. This is exceedingly minor in context because of not only the fog of war but history is what history is. I mention this because despite this issue I rather like this film, despite Patton (the man) being a brute and authoritarian. He was not a 20th century man. That says more about him than the 20th century.The screenplay is, easily, the best part of the film. By the use of sarcasm and pointed barbs the film manages to place Patton the man in the proper context and despite Patton the man being pro-war make an anti-war film; it is really a very clever piece of writing that allows both hawks and doves to be really engaged with the storyline (which largely handles the history well). Best of all, this use of irony and sarcasm allows the film to show Patton as a complex, paradoxical and hypocritical figure. Patton the man loved the smell of battle but couldn't understand why fine young men had to die in war. He is a man who read his Bible every goddamn day. It is a sight to behold the mess and contradictions Patton lived by. And the screenplay effortlessly keeps the viewer orientated of what is happening in the war.Scott is of course tailored made for the role and he gives his best career performance. Malden is also really engaging. The technical aspects give the film its proper weight. This is an exemplar of what a biopic can be.",

            "content": "I saw this the same night I saw THE HURRICANE a movie that claims to be a bio-pic on Rubin Carter but which is nothing more than total fabrication . PATTON is an entirely different kettle of fish and while not being entirely accurate ( I'll come to that later ) does at least have many accurate points Undoubtedly the best aspect of the movie is George C Scott who is physically almost identical to George Patton . He captures the arrogant mannerisms of the American general very well and few and far between are movies where a performance like this dominates a movie . Ironically this is a case of where an Oscar for best actor was fully deserved and yet the recipient turned down the honour . There's also obviously a lot of thought gone into the screenplay as to where to begin and end the story . Do you start when Patton was a child and find out what motivated him to be a soldier ? Do you start when he fought in the American Expidionary force in France 1917-18 ? Do you finish the story with his death ? I think that writers Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H North have got the settings right with starting the story with the immediate aftermath of The Kasserine Pass and finishing the story while Patton was still alive . The screenplay itself is somewhat knowingly ironic as Patton spouts \" America has never and will never lose a war \" while it was becoming obvious in 1970 there was no way the US were going to be victors in Vietnam . It was a well known fact that Patton despised Monty and much of Patton's motives were of beating Montgomery as much as the Germans and this might have led to needless deaths of men under Patton's command . The screenplay while not exactly spelling this out does hint that his dislike of Monty led to Patton's reckless streak and the audience are left to make up their own mind on this issue . It was also well known that Patton wanted to throw back the Soviets from Eastern Europe ( Monty also had a hatred of communism but was far less vocal about it ) and there are conspiracy theories that the car accident that killed Patton wasn't an accident at all . Thankfully the screenwriters and producers have absolutely no time for any conspiracy theories of any kind While being a good movie PATTON fails to be great one simply because niggling little faults creep into the movie like historical inaccuracies . In the aftermath the Germans discuss the battle of Kasserine Pass where \" The Americans were led by the British general Anderson \" Who was Anderson ? The Americans who were badly defeated at the battle were led by American general Lloyd Fredendall without doubt the worst allied general of the war and it was this that led to Patton being appointed to his post . Rommel is portrayed as having the utmost respect for Patton and his American troops but in reality this wasn't actually the case . Throughout the war Erwin Rommel had contempt for American equipment ( With good reason since German Panther and Tiger tanks were far superior to the American built Shermans and the same applied to preceding equipment ) and servicemen and counted Monty as his arch nemesis not Patton . Also as with most American war movies made round about this time the tank battles fought between Americans and Germans seem to be composed of both sides using American tanks built in the 1950s All in all a bio-pic that while being better than many others isn't flawless but like I said if you want to see how NOT to make a bio-pic watch THE HURRICANE",

The United States was still in the thick of the Vietnam war, and the country was extremely polarized between the hawks and the doves. Then along comes Patton, with a portrayal of a rebellious General who was always being put in his place by the establishment - even though he was, of course, a major establishment figure (generals aren't usually the most liberal or progressive types). Eisenhower (unseen) and the media are portrayed as unsympathetic to the maverick Patton, who is so single-minded in his determination to defeat the Germans you have to root for him, despite his boorish behavior.And that is why Patton works - you have an unambiguous war against and unambiguous evil - Nazi Germany. Whereas Vietnam might have been a tough conflict for even its supporters to explain, World War Two was quite simple - we were the good guys, and they WERE the bad guys. And so you COULD root for the US Army and Patton without feeling a tinge of guilt.\nAlso superb in the film is everyman Karl Malden as General Omar Bradley, providing the stable and workmanlike leader (and one who rises quicker in the ranks due to it) to Patton's egomaniac.And Yes, George C. Scott delivers a career-defining performance that is one for the books. Could Brando or Telly Savalas have pulled off the role as well? I don't think so - it was just tailor made for Scott.",

Patton, along with all other documents at the end of the war before retreating.I was only twelve when this film came out, so I was not so interested in the news in detail at the time. But this film indeed is a brilliant anachronism if you think about it. A film that seems to be glorifying war at the peak of anti-war sentiment in the United States concerning the Vietnam War. And yet it was a commercial and critical success and won the Best Picture Oscar.To this day I wonder why? For sure it is a great piece of cinema. Just look at what had to be a confusing first scene to the then middle aged veterans of the second world war who bought a ticket. With an oversized American flag as a backdrop, George C. Scott as the titular Patton gives a profanity laced speech on winning, war, and Americans that tells you exactly who Patton is. Fun fact: Francis Ford Coppola wrote this scene and was fired because the suits at Fox thought it was a stupid introduction. Somehow the speech was kept in the movie and Coppola ended up winning an Oscar for best original screenplay.After watching this film several times and asking myself - \"but what does it mean?\" I feel that Patton the film doesn't seem to have any real interest in being a veiled metaphor so much as it just wants to tell the story of a really weird, really interesting guy who just happened to be at the right place and the right time in history. It's not called \"Blood and Guts: An American General\". It's just called \"Patton\". It's just about him. He's a guy who knows who he is and his weaknesses and has no use for politics. And that is ironic if you realize that Nixon watched this film repeatedly trying to figure out how to deal with the Vietnam War and kept a biography of Patton at his bedside.I love it because it is a great character study with a brilliant performance by Scott. And that rousing score makes me want to stand up and salute. I'd recommend it. It is a timeless piece of movie making about when we Americans were truly on the right side of history.",

            "content": "Franklyn Shaffer's \"Patton\" opens with its most emblematic image: General George S. Patton Jr. played by the coincidentally namesake George C. Scott, standing in front of a giant American flag, to deliver one of the greatest cinematic speeches. Yet the film is too 'intelligent' to be labeled as gratuitously patriotic. The Best Picture winner of 1971 is a thought-provoking exaltation of warfare through the portrayal of a man who loved his country but loved fighting even more, and embraced victory with such passion he became its own incarnation. General De Gaulle began his Memoir by stating: \"All my life, I had a certain idea about France \u0085\". In the same vein, Patton's speech expresses a certain idea, ideal, of America, a domineering and strong country crystallizing all the prestigious characteristics of the previous victorious nations. Half-mad, half-genius, General Patton believed in reincarnation, a faith driven by the passion in History that nourished his mind with the exploits of Caesar, Hannibal, Napoleon, Frederick the Great, and to a certain extent, even an enemy like Rommel, whom he read the book, was respected for his war tactics. \"I was there\" loved to retort Patton, referring to historical battles, with a crazy smirk that no one ever dared to contradict. In his mind, America was the Roman Empire's reincarnation that provided him the ultimate opportunity to finally fulfill his dreams of conquest, victory and prestige. More than pro-American, he's supra-American: his ideals indeed transcended the limited barriers of a nation; as he repeated, he's not a politician, and certainly not a diplomat, his job is to fight, and to lead his Army to Victory, victory or annihilation. \"The very thought of losing is hateful to Americans\", which gets me back to the opening scene. There's so much to say about it this marvelous piece of \"inspirational brainwashing\", written by an Oscar-winning Francis Ford Coppola.I say 'brainwashing', because the words work, there's something authoritarian in this unique raspy voice that resonates in the hearts of all the listeners. I'm sure it made many Americans proud to have had such a great leader and non-American wish they could have such a leader. I'm sure many of us younger generation, wished we could prove our value on the battlefield and as for the anti-war people, there's still a possibility to admire a man who was faithful to his principles. Feared or respected, I don't think there was a way not to admire the man, even secretly. Hell, even the enemy admired George Patton.And how couldn't they? Patton was a bigger-than-life foul-mouthed idealist, in other words: a natural-born leader. And the genius in Scott's performance relies on the way we never cease to doubt over Patton's capability to win the War, and his unpopularity among his own peers, make him all the more appealing. No General would have slapped a weeping officer, victim of shell-shock, and whether Patton was right or wrong to do what he did in the second most emblematic scene of the film, we feel that it's precisely the kind of behavior that only a great man would have done. A great nation needs a great army, therefore great soldiers. Ego? Yes, but indispensable to inculcate this very \"idea of America\".\"They never know when you're acting and when you're not\" says an aide, pointing out Patton's talent, he's convincing and his convincing craziness is the expression of his ferocious attachment to his personal vision. Did all the great men believe in God? I don't know but I'm sure they did believe in Destiny, therefore on a mysterious God-like vision that wrote the course of events in the right way. Did all the great men believe in Destiny? It's precisely what made them great, their ability to foreshadow the future, to see what had to be done. Patton was a visionary. He had his opinion on the war in Europe, on the conflict with the Russians, and he knew that a man like him was born to meet his Destiny. Beyond George C. Scott's magnificent performance, there's also Francis Ford Coppola's gripping script (we can't help but feel that Lieutenant Kilgore from \"Apocalypse Now\" owes to Scott's portrayal) and paralleling the War, if one can't be lost given the right leader, right artillery, spirit, weapons, a movie with the right writing, directing, music \u2013who can forget Jerry Goldsmith's catchy tune- and acting, can't fail either. But although it had a fair deal of supporting performances, apart from Karl Malden's depiction of Omar Bradley, no one could hold a candle to Scott. He carried the film and embodied to the most infinite details Patton's charisma. Even when he defied the Academy by refusing his Award, there was a sort of Patton-esque irreverence in Scott's attitude. And Scott indeed made me believe that one man can change the course of War. Ironically, Scott was so omnipresent that the best scenes to give insights about his aura belonged to the German side, starting by Rommel's decision to wipe out Patton's army before he did so, you could tell in his eyes when he was told about Patton that he realized he met his match. In another scene, a General expresses his disbelief that the American Army would ban Patton because of a vulgar slap, and at the end, you could clearly see a respect toward the \"pure warrior\", and \"living anachronism\", a Master of War who could only be destroyed by an absence of War.Anachronism, yes \u0085 \"Patton\" also respected his enemies, as they belonged to the same race: fighters. With his vision of chivalry, bravura, he despised the bombs that could be dropped automatically, wars without fights, without heroes of cowards. I wonder what he would have thought about the two Hiroshima and Nagazaki bombs, one thing for sure, If Patton's state of mind didn't belong to his era, his aura could appeal to any country",

According to several vets I got to talk to (who actually served under the real Patton!), George C. Scott's portrayal was spot-on. A few observations on the movie: Even when I was a kid, seeing Patton when it came out in 1970, I was suspicious of the tanks used in that battle scene in North Africa. Even then, they didn't look like the classic German tanks...Patton's speech in the beginning of the movie was edited for content. If you ever read the original version of his speech, it makes the movie version sound like a church sermon.I also wished that the movie had pointed out that in WW1, Patton commanded the first ever American tank battalion, and was severely wounded in battle, yet kept fighting until he just about passed out from  loss of blood. I thought this should have been brought out that he had practiced what he preached... Gen. Omar Bradley: portrayed in the movie as Patton's \"buddy\", he was nothing of the sort. Jealous of Patton, the real life Bradley would go to Eisenhower behind Patton's back to stymie George's success.Monty: Sorry, Monty fans, but the movie points out one historical fact. Monty usurped needed gas and supplies from Patton in September of '44 for his disastrous \"Market Garden\" attack (watch  Richard Attenborough's \"A Bridge Too Far\" as a companion movie to \"Patton\"). Thanks to Monty, the war went on much longer than it probably would have if Patton had been allowed to drive into Germany. Patton's arrogance helped win battles. Monty's arrogance gave us the Battle of the Bulge, the fire bombing of Dresden, not to mention countless Jewish lives lost. Patton had the Germans reeling in the fall of 1944, and, as the movie pointed out, had the army in just the right place at the right time to end it. Unfortunately, thanks to Monty's political pull and crappy generalmanship, the war went on longer than it should have...",

The cinematography, costumes and scenery are magnificent, and Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful score ranks up there with his best. The direction is impeccable, the script is wonderfully written and the story is compelling a vast majority of the time.

            "content": "\"All victory is fleeting,\" says a war wary George S. Patton (George C. Scott) in the last reel of the infamous 1970 film Patton. He had successfully led the invasion of Africa during WWII and commanded the U.S. Seventh army during the invasion of Sicily. After the invasion of Normandy, he led and commanded the U.S. Third army in a rapid armored drive to relieve allied soldiers experiencing the Battle of the Bulge. Throughout the war he was admired by his troops, the allied command and even his adversaries in Germany.Yet Patton's hard-driving personality and aggressive eagerness towards battle made him a bit of a pariah at times. His showmanship, controversial statements towards the Russians and vulgar morale speeches to his men ultimately overshadowed his accomplishments. Eisenhower stated that his lack of tact was a flaw which limited his leadership potential, in spite of his many accomplishments.Patton remains a controversial figure even to this day though his profile was likely raised by the release of the Academy Award winning movie bearing his name. In it director Franklin J. Schaffner doesn't paint the man in hagiographic tones, nor does he make him a dilettante. He and screenwriters Edmund H. North and Francis Ford \"I made Godfather (1972)\" Coppola wisely checks under the hood to see what drives a man of such particular talents. As the various war campaigns unfold, we see a considerable intelligence at play; along with a tremendous ego. Patton, as George C. Scott plays him, finds comfort and honor in the savagery of war. He imagines past lives where he had seen battle and is insulted by soldiers suffering from shell-shock. \"You, know George, you'd have made a great field Marshal for Napoleon, if you'd lived in the 18th Century.\" Says a British General to the esteemed Patton; \"Oh, but I did, Sir Alex, I did,\" retorts Patton.Patton's most melancholic scenes, such as his spat with General Bradley (Karl Malden) and forced relief of the Seventh army are interiors while his largest triumphs take place outdoors. To take advantage of a wider canvas than his successful blockbuster The Planet of the Apes (1968), Schaffner made most of the action and drama to take place in vast and awe-inspiring settings. All the interiors are comparatively short scenes, often taking place in tents, just out of reach of rugged terrain. Even then the viewing audience can see open flaps, windows and corridors glimpsing at natural surroundings within the peripheries.The film was shot on 70mm film and was meant to accommodate a large curved Dimension 150 screen. Think a Samsung 4K HDTV only three stories tall. Only two films were released though the cinematographic process: Patton and The Bible (1966). While technology of this magnitude and excess has been done before in films like How the West Was Won (1962), Patton brought in a new age of pan-screen presentation that would pave the way for films like Star Wars (1977), shot for a Panavision cinematographic process and ultimately Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) filmed for 2K Digital Intermediate. In other words, Patton was among one of the first films to perfect the large screen IMAX-type experience that we all love and are used to. As a result, the action is larger than life featuring some of the best faux-battle scenes ever captured on film. As for the infamous speech at the beginning of the film; the larger canvas makes the tableau truly breathtaking.Patton was not a man before his time nor was he a man immersed in the past. He was the right man, at the right time, there for the right reasons. Was he as brilliant as General Ulysses S. Grant or as foolhardy as Captain George A. Custer? The real life of such a distinguished and complicated man can never be surmised asking such questions. What I can conclude is based on the performance of George C. Scott Patton is an accomplished film. With the inclusion of new technology and sympathetic characterization provided by the confident writing and directing of Franklin J. Schaffner, Edmund H. North and Francis Ford \"I made Apocalypse Now (1979) too\" Coppola, Patton is an incredible and unforgettable cinematic experience.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Even with George C. Scott loudly saying that he would refuse the Academy Award should it be given him for Best Actor of 1970, so dominating and domineering is his portrayal, I'm not sure the Academy had any other choice. He's that good in the part.You watch Patton it's like watching a wide screen color newsreel of World War II from the George S. Patton point of view. The film takes you from Patton taking over the II Corps in the North African desert after the defeat at Kasserine Pass right through V.E. day and after.All the things that contribute to Patton's legend are brought to life, his achievements, his braggadocio, even those character flaws that allowed for no weakness in others, we see in full view. Scott really got inside the heart and soul of General Patton. Patton had an uncomfortable knack of living up to his billing, at least it was uncomfortable enough for his critics. The only other role of substance and this is really the only weakness of the film is that of Karl Malden as Omar Bradley. Though personality wise they were as far apart as you can get, in real life and in the movie they had great respect and even affection for each other. The other personalities of World War II appear mostly as paste board figures, maybe with the exception of Edward Binns as Walter Bedell Smith, Eisenhower's hard-nosed chief of staff.Ike is never seen in the film yet he looms over the action as an unseen presence of great wisdom. Wisdom Ike had indeed, after that soldier slapping incident in Sicily, it took considerable guts for Ike to bring Patton back. Patton the film came out a year after Ike's death and he had and still has wellsprings of affection that run deep with the American public.Patton's finest hour was at the Battle of the Bulge in the relief of the 101st Airborne at Bastogne. His relief there, accomplished within 48 hours and racing north in France during the freezing winter, broke the back of Hitler's last gambit for a negotiated peace instead of an unconditional surrender. He said he'd do it and did it, there was never a question about his ability after that.I first saw the film during basic training in Fort Polk, Louisiana. That line during Scott's opening speech shoveling manure in Louisiana never failed to bring the house down.Scott in refusing the Oscar did a very classy thing. He donated the Oscar to the Patton Museum in Fort Campbell, Kentucky.George S. would be proud of George C.",

            "review_title": "George C. Scott= General Patton",
            "content": "For those who know a little history, you would know who General George S. Patton is. You would know that he is served in World War Two as one of the top American generals on the European battlefront. He was a very smart man, but also an eccentric man. His eccentric manners is what took him away from taking part of D-Day. But there is no denying the influence he had on the war. Without his leadership, who knows how the war would have turned out. In 1970, a movie about his life came out and it was well-received by nearly everyone who has seen it. The movie was worked on by close associates of Patton, such as General Omar Bradley. An interesting fact is the producers of the film contacted the Patton family for information\u0085..only a day after Patton's widow was laid to rest so it's a sad matter-of-fact that the producers didn't get any help from Patton's family. I remember vividly looking forward to this movie, and luckily I can join the crowd of people who adored this film.From the moment I see George C. Scott walking onstage as Patton to deliver his iconic speech in front of a sprawling American flag, I knew this was going to be a great movie. Every scene is captivating especially when Scott is in it, but the opening scene is the greatest, most powerful scene in the movie. The above quote I featured is part of the speech and immediately you can tell what kind of man Patton was. Patton was a man who took no crap from anybody and was a man who dearly loved his country. He spoke with such colorful language (although that idea was exaggerated in the film) and he had a way to make those words count. He was a man of perfection. You can see that during a scene where he slaps a soldier for being in a hospital for depression instead of battle injuries. That caused him a fall from grace, but you can see the man Patton was. The movie does an exemplary job in making Patton a lifelike character on the big screen.This isn't your typical birth-to-death biography. This is a biography that covers Patton during the wartime years. The movie makes a point in showing what a fine general he was and how he positively contributed to the war, but it did not hold back on showing him as an eccentric man. The scenes where he drags his very scared puppy around everywhere he goes is just one of those examples. The film begins with his conquests in Libya as he drives German general Rommel out of the country. Then we see a downfall of his due to his big mouth and incident where he slaps the soldier. Then we see a comeback as Patton commands the Allies on the European front mowing down Germans left and right as they move closer to Berlin.The main actor in the film, of course, is George C. Scott who delivers a splendid performance as Patton. In fact, this may be the best performance of Scott's long career and he had a wonderful career. The performance works on various levels. Scott is an on screen presence to be reckoned with and he follows the oldest rule in the acting handbook-to become the character. I felt I was watching Patton the entire time, despite the mannerisms of Scott. But also you can draw parallels between the two men. Scott is seen as a recluse in Hollywood because he was so eccentric. He had the extreme talent, but his personality made him like an outcast. It was a foregone conclusion he was going to win the Oscar for Best Actor (and he did), but the question was if he was going to personally accept the award. He did not stating he did not like the Academy or acting competitions in general. Scott and Patton would have been great blood brothers. Casting Scott to play Patton is one of cinema's greatest casting decisions ever. Scott delivered such a powerful performance. The other main performance was Karl Malden who delivers an admirable performance as General Omar Bradley, the man who gave Patton a second chance in the war.Patton is a long film as it clocks in nearly three hours long and Scott is in nearly every frame, but it works very much thanks to Scott's layered performance enhancing upon Patton's theatricality. The guy who possesses such bravery also loves to hear himself speak during his long-winded speeches. The movie has many speeches, but they are worthy of your attention. The guy gives such a commanding presence and I got the goosebumps during that opening scene. The movie sees the war the way Patton saw it and it's an exhilarating experience.The direction is also a highlight of the film. Franklin J. Schaffner is known for taking on ambitious projects and this may have been his most ambitious project he may have ever tackled. It's fun to see directors rise to the challenge and Schaffner took a mighty challenge here and won. Also a noticeable presence was the score by Jerry Goldsmith. He created such a patriotic score with the help of a pipe organ. Every time I think of Patton himself, the main theme becomes stuck in my head and that is a good thing. 1970 was a good year for war films. M.A.S.H and now Patton are must-see war films from that year. The former film was a spoof on the dangers of war, but the latter is about a man who dedicated his life to winning the war his style. And his style is very interesting to watch. A man who won't back down from anything. Because of George S. Patton, the Allies won the war.My Grade: A",

            "content": "The cast of Franklin J. Schaffner's Oscar-sweeper \"Patton\" consists of hundreds, if not thousands of people, and unquestionably required the acute attention spans of many others, who stood out of sight when the cameras were rolling. But all of their collective efforts seem, to me at least, to amount to next to nothing as the heart, soul, and mindset of this movie - and in fact, the only person who seems to occupy any real space in it - is George C. Scott playing the controversial World War II general. It's one of Mr. Scott's two or three very best performances, and won him an Academy Award, and yet in a bloated film filled with mostly hot air as opposed to passion and information, even Mr. Scott's joyously powerful performance doesn't seem to add up to much.\"Patton\" clocks in at just under three hours in length, and yet even with so much open space to throw in historical facts, information, and theories about General Patton's infamous career and his actions during the Second World War, the movie does not provide anything that I could not have learned by picking up a book at the local library. As a result, it does not surmount enough interesting stuff to justify its length and monotonous tone. It goes on and on, but really does not have much to say.The best thing in the movie is, again, George C. Scott's magnificent performance. What made Mr. Scott one of the best cinema actors was not only his talent, but the way he enthusiastically embraced every role given to him. As a result, the audience is able to share the fun and excitement that goes into giving a great performance. That is the case here, as well. There are other people in the movie. One of them is Karl Malden, but they might as well just be faces painted on a big mural in the background, for none of them are fleshed out, memorable, or for that matter, very well-portrayed. With the exceptions of Mr. Malden and some of the German actors, a lot of the acting is hammy and wooden. In one of the movie's key moments, Mr. Scott loses his temper with a soldier crying after a heated battle, and whips him with his cap. The performance by the actor playing the soldier is so methodical and so artificial that it really threatens to bring the scene to a screeching halt. Having an amazingly animated performance with a plethora of really stone-faced ones sort of throws the movie off balance.\"Patton\" is a beautifully-photographed movie, and the battle scenes, sparse as they are, are appropriately riveting. However, in the end, this bloated wanderer of a motion picture is just too self-righteous for its own good. The way it presents General George Patton is like a elementary student writing a report about a historical figure who they honestly could not have cared less about. Passionless and stiff, \"Patton\" left me feeling completely disinterested about halfway through and clear to the end, wondering what else there was about this figure that was worth all of the hullabaloo. I had to pick up a history book to find out.",

            "content": "Coming from the height of the Vietnam War, this very optimistic- spirited light-feeling war movie comes to feel somewhat out of place. At the time it came out, it might have been seen as a welcome retread to the gung-ho jingoistic war movies of the 50's and 60's with squeaky-clean heroism from the G.I.'s and sneering incompetence from the Germans. Also, the depictions of the battles in this movie, while often spectacular, feel pretty inaccurate and simplified for anyone who bothered to read a little more than the 9th-grade general-ed history books. It's almost as though the film just isn't interested so much in the war. The war is just a backdrop for the showcase of this complicated man.It's of another time, an era from before when history got complicated and we started really re-evaluating things... who the heroes of the war were and what really makes a man a 'hero'. How interesting is it to show people who never waver in confidence in the face of battle and never seem to fail? How responsible was Patton for the collapse of the 3rd Reich compared to the vast scale of the warfare waged by the Russians on the Eastern Front, not to mention the many who served above and below him? Was he just a cog in the machine or a truly extraordinary individual? This movie tells us the latter, but doesn't really tell us why or how beyond just all the other officers around him behaving like comparative imbeciles.That said, the film is wonderfully acted. George C. Scott was the perfect choice for the role and as long as the film focuses on him and his complicated relationship with the media, his fellow generals and allies, it works well. It just feels awfully dumbed-down to me in its depiction of the actual battles. PATTON may be a step up from THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE in terms of how well it technically pulls everything off, but just about on-par with it in terms of giving history credit where credit is due.",

            "content": "General George Patton was a natural born leader who thrived on victory, and detested defeat!! His passion for military triumph put him in the category with the stellar generals in WWII, comprising of himself, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Douglas MacArthur!! This triumvirate of generals was a select group of military leaders who were driven by emerging victorious in battle!! For them, to be writhing with conviction, and to be motivated by ultimate confrontation, signified an irreplaceable exuberance which is a quality of an individual that belongs solely to the fortitude of a genuine leader!! The callous gratification of wartime victory involves a temperament of ego-maniacal obsession, and impervious obstinacy, for purposes of adhering to the compulsory premise of all or nothing!! The contention issued by the Saturday Evening Post that Americans were complacent in their plight of embracing mediocrity, which ran the gambit from fighting in a war to fornication, was something that Patton vehemently disagreed with... It was Patton's theory, as it is mine, that Americans have an intensity to win, to strive to be the best!! Our nation was built on the foundation that every American can epitomize his desired accomplishments because he is an American, and Americans strive to be the best, hence, Americans love a winner!! The desire to win World War II with Americans was indeed pandemic!! When someone says they hate a winner, the term \"hate\" serves as a malignant euphemism for \"wistfully resent\", to which a winner could just look at this person with star lighted eye contact and say \"REALLY!!\". The stakes for victory in WWII severely differentiated themselves from winning a baseball game. While one is for purposes of giving the fan his money's worth, the military success in World War II dealt with an end result being one of painstaking encroachment to the pinnacle of world conquest!! Patton once said \" I don't want my soldiers to like me, I want them to fight for me\"...The operative word in the phrase \"young men who are willing to die for their country\" is \"willing\"!! Patton did not wish his soldiers to die for their country, he wanted other soldiers from other countries to die for theirs!! Patton's soldiers were American soldiers, the best soldiers in the world, and they had to survive, which ultimately translated to America winning the war.. Patton was a born leader who had an inherent yearning for victory, as well as crystal clear conception of the visceral elements of survival!! Patton's rigid and quasi tyrannical dictatorship was for purposes of ensuring the allied power's democracy.. This film \"Patton\" takes you through the laborious processes Patton engaged in to secure that the United States attain a resounding victory in WWII!! The eloquent spokespeople in the White House abhorred Patton's desultory decorum, particularly with regard to his ostracizing the Soviet Union, something which Patton did with an unmitigated disdain!! Patton's cannon of cogency pertaining to his military and political ethics, was something that he carried around with a very unapologetic disposition. The part in the movie when Patton (George C Scott) said that the greatest part of his life was serving as a five star General in WWII, became a dirge of candor which the movie audience could thoroughly believe!! This comprehensive account of Patton's life during WWII was a stunningly successful effort by directing great, Francis Ford Coppola!! (Best known for \"Godfather\" Godfather Part II and \"Apocalypse Now\"). Coppola wrote the script to \"Patton\" in corroboration with director, Frank J Schaffner (Famous for \"Planet of the Apes\"). This film is an accurate historical review of the prevailing circumstances of the United States involvement in WWII .. History has perennially been a collaboration of stubborn facts which reflect our failures and triumphs during any given era and/or event!! Whether writing or directing a movie, Francis Ford Coppola has an acute knack for accurately pinpointing the bittersweet rewards and repercussions of our nation's military conflicts, as he did so brilliantly with \"Patton\". George C Scott does General Patton justice with this role, as he provides a succinct portrayal of Patton as a man who was driven by fervent and coveted accomplishments!! AFI (The American Film Institue) ranks this film as one of the top 100 American Films ever made!! The film \"Patton\" won the academy award for best picture in 1970, and deservedly so!! The auspicious direction that this film perpetuated was an enlightening summation of history which enabled me to have a better understanding of what our primary purpose was in World War II!! I strongly recommend seeing this film!! It is definitely amongst the greatest films in the American cinema world!!",

            "content": "This film is not a full biography of General George S. Patton; it contains nothing about Patton's early years or his military service prior to World War II. It opens with a highly theatrical opening monologue, delivered by Scott in front of a huge American flag, based on Patton's famous speech to the Third Army. (\"No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.\") It then follows his wartime career in North Africa, Sicily, France and Germany, but omits his death in a road accident a few months after the end of the war.There can be no doubt that General Patton was a highly complex character. He was a brilliant tactical commander and the Allied general most feared by their German opponents, who could not understand why Eisenhower rather than Patton was chosen to command the Allied invasion of Europe. His American and British colleagues, however, did not esteem him so highly, regarding him as rash, unpredictable, quick-tempered and too prone to take risks. Patton, in turn, had an equally low opinion of his colleagues; a theme running throughout the film is his feud with the British General Montgomery. Eisenhower does not appear, but we are left in no doubt that Patton did not esteem him any more highly than he did Monty. He is, however, shown as having a grudging respect for his second-in-command General Omar Bradley, even though Bradley's cautious temperament is the polar opposite of Patton's own. (In reality the two men appear to have detested one another, but Bradley was acting as military adviser to the production, so the film-makers doubtless wanted to portray him in a good light).Another contradiction in Patton's character is shown in his religious views. He claims to be a devout Christian, but nevertheless believes firmly in reincarnation, which is not part of the Christian faith. (He claims to have fought, in one incarnation or another, in most of the great battles in history). His attitude to war, moreover, seems to go far beyond the traditional Christian doctrine of the \"Just War\" and comes perilously close to relishing warfare for its own sake. He was notoriously foul-mouthed and his inability to control his temper was shown in two separate incidents in which he slapped soldiers whom he regarded as guilty of cowardice; these incidents, which are combined into a single incident in the film, led to him being relieved of his command.George C. Scott famously refused the Oscar he won for \"Patton\". He had, in fact, objected to his nomination, saying that he disliked the concept of acting competitions because he did not consider himself to be in competition with other actors and that he would not accept the award if he won. The Academy, however, still insisted upon voting him \"Best Actor\", and the record books show that he won the award in 1970. It might have been more appropriate if the Academy had respected Scott's wishes, withdrawn his name from the nominations and given the award to some other actor. (My nomination would have been Jack Nicholson for \"Five Easy Pieces\"). With all due respect to Scott's principled stand, there can be no doubt that his performance was worthy of an Oscar. Patton could easily have emerged from a filmed biography simply as a one- dimensional monster, but Scott manages to unite all the many facets of the General's personality into a fully rounded portrait of a complex human being, completely dominating the picture with his commanding presence. Karl Malden has the rather thankless task of playing the much quieter, more restrained Bradley, but succeeds well enough to avoid being totally eclipsed.\"Best Actor\" was not the only Oscar won by \"Patton\"; it also won six others, including \"Best Director\" for Franklin J. Schaffner and \"Best Picture\". 1970 was perhaps not the greatest year in movie history- it was, after all, the year in which a film as weak as \"Love Story\" could receive a \"Best Picture\" nomination- but \"Patton\" might have had a worthy rival in the shape of \"Ryan's Daughter\". For some reason, however, David Lean's film was not even nominated, and \"Patton\" was certainly the best of the five nominees. Its success does not rest on Scott alone; its other merits include a fine musical score by Jerry Goldsmith and some strikingly vivid battle scenes.Frank McCarthy, the producer of \"Patton\", was later to produce \"MacArthur\", another biography of a controversial American commander from World War II. \"MacArthur\", however, is today largely forgotten, possibly because of the miscasting of Gregory Peck in the central role. Scott, however, has helped to raise \"Patton\" to the status of an American classic and its main character to the status of American folk hero. It is perhaps the greatest of all military biopics. 8/10",

I remember the line about dying for your country--the idea is to get the other poor son of a bitch to die for his country. I look upon this as the worst of human ideology.

            "content": "Patton was a man who loved war. He saw it as a thing of honour to be able to fight for his country. More than that, he believed it to be his destiny and purpose to lead men throughout WW2. The war was a story to him that would be told throughout the ages and he wanted the leading role. We never see anything of Patton's life before the war. Instead the story begins in the midst of the second world war when he is promoted to Lieutenant General, almost as if that is where his destiny begins. It follows all of his military exploits from that point. We see everything of his joys of controlling the realms of battle to his frustration and misery at spending time waiting for his next assignment. We see both the highs and lows of his career and everything between.Through the diversity within all his exploits, the man is left open to a great deal of interpretation. One person can walk away from this film thinking about Pattons many victories. But another can watch this film and see a brutal man whose war methods put too much strain on his own men. The film never offers a definite opinion. It just shows us the facts and lets us assess the man ourselves. It allows for a far more diverse set of views and creates a more interesting look at what kind of man he truly was. Normally it would be difficult for an actor to keep open these various views about his character. But luckily they made a perfect casting choice for the role. Whilst the Scott himself felt his performance did not do the material justice (to the point that he declined his Oscar for best actor), he truly brings the man to life. From the moment he steps on screen and delivers the films opening speech in front of the American flag, Scotts performances is instantly hypnotic and maintains its strength from start to finish. He balances every part of Patton's life seamlessly. From his admiration of any mans courage in war to his sorrow at not leading D day, he juggles all of the different aspects of Patton's life. Always demonstrating Pattons love of the grandeur of war by constantly taking centre stage he ensures that he builds up Pattons own perspective of how his life was the centre of the war. He performs the role incredibly to keep us all hooked to the film from start to finish. The film delivers a powerful portrait of one of the most controversial figures of the American military. It captures the man's admiration of war showing us the beauty and honour that he saw in battle. It's a brilliant example of when a great actor is given a great script and cinematic history is born.",

            "content": "George S. Patton was one of the most controversial and famous general during the Second World War and his war career got adapted into a Oscar Winning film in 1970. Based on a couple of book Patton works best as a board overview of his career, from taking over the American II Corp after the American Army was humiliated during the Battle of Kasserine Pass to meeting the Soviets after Germany's surrender. Running for three hours Patton was able to cover a lot of the general's war career as he brought discipline to the American Army, well read with a knowledge of history and led from the front but got into as much conflict with generals on his own side, slapping a traumatised soldier and made controversial statements. It is a great big film that don't get made anymore and even though the film does side a bit too much with Patton on a personal level it is a strong World War II film.",

            "content": "\"The myths of World War II have warped our view of how we look at things today. The twisted memory of it encourages the men of my generation to be willing, almost eager, to use military force anywhere in the world.\" \u2013 Admiral Gene LaRoque\"Magnificent! Compared to war, all other forms of human endeavour shrink to insignificance. God help me, I do love it so!\" - General George Patton Underrated director Franklin J. Schaffner turns in more good work with \"Patton\". It's a grand biography of US Army General George Patton, filled with Schaffner's customarily excellent photography, though philosophically things are a bit dubious. Blame screenwriter Francis Ford Coppoa for this.As is now well known, \"Patton\" follows General Patton from the moment he takes charge of the demoralised American II Corps in North Africa, to his march into Germany itself. The film massively overstates Patton's influence on the war, ignores the real causes of the war and the Imperialistic equivalencies between all parties involved, but that's to be expected of a film which panders to American egos. Interestingly, \"Patton\" is explicitly about performance. The movie opens with Patton on stage, features a Patton who believes himself to be \"performing\" the reincarnated \"role\" of past warriors, features military tactics which rely on decoys and deception (ie more performance acting), treats Patton's life as a predestined concert show and the world as a grand stage, sports a soundtrack that is literally composed of resurrected echoes of the past, shows generals as being preoccupied with public perception and nurturing their media personalities, portrays war as being one big performance in which victory is simply a means of becoming a top celebrity, and is filled with characters who are obsessed with \"the proper conduct\" and the \"right way to perform\" or \"carry oneself\". Add to this the fact that the historical Patton was himself an erudite and intelligent man who only adopted a false persona of machismo and bluster and you have a film which is entirely about both performance and the egos which fuel wars (see Kaufman's \"The Right Stuff\").This, incidentally, is why actor George C Scott, who plays General George Patton in the film, was interested in the project, though he'd ultimately be unhappy with the film's final product. He'd go so far as to turn down the Oscar he won for his role, disgusted by the film's popularity.Odd for a war movie, \"Patton\" is interested in the logistics of war, the scale of the war effort, the size of the US military machine and of course the expansiveness of Europe itself. Watch how Schaffner stresses the lengths of supply lines, the distances covered by tanks and convoys, the vast number of different generals operating in tandem etc. You really get the sense of a huge and multifaceted war machine rumbling across Europe. No other film does this better.Also interesting is this: the film was cynically designed (and Coppola admits this himself) to appeal to both right and left wingers, to war hawks and pacifists. The entire film is thus constructed in such a way as to allow audience members to praise or rebuke General Patton, depending on their own political dispositions. Or at least that's what was intended. In actuality, Scott seduces you with his hard-on for war and conquest. So though the script sets up an ending in which we're given the false choice of viewing Patton as either a necessary relic or an unnecessary relic who \"walks off into the horizon of history\", the reality is that Patton will never go away. He'll aways be resurrected, whole nations always on the brink of saddling up to the next Patton, hungry to suckle on his testosterone soaked teats. Indeed, the majority of Coppola's films evoke the seductive lure of megalomania, a trait he shares with Oliver Stone, both directors often undermining what they believe the messages of their films to be. Incidentally, \"Patton\" was part of a group of war films released between 1965 and 1977 (\"Bridge Too Far\", \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\", \"The Longest Day\", \"Midway\", \"Battle of Britain\", \"Battle of the Bulge\", \"Patton\", \"633 Squadron\" etc), all of which tried to broaden the scope of previous war films by focusing on as wide a cross section of military personnel as possible. Unlike the platoon genre, these \"hierarchal films\" aimed to portray war on a far larger canvas. They promised to offer audiences the \"spectacle of history\", viewers being granted a nuts and bolts recreation of some historical event in which the entire hierarchy of the military machine took part. Significantly, the event being recreated often revolved around some grand disaster (Pearl Harbour, the Blitz, D Day etc). These are all films in which noble Allies bravely fight against all odds (against an overwhelming, savage, superior foe), only to eventually emerge with a kind of bittersweet victory. These films thus display contempt and reverence in equal measure. This is a contradiction which infects most war films. On the one hand, these treatments predict a pessimistic, even tragic outcome and outlook, whilst on the other they want to curry the favour of audiences, a procedure that predicts an optimistic, even a celebratory outcome/outlook. Celebratory vs Tragedy: it is in this fashion that most war films veer pathologically between antiwar statement and gung-ho propaganda. Covertly such art succumbs to the Cult of the Military. The Cult which says that Freedom isn't free, and that the cost of freedom is blood which must periodically be sacrificed on the altar of Liberty by the military clergy.Perhaps the last film in this cycle was \"A Bridge Too Far\" (1977), by which time audiences were tired of WW2. At this point a series of cathartic Vietnam films were realised, which had about as little to do with Vietnam as the WW2 films before them had to do with WW2.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.",

            "content": "It is rare, but it happens an acclaimed actor will often become so ingrained with a role, that whenever the movie is brought up for discussion, one immediately discusses the actor as well. Thus it is so with this 1970 film called \" Patton. \" George C. Scott has proved himself versatile in many roles, but his career is crowned here with the role of a lifetime. The movie does not cover the life of Patton, but only the War time segment. Beginning with the North Africa campaign, Scott demonstrates the flamboyant army general who despite his Christian beliefs, also believed in his vault of past lives or reincarnations. Although, Patton had a great ability to wage war, he suffered from an inability to control his opinion. Whenever, he accomplished some extraordinary feat in battle, he would often follow it up by saying or doing something which would cause him great embarrassment. One example is his defeat of Erwin Rommel's 10th elite Africa corps in battle, then following it up by slapping a common soldier in front of medical witnesses. Always claiming he had defeated the Desert Fox, one wonders if he could have done it at the beginning of Rommel's campaign. Nevertheless, throughout the war, Patton would be able to snare the lion's share of the wartime glory only to have it snatched away by his arrogant social behavior. Still the movie itself is a fine testament to the controversial general who gained the respect of his men, staff as well as his enemies only to die in what many called an ignominious death. The film is further enhanced by noted actors like Karl Malden as Gen. Omar Bradley and Karl Vogler as Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. This is one film which not only stands as a living tribune to Patton and George C. Scott but a definite military Classic for any collection. ****",

Scott's performance is rightly legendary, and saves the film from its crumbling finale. this remains his golden moment - and to the extent that he performs George s. Patton exactly as he ought to be played - and he does, - this remains not only Scott's shining moment, but one of the great performances of film history.",

It's rare that an actor can take control of a character to the degree Scott does in this film, so much so that he literally becomes Patton. It was interesting to listen to Francis Ford Coppola's remarks on the 20th Century Fox DVD presentation, talking about his research into the General's life. Coppola utilized Patton's belief in reincarnation to write the scene where he discussed the Roman defeat of the Carthaginians in North Africa. A complex character, Patton was a God fearing man who could curse up a storm, and mete out scorn for a coward and empathy for a battle scarred soldier in equal measure. The film uses those kinds of moments to demonstrate the essence of a man who was literally born to battle because he 'loved it so'.Coming off a recent viewing of \"Band of Brothers\", this picture helped put in perspective part of Patton's grand strategy in Europe during World War II. With the 101st Airborne pinned down in the area of Bastogne, France, Patton's near impossible march of a hundred days with little in the way of food and war supplies was deemed a master stroke. He made the impossible look like a minor inconvenience.With the passage of time, it's apparent that Patton's personal philosophy becomes more and more anachronistic. \"All real Americans love the sting of battle\" is not an idea that's championed today, even when conveyed with Patton's passion for achievement in competition from a young age. Can you imagine a general like him testifying before Congress explaining how he'll cut out the enemies' living guts and use them to grease the treads of our tanks? Granted, George Patton was the product of a different era, but it's prudent that we pay respect and honor to men like him, and the men who served under him, for the freedoms we still cherish today.",

            "content": "\"Patton\" might not be the greatest war movie ever made, but it's without question cinema's finest character study. It's a portrait of a man painted so vividly that I bet -- at least since 1970 -- that there are far more historians whose research emphasis is on Gen. George S. Patton than any other war hero/major military figure. Hollywood has given us any number of unique and enigmatic characters, but none so compelling and quickly gathering of our sympathies as Patton.Patton was an American general in World War II, but more specifically he was fighter, a soldier a man who believed in war as part of human nature. He was also a poet and a war history romantic. He was prideful, he was vulgar, he was both loved and despised. The list goes on, because that's how incredibly complex Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North's character is as well as the layers of depth George C. Scott gives him.Scott refused his much-deserved and won Oscar, but he insisted he didn't belong in an elite category. What he didn't really consider was that sometimes an actor, usually a character actor, comes across a role so perfectly suited to their talents, a part that wouldn't be the same done by any other actor, that greatness happens. Scott found that role. Few actors ever do. He plays Patton with such command yet the more Patton realizes his fallibility, Scott withdraws ever so slightly, bringing the character a tad closer to earth each time, but never losing that essence of pride and self confidence.\"Patton\" is a long movie and you spend much of it just craving for Patton to do or say something. From his eternally quotable opening monologue before a backdrop of the American flag onward, we can't see or hear enough of the man. He's utterly fascinating. He speaks American war ideals like they're fundamental truths about the universe. Hippies would be ready to die for their country after listening to that, no matter how many swears he uses. And he never appears crazy. In fact, throughout the film as Patton's commanding officers reprimand him for his behavior including hitting a soldier, we find ourselves wondering \"why doesn't anyone else see this man's brilliance?\" He's not nice, but he's right. The idea of Patton as a war man and not a politician plays out then throughout the rest of the film.Honestly, whenever Patton's not on screen and specifically saying something, the film is uninteresting. There's one terrific action moment where Scott, angry at the incompetent British in Morocco, goes outside with his pistol and tries to shoot two German planes down. After that, the war scenes are nothing but random explosions and images without any narrative relevance to the story. In a nearly three hour film, it's fair to consider all the scenes where the best part of the film plays little or no role a bit tedious and pointless.It's impossible to describe in a review the many depths and levels of Patton's character. There are many elements in the story that evolve from and revolve around the man he was that little can be summarized. The most basic piece of this character to understand is that despite how convincing and successful he was as a military figure, his wily and off-kilter ways were always at odds with that success. Essentially, it reveals the many dimension of Patton and the many dimensions of war that require more than just a \"blood 'n guts\" attitude.",

            "content": "The main strength of this film is George C. Scott giving the performance that defined his career. Scott is Patton throughout this film. Karl Malden is excellent in support as Omar Bradley. One of the strengths of this film is how it gets to the inside of the man Patton in total. This comes from the book \"A Soldiers Story\" which was written by Omar Bradley & the retired General also served as a consultant for this film. This is in a way why this film is great, besides Scott, is that Bradley brings out the surprises of Patton, not just the man the public knew. There is something magnetic about a general who is desperate to be a hero despite being wealthy, a leader whose knowledge of the past is eerie enough to provide his beliefs in reincarnation. While Patton was not a \"womanizer\" as other Generals in World War 2 (like Ike) were, he is leading a full life in the present to go with the life he has led before throughout history. This makes for a compelling, complex portrait which goes beyond how a real man is presented in film in most cases. This film is very much a canvas portrait of George Patton which not only looks like a masterpiece, but give the viewer a glimpse at the oil base that makes up the painting. It is run on television often because it is so good. If you have not seen it, you should. If you have, it still holds something enthralling enough that like a great masterpiece, seeing it again can give you something more. The battle sequences were shot in Spain & are very well produced. The character study of Patton, the man & the General is so accurate, many vets blinked when they saw the film. Hollywood rarely gets something so right.",

            "review_title": "\"A Perfect Anachronism\"",
            "content": "These were the words that came (in the movie at least) from German Captain Oskar Steiger (Siegfried Rauch) as he contemplates their arch-enemy, General George Patton (played superbly by George C. Scott). Patton was a figure from a by-gone age, obsessed with military history and battle tactics, not understanding that being a brilliant general was no longer enough in modern warfare - one had to be a diplomat and politician as well, and Patton simply couldn't adjust to those demands even while he remained perhaps the most brilliant combat general of the US Army in World War II.I was a little bit surprised at the portrayal of Patton in this movie. I was under the impression that it portrayed him as almost a mythical figure above reproach; the quintessential American hero at a time (1970, with defeat in Vietnam staring the US in the face) when Americans needed military heroes. While there's no doubt that Patton is portrayed as a brilliant general, his character flaws are shown as well: arrogance and envy over whether he or British Field Marshal Montgomery (Richard Bates) is the more important, hot-headedness: slapping a shell-shocked soldier silly and being forced to publicly apologize under direct orders from Eisenhower, a warmonger-type figure in his attitude to the Russians, and generally chafing under orders that he didn't like (and sometimes not obeying them.) He is certainly a well-developed personality in this movie. Early shots of Scott in the role made me think of a striking resemblance to the swaggering Mussolini (and the displays of arrogance and egotism did the same.)It's a good movie. It has a few weaknesses. It really should be called \"Patton in World War II\" because there's really nothing about the man outside the period 1943-1945, the first half of the movie overdoes a few battle scenes at the expense (I thought) of really focusing on Patton, and the whole thing is a little too long for my liking. Basically though it's very good, and features solid supporting performances from Karl Malden as General Omar Bradley (Patton's subordinate who becomes his commander) and Ed Binns as General Bedell Smith. I also appreciated the emphasis on giving us the perspective of the German officers who opposed Patton (in particular Karl Michael Vogler as Field Marshall Erwin Rommel and Richard Munch as General Alfred Jodl) and I thought it added a touch of realism in these scenes to have them spoken in German with subtitles.7/10",

But his ambitious, bombastic and flamboyant ways, along with his often ill advised remarks to both public and enlisted men, lands him in trouble more often than not. Despite his success on the battlefield he is relieved of command, something that pains him a lot. He is a commander, made for war, and not to be in The War of his time vexes him. Finally he gets the chance to lead the third army in France, once again able to win the glory of the battlefield.Comments: A movie that won many awards, including the Acadamy Award for Best Actor, Best Director and Best Picture, that has since grown into a classic. But to me it isn't that good. Don't get me wrong, it is still a movie, not just that good.It seems to follow historical events pretty much, even though some things have been changed for dramatic effect or to save time (even though it still runs over 160 minutes). The main events in Patton's World War II career seem to be there though. What makes me doubt is that Patton seem to have only one mode, all out attack, no restraints what so ever. That may be the truth, and a correct depiction of the real Patton, but it also makes the character a bit one dimensioned, something I am sure the real Patton was not.The story doesn't add much dramatic effect or suspense either, as it is seen from either Patton's or Bradley's view, i.e. the commanding officers, not the front line troops. It may also be very accurate, but not the typical war movie.Patton's speeches and remarks do live it up a bit though, as they always add some spice to the story. From the viewpoint of the movie it is those talks that drives the story. It is both a little funny, and maybe the most dramatic that's in there. The situations his words put him into are quite tense and lends some suspense to a story.In conclusion you could say it is a biographical drama. Seems pretty accurate but also made to be entertaining to watch.6/10",

            "content": "A few random thoughts: 1. The great broadcaster Walter Cronkite, who covered Patton during the war, felt this film captured the man extremely well. 2. My favorite brief scene in the movie is where Patton looks out over the ancient battlefield (Rome vs. Carthage), the music flares gently, he describes the battle in a few succinct sentences, pauses, and says, \"I was here.\" 2a. My favorite extended sequence in the movie (in fact, in any movie) is Patton's pivot north to relieve Bastogne, from the first stirrings of enemy activity in the Ardennes Forest to the chaplain's successful prayer for good weather. 3. Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) comes off very well in the movie. This may be historically inaccurate. The excellent military historian Victor Davis Hanson, in his 1999 book \"The Soul of Battle,\" rips Bradley for his bureaucratic timidity (he does the same for Ike) and praises Patton to the skies. Davis' writing on Patton is splendid. 4. I like how the movie leaves implicit, rather than making explicit, a central fact: Patton's pursuit of military glory was entirely congruent with America's best interests in the war (and I'm sure he knew this). There was no conflict whatsoever between him needing to be great and America's need to win; in fact, his ambition fueled our victory. 5. President Nixon reportedly watched this film a number of times before the invasion of Cambodia. When I was a kid I scoffed at this. Oddly enough, the older I get, the more I understand it. Not the invasion. The watching of the movie to brace oneself for a massive task. 6. If you read the Aubrey-Maturin novels of Patrick O'Brian, about the Royal Navy circa 1800, you get a good feeling for the deep depression that can come upon a combat soldier after seeing action. This, of course, is the body readjusting - it's the body coming down from a huge adrenalin high and finding homeostatis again. I'm convinced this is what happened to Patton after he completed his magnificent crossing of Europe. This, in combination with head injuries suffered during horseback riding, significantly unbalanced him, IMO. We see the lack of balance in the film in his phone conversation with Gen. Smith about the Russians: \"You give me ten days and I'll have us at war with them, and I'll make it look like it's their fault!\" 7. In the early 1970s, when the film came out, with the Soviets and the U.S. pointing nukes at one another and the world worried about nuclear incineration, a whole lot of people watched that phone scene and thought, \"Hey, not a bad idea - that might have worked out OK.\" Yeah, maybe, except for the fact that the Red Army had many millions of men in Eastern Europe, plus tanks, planes, and artillery; the U.S. didn't have nukes yet; and Americans were sick-and-tired of war. 8. The script is amazingly good. It takes a sprawling topic and makes it manageable and fascinating. A well-deserved Oscar for Francis Ford Coppola. 9. With reference to Patton's scabrous view of the Russians, do a Google search for \"They Raped Every German Female From 8 to 80\" for background. 10. Some people hate this movie. If you go to Roger Ebert's website, rogerebert.com, you'll find comments from one or two of these folks. I truly do not see their point of view on this one, at all, and I'm tempted to think that a person who hates this movie perhaps hates movies in general, or maybe hates America in all its complexities and fissures and wildness.",

            "content": "Sometimes in life, a human being may have unlikable qualities, yet still be extremely likable in spite of all that. George C. Scott and General George Patton shared both of those qualities, so how ironic to have them associated together through this Oscar Winning Best Film. This is one time in watching a movie where it does help to know a little something not only about the character the leading man is playing, but the leading man himself. With his raspy voice, not quite leading man physical looks and a controversial off-screen image, George C. Scott is a most fascinating actor because in spite of everything, you can't help but like him. In playing one of America's most controversial World War II figures, Scott gave a solid performance that is captivating even when he is being less than kind to the people who are serving under him.Even if he just appeared in a short covering the opening sequence (the classic speech in front of the giant American flag), Scott would have entered screen immortality. But there's another three hours after that amazing sequence (which screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola claims almost got him fired off this project), and that is three hours of solid entertainment. Any man who can use the Lord's name in vain while professing his belief in God is a fascinating character to watch, whether you agree with how he feels or not. When Scott attacks a soldier on the verge of a nervous breakdown in front of the wounded in the hospital, you sense both his compassion (for the wounded) and the reasons for his anger at the soldier he humiliates.This isn't a war epic about amazing battle scenes, although the strategies that Patton reveals are very interesting. When Scott is off screen, you will be riveted to the sequences where Nazi officers reveal aspects of Patton they have discovered themselves to their amusement. The relationship between Patton and British war hero Douglas Montgomery is also fascinating, a battle of two Prima Dona's who know they want glory, although Patton adds that he's willing to admit it, even if Montgomery (a subject of several war films himself) isn't.Karl Malden offers solid support as Patton's right hand man, perhaps the only man who truly understands him and accepts him for who he is. The ending reminded me of the final scene between Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains in \"Casablanca\".",

Karl Malden needed more than his gimmick of chewing on a piece of straw for his Bradley portrayal - he does NOT resemble Omar Bradley. A total miscast, the result of Hollywood's continual illusion that any good actor can portray any personality faithfully. Of course, Hollywood script writers seldom are very familiar with the historical figures they create on film, or what they did. The major problem with this film's script was its absurd portrayal of Patton as a \"tank expert.\" He certainly was not that. Innumerable examples from the war prove without any doubt that Patton completely misunderstood the purpose of armor in WWII. The most glaring (and well known) example was his rejection of the M26 Pershing tank in favor of the horrible Sherman they had used up until the Tidworth Downs conference in England prior to Normandy. His brainless decision (based on obsolete Army theories of armored warfare)was vehemently opposed by every armor commander who had had experience with the Shermans in Sicily and North Africa. Everyone except Patton was well aware of the severe deficiencies of the Sherman tank, but Patton's rank and obstinateness prevailed. That I rank as the most disastrous decision made by any US commander in WWII - it lengthened the war and killed many thousands of those unfortunate enough to be selected to be a member of a Sherman tank crew. After the invasion, when it became readily apparent just how inferior the Sherman was, a growing scandal was hushed up by the governments of both Britain and the US. Despite the fact that Patton's rejection of the vastly superior Pershing was easily the most significant and far reaching decision he ever made, the film doesn't even mention the fact. This totally destroys the credibility of this film. Typical Hollywood history - things are portrayed the way some scriptwriter wishes they had happened. Buy hey, that's Hollywood.",

Patton was a man who himself stated that he read the Bible every day as he told a priest; (of course, the strong expletive he used as his adjective for the word \"day\" is not fit, I believe, to be placed in this review.) He didn't mind spitting out dirty words at the beginning when he was talking to his men, a man who loved war so much that generals under him began to hate him, a fact depicted in the movie. One memorable scene was the one in which he slapped hard the head of the boy too scared to fight. (Tim Considine, famed for playing Spin on the serial \"Spin and Marty\" on, in turn, the \"Mickey Mouse Club\" of the middle '50's played the part of the scared soldier.) I wonder if George S.

In an attempt to demystify the controversial general that has met both the scorn and respect of people and other military officials alike, \"Patton\" has become an underwhelming picture. George C. Scott's amazing acting is placed far from the camera, often framed next to taller and bigger people and things, making him look small, separate, even unappealing. The famous shot at the beginning of Patton in front of the gigantic American flag is at first really visceral, but thinking back on it, I realize it becomes a structural set-up for the mythic hero constantly set beside things that overshadow him. It's almost depressing.Of course he was, after all, just a man... but this movie seems to go to such great lengths to stress that at times that sometimes I wonder why the creators even wanted to do the project at all. If it wasn't for Scott's grandiose portrayal, I would think that this movie would overshadow Patton so much that he'd disappear from the screen altogether.What this movie does succeed with, in my opinion, is pointing out how different modern war is from \"classic\" wars in human history. WWII was the last war in which America had enemies that marched... in fact it was the last chance someone like Patton had to truly succeed in the way he did. Everything since has changed so much and the process differs so greatly that one of the reasons the US has had problems with wars ever sense is because we haven't yet recognized that we're not playing the same game as we were before. Everything's evolved and Patton in the movie is afraid of that, and it's for that reason that this movie still has something to offer.--PolarisDiB",

Patton proved the exception to the rule. \"Patton\" received seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Art & Set Direction, and garnered nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Special Effects, and Best Original Music. Repeated screenings of this extraordinary World War II epic combat film, especially George C. Scott's bravura performance, make it difficult to believe that producer Frank McCarthy toiled for 19 years to persuade the Pentagon as well as General Patton's family, both adamantly opposed to it, to help him produce this multi-faceted film. Scenarist Francis Ford Coppola, long before he made his own masterpiece \"Apocalypse Now,\" penned one of the earliest versions of the \"Patton\" script and realized the deadly pitfalls that lay in the subject matter for any filmmaker. \"Wait a minute, this guy was obviously nuts. If they want to make a film glorifying him as a great American hero, it will be laughed at. And if I write a film that condemns him, it won't be made at all.\" Coppola encapsulated the contradictions that confronted McCarthy for nearly twenty years. According to Coppola, only George C. Scott's intervention brought Coppola's long since rejected elements back into the film, particularly the stunning opening with Scott poised in from a gigantic American flag delivering his stirring speech to the troops.Initially, the Patton family opposed \"Patton,\" and McCarthy recalled the rage of Colonel George S. Patton III who threatened shoot anybody who made a movie about his father. Indeed, Twentieth Century Fox shelved \"Patton\" in 1951 and Warner Brothers following in their footsteps in 1953 not only because the family did not trust the filmmakers, but also because the Pentagon felt any film about Patton would portray the Army in an offensive manner, particularly because the general emerged as such a controversial figure. The family interpreted any movie as an invasion of privacy, lobbied the Pentagon to deny cooperation to filmmakers, and even launched a law suit. Eventually, the Defense Department cooperated, but it provided none of the equipment that appeared in the film. The Spanish Army furnished the tanks, equipment, and troops for the battle sequences. Patton's daughter Ruth Ellen Totten dropped the law suit after she saw Schaffner's film. Reportedly, Totten told her attorneys, \"Call off the dogs.\" She gushed about it. \"I think that it is the best movie I have ever seen since Gone with the Wind.\" Totten added brother George was thrilled by Scott's portrayal.The positive reception of \"Patton\" seems almost inevitable in light of the authenticity of Schaffner's film. McCarthy scored a coup when he convinced General of the Army Omar N. Bradley to serve as 'senior military adviser. Bradley scrutinized the script and later took McCarthy and Schaffner on a tour of the battlefields in Belgium, France, and Tunisia, so Schaffner was confident that \"we didn't do anything which was outrageous or silly.\" However, McCarthy had to purchase Bradley's memoirs to obtain his services. Inevitably, \"Patton\" compared its insane, quixotic hero with Bradley's more down-to-earth, humanitarian general. Four-star General Paul Harkins, who had been Patton's chief of staff, joined Bradley as another military adviser. These two figures placated the earliest anxieties that the Patton family had about the production.Clocking in at walloping 169 minutes, \"Patton\" depicted the celebrated general as an amalgamation of contradictions. He was religious but profane. He was violent but sentimental. George C. Scott perused Patton books and watched news reel films. Indeed, Scott transformed his appearance to resemble the general. Totten called Scott's portrayal \"tour de force.\" Winning the acceptance of the Patton family and the military proved one part. Twentieth Century Fox had to win over moviegoers during the era of the Vietnam War with most people agreed that the nation has lost the war. Co-scenarist Edmund North summarized what attracted audiences divided over Vietnam to \"Patton\": \"I believe it was because each person brought to it his own underlying feelings about the Vietnam war.\" Those who were appalled by Vietnam interpreted \"Patton\" a fascinating anti-hero. Those\u2014like Richard Nixon\u2014who regarded Vietnam as a noble enterprise could find comfort and support in Patton's self-righteous and dedicated savagery.\" President Nixon watched \"Patton\" twice and admired the general's arch-authoritarian attitude. Later, Nixon denied in an interview with David Frost in 1977 that the film \"Patton\" had inspired him to launch his Cambodian invasion Cambodia five days after watching Patton the second time. The film has many memorable moments, especially Patton's orders to a chaplain to intervene with God with a prayer for good weather and the scene in the desert when Patton leaps out of a window to fire on a German aircraft. Karl Mauldin is fabulous as General Bradley and there are tanks galore. Every World War II fan should put \"Patton\" on their required viewing list of movies.",

The practical effects are convincing and the other actor's performances hold up well. The film does tend to drag on a bit at certain times though.

There is no doubt that film's success and popularity came, almost entirely, from the outstanding performance by George C Scott: he was, and is, the movie. Without Scott, 'Patton' would have been just another war movie - and not a very good one at that. From an historical point of view, the movie treated Patton very favorably indeed, not surprising since the screenplay came largely from Ladislas Farrago's hagiography \"Patton, Ordeal & Triumph\" which almost deifies Patton - later histories and biographies are more honest, more accurate and reveal the seamier side of the Patton story including the fact that he was far from the gifted general that the movie would have one believe. Regretfully, Scott was unable to reprise his triumphal portrayal in \"Patton\" when he, unwisely, made \"The Last Days of Patton\" in 1986 - in some ways that disaster detracts from his original performance. \"Patton\" hasn't aged well. Thirty-five years down the track the use of the Spanish Army (and its equipment) as extras, poor continuity and patriotic hyperbole - which, no doubt, was stirring in 1970 when the US military was getting an ignoble beating in Vietnam - now grate, severely, on the viewer's nerves. Nevertheless, the movie is still worth watching for, what is probably, George C Scotts greatest movie role.",

The movie begins famously with Scott addressing a troop of soldiers while standing in front of a massive American flag. It's a daring way to open a movie, and Scott makes it riveting. He's so good in the first few minutes that you might think the rest of the film loses some steam afterwards. It doesn't. Scott carries this film for its entire 170 minutes, and there's hardly a scene that he's not in.\"Patton\" isn't so much a biopic about one man as it is a document of one leader's decisions during wartime. It's smart and sensitive enough that it doesn't pander to easy sentiment or mindless patriotism, yet it's not exactly an indictment of war either. It seems to take the point of view that WWII was horrible but necessary, and that leaders like Patton were necessary if we were going to win -- people who seem custom made to exist during wartime and whom you can't imagine existing in any other context.Grade: A",

The false tone is set up at the very first, long, laughable and totally unnecessary speech scene that does all the wrong service and only makes the tonality of the film pretentious and suddenly comic. Battle scenes - there are several. But a very sloppy montage and abrupt character add to a bigger misery. Even the man himself seems to be all at odds with the whole thing. The worst is yet to come with typically awful depiction of Russians. More to say here is only to induce laughter. So silly the whole scene is. The best is all of a sudden is a very delicate and deeper take on Germans - Jodl, Rommel, Steiger are all very decent and highly deliverable antagonists with their hopes and falls.

            "content": "Instead of getting into a deep biopic about Patton's life, director Franklin J. Schaffner (Planet of the Apes (1968), and screenwriters Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North (Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), dive right into, probably, one of the most detailed character studies ever found on film. They skip all the early parts of Patton's life and his early military career and get right into the momentum-changing, impact, that he had on World War II. It is a part of his life, that barely covers three years in total, but it is the three years that defines his life. It is the three years that make this film a critical success. The original script comes from elements found in Omar Bradley's autobiography and based on a biography about Patton, by Ladislas Farago.What Schaffner, Coppola and North do however, is bring to the forefront, Patton's belief in reincarnation and the fact that he believes, he is a reincarnated warrior, who shows up every century, in a new form, to storm the battlefields of the day. By doing this, it allows the story to take him to places or moments in time, where he resights poetry and envisions battlefields 2000 years old. By living vicariously with legendary dead generals and conquerors, these moments of reflection for Patton, also tell us the story of his earlier days, his early wins, those things needed to fill in those gaps in his character development. It is a very clever way to tell his biopic, without leaving the main setting or direction of the film, which is the war and his journey from Africa to Berlin.On the technical side, this film has no mistakes. It uses the, state-of-the-art, practical, physical effects, of the time. The on-location filming helps with the set pieces and art direction, which makes everything look real, like a color news reel from 1943. The filmmakers use the wide-screen nicely in this film. From Patton standing in front of a giant American flag, to the widely spread valley on the battlefield, the cinematography is brilliant. The performances by the cast is so convincing, they actually draw you into the film. Forget the fact that, George C. Scott won the Best Actor Oscar for this film. We already know that. We know this is his masterpiece, but the rest of the cast is good too, especially Karl Malden as Bradley. It is no wonder the film won Best Picture too. It is a masterpiece in WWII historic cinematic exploration, not just in 1945, but also in 1970. A film that everyone needs to see and one that future filmmakers can learn from.9.4 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",

PATTON tells an unhurried tale charting Patton's battles staged in Sicily from his base in North Africa, depicting how his rivalry with British forces led him to the greatest of success.From this point on the man's infamously prickly character gets him into trouble with his superiors and later his ultimate superior, and the rest of the film follows various trials and tribulations in a tale filled with highs and lows. George C. Scott was one of Hollywood's most uncompromising actors and he truly gives the role his all here, so much so that he becomes synonymous with the character he plays. Also most impressive is the staging of the battle scenes, which are gritty and authentic and look fantastic, with every dollar of the budget put up on screen for the viewer's enjoyment.

It is an epic film at times has a cast of thousands in the desert. It is a movie that was inspired by Lawrence of Arabia. It is a film about war but we do not see many battles. There is a sequence where Patton's base is being bombed by a warplane and he goes outside to shoot at it with his pistols. Another later sequence we see of Patton advancing in France but it is just him driving through on his jeep.There are no side plots of heroic soldiers in close up battles. The film is about Patton and his many contradictions. It stands out because of Scott's performance, big and brash. He dominates the film only Karl Malden gets a whiff to be memorable, the British soldiers are portrayed as stiff bores.The film was regarded as anti-war. It is not. There is a moment in this film when Patton exclaims 'I love it, God help me, I do love it. I love it more than my life.' The script was co-written by Francis Coppola, these lines would be later riffed by him for Apocalypse Now for Colonel Kilgore. Like Kilgore, Patton would walk to the battlefield knowing he will not die. As soldiers in his command remarked in real life, 'our blood, his glory.'

The other performances in the film are not near as convincing, but they really don't need to be because this is a film about Patton from beginning to end.

The complexity of this man only grazes the surface but Scott's near perfect performance shows some of the perculiaraties of a deeply religious man who uses God's name in vain without flinching.   His belief in reincarnation also rubs against the Bible which he so confidently proclaims that he reads every day to a group of priests in one of his most telling scenes.

            "review_title": "The Ultimate Warrior, By George",
            "content": "Like many Americans, George C. Scott had divided feelings about George S. Patton. In an interview with Rex Reed shortly after \"Patton\" came out, Scott called the general a homicidal madman. Yet later Scott spoke of his deep admiration for the World War II commander and his warrior mettle, and even returned to play the character again 16 years later in a mawkishly eulogizing TV miniseries, \"The Last Days Of Patton.\"Both the great and the nasty Patton are up on the screen in Scott's original, 1970 portrayal. The result is one of the finest one-man shows in Hollywood history. Just the scowl on his face as he first appears, in front of a giant American flag that sets a scene both patriotic and slyly satirical, is an assay of theatrical command, one that builds by shadings and degrees as the film progresses.\"Patton\" derives much of its dramatic tension not from war scenes or arguments, but its central character's inner turmoil. Patton was a student of military history so enamored of the past he claimed to have been reincarnated \"across the travail of ages.\" Yet he was also a dynamic tactician of the era's most advanced form of combat, armored warfare. He could schmooze his superiors in cultured French, but was prone to childish tantrums. He demanded unquestioned loyalty, but had a hard time following orders when his own grabs for glory were overruled.A lot of the tension here comes from the audience wondering if Patton is going to lose it in this or that scene and blow a chance at the brass ring. Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn't, and sometimes, as with a speech he innocently delivers to some English ladies, he is undone in a way he can't be blamed for. Patton is presented to us as a sick man (\"by God I love it so\" he says of war at one point), but a necessary one, rated so highly by his German opponents that their high command withholds valuable troops from the front thinking Patton's about to attack them far to the rear in Calais.Through the first two hours of the three-hour movie, we often see Patton at his worst, for example putting entire regiments in danger just so he can beat Monty to Messina. But the film subtly manipulates us to side with \"ole Blood and Guts\" despite his faults. When he slaps a soldier, it comes right after a tender moment with Patton decorating a grievously wounded GI. He clashes with his superior Gen. Eisenhower, but the film shows this in the form of arguments between Patton and Ike's brusque envoy Bedell Smith rather than Eisenhower himself, who had just passed away in 1969 and who would have made a less likely target of audience antipathy.The last hour is kind of glorious resolution, the \"Ordeal and Triumph\" which was the title of one of the film's source books. Patton plows through France and single-handedly wins the Battle of the Bulge for an encore. The fact that this is historically accurate makes it easier to appreciate and rally around, along with Scott's subtle shadings of humor (he eases back on the gas and lightens up) and a score by Jerry Goldsmith which is one of the great movie themes of its era and should have gotten the film its ninth Oscar.I'm less sold on the rest of the film, especially the actors around Scott. They are stiff and wooden. A couple are quite bad. The only recognizable actor other than Scott, Karl Malden, plays a stolid and dull counterpart to Patton in Gen. Omar Bradley, too nice to be believable. I guess since the real Bradley was working on the film as \"senior military adviser,\" it was hard for Malden to play it up more.Clearly Scott wasn't likewise inhibited. The result gives us an excuse to sit back and watch one of America's most gifted actors breathe life into one of its most brilliant and conflicted generals, and offer quiet thanks there are really guys like crazy George steeling the martial mettle of our liberal democracy. You wouldn't like Patton much if he lived next door to you, but you'd be glad for him in the tank beside your foxhole.",

            "content": "Hot off \"Planet of the Apes\", Franklin J. Schaffner directed \"Patton\", a biopic of the WWII general. It seems a bit odd to me that a movie about a WWII general came out at the height of the Vietnam War - to be certain, Nixon really liked the movie - but co-writer Francis Ford Coppola decided to incorporate several different aspects of George S. Patton's life to show that he was actually a very complex individual. Coppola of course went on to make one of the most staunchly anti-war movies of all time, \"Apocalypse Now\".Although it features some battle scenes, the movie is definitely more about the man himself. George C. Scott shows Patton to be worldly (quoting literature) and aggressive (he infamously struck a soldier whose remarks displeased him, and then his apology was a pretty weak one). What caught my eye most about Patton was how he always wanted all the glory, even disobeying orders so that he could liberate towns before Bernard Montgomery did.I wouldn't call \"Patton\" the best movie of 1970, given that the year also saw the releases of \"Catch-22\", \"Five Easy Pieces\" and \"Little Big Man\". As for Scott's refusal of the Oscar, I guess that he was entitled; he should have won something for \"Dr. Strangelove\".Providing good support is Karl Malden as Omar Bradley, Michael Bates as Montgomery, Karl Michael Vogler as Erwin Rommel and a host of other people as various grunts and officers. My favorite scene is when Patton and the Russian official toast each other \"one son of a bitch to another\". I recommend the movie.Oh yes, and part of the movie takes place in Tunisia, which recently saw the popular ouster of its dictator, while chaos engulfs Egypt.",

Scott gives a Universally praised Performance that is without doubt the best part of this Academy Award 7 Time Winner. The Script is also a significant achievement weaving Pro and Anti War sentiments effortlessly. There are so many quotable lines...here is one...\"Compared to War, all other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificance\"That is a summation of Patton and the Movie does give a slightly Romantic vision of the most Controversial, Flamboyant, and Charismatic Military Leader of His Era. In contrast, Eisenhower barely had a Heartbeat and was dull and humorless.The Film is Framed and Shot entirely from Patton's point of view. The Battles are shown mostly in Wide Shots and the carnage is only glimpsed after the fact. The Deaths and suffering of the Soldiers underneath this self identified Demi-God are to Him like Players on a Stage or Pawns in a Game. He was eccentric, to say the least, and fancied Himself a Man with a Destiny. He believed in Reincarnation.But this often alluded to Spiritual Belief, is shown to be insincere when after He is told that the Future of War will be pushbutton He states...\"Thank God I won't be around to see it\". But most of the Movie is consistent in its telling of this Larger Than Life, frightening, Dictator Wannabe and it gives the sense that this unhinged Man would not be much different than the Evil Despots who were the Enemy.Overall, it is an Overrated Film but is quite good and worth watching as a Dramatic representation of an Egomaniac, who like most of His ilk, left to their own devices, would more than likely cause more harm than good. Having this Man with His hand on the button is a very dangerous thing. Reference Scott's Role as an Air Force General in Dr. Strangelove (1964). That could be Patton Reincarnated.",

This is a great film that should be on TV on every patriotic holiday. His dedication to his profession, while admirable, allowed for no cowards around him. While his infamous pep talk is meant to put the fear of God in his men (and the viewer), the sheer bluntness of it always makes me laugh out loud. If you don't know anything about George S.

            "content": "The extraordinary nature of this film is that it is not a slavish biography of General Patton (who is probably idealized and transformed into something a little different from the real historical character), but it uses his cumbersome and controversial figure to make a timely speech above. War in all its facets. That is, what is war really? What was its primal meaning? In a very suggestive fantasy, Patton imagines himself resolving the conflict with Germany in a solitary duel against Field Marshal Rommel: the two of them, armed against each other, fighting each other in the desert aboard a tank. Whoever wins the fight also wins the war. It is undoubtedly an image of breathtaking beauty. War as heroism, stripped of all its political implications, of all its abjections and horrors: two men who face each other, putting their honor and their lives on the line, to affirm their self. In a conflict of this kind, \u00e0 la Patton, the richest state would not win, the one with the best equipped or most numerous army: no, the bravest soldier would win. Patton, in his impetus, if you will, incomprehensible towards the war thing, is far removed from what war means in our collective imagination: it embraces a world of abstractions that are foreign and unknown to us. Paradoxically, this is precisely how he restores a strangely and romantically noble dimension to waging war. Let me be clear, Patton is not insane and he is not a rhetorician. I think there is no more ironically jarring image than the very famous opening sequence of Patton teasing soldiers in front of a huge stars and stripes flag. Patton is anything but a patriot: for him the valor shown in battle is what stands above all else, not the love for the fatherland (whatever the fatherland is). Ironically, Patton would be willing to march under any flag to fight. Someone might see in general an alienated person who has lost the sense of reality: I see someone who has simply found the purpose of his existence. And I feel I have a deep affection for war films like this one or The Dirty Dozen, which don't care to weigh down the theme - already quite weighty in itself - more than necessary, but contaminate it with splashes of smiles and true humanity. .",

From the establishment of the totally bogus \"United Nations\" to America's 8-war losing streak, PATTON strengthens your belief that most of our Troubles could have been avoided had not a Megalomaniacally jealous Eisenhower engineered PATTON's assassination-like demise. That a smirking Ike got away with this outrage gave Johnson, Nixon, and the Bushes--all present in Texas on 11-21-63--the blueprint they used to brazenly snuff JFK and facilitate 9-11. PATTON is portrayed as an idiot savant of War, lacking in key social and political survival skills as he prattles on about his various previous incarnations and poetry writing skills. On the other hand, Karl Malden embodies Gen. Omar Bradley as an Ike Toadie interested only in getting a tank named after himself.

The technical support from the Spanish Army is a load of hooey and the sound work is absolutely atrocious.  Given, back in 1970 there was a general lack of quality sound editing, but this is terrible!  Also, the supporting cast is terrible.  I kept having flashbacks to the hollowness of Battle of the Bulge and Where Eagles Dare.Fortunately, the cinematography is top-notch for a 70s movie like this, even when there is too much zooming.  I noticed that, as far as quality filmmaking was concerned, Patton gets better as it progresses.  The opening up until Sicily are poorly edited, chatty, and forced in depth.  The last hour remains one of the greatest achievements in grand-scale filmmaking. Scott didn't like Patton as a person, but he has now transcended the actual person in the public limelight.  He resembles a human Panzer tank, all bulked up and firing his outbursts with absolute power.  So it goes...The message, of course, is the futility of war.  Many other movies have covered it, all with mixed results.  Scott presents an interesting case, though it is hard to believe someone as batty as Patton could get in the army, no less a four-star general.Jerry Goldsmith, who has done almost every kind of movie for Hollywood, creates a soundtrack of both rousing pomp certain to make pacifists cringe and organ postludes reminiscent of medieval times, thus enhancing Scott's throwback character. Overall, PATTON fits in my Top 10 movies from the 1970s, crazy as they are. 4 out of 5 stars.",

Scott - Perfect... Undeniably deserved the Oscar for Best Actor, Scott becomes General Patton in this film, he delivers his performance with restraint, appropriate emotion and characteristics. This is exactly the kind of role that stays with an actor for lifetime. George C. Scott has become the man who played Patton! This performance is quite possibly the best of all time.Scott himself, an intense and intimidating personality in real life, seemed perfect for the role, yet he was not the first, or second, nor third choice for the role, he so masterfully consumed. The theatricality of the character is inspiring. Patton, stands up in his Jeep, makes speeches, quotes history's finest figures to his subordinates. The only weakness of Patton, which was also his strength was his ego; listening to no one, acting alone, slapping a disturbed soldier, getting himself in trouble. Anyway, the film itself is magnificent. The direction is exceptional, the score by Jerry Goldsmith is a pounding, intense one that thoroughly suits the themes of the film.Glorious battle sequences, military wit and passionate quotations from different times of history, I am happy to say that 'Patton' is one of my favourite films and one of the greatest war films ever to be made.10/10",

Sadly, though I tried to keep pace with the unfolding events, the ceaseless pro-American propaganda eventually wore me down and I ended up leaving the room for other more interesting pursuits.It's not that I resent nationalistic pride nor patriotic ferver by any nationality, be it the U.S. or any other nation, but this production just never stopped laying it on thicker than meringue on a lemon pie, beginning with Scott's pacing and prolonged opening pro-America bombast, against the backdrop of a gigantic American flag.American readers who cannot understand what might be cloying about that performance might gain a bit of perspective by imagining any other nation being so represented at the start of a movie. Imagine, for instance, a gigantic Soviet hammer and sickle flag and a Russian general in full uniform spending ten minutes pacing in front of it and telling the audience how Russia will never lose and that Russians live to fight will plough through any enemy etc. etc. Wouldn't you roll your eyes? But then I'm not the target audience. You are.But of the movie, when it finally got underway... We step into position as vicarious viewers of Patton as a fully developed General, and take up the story as Patton commands in his blustering style, the North African campaign. Battles are fought, jeeps roar around and are sometimes blown through the air, but no story ever seems to develop. It's just Scott roaring and behaving like Patton is expected to behave. As events progress to the invasion of Sicily, nothing new there either. Patton roars, Palermo is occupied, the infamous battle fatigued soldier gets slapped and Patton delivers the insincere apology, and on we go. It just got so dull that I finally gave up on the movie.I must be in the minority though, because this films aggregate votes place it in the top 250!I have to wonder however: The vote database compiles stats from gender, age and so on (females under 18 tellingly rate it at an average 5.5!) but voting demographics do not include nationality.

It is my favorite war film, and easily one of my favorite films of any genre.I really can add nothing to what has already been said about Scott's phenomenal performance. However, I believe some of the criticisms expressed by other reviewers are not quite being fair to this film. I do not at all believe this film is an example of gung-ho American supremacy at the expense of the British contribution to the war, as some have alleged. I suspect the major reason for this allegation stems from the portrayal of Montgomery as being pompous and dismissive of American capability. Patton himself (in the film) answers this critique nicely, by stating that both he and Montgomery are primadonnas, the only difference is that Monty wouldn't admit it. Further, in one scene where his subordinates were joking about the poor capabilities of both the Americans and the British, Rommel reminded them that Monty had pushed his army clear across the desert.But ultimately, remember this is a biopic and you are seeing the events of the war from Patton's perspective. Patton may have complained of the British not providing enough air cover, or of Monty trying to keep all the glory to himself, but that is countered by dialogue suggesting that Eisenhower knows Patton is not seeing the whole picture and is basically just Patton being Patton. In other words, what some see as Brit-bashing is really just a portrayal of Patton's historical assertions, rather than some sort of cinematic whitewashing with pro-American revisionism. It is really only natural that supremely confident, brilliant, but egotistical men like Monty and Patton would vie with one another in pursuit of a common cause, and let us be glad we had them both.",

            "content": "What a colossal bore. Its a film that takes its ideas, mulls over them but just wants to give you a little, not a lot. Patton conceivably was a great man, with great flaws. He was determined, like this film to get his goals achieved. However, unfortunately he was halted by fate, as was this film from any genuine ingenuity.The film's flaws stem mostly from its pace. It drags out a message that could be conveyed in a fraction of the screen time. Yes, he was an aggressive and difficult character, yes he was admirable for his ambition and conviction and yes he was a pompous, overbearing and ultimately hypocritical human. Why does Schaffner have to take so long illustrating this? At first it seemed mature and honest, we see Patton's abrasive nature and obstinacy, his arrogant refusal to submit to the system. Unfortunately then we see the same point reiterated on numerous occasions and through the same initial omniscient viewpoint, we never get any other angle on all this. All that we are treated to is the same perspective that eventually insinuates that Schaffner wanted us to feel sympathy for an egomaniac who loved war, and festered the whole time to his wholehearted dedication to it.Although Scott's performance is truly breathtaking; his presence and charisma really manage to keep us interested to watch the film to the end. He never can diversify the one-sided material he was given. We just get treated to the generic and repetitive view of how Patton was unfairly treated and vilified by his superiors. Objectivity just seems to be flung far away for Patton to roll over in his tank.Good biographies show the many facets of an individual, their strengths and vulnerabilities; strong biographies like 'Raging Bull' concentrate on how the qualities and dysfunctions interweave with those surrounding them and how their morphed personality shapes their future. 'Patton' unravels itself more to be an wholesome tribute to a psychotic and driven madmen,rather than an analytical piece of characterisation. Its glorification of war is offensive and ridiculous, and it wants to invoke pity and empathy for a supposed 'legend' who was really a very apprehensible individual. He is rewarded for being brutal, egotistical - not only on the battlefield but in the audience's eyes as well because of the partiality of the narrative. It chooses to take sides with Patton, to depict his pomposity as an approvable characteristic and to compress his fallible traits as excusable. It avoids a balanced depiction and chooses to become a cheerleader for devotion and loyalty to Patton's type of firebrand patriotism.Pity would have been more forthcoming had Schaffner opted for a more sagacious viewpoint; one that chose to focus more on his skewed values and hone in on them rather than dedicate 3 hours of film to underplaying Patton's zealousness and portraying him as an admirable and amiable fundamentalist. Scott's brilliance rather than Schaffner's incapability are what really gives this film a renowned reputation. It simply comes across as frivolous piece of US patriotism masked as an honest portrayal of an unbalanced, crazy and disastrous humanbeing.The film's ultimate purpose is to evoke empathy and sentimentality for a person who should be lauded for his determination and rebellious nature, and not criticised for his amazingly warped view on life. Because Patton was a victor, he has been canonised as a saint of the American right; which is all this film seems to want to achieve. It eschews real quality through its monotone narrative and dishonest subject matter. Its for romantic rightwingers and nobody else.",

            "content": "Throughout the ages the world has seen many exalted military leaders come and go, but one such individual will forever be distinguishable from the rest. The individual in question is General George S. Patton Jr-the pure warrior. Unashamedly egotistical with a bizarre belief in both Christianity and reincarnation, Patton was a tough military genius as well as a keen historian and poet. A magnificent anachronism, an enigma no doubt. There hasn't been a military commander so brilliant before or since the second world war. Granted, Patton had his flaws. For one his impulsive demeanour bordered on lunacy and secondly he relished combat with a worrying degree of fetishism that seemed almost sexual. Factors such as these make one question the man's sanity, however I think we can overlook his emotional state as his infatuation with war would lead the allies to victory in Europe.Here in Franklin J. Schaffner's profound tribute, General Patton is immortalised by the excellent George C. Scott in what is probably the actor's finest hour. Without a doubt, General Patton was the last of his kind and George C. Scott gives a one-of-a-kind performance. Scott thought he couldn't capture the essence of George Patton but despite being frustrated by this, he seems to be thoroughly enjoying the role and provides us with a superb take on the Patton legend. John Wayne and Robert Mitchum were contenders but neither could have embodied Patton's spirit the way George C. Scott did. He brings George Patton back from the grave and is firing on all cylinders, revelling in his own sharp witted charisma. Scott is truly mesmerising and each time he speaks you as the viewer are duty-bound to pay attention. Take Patton's opening speech shot against a huge U.S flag, masterfully scripted and terrifically executed it's the most compelling call to arms ever filmed. It sets the standard for the rest of the movie which remains consistent throughout. By the end of the speech I wished that I had served under Patton and even though he may have been hated by a lot of his men, I'd say they were ultimately proud to serve under a leader so ingenious. The film ends with an internal monologue from the General which is written and executed with touching sincerity to the point where it becomes philosophical. It struck a chord with me personally as it conveyed fantastically one of the sobering facts of not only war, but life in general and deeply illustrated how one can easily become disillusioned with both. The producer couldn't have hoped for a better script which was penned in part by the great Francis Ford Coppola, who would transform himself into something of a cinema heavyweight as the 70s progressed. Unique dialogue enriches the film, it's probably one of the most quotable films you'll ever see and some lines will give you a chuckle. Patton is a war movie as you already know, but the most intense scene takes place not on the battlefield, but within the confines of a military hospital. That's right, I refer to the infamous slapping incident in which General Patton assaulted a battle fatigued soldier in front of the man's contemporaries and army medical staff. A formidable and quite appalling occurrence in reality that is represented with commendable aplomb by Franklin J. Schaffner, who deserves to be eternally praised for using exemplary tact in bringing to the screen such a sensitive topic. I couldn't fault any of the performances in the film. Karl Malden is always a joy to watch and shares with George C. Scott some of the movie's best scenes. Impressive performances also came from Lawrence Dobkin as Colonel Gaston Bell, Michael Bates as Field Marshal Montgomery, Richard Munch as Colonel General Alfred Jodl, Frank Latimore as Lieutenant Colonel Davenport and Paul Stevens as Lieutenant Colonel Codman. Jack Gwillim is also worthy of note as General Alexander, as is Peter Barkworth as Colonel John Welkin and Seigfried Rauch as Steiger.Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score also compliments the movie's sprawling visuals. For a film that is heavily character driven a considerable amount of effort was put into the stuntwork and special effects, both of which I thought were amazing. The suspense is tightened harshly for a large battle in the desert and a couple of minor skirmishes in Europe, not to mention a German air raid on a North African town. There's also a lot of fine looking armoured machinery on show throughout the film. Cold war M46, M47, M48 Patton tanks and M41 Walker Bulldogs are mocked up to represent second world war U.S Shermans and German Panzers. Historical completests will be pained by this fact, but for me there was nothing better than seeing those armoured beasts dominate the screen.Hollywood's earnest love letter to one of the greatest military commanders in world history deserves to be seen numerous times-not just for George C. Scott's spectacular portray-but for an insight into the obsessively volatile psyche of one extraordinary individual. 10/10",

            "content": "From viewing the famous opening sequence of the 1970 war movie, \"Patton,\" I knew what kind of epic I was in for. That opening sequence, with Patton addressing soldiers in front of a draped American flag, shows what kind of character General George S. Patton is. A bloodthirsty, vivid man who is overly fond of his colorful language as well as his hatred towards the Germans. This character is fully embodied by George C. Scott, who delivers such a mesmerizing performance. This is the oldest rule in the acting handbook, but I truly believe I was watching Patton barking orders on screen, not George Scott. I really enjoyed this sprawling war epic, which covered the years Patton served in the war. The film, while suggesting sympathy, tells an unflinching account about whom Patton was and why he wasn't well-liked amongst his superiors. Thanks to a wonderful screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola, the character of George Patton was brought to life on the big screen.Franklin J. Schaffner's film celebrates the life of one of America's finest, but most eccentric generals. The film travels from his conquests over General Rommel in Libya to his downfall which led him not leading the troops at Normandy due to his big mouth and an incident where he slapped a solider. But the film shows him getting back at it by defeating Germans left and right as he marches closer and closer to Berlin.George C. Scott had a wonderful career, but this may be his finest performance he has ever done. In a sense, Scott is almost like Patton. They share nearly the same kind of personality. Scott always seemed to have controversial comments. But that being said, Scott blended into the role of Patton very well. He definitely deserved that Oscar win. The other \"big\" actor in the film is Karl Malden, who played General Omar Bradley. He really doesn't have much to do, except to play third wheel to Scott's Patton. But in that case, I believe it is okay here. After all, this film is about George Patton.Overall, Patton is an example on how to make an exemplary biography. It's an extremely wonderful movie thanks to a center magnificent performance by George C. Scott. This is also a war movie, but I was surprised at the lack of battle sequences. Now there were a few, but this was more character-focused than I expected. That is not a complaint, as I love these kind of movies. Now for what little battles we have, the sound and effects work were great. I also loved the score by Jerry Goldsmith, and his use of the pipe organ in the main theme honoring the religious overtone of Patton. This is a great movie that respectfully treats one of the most iconic names in American history.My Grade: A",

            "content": "This film essentially tells the story of General George Patton during World War II. What he does before and after is of no consequence. While some liberties are taken, the film is largely historically accurate.I think the whole feel is summed up in the opening speech from Patton: \"Men, all this stuff you've heard about America not wanting to fight, wanting to stay out of the war, is a lot of horse dung. Americans traditionally love to fight. All real Americans love the sting of battle. When you were kids, you all admired the champion marble shooter, the fastest runner, big league ball players, the toughest boxers. Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser. Americans play to win all the time. I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed. That's why Americans have never lost, and will never lose a war... because the very thought of losing is hateful to Americans.\" I really enjoyed the idea that Patton is a sixteenth century romantic warrior stuck in the twentieth century. The planned Sicily attack in 1943 is key evidence to this. (Mysteriously, Patton cites the Athenian invasion and the leadership of Alcibiades, but it's a foolish comparison. The Athenians were decimated at Sicily, and their leader deserted them. Alcibiades began the conflict as one of the Athenian commanders, but defected to Sparta... why would Patton want to do this?) Likewise, he also has this weird concept of living in many different centuries. How much he believes it and how much it is just a way of saying that his soul is eternally tied to war, I don't know. The film portrays him as being pretty serious, which I'm skeptical about.They are dead right on one thing: Patton does not allow softness or even cooks or doctors to go without uniform. He is a great general, but his big weakness is his lack of compassion. While arrogance and confidence and hardness work well in war, they may not make a well-rounded man.",

            "content": "Although I think George C Scott is a great actor, I do not understand why this film won 7 Oscars when several superb historic war films also produced in 1970 received little acclaim.This is yet another of the almost limitless American films post WW2 which glorifies one of their famous generals. True it shows his vanity and cruelty as well, but as a military historian myself I really wonder why such average war scenes rated so highly? For example Patton's triumph after Kasserine is portrayed in almost laughable battles-scenes. We have modern M60 tanks (ironically the \"Patton\") with black crosses on the side pretending to be German tanks and German infantry marching in Napoleonic dense columns towards the US Army. Its incredibly bad even by the standard of the time (and Gen Bradley was the military adviser?).I do like the acting in the film. I think George C Scott is great and well deserves the accolades. But I do wonder why the outstanding films \"Waterloo\" and \"Cromwell\" shown also in 1970 did not receive wide acclaim, despite being in my opinion some of the best films ever put on film. Waterloo is probably the most impressive cinematic representation of a historic battle ever made - never again will a film be made like this. I can't help but think it does help if your film is about an American war hero, with famous American actors for Americans (like almost every successful film that has been made in the English speaking world since 1945). Interesting that a Bridge to Far which has faultless battle scenes and outstanding moving acting did not receive anything like 7 Oscars! I wonder why?",

To take on an enemy like Hitler, we needed a leader like Patton, someone who had no qualms about \"holding on to the enemy by the nose and kicking him in the ass.\"The hospital scene is what I think bothers a lot of people about this movie and also what I think stirs up a lot of controversy. What has to be understood here is that when taking on the Germans of WWII, any display of cowardice or weakness could not be tolerated. What Patton did to the soldier in that tent was nothing compared to what the Germans would have done to him if he had been captured and sent to a POW or concentration camp. The Germans of that day were a sadistic lot, as history will tell you, and they would have had a field day with an American soldier blubbering and crying. These were the kind of people they loved to torture. This was tough love before anyone ever thought of the phrase. Patton was basically saying, \"Come on, soldier, grow up! We're at war here and if you don't shape up, the enemy is going to kick your ass even worse than I am.\"This movie shows an unapologetic look at a great general, and forces you to accept him on his own terms. Was Patton perfect? Of course not. Nobody is. But he was the right man for the right time and he did his job well. No one can fault him for that. Interesting that his birthday is on VE Day. Great movie, great character study. 9 out of 10.By the way, my favorite line(s). Patton just got a call from Beetle Smith and is being raked over the coals for refusing to denazify his staff. The politicians didn't want to make the Russians mad at them, and, every time I see this movie and hear this, I cheer and say, \"Right on, George, go for it! Give 'em hell!\" He says, \"To hell with the mongoloid Russians. You tell Eisenhower to give me the word and I'll start a war with those sons of bitches and make it look like their fault...I'll kick their behinds back to Russia where they belong.\" YESSSS!!!!!!!",

This makes for a compelling, complex portrait which goes beyond how a real man is presented in film in most cases. This film is very much a canvas portrait of George Patton which not only looks like a masterpiece, but give the viewer a glimpse at the oil base that makes up the painting. It is run on television often because it is so good. If you have not seen it, you should.

Army general during World War Two who believes that he is destined to achieve greatness, and does it, and in the process exhibits behavior that some consider erratic, others consider dangerous, and others consider inspired. The movie suggests that this general's behavior is a combination of all three. Of course, what makes this movie great is George C. Scott's classic portrayal of the general - George Patton. Other actors could have played the role, but Mr. Scott went beyond just playing the role - he became the personification of General Patton. In this movie Patton is portrayed as a complicated man. He is moody, he is foul-mouthed, he is petulant, he is impulsive, he is nasty. Yet he is also brave, loyal, heroic, dynamic, intelligent, pragmatic and inspired. It was General Patton's Third U. S. Army that broke the siege of Bastogne and led the invasion into the heart of Nazi Germany. It was General Patton who correctly assessed the political situation in Europe as it related to the Soviet Union and it was General Patton who recognized and appreciated the heroism of the American soldiers. But although this movie is about a U. S. General during World War Two, in no way does this movie condone or glorify war. Actually, this movie is one of the great antiwar movies, along with \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" and \"Paths of Glory.\" This movie a condemnation of war because it shows that when peace fails, then it takes men like General Patton to restore order, and one must ask: Do we want men like George Patton in positions of power?

Patton, standing like a giant with the American flag in the background, is an iconic masterwork of character development.  This scene truly sets the tone.  Patton was a definite student of history and this address to his men was reminiscent of motivational speeches that great ancient commanders like Hannibal and Scipo would deliver.  He knew the tactics of those classic warriors well and he parlayed his study of battle and his joie de combat into becoming one of the greatest American generals ever.Patton was a complex man and George C. Scott captures his essence brilliantly.  His dichotomous nature was vividly captured by Scott in the infamous hospital scene where he slaps the soldier.  The moments prior to that reveal much about the man as he knells before an unresponsive soldier, his face bandaged and covered by an oxygen mask, and whispers thoughtfully into his ear.  The look of pain on Scott's face as he contemplates the fate of one of his men is impressive.  He certainly was the right choice for this over the top role, just as Karl Malden was for the understated part of Omar Bradley. Thankfully this movie was made during the greatest era in American filmmaking, the late 60s/early 70s when other historical figures (Bonnie & Clyde, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, many of the characters form `Little Big Man', etc) were adopted into intriguing, epic works.  A movie like this would have fallen well short of the achievement made here, if it was attempted today.  Can you imagine a director like Oliver Stone doing this?  No offense to him, `Platoon' is one of my all time favorites, and I respect `Natural Born Killers', but he would have made a travesty of this story.General Patton is still widely revered in military culture today.

Said critic lists the title as his favourite film of all time).George C. Scott delivers one of the best performances I've seen in a long time; one that has, and will continue to withstand the test of time. The final scene is relevant, well-suited, somewhat heartbreaking, and poignant, as are the final lines. That's not to say I'll be studying Patton the man in any great detail in the future, but I have gained a greater level of respect and admiration (and fear?) of the character after watching this film.It's hard to give this movie a 4-star rating simply because I can't recommend it unreservedly to EVERYONE. Having seen many WWII-based films like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and TV series like BAND OF BROTHERS, the visual effects and dialogue seem a bit...dated. Nevertheless, that does surprisingly little to take away from the overall 'feel' of this movie in which every scene in its run-time of approximately 165 minutes seems relevant and necessary.The best movie of all time? Not quite. But very highly recommended in any case. Deservedly won 4 of the 'Big 8' awards at the Oscars, including Picture, Director, and Lead Actor.

There are a few battle scenes scattered throughout, but none are more than a few minutes in length and are there just long enough to give the viewer the idea before moving on.Along with opening with only Patton on the screen, the film ends that way as well. You could read this as symbolic to the depiction the film gives. Alone, in solitary union. Despite his impressive record and military achievements, Patton is displayed as a tragic figure. A romantic hero fighting a lost battle against opponents of less eminence from the new age. His greatest days taken from him by those considered to be on his side. But yet he still manages to rise and stand above them all.There is no other way of describing George C Scott's portrayal than saying he becomes Patton.

Not only is it a fascinating character study, it is also an interesting glimpse into the politics of warfare.George C. Scott won an Oscar for his portrayal of Patton and it's certainly hard to argue with that choice. Other than him, though, there's not much worth remarking on from an acting standpoint. Even past Oscar winner Karl Malden was almost completely overshadowed by Scott's towering performance.Franklin J. Schaffner's Oscar-winning direction captured the battlefield action well and also created some striking images in the more subdued moments. The film also won Oscars for art direction, editing & sound, so it should be readily apparent that the film's technical aspects were well handled. Jerry Goldsmith's evocative, Oscar-nominated score also deserves mention as one of the film's most memorable elements.The screenplay (co-written by Francis Ford Coppola) also won an Oscar but I'm not completely satisfied with it. Some of the dialogue doesn't quite cut it and I'm not sure if the fault lies with the script, the actors or the director. That being said, the story is quite compelling, though in following fact it has somewhat of a lull in the middle and ends anticlimactically. As far as sticking to the actual events goes, the film is pretty accurate with some acceptable tweaks for dramatic effect.All in all, I consider \"Patton\" to be one of my favourite war films of all time.

Scott channels the essence of the man in every scene, starting with, perhaps, my favorite 5 minutes in movie history - the opening monologue in front of the American flag.But this movie is more than just Scott's portrayal. Director Franklin J. Schaffner imbues this movie with the same sort of directorial panache that Scott imbues with the lead character. He drives the story forward with skill and draws some pretty interesting pictures along the way.Both Schaffner (for director) and Scott (as Patton) won Oscars for their work - as did the movie as BEST PICTURE in 1970 - it won a total of 8 Academy Awards all together. But I was disappointed when researching, that Karl Malden was not even nominated for his portrayal of General Omar Bradley - the one guy that had Patton's back. While Patton was \"blood and guts\", Bradley (and Malden) is this movie's heart and soul. Scott's portrayal does not work without Malden's counterbalance. A great, great movie. One that stands up 45 years later. A must see.9 (out of 10) stars - and you can take that to the BANK (of Marquis)",

I re-watched it recently, was more than disappointed that it didn't measure up to memory, and have downgraded my rating of it accordingly. It's a good film, mind you, superior to many of its kind, but when Scott's not on screen, \"Patton\" is just another WWII movie suffering the usual after-the-fact inaccuracies. Never mind the use of anachronistic tanks and other equipment, or the simplistic and inaccurate portrayal of engagements like the Battle of El Guettar, the film simply stalls whenever Patton himself isn't the focus. The pacing is often slow, and truthfully, a half-hour or more could have been cut without significant loss of content. Despite a solid performance from Karl \"The Streets of San Francisco\" Malden, too much time is spent on General Omar Bradley; for instance, the entire opening sequence (post-Patton monologue) at Kasserine Pass is, in my mind, superfluous.Nonetheless, a very good bio-film, and required viewing for Scott admirers, as well as students of the zeitgeist of a divided Vietnam War era United States. That \"Patton\" was President Nixon's self-admitted favorite film shortly before he commenced the secret and then not-so-secret war on Cambodia is food enough for thought.",

The acting of George C. Scott is simply superb, as he captures the ruthless, unwavering and stubborn character of General Patton, a man who thrived in the disciplined military system and was a firm believer of the eternal glory of war. The film is remarkably well paced considering its length, as it flows beautifully through the different settings showing George Patton in the last two years of the war and illustrating his controversial nature, all the while also allowing the audience to develop a great deal of admiration and respect for the man. Due to the exquisite cinematography and production design all the scenes are brilliantly constructed, portraying the war in a realistic and accurate manner, which makes Patton a very interesting viewing experience, one that offers an absorbing blend of a war film and a biopic, with both aspects executed to mere perfection.",

            "content": "From Oscar winning and Golden Globe nominated director Franklin J. Schaffner (Planet of the Apes), this is a pretty good war film about one of the most infamous and heroic leader's. The film begins with my favourite and most memorable moment where Gen. George S. Patton Jr. (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated George C. Scott) addresses his troops in front of the large stars and stripes flag. The rest of the film is good too, for nearly three hours, although it is mainly seeing the attitude of Patton, his many chats with fellow leaders such as Gen. Omar N. Bradley (Karl Malden), Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery (Michael Bates), Capt. Chester B. Hansen (Stephen Young), Brig. Gen. Hobart Carver (Michael Strong) and Moroccan Minister (Albert Dumortier). Also starring Frank Latimore as Lt. Col. Henry Davenport, Morgan Paull as Capt. Richard N. Jenson, Karl Michael Vogler as Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, Patrick J. Zurica as 1st Lt. Alexander Stiller, James Edwards as Sgt. William George Meeks, Lawrence Dobkin as Col. Gaston Bell and David Bauer as Lt. Gen. Harry Buford. There are a few battle scenes which add excitement, you see some stuff from the Germans, and there is great theme music, but the one who steals the show is indeed the performance of Scott, who was the first actor in Oscar history to refuse his award (second being Marlon Brando in The Godfather). It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Factual Material or Material Not Previously Published or Produced for Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North, and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Special Visual Effects and Best Music for Jerry Goldsmith, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Sound Track, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. General George Patton was number 29 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes, the film was number 89 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 44 on The 100 Greatest War Films. Very good!",

Add to this the fact that the historical Patton was himself an erudite and intelligent man who only adopted a false persona of machismo and bluster and you have a film which is entirely about both performance and the egos which fuel wars (see Kaufman's \"The Right Stuff\"). This, incidentally, is why actor George C Scott, who plays General George Patton in the film, was interested in the project, though he'd ultimately be unhappy with the film's final product. He'd go so far as to turn down the Oscar he won for his role, disgusted by the film's popularity. Odd for a war movie, \"Patton\" is interested in the logistics of war, the scale of the war effort, the size of the US military machine and of course the expansiveness of Europe itself. Watch how Schaffner stresses the lengths of supply lines, the distances covered by tanks and convoys, the vast number of different generals operating in tandem etc.",

            "content": "'Patton' is a anti-protest, pro-war film about General George Patton, released in 1970 in the dust of the Vietnam War. George C. Scott plays the leading role fabulously, its such a colorful character greased in patriotism and old-school justice and Scott adds further detail to him with a pair of darkened eyes and a humorous grin. Patton had been studying warfare throughout history with fanatical interest, and he believed that he had been a warrior in his past life - his ingenious war tactics made him one of the most successful American Generals to ever live in the 19th century. The film takes place when Patton and his army teared down Axis forces in North-Africa, started racing British General Montgomery throughout Sicily and finished off his WWII-campaign in Normandy. Artistic elements of director Franklin J. Schaffner and screenwriters Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North does push historical accuracy aloof at occasions, but as I always emphasize when watching historic films - it was/is the filmmaker's adaption. It features a great score by Jerry Goldsmith, and is shot fantastically by Fred J. Koenekamp who really captured the battle-scenes brilliantly with wide lenses - and although 'Patton' was too early on for when the sound editing revolution of the 70ties rode in, there's punch and high drama in the action sequences that still impresses. 'Patton' is fascinating as a character study, and it feels a bit like a left-hook compared to many other war-movies that lend much of its power and message to criticizing American government and leadership. I'm not saying that 'Patton' is absolute pro-war, but whatever Patton snuffed out about cowardice among his soldiers, or acted like a primadonna when big questions arose, nobody could touch him when it came to important, victorious battles - and 'Patton' celebrates him for it.",

I'm happy to say that the performance matched my expectations, and even exceeded them.This is a pure character study... the plot has very little suspense, we all know how world war 2 turned out and Patton's role in the war is also pretty well known. What keeps you watching is the desire to see the characters complexities revealed as the predictable chain of events unfolds.What makes the film so great is that Patton was such a complex and eccentric character and the film pulls no punches in it's depiction. The script shows Patton, warts and all... The good, the bad and the ugly. During the course of the film I went from hating him, to liking him again about every 10 minutes.The actual battle sequences are fairly uninspired but throughout the film they do a good job of giving you the feeling that a huge battle is taking place just over the hill and there is a great sense of being surrounded by war. The soundtrack is excellent and the direction almost reminds me of a John ford film in the way it relies on exterior Locations to provide atmosphere. A large portion of the film takes place outdoors and the locations chosen are excellent and perfectly photographed. There are moments when you almost feel like you're there, particularly the quieter moments right before the start of a battle.I would probably rank this among my top 3 WW2 films now and i can't think of anybody i know who wouldn't enjoy it.

Patton becomes, like a great literary character, defined by his contradictions: a modern warrior obsessed with the past and his possible past lives; deeply religious, yet deeply profane; a master of details who often watched seemingly insignificant events unravel his private and professional ambitions.* mild spoiler *The final shot of Patton staring at a windmill like a modern Don Quixote is at once both poignant and telling. like the whole film, it is great cinema and great biographical history.",

Scott's Oscar-winning portrayal dominates the film and overshadows all the other characters, much as Patton dominated those under his command in real life. There is no real attempt to create another strong character in the movie; Karl Malden's Omar Bradley is mainly used to react to Patton and the British General Montgomery is seen as a caricature, a stereotypical stuffy Brit who contrasts with Patton's earthy and impulsive nature. Scott truly becomes Patton in this film; it's difficult now to think of one without the other. The characterization and the film have many layers. On the one hand, 'Patton' is a straightforward war flick, with big, well-staged battle sequences. But it is also a brooding psychological study of a complicated individual, one who's near-madness goes hand in hand with his cunning and courage. Patton comes across as, among many things, an outsider in his own chosen field of endeavor. The other officers, including the generals who are his superiors, consider him something of a brilliant kook, to be used when needed and shunted aside when he isn't, or when he embarrasses them. Eisenhower, who is never seen or heard in the film, and his group of generals are businesslike, no-nonsense types who share none of Patton's flamboyance or showmanship. To them, the war is an ugly business to be concluded as quickly and painlessly as possible. For Patton, it is a holy, glorious crusade that defines him and his reason for being. Some critics claimed the movie was both pro-war and anti-war. I have to agree with Roger Ebert, it's no such thing; it's about as pro-war as you can get. But since its setting is World War II, that is not a difficult or far-fetched notion to accept. Even in this confused day and age where we agonize over whether conflicts are worth getting involved in, most people agree that the U.S. was on the right side in the second world war and that vanquishing Hitler and the Nazis was the right thing to do. Patton embodies that ideal and so we naturally root for him even if some of his actions and statements go against what we would do. George C. Scott so inhabits the character of Patton that it almost becomes irrelevant whether the portrayal is one-hundred per cent accurate. As war historians have pointed out, liberties are taken both with dialogue and plot points; there was no 'race' for Messina between Montgomery and Patton, there were actually two soldiers who were slapped, etc. But these easily fall into the realm of cinematic license and do nothing to detract from the essential reality Scott brings to his characterization. And it certainly says something about General Patton that the famous speech he gave in 1944 had to be toned down for a movie that was released in 1970!",

After a lot of coaxing on the part of Ma and my youngest Brother, Dad agreed to go in with them to see the Film.

It would be truly difficult to not like it, for it was an Epic Tale of a real flesh and blood man, who had lived just a few years before, and a man whom we should be very to have fighting on the Allied side of the Hostilities.What Director Franklin Schaffner, Producer Frank McCarthy and Associate Producer Frank Caffey did was get together and have a \"Frank\" discussion about just how to proceed with this project.* Somewhere along the line they decided to make full use of as many veteran character actors available to fill out the cast. Whether or not that this was their plan, they had a large number of highly able Actors, many of which lack that \"Movie Star\" \"Drop Dead\" good looks. And, coincidentally, that's how most real people are in Real Life.Because of this policy, there were many Supporting Players cast in PATTON who had their greatest career roles. Some good examples are Larry Dobkin(Colonel Gaston Bell) and John Ducette(Major General Lucian K. Truscott). Both men had long careers in supporting parts in TV and the Movies, and here got a chance to display their acting skills to their largest venue of exposition.The filming done in Spain and Morocco gave a truly authentic look to the combat scenes. The production team is said to have made good use of real Soldiers from the Spanish Army to provide the large number of Military extras needed for the staging of the recreated battles.** The use of clips from FOX Movietone News Reels of the day was an excellent touch of authenticity and made for a good bridge for parts of the story.(That voice sure sounded like the real Lowell Thomas, who did narration for Movietone.)We all know how the War came out, so there is no reason to check the \"contains spoilers\" box above. No? But all kidding aside, this film, in spite of the huge, epic battle scenes, great numbers of personnel(civilian & military) and the serious situations of War, is still a character driven story. And in no other area is this more apparent than the multifaceted portrait of Patton by Mr. Scott.George C. Scott, as we all know, was awarded and refused to accept his Oscar for \"Best Actor in a Leading Role\". We're truly sorry for this, as he apparently was also. He did start attending the Awards ceremonies several years later, but the TV director in charge of the telecast did his best to keep Mr. Scott's countenance off of the home screens as much as possible. The whole episode was such a damn shame! There were some truly fine and original touches put into the screenplay. We found out that the General cursed a lot, but prayed on his knees. He was a tireless and relentless driver of his troops, yet he composed poetry and recited it frequently. His was a hard personality to define and portray.The opening scene, the now famous Patton Prolog pretty well nails it when it comes to this characterization. The scene is made to give the impression of the General himself, stepping up on the theatre's stage to address his troops and the audience. The voice intonations, not unlike that of a Football Coach's half-time pep talk, made use of both the Queen's English and a lot of slang and even vulgarity.But it was this scene that was said to have captured the essence of Patton and set the tone as the Movie's \"grabber\". It was the creation of one Francis Ford Coppola, later director & screen writer of THE GODFATHER. Thank you Mr. Coppola!* Get it? A \"Frank\" discussion!** The men of the Spanish Army portrayed German & Italian Troops, as well as British and American Soldiers. We wonder what old Generalissimo Francisco Franco(1892-1975) felt about that!(Hey, another Frank!)NOTE: As a side bar and point of interest, we thought it proper to point out the contributions of veteran sound effects man, Murray Spivack on the production. His long career dated back more than 4 decades. He had worked on the original KING KONG(RKO 1933).",

            "content": "The critics who dismiss this film as bad primarily because it is pro-American seem blinded to the probability that it's the most complex and artful film representation of the fierce pride and nagging problems that come with commanding any army of a democracy in a great war. (Perhaps their ancestors who served in that democratic army, or who were liberated in their millions by 20th century American soldiers, would be less inclined to condemn this portrayal of those soldiers and their leaders.) In any case, Patton, the poet, the historian, the bully, the sentimentalist, the great tactician and embarrassing propagandist, is shown in this haunting film to be the ultimate representative of type: the tyrant we call on to ensure defeat of the Great Tyrant. Of course, \"democratic army\" is an implied contradiction, and it is exactly this paradox that is examined and illustrated so brilliantly in Patton. The General knew enough about history to realize he would be harshly judged by some historians, the latter day advocates of political correctness, as he had been in his own lifetime. Of course, there is ambiguity in his character and ambivalence in people's feelings about him. (An old Warrant Officer told me he was in a military hospital in occupied German and when Patton's death was announced, half the soldiers there cried and the other half cheered.) He is hardly painted with untainted glory in this film, which captures well his self-awareness. Contrast Scott's perfectly delivered profane-glorious speech in the first innovative moments of the film with his message in the final scene when the resigned old warhorse, walking away from us into history, reminds himself and us: \"All glory is fleeting.\" This is impeccably balanced work by writers North and Coppola, with superb directing by Schaffner, backed throughout by Goldsmith's alternately triumphant and plaintive score. Listen to the recurring \"distant trumpets\" (echoed in Saving Private Ryan). Patton is a classic.",

It stars George C Scott, Karl Malden, Michael Bates, Edward Binns, John Doucette, Stephen Young, Michael Strong and Cary Loftin. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Fred J. Koenekamp.Pic is a part biography of George S. Patton Jr. which follows his exploits in WWII until his retirement from service.Released at the time of the Vietnam War, there's a certain bravado in the makers choosing this period to release a biopic about one of America's most famous - and controversial - military characters. Led by a tour de force performance by Scott as Patton, Shaffner and his team rightly portray the man as full of flag waving bluster, gigantic egotism and majestic tenderness. The complexity of the man in Scott's hands is what drives the film to greater heights.Schaffner (Planet of the Apes) shows a smart eye for battle scene construction (shot in 70 millimetre - Dimension 150), this puts us viewers right in amongst the horrors of warfare. The supporting cast do sterling work in the face of Scott's barnstorming show, which when all told as a film leaves us with a war biography of great depth and one that rightly is held up as a marker for such genre ventures. 9/10",

            "review_title": "Last Hurrah for the Fighting Male of the West",
            "content": "Just saw 'Patton' with George C. Scott for Veteran's Day and thought I would comment on it while it's still a fire in my mind.Francis Ford Coppola wrote a very enlightened screenplay that thoughtfully explores the Western Male Ethos and its accruing limitations as it plays its 'civilizing influence' out across the millennia. But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing, not one little thing without the towering Shakespearean quality performance of George C. Scott. When actors speak about shadings, depths and levels, undertones and overtones in a performance this is what they are talking about.This thing of beauty that Scott creates in the persona of General Patton will explain to you on a visceral level why we still have wars and why Cronus ate his children. Why Knute Rockne felt it necessary to explain the need of any society to sublimate somehow the natural male spirit and propensity for combat and, (dare I say it?) conquest in their relationships and surroundings. When wide-eyed innocents ask you \"-why is there War?\", don't explain anything to them. Just sit them down to watch this film and they will also understand why there is football and the deification of Bruce Lee.It is because of this guy; the 'pure warrior' strutting about over a vast playing field creating big Hollywood effects in blood and explosions and steeling himself against the human carnage he has wrought without hardly breaking stride.It is for the glamor and the glory and the thrill and the love of POWER, baby. THAT is why males engage in such a 'preposterous way to settle a dispute' as Sherlock Holmes would comment registering his disgust while twiddling his thumbs and awaiting a 'case' that will once again have him engaged in the hunt and the chase and the fight.Scott conveys through his performance a mythic archetype who somehow takes you grudgingly into his confidence and despite all his carefully orchestrated bombast gets you to know him in subtle and intimate ways. He knows, like Alan Ladd's 'Shane', that his days are numbered. There have been way too many women and children marched naked in the parade before the conqueror's stand for him to be put up with much longer and the clamor for him to march his own way back into the dim mists of history is rising to a deafening pitch. But before he goes, he just wants to hitch up his ivory plated pistols one last time, partners, and show you turkeys how a real warmonger gets it done. That is because he honors and reveres and loves all this with a fervor approaching religious ecstasy and in a way you never will. As James Brown would exclaim, \"Everybody relax; and watch me work!\" The wonder is how Scott manages to simultaneously convey General George Patton as a larger than life figure and yet as someone as real and down to Earth as that son of a bitch who keeps complaining about how your kids are always running across his lawn and what he'll do to them the next time. Seeing him in scenes with the other actors he stands out not because of the usual physical beauty of the standard leading man, but because he seems so out of place. He is indeed a walking human anachronism. This is World War II and the American Armed Forces have enough intelligence, grit, technology and will to win it. But just in case events don't go their way, they have brought Solomon Grundy back from the grave to reserve as their Ace in the hole.Karl Malden and supporting cast come across as temperate paragons of sanity next to Scott's fiery Patton. Even the Nazi officers seem like civil servants simply doing their job, as was their assertion when defending the Jewish holocaust. This film, to Scott's credit, seems all about Patton and the holy and unholy forces he has unleashed to make everybody head for the hills before all the evidence is burned and he is finally reigned in for good. Everybody else is fighting for Home and Country, but Scott's Patton is the Spirit of War plying them to accept his Faustian bargain. Thank God nobody takes him up on it.There are many other things to be said about this film. It is like encountering a beautiful woman in the Library. Later on, you try to convince yourself she wasn't all that, but upon encountering her again you realize she WAS all that and there were even more features to her beauty that only now you can appreciate.This is not 'The Best Years of Our Lives'. But should you like films that make you feel like you're part of a winning gang earning the approval of an ornery father by doing the impossible and whose portrait oddly resembles that of the dearly departed Dorian Gray, I can only recommend this poetry spouting reincarnation of the Force of War.However, when taking your girl on a date, and having a choice between seeing 'Love Story' or 'Patton', I suggest you see 'Love Story' first.",

The same can be said of Hackman & Douglas. When this coming together of actor & role occurs we get the instant feeling that there is nobody else who could play the part, they are almost one & the same such is the performance.I consider this to be the ultimate in acting ability the skill to totally immerse ones self in the part & to make it look real.You almost come away feeling you have witnessed history having seen the actual person.

I doubt if I've even seen a photograph let alone newsreel footage of the real Patton so I have no way of knowing how close George C. Scott's portrayal is, but I have seen Scott in other roles - The Hustler, for example - and he does seem to be something of a one-trick pony who has mastered the role of the ruthless, cynical, arrogant lawyer, tycoon, militia man and plays it to perfection each time somebody yells 'action'. Probably the best thing I can say is that I wasn't bored by the two-and-a-half hours running time but I wouldn't necessarily want or need to watch it again.",

            "review_title": "What is the big deal?",
            "content": "I've given it two chances, but I just didn't see the big deal about Patton. Hailed as one of the greatest war pictures of all time and sweeping up seven Academy Awards, I felt it was far inferior to other films of the mid-century like The Longest Day, Tora! Tora! Tora!, and Too Late the Hero. The whole aura of the movie felt very self-satisfied, as if the filmmakers and actors were far more concerned with their own images than those of the people in the film itself. I couldn't help imagining George C. Scott watching the dailies and being enormously pleased with his performance - which took me out of the viewing experience. He didn't feel present in front of the camera; he felt like he was watching himself. Karl Malden also came across as smug, as did most of the supporting cast. James Edwards, as Patton's valet, managed to come across as a soldier rather than an actor, but perhaps it was the role. His purpose was to literally support another character and fade into the background, so he couldn't look at himself in the mirror all the time.For such a big production and all the hype, I was surprised to be disappointed even in the war scenes. I usually like director Franklin J. Schaffner's work. However, by 1970, any WWII movie needed to be extraordinarily good, since movies on the subject had been made for thirty years and were no longer a novelty. This movie felt both contrived and watered-down, especially since it was released the same year as Tora! Tora! Tora!. The two films were both based on real events and included real figures from WWII, but while one blindly glorified America's role in the war, the other exposed a horrifying secret. As Goldie Hawn said when she revealed the winner for the Best Actor of 1970, \"Oh my God, it's George C. Scott!\", if you finally get around to watching this classic and aren't impressed, you can feel free to paraphrase her: \"Oh my God, this is Patton?\"",

Scott more than just plays out the role, he really makes every piece credible, I have never before seen someone convincingly talk about being a re-incarnation, it half left you wondering a bit with his description of the time and saying he could smell the battle, I would guess the dialogue was approximated from the testimony of the man with him.The movies attention to detail and conciderations on political, moral and war opinions make you wonder about every other great wartime hero. Many must have had faults some possibly even as bad or worse than Patton's but because some of his surfaced at the right times to make a big splash controversially this man got blown up into one of the most notorious leaders in history. At the point where he whacked the private over the head and cursed him I was wishing it was him to eat a bullet for his behaviour.There is nothing really to rate this down, entertainment value is not high but if it was it would detract from the films importance. It's one of the most enduring and informative biographies.

Patton is loved by the Germans but often despised by his own leaders due to his arrogance, inability to follow order and how verbose he is. Will his ways catch up with him? This movie is directed by Franklin J. Schaffner (Planet of the Apes) and stars George C. Scott (The Hustler), Karl Malden (A Street Car Named Desire), Stephen Young (The Silent Partner), Bill Hickman (The French Connection) and Michael Bates (A Clockwork Orange). The storyline for this picture is very interesting and unpredictable. The battle scenes are intense and Patton as a character is so outspoken and arrogant that you never know what he's going to do.

Patton was brilliant as a General and very eccentric and complex as a man. He was glorified and vilified, reshipped and abhorred. He was a natural warrior and Scott is able to convince the audience that HE is Patton. He convinced me, anyway! There is an excellent supporting cast, led by Karl Malden as General Omar Bradley.

Most of the movie contains discussions; speeches; meetings; strategic planning; and, other 'non-battle' scenes...as well as Patton constantly getting into trouble with his superiors because of his actions, and, his words and lack there of.Much like \"Battle of the Bulge\" (1965), the tanks aren't the real types used during the battles in this war. I read somewhere that they are actually the 'same' tanks used in \"Battle of the Bulge\" (this movie was also made in Spain with the help of the Spanish Army, from whom all of these tanks were borrowed). The Americans are using later-model Sheridan tanks in place of Shermans; and, the Germans are using (ironically) later-model Patton tanks as Tigers.

            "content": "Grand in scope, accomplished in production & riding high on George C. Scott's magnificent performance, Patton is an epic biographical account of the decorated but also controversial American General, George S. Patton, and covers his stint as tank commander during World War II. Winner of 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Patton remains one of the most impressive biopics in existence and is one memoir that's as informative as it is engrossing.Set during the Second World War, Patton follows its titular character who arrives in North Africa to take charge of the demoralised American troops after they suffer heavy casualties at the hands of German forces. The plot covers his stint as he leads his soldiers to victory over the enemy before heading to Europe where he would go on to script one of the most astonishing sweeps in warfare history. Over the course of its runtime, the film also focuses on his human flaws.Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner & co-written by Francis Ford Coppola, Patton opens with a massive American flag pinned on the entire canvas where we are introduced to the titular character who then goes on to deliver the now infamous monologue, which in addition to beginning the story on an instantly captivating note also offers an insight into his colourful & no-nonsense persona. The main plot then follows which is a character study that takes as much interest in Patton's strengths as a leader as it does in his faults as a human.The production design team is in charge of a huge canvas here & they fill the wide locations with set pieces that are more or less in tune with documented history, whether it's the tanks or outfits or battlefields. Also adding enhancement to its imagery is the brilliantly controlled camera-work that makes sure that every moment is captured in fine detail. At 172 minutes, it is a daunting film to sit through this biopic but the runtime isn't even felt for the most part. And Jerry Goldsmith contributes with a militarised score that skilfully compliments the story & keeps its tone in tact.The acting department is spearheaded by George C. Scott who turns the picture into a one- man-show with his memorable performance as George S. Patton. Taking a much balanced approach in the rendition of his character, Scott is able to exhibit the best & worst traits of the notorious General with immaculate precision and carries the whole film on his shoulders with effortless ease. Although it's easy to hate this character, there are also moments when you can't help admiring him for Scott does well in balancing both positive & negative sides of Patton, plus he's brilliantly supported by the rest of the cast.On an overall scale, Patton is every bit worthy of all the accolades it has garnered since its release and is definitely amongst the finest examples of biopics & war filmmaking out there. It's a thoroughly engaging cinema that makes you root for as well as criticise the same man who was admired for his leadership but was also lambasted for his distorted philosophy of life. It's not just the characterisation aspect that's laudable here for the movie is technically sound as well and the battle sequences have a gritty, realistic feel to it. An important lesson in biopic filmmaking that offers a fair treatment to an unfair personality, Patton is absolutely worth your time & money.",

            "content": "'Patton' tells the story of General George S. Patton Jr. who has been described as the Allies' greatest general. This was a man who loved to fight and lived for it. He didn't fight for freedom, democracy or any other idea but merely for the love of it. And for this love, he wanted to win the battle. This arguably made him a great leader but had some serious drawbacks which the film wonderfully demonstrates. 'Patton' really does capture the essence of the General and after doing some reading, it appears to paint an accurate portrait. Patton himself was aware of his weakness and the consequences his actions brought. He even accepts responsibility but he can't lose sight of the fact that he's a born fighter. Director Franklin J. Schaffner has made one of the most fascinating character studies and George C. Scott delivers a riveting spirited performance that is highly nuanced and very detailed. Karl Malden is equally convincing as General Bradley who's a bit of a brotherly figure and conscience to Patton.On the technical side, it's a remarkably well-made film. The sequences that show the aftermath of the war are haunting (without having to be too graphic). The battle scenes are well choreographed. The cinematography is another standout.It's almost three hours long but there is not a single dull moment. To sum it up, 'Patton' is one of the most intriguing character-driven films I have ever seen. Even long after the closing credits have stopped rolling, I found myself thinking about this compelling figure.",

            "content": "Not much else I can add to all the favorable comments about this movie. \"Patton\" is definitely George C. Scott's greatest performance, and was truly Oscar-worthy. It's funny that George C. Scott has never received the acclaim he deserves as one of our best actors. He wasn't a \"big star\" type, like Clark Gable, John Wayne, Henry Fonda, etc., but he was an excellent actor who could completely submerge his persona into that of the character he was portraying. To me this is the mark of a truly great actor, as opposed to a \"movie star\". Marlon Brando has often been hailed as America's best actor, but I think Scott beats him hands-down.George C. Scott's entire career shows an astonishing breadth and depth, and he could convincingly portray characters who were in no way alike. Next to this, the \"big stars\" of Hollywood always seemed to be themselves, merely playing a different character. Scott was equally convincing as General Patton, as an aging con-artist in \"The Film-Flam Man\", as Sherlock Holmes (or at least a guy who thought he was Holmes)in \"They Might Be Giants\", as a flamboyant Air Force general in \"Dr. Strangelove\", as a seedy wheeler-dealer in \"The Hustler\", as a chilling Ebinezer Scrooge in \"A Christmas Carol\", as a burnt-out boozy doctor in \"The Hospital\", as a retired British Army officer turned detective in \"The List of Adrian Messenger\", or as a hard-bitten veteran LAPD cop in \"The New Centurians\". Other solid efforts that immediately come to mind include \"Petulia\", \"Anatomy of a Murder\", \"The Changling\", and \"The Day of the Dolphin\" (he was about the best thing in that otherwise very mediocre movie). By contrast, Brando peaked early in a few convincing roles, then went downhill fast with one ludicrous performance after another (anyone care to remember such pics as \"Reflections in a Golden Eye\"? \"Desiree\"? \"A Countess from Hong Kong\"? \"Teahouse of the August Moon\"? just to name a few).Perhaps George C. Scott never received his due as a great actor because he was so much an \"outsider\" (including his famous refusal of the Oscar for \"Patton\"); maybe the Hollywood-types never forgave him for not acting beholden to them. At any rate \"Patton\", like many other George C. Scott movies, is definitely \"must see\" cinema!",

            "content": "Patton (1970) :\nBrief Review -A heroic and controversial tale of Inteprid Warrior George Patton deserved to be told and deserves to watched. The story of brave but mannerless and unknown general from World War 2 will take you on spellbounding heroic ride. The film shows some real heroism and controversial content that nobody would have dared to display but at the end majority of viewers will fall for George Patton. He was reckless, careless but he was dedicated. He didn't know nothing about politics, family affairs all he knew was War and destroying enemy at any cost. The guy who had reputation even among his opponents. This complex story needed to be made and American people needed to know this unknown tale, and it was meant to be made in Classic manners and so is Patton. The deserving acclaimed biopic over the years for a reason. George C Scott as Patton gave an unforgettable performance and if he had not won Oscar then it would have been Oscar's lost not his. Whenever it comes to Biopic i would love to watch out for characterisation (well that's mandatory in every film anyways), if that fails then entire narrative falters but Patton doesn't belong to those faltered family. The writing and crafting is done smartly keeping emotions and real events well balanced. The supporting cast is tremendous. Most of the war films go for putting in some additional stuff like love story, family values, friendship but Patton is fully focused on Patton and War events. There isn't any useless garbage in this 170 minutes film and that's why it doesn't feel long. Franklin Schaffner deserves a gramd salute for taking up such a topic and presenting it in so freaking awesomely. I will remember Patton fir years as one war film that shown only and only the required content and no useless melodrama or typical love angles and all. I just gotto stand up for a moment and Salute the entire team for this heroic film. A CLASSIC !RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

I've heard reviews and recounts of the film describing it as a `war film'.  After finally seeing Patton, I would consider it more of a biopic than anything.  We come away from the film with enough understanding of the man to see why he was great, but also leave with enough of a sense of mystery about him that makes the viewer want to do some additional research should they be so inclined.Patton is definitely one of those films that should be seen once in one's life.

            "content": "Patton (1) (1970) -And another episode of the Simpsons suddenly makes more sense! (Season 1, Episode 5 - Bart The General)\nI will never understand those bloody daft trousers with wings that the title character here was wearing though.I didn't know anything about Patton, before watching this film and I still couldn't tell you if George C. Scott delivered an accurate portrayal of the man, but regardless of that, he certainly embodied a commanding character that was incredibly interesting and watchable. He had a great presence and I watched for him in every scene, because the acting was superb and I was on his side, almost all of the way through the film. Towards the end Patton's own politics shined through and they seemed to be skewed with those of my own and I would hope that had something to do with the brain damage he was alleged to have been suffering from, but nevertheless in many ways, like all men of war, it appeared that he did some great things and apparently some that were less than great too.Although I am a complete pacifist and generally don't enjoy watching bloody battles, I would like to believe, based on the good that was shown in this film, that the positives outweighed the negatives and that in the long run he saved more lives than he lost. The Americans apparently rated him highly enough to have him portrayed in such a fashion here, so he was a hero to at least some of them.I actually thought that they showed the balance of his character, quite well. The scene in the infirmary tent where he shouts at a \"Coward\" was balanced by the way he reacted to the blind man lying in a bed opposite just beforehand. They were clever to show that he wasn't all good, but that he also had a great military mind that helped to bring an end to a bloody war.The film itself must have had one hell of a budget for the extras alone, of which I'm sure their were thousands. I have always liked it when a film has made the effort to deliver realism and that was how those scenes felt, because they had bothered to spend on a correct number, instead of re-using the same faces over and over in different outfits copied and pasted. It was something I also appreciated about 'The Longest Day' (1962). That film was also clever to have the German's subtitled, instead of speaking English with an accent or not even that, as I have seen with some films where it has grated on me.I did feel that it had similarities to 'The Charge Of The Light Brigade' (1968) about it, without seeming to be the pointless bloody waste of life that was shown in that one. There were still obvious casualties, both fatal and otherwise, but it didn't appear to be just cannon fodder deaths that the makers of this film showed. Instead they felt victorious and glorious, which would usually be lost on me, because of my distaste for conflict, but they had a sort of Klingon \"Today Is A Good Day To Die\" way to them. They believed in what they were fighting for, because George S. Had instilled in to them and I nearly got carried along for the ride too.It did show up the British though. We looked like a bunch of Bally Ho Silly Boys and perhaps a Brit film about Field Marshall Montgomery would show Patton as a completely reckless American nutter, surrounded by sycophantic, blood thirsty yanks cruising for a fight, but which version would be right?It really was the only thing that let it down for me though. I prefer to see films that don't make either side look stupid, except perhaps Hitler and people of his ilk. Even the Germans came across better than we did.So many other actors were nearly cast in the title role, but although I didn't know anything of Patton, I can't imagine anyone else in it having seen this and I could also see why George C. Was so well recognised for his part. He was imposing as Ebenezer Scrooge in the 1984 version of 'A Christmas Carol' and I could see many of his characters traits from that film in his version of Patton too, so maybe he was just a gruff old man who stumbled around film sets, but that didn't detract from his performances in either film for me.Funnily, I felt that he bore a lot of similarities to Woody Harrelson too. There was something about his look and mannerisms as well as his voice/accent, but I couldn't find any connection between the two of them in real life.I was completely flabbergasted by how much I enjoyed this film. I think that it was mostly George C. That made it so impactive for me, but surely there was a part of George S's history that contributed to the content and its interest too. It will definitely be one of the highest rated war films on my list and certainly one of few that were pre 1980.754.63/1000.",

            "content": "I saw this during it's initial theatrical release where it looks it's best up on the big screen. I've seen it on television several times since but it's nicely filmed movie that really needs a big screen to do it justice. The story of General George S. Patton during World War II who had been in the military for a long time before WWII. At the beginning of the war he outranked Generals Eisenhower and Bradley and by wars end they had moved up in ranks to both be his superiors. Much of the basis for the screenplay was derived from Ladislas Farago's 1963 book Patton: Ordeal and Triumph and from General Omar Bradley's 1951 book on his WWII war experiences called A Soldiers Story. Additional insight into the mind of Patton came from the 1947 book of Patton's memoirs based on his letters called War As I Knew It. Patton was a very different general from Bradley. Bradley was gentle, courteous, polite and concerned for the welfare of his troops and hated military pomp. Patton was called Old Blood and Guts and reveled in war. He designed his own uniforms and carried a pair of pearl handled colt 45's on his hips and loved projecting a larger-than-life mythic image. George C. Scott was reportedly the 6th actor to be considered for this role after the likes of John Wayne, Robert Mitchum and Lee Marvin but as Patton you can't imagine anyone else in the role. Even seeing old newsreels of Patton himself he seems like an impostor to the film role of Scott. Scott dominated the picture and is in almost every scene for which his role earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor which he turned down. Karl Malden as Gen. Omar Bradley is the only other well-known actor in the film. Bradley served as a technical adviser on the film as did Gen. Paul D. Harris. The film's producer Frank McCarthy was himself a Brig. Gen. during WWII and worked for 20 years to get this film finally produced. It paid off with the Academy Award for Best Picture. Franklin J. Schaffer was reportedly the fifth choice to direct this film. He was known for his recent hit film Planet of the Apes and he would go on to direct Papillon and The Boys From Brazil but had a relatively short directorial career with only 14 films and none before or after Patton that compared to it. He won the Academy Award for Best Director. This is wonderfully photographed by cinematographer Fred J. Koenekamp who had not done a big hit film before. He would go on to film Papillon, The Towering Inferno and Billy Jack and had marginal hits with The Amityville Horror, Uptown Saturday Night and The Other Side of Midnight but would never have a chance to do another big film like Patton. It got him an Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography. Edmund H. North who had wrote screenplays for such films as Sink the Bismarck, Destry and The Day the Earth Stood Still and writer/director Francis Ford Coppola on the cusp of super stardom wrote the screenplay for which they received the Academy Award. The film also won Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing and Best Sound. It's other nominations were for Best Effects and Best Music. This film received awards from all the major industry organizations including Writers Guild of America, Directors Guild of America, New York Film Critics, National Society of film Critics, National Board of Review, Motion Picture Sound Editors, American Cinema editors, BAFTA, The Luarel Awards and the Golden Globes. It's a long one at almost three hours but it's an epic war picture and a dramatic character study into the complex personality of a man who was loved by many, hated by many, feared by most and ultimately one of WWII's most respected soldiers. I would give this a 10.",

            "content": "George S. Patton (1885 - 1945), a highly-decorated and outspoken U.S. officer, was influential in the Allied victory of WWII, notable for his campaigns in North Africa and while commanding the Third Army across Europe. He was not without his controversies, of course. In 1943, after slapping a shell-shocked \"coward\" in the medical hospital, Patton was severely reprimanded by General Eisenhower, and the incident nearly cut short his military career. In Franklin J. Schaffner's 'Patton (1970),' George C. Scott offers a commanding portrayal of the man, a master strategist and an egotist, who ruled his troops with an iron fist in his self-serving bid for historical immortality. WWII is portrayed, not as a battle of patriotic wills, but rather a battle of egos: throughout the North African campaigns, General Patton and British ally Montgomery (Michael Bates) engage in a petty rivalry, bluntly sacrificing strategy for personal glory.Whereas most military men would be glad to see an end to war, General Patton was a rare breed. Surveying the carnage of a disastrous overnight skirmish, he expresses his unashamed love for the stench of battle, his speech recalling Robert Duvall's \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning\" monologue in 'Apocalypse Now (1979)' {Francis Ford Copolla, as co-writer with Edmund H. North, won his first Academy Award for 'Patton'}. In one memorable scene, Patton bends down to kiss a shell- shocked soldier. His action is sickeningly transparent, a clumsy attempt to attain the humility of the great historical generals whom he admires with such fervour. It would have been more honest of Patton had he simply slapped the soldier as he had Charles H. Kuhl previously. A fine strategist he may have been, but Patton's showboating is depicted as a perpetual distraction from his military goals.",

            "content": "This film is neither a biopic nor a conventional war movie. It is too sprawling and narrative to be the former and too sweeping and Victorian to be the latter. Wikipedia describes it as an epic biographical war film, which I suppose its technically accurate. But it sounds like some description an English teacher would give, one that is not quite appropriate for what is one display here. It is too sweeping, too emotional, too driven, too dedicated to channeling the primal sophistication.From a critical standpoint, perhaps the greatest achievement of the film is how it shows the over-the-top character that is Patton without bias or framing. It shows the man as he was and how he saw the world. The people who like Patton come out of this movie thinking that it wanted them to like him. The people who don't like Patton come out of this movie thinking that it didn't want them to like Patton. Of course, really it is neither. It is somehow faces left and right without stopping staring straight ahead.I would say that Patton is one of those people whose lives just beg to be put on screen. He is basically what you would get if you combined the high points of the arrogant jerk character and the typical protagonist and blew it up tenfold. There are characters in film that are made to be unbelievably over-the-top but they don't come close to Patton. None of this is meant as an insult, by the way; he seems to transcend reality, bringing truth the old axiom, \"The difference between truth and fiction is that fiction has to make sense.\" He saw life as his story; yes, kids, if you think the world revolves around you, one day, you might be the greatest general of your time.But seriously, he believed himself to be the reincarnation of every great general in history, including the aforementioned Napoleon and Alexander the Great. He lived for war; it allowed him to rise to what he felt was his destiny. It is poetic that he died not long after the German surrender.What I'm trying to say is that the film reflects the man. This film is not light or fluffy about war or Patton, but it is not a hyper-realistic Saving Private Ryan-type movie either. It is as if Patton is a lead actor on the world's deadliest stage. As it should be.The only times the camera moves off Patton are the battle scenes. And even then, could you really say that they moved off him at all? Patton is battle. If anything, they moved off his outer frame and into his heart. This is the kind of man who would fight forever and never find it boring.I find it interesting that the screenplays for this and Apocalypse Now were both penned by the same man, Francis Ford Coppola. There are many similarities between the films; if you don't think that Colonel Kilgore was channeling at least some of Patton's energy, you did not watch the same movie that I did. Of course, Patton is a more complex character/person, but I can certainly imagine him saying something along the lines of, \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Both films also dive into the heart of war in a way that few others do. It is not portrayed in exactly the same way in both, but some of the basic elements are the same. Think about it. Take a normal war movie. Likely as not, the environment is portrayed like a deadly lion stalking its prey. There is nothing wrong with this: in fact, one of my all-time favorite films, Saving Private Ryan, goes this route. But those sorts of films have been done a million times and you need to be outstanding to not be a blip. Coppola's vision, on the other hand, is unique.The lion does not chase its prey. It charges towards it with eyes of insanity. Most war films have a deathly feel. Coppola's give off the impression that they are revoltingly, horrifyingly alive. He focuses more on the insanity so present in war than its morbidness. As a result, his films feel more interesting, and in a perverted way, more realistic. There are very few directors who could pull that off. He is one of them.For that matter, there are very few people who could convincingly play George S. Patton. George C. Scott is one of them, and not just because his name kind of looks like Patton's. He was the sort of rebel that really doesn't exist anymore, couldn't exist anymore- just like Patton. He also produced the sorts of results that are nigh-impossible to replicate- just like Patton. The casting is topped only by the execution. I do not just believe his performance whenever I watch it; I give up to it. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for this role; though, in true rebel fashion, he turned it down.This movie took home a whole slew of Academy Awards, and rightfully so; I would have been angered if it didn't, and not just because it's a good movie. 1970 was a terrible year for film; the second best movie released that year was likely either Love Story or Airport, two movies that I like well enough but are not all-time great movies in the least. Keep that in mind every time someone says how terrible movies are nowadays. This film towered over the cinematic year like Patton himself towered over any war theatre he took to.Goodnight.",

He praised and denigrated people by race (as was private routine then) but welcomed African-American tankers into 3rd Army (at the time, as was all the U.S. Army, segregated) and even was the first commander to integrate rifle companies when manpower got tight.\"Patton\" correctly salutes Patton by making a movie just as complex as he was; this film both celebrates martial glory and shudders at war's true horror. Patton read the Bible daily and believed in the efficacy of prayer even as he believed in reincarnation and used every profanity known to man to get his army moving. Patton's speeches were even more bloodthirsty than the first scene of the movie, a somewhat bowdlerized, but still stirring, version of his pre-combat speech to 3rd Army, yet as a commander he relied not upon brute force but maneuver and flanking movements to turn the enemy, get him fleeing and keep him that way. By the war's end, he had pushed the Wehrmacht further, with fewer lives lost, than any other Allied general.The truest memorial to the veterans of WWII was written in Hollywood celluloid; \"Patton\" is a worthy addition, and a fine, inspiring tribute to an American legend (and all who served under him). As Patton himself, with painful self-knowledge, said while viewing the carnage of a battlefield: \"War, I love it. God help me, I do love it so.\"",

            "content": "If you haven't yet experienced Patton - the movie, if you've experience the actual General you're probably not on this website - there might be several things stopping you: it might be that film your dad keeps going on about, or seem from afar to be a tragically outdated affair. Perhaps you don't like war films. All valid concerns, yet none need apply here.Released in 1970, Franklin J. Schaffner's Patton manages to be a mix of the very best of 60s cinema - a classy, colorful, epic affair - while heralding many traits that would define the 70s. It is as much a war film as Lawrence of Arabia, whose lofty heights it does not quite reach, because it is, first and foremost, a portrait, drawn on a huge canvas befitting such a huge man. Just as with David Lean's classic, you'd be forgiven for expecting jingoism and a romanticized portrayal, and just as with that film, you'd be wrong.Schaffner, though denied a place in the pantheon of great mid-century filmmakers, was far more than a technician. This is the man whose dedication and skill raised Planet of the Apes from silly B-movie to classic, and later gave us a surprisingly gritty vision of hell in Papillon. His gift for nuance and interesting contradictions is on solid display here, and while he peppers his film with impressively-staged and shot battle scenes, these only exist to say something new about our protagonist, all the better served by a rock-solid screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola. All this was inevitably only going to be as good as the lead actor, and in George C. Scott, a master at crafting fascinating but not necessarily likable characters, the filmmakers got more than they bargained for. Scott lights the screen in every screen, eliciting a wide range of emotional responses, but never less than fascinating. While often charismatic and charming, he does not hesitate to come off as a thug and a bully at times, creating a character of surprising depth.This great film owes its enduring appeal not to nostalgia but a rare level of excellence. Regardless what your opinion is of older films, epics or war flicks in general, this is unmissable.",

Some great scenes that show the complex nature of Pattons character (slapping the soldier, drinking with the Russian, shooting the donkey). There are the usual Hollywood stereotypes - Montgomery's character is very one dimensional - its a wonder we ever won the war with generals who were so pompous, posh and self centered - good job we had Patton to win it single handedly for us!

I feel that this film captures much of the true essence of General Patton, played perfectly in an Oscar-winning performance by George C. Scott. Although I don't necessarily like his foul mouth, I think it accurately recounts who he really was. The film makes him overbearing and gives him a sense of humor, making him real and someone we love to watch on screen. This film manages to entertain very highly, throwing in tons of details, down to Patton's wimpy little dog, to keep us interested the entire time. At nearly three hours, the film flies by. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Some scenes, such as Patton slapping another soldier, may be controversial to some, but they make it all the more interesting and thought-provoking for me. \"Patton\" is a rare film that gives me no reason to mark it down at all from a perfect rating.**** out of ****",

            "content": "\"Patton\" was a movie for its time. That time wasn't 1945, but more like 1970 when it was made. America was right in the middle of the Vietnam War and it wasn't going well. Patton reminded Americans that they once had generals that knew how to win.There are two ways to view \"Patton\". One is just in purely cinematic terms and the other is on how the film slots into broader cultural history, what it meant then and even now.As a film, it's brilliant. I'm not one to spot things like whether or not they used the right tanks or insignia, for me, \"Patton\" was a big movie with fantastic locations, an inspired script and great direction. Every dollar spent shows on the screen.More than just a good war movie, it got into the skin of George S. Patton Jnr. George C. Scott brought Patton to life in a performance that almost seemed like channelling.He projected ego along with humility, wit along with vitriol, contrition along with rage, and wisdom along with bombast. Contrasted against the more empathetic Omar Bradley (Karl Maldern), the film could be critical of him, but overall, Patton emerged as something of a military superhero, albeit one tinged with tragedy.Scott won the Academy Award for best actor, but refused it. To paraphrase that opening speech, one could actually pity those poor b*stards he was up against; they probably wished they had been nominated in another year.There is also that awesome score by Jerry Goldsmith, what a sense of elusive glory he achieved with those echoing trumpets.Made in 1970, this film was an antidote to what was happening in the 1960's. After WW2, America and its allies faced different kinds of wars. Goals were less clear, there were no front lines, there was plenty of collateral damage and military leaders were often discredited. The biggest battles seemed to be for the hearts and minds of Americans let alone anyone else's.I can't help feeling \"Patton\" looked back with something akin to nostalgia. The idea of George S. Patton was reassuring. Although he seemed an anachronism even by the end of WW2, the guy was a winner and America and the West were beginning to get used to compromise at best.\"Patton\" presented a strong leader, ruthless, but with the uncanny ability to fight and win his country's wars.",

Patton was almost the same in this movie as he was in life but in life he was much much larger and more colorful He inspired his men.At the time of the slapping incidents which is portrayed here almost as it happened Patton was the most popular General The Allies had. second only after Eisenhower and Bradley was third overall. This movie shows the problems that Eisenhower had with Patton he was really the only general who was feared by the Germans his leadership inspired the men to fight and he got great Press. But he was too much of a rebel and how do you deal with a rebel and punish him when he is your best general? George C. Scott was outstanding in his portrayal of Patton and he deserved his Oscar for this role and Scott did a Incredible Patton like thing in refusing the Oscar and adding to the glamour of the movie. And of course we have Karl Malden as Omar Bradley one of his best roles and most likely his most overlooked role which is a shame because he ADDS to the complex colorful story of PATTON. Everyone here carries off their role perfectly and the research alone is nothing short of brilliance this movie is one of the greatest movies made in my mind. More entertaining then the bio pic of MACARTHUR with the always brilliant Gregory Peck that movie although fun and entertaining fell short of the glory and glamour that was PATTON. Now I've always hoped and prayed the they could make a movie on Ike Eisenhower on the same scope and same care they showed in making Patton. Highly recommended this is not your typical war movie.

Films that purport to tell the story of a single famous man tend to reduce complex subjects to clich\u00e9s and rarely portray the person as having an interesting arc.A lot of the complaint applies here. Everything that this film has to tell you about George S. Patton is covered in the first hour, and it basically spends 3 hours showing you the same man stride through the canvas of WWII. It does a good job of mapping out the progress of the war and his role in it, but there's really no subtlety to his character.Still, within those limitations, you couldn't ask for a better film. Part of it is George C. Scott, who makes a goddamned meal out of thsi character and manages to suggest some subtleties that aren't necessarily in the film. Part of it is Franklin J. Schaffner, who by this point in his career was a master at painting huge film canvases. There are very few films shot on 70mm that are this huge and grand. The final part is Francis Ford Coppola's screenplay which manages to draw a really balanced portrait of the man. He was undeniably nuts and the kind of person that used human lives as a tool to further his own ego, but the film makes a good case for the need for mad strategic geniuses like him in times of war.",

            "content": "Director Franklin Schaffner's 1970 film, Patton, is a film that falls just shy of overall greatness, unlike his previous film, Planet Of The Apes, even though both had excellent scripts, were unconventionally shot, had great acting performances, and were films that fundamentally altered their subgenres, biopics and science fiction. It is a film that, while it's clearly not a great film, does not offer up an obvious reason. It starts off brilliantly, with Patton's famous address to the film audience, and then, well, becomes, in many ways, a routine biopic- at least when it's not about Patton directly, for George C. Scott owns the screen like few actors ever before him had. No, it's when we see other characters, or the big battle scenes, that the film becomes pedestrian. And that 20% or so of pedestrian film lowers the rest of the film's inarguable greatness to merely near-great status.Patton is not a great film, but in its flaws it delineates much of what a great film can be, and just how little of that needs to stem from the idea of a visionary or an auteur. As such, and along with Casablanca, it stands as one of the great arguments against the notion that films of quality must be wrought from the power and inspiration of a singular source. Franklin Schaffner, in fact, is proof that great art can come from people who are not gifted with innate greatness, just as the real General George S. Patton proved the opposite can also be true, and the two ideas not mutually opposing. As for the film, watch it for Scott's performance, watch it for a sense of American history (pro and con), and watch it because it's great entertainment, if not great art. Not all art need core into one's soul, sometimes pricking the flesh is enough. As such, Patton's a great prick.",

Patton was the right man at the right time, but cool thing about this picture is how it honors Patton's accomplishments without completely glorifying him. He isn't portrayed as perfect by any means.

            "content": "PATTON is a rich and in ways warm depiction of the WW II life of George Patton that remains loyal to his driving compulsion for victory in war and his uncompromising values toward honor as the mainstay of the battlefield. But what makes the film the great one it is is the focus upon the man's character---for this was no stereotypical war monger who needed to be satirized. George Patton was at heart a complex romantic--about warfare, about history, and about the honor of men dying in battle. He quoted Fredrick the Great, Alcebiades, and possessed a nonpareil understanding of military history.Who but George C. Scott could have approached this role so powerfully? It is reputed that John Wayne wanted the part badly, but the requirements necessary to portray Old Blood And Guts went far beyond what Wayne represented. Producers wisely realized this in casting Scott and they got even more than they bargained for. And if it wasn't the greatest performance of any military biography in movie history, it certainly ranks in the top three or four.Watching the movie MacArthur recently, the 1970's film starring Gregory Peck in the title role, I was struck once again by what always seems to be the antagonist of high military command---the politician. In MacArthur's case it centered on the decrees from above to stop short of planned engagements in the Phillipines and in Korea. In Patton's case it was the British one-upsmanship that stuck in his craw that Ike (General Dwight D. Eisenhower) allowed and even fashioned. Moreover, it was also the muzzle that the Supreme Allied Commander kept putting over Patton's mouth after his off-handed remarks mushroomed in the press. Unquestionably, Patton was a loose canon and Ike spent not a little energy dealing with out of control tank commander who could not have cared less about politics. But the personal frustration of political correctness was unpalatable to Patton. After the travail of warfare itself, it becomes one of the movie's central points. Few remember or know how badly the U.S. had been bloodied in North Africa until Patton arrived. Even fewer understand the nadir to which allied forces had sunk before we took back the upper hand in places like Africa and later in the campaigns that Patton cut across Europe. The general certainly was not responsible for the turnaround alone, but his unprecedented tank conquests became a juggernaut that did as much to win the war as anything MacArthur or Nimitz did in the Pacific. But that is where the similarities end. For unlike MacArthur who allowed his name to be placed in nomination for President, Patton had no political designs. When the war was over, his service was over. One of the movies most memorable moments is, of course, the \"hospital slapping incident\" in which the general humiliates a soldier with a bad case of nerves. It certainly did happen and Scott executes it powerfully---we see the veins bulging from his neck as he reaches for his six shooter and states that he will not \"subsidize cowardice!\" And we see Patton's utter frustration when Ike orders him to apologize. It must have been the supreme act of forbearance for Patton to comply. General George Patton was one of the last of his kind. Unlike today's commanders who must juggle the horrors of military verities with political correctness, Patton knew only one thing: drive on, drive on to victory. And for those who think he was mentally off-balance or just plain crazy, it needs to be stated that leaders such as Patton were the antitdote for what the free world faced from 1941--1945. The movie's final scene is a brilliant testimony to all that Patton must have learned by the time he was through. The war is over and the general has completed his service. He walks his dog alone out on the plains and thinks of ancient warriors who knew \"that all glory was fleeting.\" A windmill is significantly cast in the scene. The allusion to Cervantes' Don Qixote is unmistakable--for George Patton, like Don Quixote, fought windmills, too.Dennis Caracciolo",

With a prodigious runtime and a large budget, respected producers and writers, a very well endowed production scale with a high level of production values, including in the post production work, 'Patton' manages to produce \"Pap\".It is primarily for the films technical credits that I rate the film above a terrible 1-2/10 score. As a work of craft this is watchable but as a work of artistic output it is hindered by utterly bland and uncaptivating writing and stodgy direction, overblown acting, overlarge cast, overlarge set pieces and a complete failure to generate a convincing sense of time and place in almost any situation that it depicts.Karl Malden impressed me in small doses but the rest of the cast seem to be suffering from such a poor level of writing that any actors would be unable to overcome their material here. George C Scott himself, in the leading role as George S Patton, makes a remarkable effort but you can't carry a film if this length and supposed breadth with such pallid and flat material.Considering the man himself and his exploits and considering the historical context within which this film focuses itself onto his story: the western allies campaigns in Europe in the second half of the Second World War then I can honestly say that a well researched book or documentary will provide a far higher standard of exhilaration, excitement, interest and engagement.'Patton' to my mind represents an attempt at film making on a subject matter that the film makers in question were unequipped to justify.I sense that this film is so amazingly uninteresting and uninformative as a piece of artistic output because fundamentally those responsible for it's artistic creation, as opposed to it's technical production, were disinclined to view the subject with anything but dispassionate disinclination.I rate at 3/10 and I recommend to anyone interested in a meaningless powerhouse acting performance that says nothing of the historical personage being depicted and fans of seeing a lot of military uniforms and hardware on screen.

            "content": "Nice guys don't win wars. Patton was a notorious American general who came into prominence during the latter stages of WWII, who got the job done but won few friends in the process. He studied old battles from history, and duplicated their tactics, often to brilliant effect. But he cared little for what he considered cowards, and in one well documented incident slapped a man full on in the face for the terrible crime of being scared of guns... In front of an entire hospital ward. He also had a tendency of engaging his mouth before his brain, which led him to come into constant sparring with the US government. After the conflict was over, he was quickly removed from his post... a man who's provocative behaviour and outrageous jingoism had become something of a national embarrassment, despite his achievements on the battlefield. But did he deserve this ignominious fate? The movie attempts to answer that question.Being over two and a half hours long (with a musical intermission no less!) you might expect proceedings to drag at certain points... and indeed they do. But what keeps the action ticking along nicely is George C Scott's incredible performance as the controversial central character. According to this film's representation of him, he was just a man solely concentrated on getting the glory and annihilating the opposition... everything else, such as empathy with his men and following orders, just fell by the wayside. Scott somehow turns this rather gruff individual into a likable person, with an Oscar an ample reward for his efforts. For a feature made around 1970 the war scenes are extremely well done, with realistic explosions, convincing gunfire and detailed injuries adding to the resounding effect. Finally, it can also be quite funny, which is needed to leaven out some of the more bloody passages.So, not a film to half watch as you're chatting on the phone, but one to fully immerse yourself in when you have an afternoon spare. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. 7/10",

It's preposterous ham-fisted canonization, and as great as George C. Scott is as an actor, he cannot remotely make it work as anything other than broad, jingoistic caricature buoying a right-wing icon. \"Dammit, I don't want my soldiers to love me, I want to fight for me!\" \u2014 or some such hackwork.Scott is charismatic, yes, which gets it one star \u2014 the rest is absolute amateur-hour: god-awful sanitized \"action\" scenes, nary a thought given to historical accuracy, no semblance of even basic continuity. It's like somebody got an A-budget to make a B-movie, peed it away on just being a bad filmmaker, and the vaunted Academy gave it some awards because they figured Vietnam was lost and America needed a shot of B-12 in the balls.Ah, but the sainted subject matter \u2014 the irreverent, anachronistic, God-fearing general who nevertheless cursed liberally, disrespected the authority he damn well expected everyone to follow as long it was him, because he was that mesmerizing a presence \u2014 and yet, we don't hear one actual curse from this institutional \"rebel\" the entire movie or get any sense of how he did things differently other than disobey his orders to inflate his sense of his own nigh-psychotic narcissism, even as the filmmaker seems to pass this off as simply a symptom of \"greatness.\" This movie belongs in the category of The Green Berets, an archaic hunk of fecal matter that profanes difficult, textured subject matter of a three dimensional world by rendering it, badly, two-dimensionally, stupidly, with the purview of a so-called patriot, and yet diminishing patriotism by rendering it down something no more complex than blind religion. It all bespeaks the dogmatic limitations of the filmmakers, notably a glaring lack of talent or deliberation or capacity for lateral thought.My dad used to say how he agreed with Patton, that he should have kept on going after Germany straight to Moscow. It was an easy, cursory, dumb quip to deal with a nightmarish scenario, one so many of us lived under for far too many years. There was horrific danger in that kind of mentality, and it took a psychotic demagogue to breathe such words at all while wielding the potential martial power to actually do it \u2014 like a Gen. Jack D. Ripper fifteen years removed. That would have been an incredibly complex character for a filmmaker to show and a viewer try to understand, to weigh the retarded, dogmatic simplicity of his world-view with the bleak scape of a globe already in smoking ruin, genocide made into industry, with tens of millions already dead. Such a character study, of someone so fanatical, of such blue-eyed self-righteousness, as to presume himself a suitable master-race fuhrer for the master-race he had dispossessed, that would have been a profoundly mesmerizing premise for a movie, and something George C. Scott would have torn into like a rare steak.Instead we got this. Don't believe a word your Republican parents say. This was NEVER a good movie and it won't ever be.",

            "content": "Franklin J. Schaffner churned out the 1970 Best Picture winner, Patton, starring George C. Scott and Karl Malden. A wartime film about the harsh no-nonsense life of General George S. Patton, with George C. Scott in the titular role. Perhaps best known for the intensely moving speech at the beginning of the film delivered by the general, Patton explores one man's seeming love affair with all things related to war. It was an interesting ride, to say the least, of viewing 1970's top film, according to the Academy.The film opens in WWII and shows General Patton's (George C. Scott) career as a tank commander progressing through the invasion of Europe. Eventually highlighting the fall of the Third Reich, Patton shows one wartime successful, yet bizarre man who believes he has lived before. At one of his exploits he explains that he has been reincarnated to the General he is now, but lived before in the time of the great Roman empire; Patton even believes he fought in battle on behalf of the Romans. No one is ever able to pinpoint the General's character. He is stern one moment, jovial the next, always shifting between his idiosyncracies with the blink of an eye. With each \"victory\" Patton gains in battles, the more inflated his ego becomes. The larger Patton's ego becomes, the more talking he does, the more talking he does, the more trouble he gets into. Patton eventually becomes a far too controversial figure to have around and begins to realize that the once great commander must now accept a life in which he is no longer needed to serve his former post. Through all the transitions he goes through, Patton learns the ultimate lesson; glory, even for the best, is always fleeting.This movie was strange. I understood without the constant show of it that Patton was a different sort of individual. I always applaud a movie that gets its point across about characters or issues in the story line without drilling it into the audience. A good 40 minutes could have been cut out of trying to convince me that there is something \"off\" with Patton; his opening speech made this abundantly clear. I will say that the acting of George C. Scott was phenomenal. The Academy definitely got it right, giving top acting honors to Scott that year. Karl Malden was great in this film, as well. Who doesn't like Karl Malden? He's such a seemingly down-to-earth actor that just exudes happiness, and it's hard for me not to love him in every role I see him in. In Patton, he plays General Omar N. Bradley, the newly appointed 2nd in command under General Patton. Malden does a great job towing the line between following his commanding officer, yet realizing Patton's flaws and being weary of them. Directorial achievement must be noted for Franklin J. Schaffner. Since Patton's introduction to the film, he commanded each scene he was in, elevating his image and making even the audience worry about what he'll do next.Patton is a must see for history buffs. Anyone that has any prior knowledge of the general would enjoy the film, even if it is the slimmed down version of the man's life and triumphs. Patton is also a must see for any fans of war movies. The battle scenes in this film are on a grand scale and deeply resonate with the audience. As far as from an Academy standpoint; I haven't seen any of the films nominated for top prize of 1970, but there were parts of Patton that stand out to show it as the best.",

Bad war movies either aren't about the people at all, or use the characters as some stereotypical element lacking in any sort of realism or personality.Patton is different. It is a war movie about a man, one very ambitious, very egotistical, very talented man. A man so obsessed with combat he has forgotten how to be a human being, and is eventually forced to learn how to become one all over again.The film probably contains factual errors about General George S. Patton, but as a film it is an terrific character study about a man whose gifts are such a powerful, motivating force that all other characteristics are lost in their wake.10 out of 10.

It's a World War film with some amazingly well shot scenes of the battlefield and the horrifying impact that everybody had to go through.George C. Scott was just terrific in this movie playing George S. Patton. I didn't see George C. Scott in this role, I just saw the real guy in front of me and he completely disappeared in this role and became the real thing, and that's just top notch to me.The cinematography in this movie looks like it took a long time to get the perfect shot and needed the right timing, and for that I give the cinematography team respect for actually trying to get the right shot.

            "content": "In a list voted for by British channel four viewers about four years ago Patton only managed 44. It's understandable, I would say it's a fair placement. Of course from reading other comments, many people from the US would disagree. But let's be realistic, it's nowhere near a patch on other war films around, nowhere near.This was the first time I have watched Patton all the way through. Being in my early twenties and studying history and film theory for a degree I am very wary of Hollywood biopics' of any kind so I came to this movie with my eyes wide open. I was disappointed to find it quite boring at times and even a little outdated! People argue it is an anti-war movie, I disagree. I find it quite neutral. Yes we see bodies but we never see in detail any death, and Pattons love for war is connoted so fondly it cancels out the anti war message to a large extent.Being British it is understandable I would always feel differently to patriotic Americans or other nations watching this film. I enjoy war films immensely and will let things slip while watching unless the facts are completely false or I roll my eyes (this happens very often) at the portrayal or complete absence of other Allies within the films about the second world war made by Hollywood.I cannot deny the portrayal of Patton was amazing, well worth an Oscar, however I never felt like I wanted Patton to succeed. He was narcissistic and self absorbed which is probably the biggest fault of the film, all we get is Patton and America, thrown in our faces constantly like a propaganda reel. We don't even go into depth with Pattons character I feel a little robbed.I also disliked how Pattons importance was boosted, it's understandable but it wasn't needed. Also Africa portrayal is completely false. Blaming a British General for the first defeat was ridiculous! It was an American in charge, to this I really did roll my eyes. What an unnecessary dig. I suppose I have become accustomed to British soldiers, generals, Britian as a country being portrayed as idiots or the people who did nothing, or got in the way or worse weren't even portrayed at all. Makes my blood boil. I want a British film maker to make a film about British soldiers in the second world war! I beg please stop the on coming flow of American WW11 movies implying they did it all! Please!! To sum up, not a bad film, quite boring in parts and seemed outdated. I really don't see this being watched in thirty years time by anyone other than a few Americans.",

The film takes place during WWII in Europe and Northern Africa.The film starts off with General Patton (Scott) giving a monologue to his troops in front of a giant American flag about war. It is hard to give a summary of this film because it is about General Patton so instead I will give you a summary of the character. Patton is a legendary man who will be remembered for as long as WWII will be remembered. He is one of the greatest American generals. The film focuses on every aspect of his character. He is a hot headed, stubborn man who will do things his way. He wants all the glory. The most important thing about him though is his love of war. For him war equals happiness. This film is one of the best character studies ever made and it is hard to really call it a war film since there is so little war sequences.The screenplay for this film is absolutely brilliant. It was written by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North who both deservingly won Oscars. Patton was constantly on the screen for about 90% of the film and for me to keep interested by him the whole time is enough to say that this is an incredibly written film. I also really liked how the Nazis were shown studying Patton so I was also able to know him better. Another great thing was that I grew to really like Patton and yet still dislike his beliefs. That is great writing. Bravo.Schaffner has succeeded in direction one of not only the greatest war films ever, but one of the greatest films. There were so many beautiful complex shots in this film I was in awe constantly. Not only did he direct this film brilliantly but he knew how to get an outstanding performance from his lead actor. I believe that if almost anyone besides Schaffner directed this film it would have been a terrible, boring film that would have been tossed aside during the Oscars even though it had a brilliant screenplay.George C. Scott delivered one of the greatest performances of all time in this film. He was a hated man yet made me grow to love him. Scott made me understand Patton in a way the direction in the writing could not do. It is rarely I leave a film and say to myself I wish I knew this man just to be in the presence of such a complex mind that is truly simple in a way. Karl Malden did a fine job as General Bradley, he was very likable and was perfect for the part. The rest of the supporting cast did a fine job as well.Overall I give this film a 10/10. It is a must see film for anyone who likes character studies, war films, or just an excellently crafted film.",

            "content": "General George S. Patton (George C. Scott) was a true military man. Born from a lineage of rich Virginian countrymen, Patton attended West Point and eventually propelled into being one of the greatest American tank commanders in history. The 1970 film \"Patton\" came out in a time when American patriotism was in danger and the heroes that we had idolized a generation earlier were being brought into question. I believe that \"Patton\" takes a neutral stance in portraying its subject. It shows us his love of history, poetry, and romance, but it also shows us the dark side of his brashness. He was a difficult man to reign in, as his commanding officers often made decisions that he believed were in poor judgement. He had an ego that caused him to gamble with the lives of his men when fighting in Sicily (a gamble which paid off). He didn't fully understand the impact that PTSD had on the mental and psychological fitness of front-line soldiers, which caused a grave controversy that nearly pulled him out of World War II altogether. Despite his flaws, Patton remains an American figure that many idolize and cherish for his charisma and battlefield successes.\"Patton\" takes us from his taking command of the American II Corps in North Africa fighting against Rommel's tank divisions there, and ends with him being dismissed after the Allied liberation of Europe and his sharp disagreements with the post-war policies that America and Britain had enacted with the Soviet Union.The cinematography is epic. We are shown massive armies fighting in the deserts of Tunisia and the wintry forests of France and Germany. This is also backed up well by terrific acting by Scott and his co-star Karl Malden as General Omar N. Bradley. Acting sequences in military briefing rooms are tense as difficult decisions are made and the characters debate the next actions of war.Fantastic movie and one of the all-time great war epics.

It essentially ruins his life too, because the man loves war.And really, even just the last line can tell you what this film has to say about war- \"All glory is fleeting.\" The film acknowledges that war can give glory- but it will not last.Besides that comment, all I have to say is that the film is great and straightforward, and not only because of Scott's brilliant performance but also because of the engaging screenplay and sweeping style.

I'm surprised he wasn't in more famous films considering his acting skills and presence.It's hard to tell how accurate the character of Patton is. He was a controversial figure at best. A good general perhaps, but was he overly headstrong? Stubborn? Was he too harsh with his soldiers? Arguments could go either way. Maybe he rushed into things and lowered morale. Or maybe he got the best out of his soldiers by pushing them. Maybe he was heartless or maybe he was just appropriately tough - he once slapped a soldier who was afraid to fight, apparently.Patton as a film is decently made but feels a bit dated. The pace is slow. Some of the battle scenes are impressive but short-lived and not that fleshed out. We mainly see the aftermath of battles or Patton traveling and planning. It's not clear what the focus is meant to be.Maybe that's part of the point, to let us decide what we think of Patton. But that's hard to do if we only get such a limited picture, with little to compare him to and many details which may be taken out of context and others which were omitted from the movie. Maybe a lot of generals were like that. Maybe that's the kind of man you need to get things down. I'm not a war historian!It is strange that Patton seems to love war. And it's interesting that he cites poetry and feels connected so deeply to the past. Was he insane or onto something? I suspect it's something partway. His obsession with war was probably unhealthy - did the movie exaggerate this? But he undeniably got things done and history certainly repeats itself. An awareness of past battles surely helped motivate him and give him ideas.The problem for me is that the overall story just isn't that interesting. It feels like the same pattern throughout. Patton is good at his job, but too reckless. It's the cliche of action movies - the flawed hero they need because he's the only one who can do the job.But I never sense much in the way of development or insight. Patton doesn't change. Was he a great man? Very flawed? Without seeing the other generals or even much of the Nazis, we have no comparison point.The movie is mainly a biography I suppose, but it feels like the war itself might have been more interesting. The victory of the allies seems inevitable, reducing the suspense. The reputation of one general seems trivial compared to the lives of millions affect by the war.Still, it's clearly a good movie overall, just not riveting nor life-changing. There's some humour running throughout which keeps it entertaining. Like Patton's dislike of Russians and determination to fight them straight after the Nazis. He's like a child at times, petty and jealous. But he respects people more when they challenge him - honesty wins him over.His opinions are often extreme so it's hard to tell when he's serious - as he says, only he needs to know when he's acting. Maybe he's willing to say what others are too scared to say - the truth. Or maybe he's lost the plot.Patton is worth watching mainly for George C. Scott. A solid understanding of the real events probably helps a lot - I only have a modest understanding.",

            "content": "Although two other soldiers are credited with consulting on \"Patton,\" Gen. Omar Bradley gets consulting credit in huge letters, and the sources for Francis Ford Coppola's script are given as Ladislas Farago's biography of Patton plus Bradley's own memoir, \"A Soldier's Story.\" This is significant because much of this movie is told from the viewpoint of Bradley including the way Patton is ultimately portrayed. George C. Scott ultimately \"defends\" Patton. (I once heard an actor say that \"defending\" is often an actor's job when playing a villain but that it can be the job of playing a flawed hero, too.) Nevertheless, having just watched the first half of this movie (having seen the whole thing years ago and mindful of not remembering the rest of the movie as vividly as the part that I saw last night), I can't help seeing this great movie in a bit more critical light than I did when I did not know more about the real life people in question.A good example of how the movie takes Bradley's side against Patton (but how Scott defends him) is in the scene in which Bradley complains to his superior about the losses in Sicily and Patton says, it's time to remember how many more losses there would have been if men were still slogging up that road they had been supposed to follow. Of course, this raises the problem of how do you know what would have happened if you had taken a different path from the one you took, but Patton could have been right; there was, after all, no bloodless way to take Sicily away from the Germans.In a prior scene, where Bradley is advocating caution and taking time, he says to Patton, \"The difference between you and me is, I do this job because I was trained for it, you do it because you love it.\" There is a certain amount of self-justification in all of that. After all, later on it wasn't just Field Marshal B. L. Montgomery who screwed Patton in Europe, it was Bradley whose over-caution led him to reject Patton's plan for a swift entrapment of the German army followed by a swift invasion of Germany. Patton was a bastard, there is no doubt, but his plans were daring enough to shorten the war by a year. Bradley's caution, in the end, cost lives, as Puck-20 already implied in his review. Loving your subordinates is warm and fuzzy, but give me a Patton who gets the boys home by Christmas by winning the war.",

Patton, General of World War II - whose numerous faults, such as his temper and tendency toward insubordination, prevented him from becoming the lead American general in the Normandy Invasion - instead being used as a decoy to successfully deceive the Germans in a sham operation called Fortitude.Indeed, we actually might need a US general like that to lead the liberation of the Putin occupation in Europe. In my opinion, this multinational force should be led by the US and not as a NATO force - as also alluded to by my friend, former US Army general David Petraeus.The US and its allies would destroy Russia's troops and equipment in Ukraine - as well as sink its Black Sea fleet - if the Russian ex-president, Vladimir Putin, used nuclear weapons in the country, former CIA director and retired four-star army general David Petraeus warned recently.In my opinion, we should actually not stop there - and also liberate Russia from the Putin regime - as I'm quite sure the majority of the Russian people would welcome American G. I's with open arms, and throw flowers at their feet :)This is actually no joke - the US being a bit like an elephant - quite difficult to arouse, but once lead into the right direction, quite a formidable force.(In fact, Americans are quite different from us Europeans, being not the most intelligent species, but having picked up quite efficient war strategies from their Native American brethren :)So in all humility, I would like to inform the Putin regime and the Kremlin, that I do not control America fully - as some Americans do not regard me as their acting President yet - but rather as a revolutionary, who is supposed to get his butt out of America again - or so I have heard :) Also, the US Congress is currently dominated by the Republicans - and I'm quite sure, once the American elephant is unleashed in Europe - just like in WW2 - the US Congress, under my leadership, will push this time for a lasting peace between America, Russia and Europe; and invite Russia into a new International Peacebuilding Alliance :)Interesting to note, that General Patton was quite possibly taken out by the CIA, murdered - to preserve the Peace between America and Russia - since General Patton did not believe that Peace with Russia was possible; due to Stalin's insatiable lust for conquest, power and murder.So in retrospect, the US Intelligence Community did Russia a big favor there; and I hope that Vladimir Putin - and his body double - are a bit more inclined towards Peace than Stalin was. Because we have plenty of more 'Pattons' in America - all educated at West Point - who would be happy to liberate Russia from the evil Putin regime :)On that note, I would like to encourage all Russian Forces to withdraw from Ukraine and engage in Peace Talks, so that Diplomacy and Dialogue can be restored in the International Community :)",

Patton's experiences during World War II, stands out from the pack mainly due to a larger-than-life performance by George C. Scott, who's sadly no longer with us.Though he bears little physical resemblance to his subject, Scott expertly captures the essence of warrior-philosopher Patton in both the heat of battle and in private, pensive moments.  He's helped considerably in this by a psychologically insightful script by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North, as well as Franklin Schaffner's balanced, unobtrusive direction. \nBeautifully shot in 70mm by Fred Koenecamp, the production boasts exhilarating epic scope in its vast tank battles, far-flung locations (both exterior and interior), and seasons ranging from hellish desert sun to the snow-clogged Ardennes forests.  The supporting cast is for the most part fairly innocuous, probably deliberately so, with the most noticeable work contributed by Karl Malden, Edward Binns, James Edwards and a few others.The film also takes the time to give a sense of the enemy's perception of Patton, particularly Rommel's.  Scenes of the German command reacting to Patton's moves are vividly enacted, with authentic dialogue and subtitles.Overall, an almost perfect meld of historical and personal drama, framed with epic sweep against the grand theater of war.

They were victorious and made a real classic. The casting & acting is so fine that you can forget to appreciate the beautiful cinematography, excellent editing and well-paced plot line. At age 14, I saw this movie for the first time and have been in love with it ever since. After consuming great bowlfuls of Patton-era history at high school, I ended up liking George C. Scott's Patton better than I did the real General himself. Scott produces a commanding presence that the real George Patton didn't seem to possess, from the film footage we see of his speeches during WWII. But, Gen Patton was a father and husband with a softer side, which Scott could afford to ignore (not a woman in the entire movie has more than sixteen words to say!!). Co-starring roles are almost all played flawlessly, especially the self-centered and arrogant Monty, played so perfectly by Michael Bates, you almost believe in replicated reincarnation! Malden pours himself into the Bradley role that his performance, too, is like watching a ghost...nothing as good was done again until Dunnaway did \"Mommie Dearest\". The only flaw for me in this movie is the cursing, which was supposed to be such a shock to audiences in 1968...it's just a distraction now, especially the answer that the General gives to the Chaplain who asks him how often he reads his Bible. Lastly, \"Patton\" doesn't dwell on the harsh realities of combat, as we wish to see them in today's films, but that wasn't it's mission at the time, so it's still fresh and illustrative of the Militaristic mind-set.

He captured Patton's sensitivity, anger and rage, emotionality and wilyness like no other actor has ever captured any other's character.No less an authority than Omar Bradley, played by Karl Malden and acting as Technical Advisor, said Scott got Patton spot-on, except that his gruff baritone was several octaves lower than Patton's tenor. \nFranklin Schaffner never topped his direction of this film -- although he came close in The Day of the Jackal.  MacArthur?  Fuggidaboudit. \nThe battle scenes are good -- great, even, given the style of the times. (Not realistic, of course, next to Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, but still exciting, loud and flashy.  And what more do you really want from a battle scene?)  The history is quite accurate -- the soldier slapping scene, condensed from two incidents, was almost word-for-word how it happened, according to several secondary sources.  The subplot involving German lieutenant Steiner is gratuitous, but gives the viewer some details on Patton's character and biography that might have made the movie appreciably longer if shown.  And it was a clever device to show the progress of Third Army, when casualties and numbers of towns taken are toted up.  This film is based almost entirely on Francis Coppola's screenplay, and an excellent one it is.  Coppola got The Godfather based, I think, more on this screenplay than his direction of Finian's Rainbow.

Scott gives the performance of a lifetime if Patton watched this film he couldn't tell the difference himself. Scott portrays him the way he was, not the way he should be or the way we would like him to be. Patton is Patton, tough, resilient, fearless, sarcastic, angry, witty, cultured, charming, bull-headed, uncompromising, temperamental, and more patriotic than Uncle Sam on the 4th of July. The speech at the beginning with him in front of the American flag sets the tone. It's his way or the highway. And Patton is driving. His antics tick off the high command and rankle his subordinates but they all can't argue with his success. Karl Malden is his good friend and at times adversary General Bradley who is as resourceful as Patton is eccentric and they make a great pair. Every time Patton has a victory he screws it up by way of his gargantuan mouth. But he keeps going. When disaster strikes he always manages to pull defeat out of his rear and strike a blow for the 2nd Corps or the 3rd Army or whatever army he's commanding. His soldiers love him, his soldiers hate him, but his soldiers fight for him regardless because they know he's the best. Patton's rise is like Patton's fall, momentous.

Scott does a terrific job at showing how brash, ambitious, and rebellious Patton was as a leader. Patton's character was often questioned, but he was a man of honor who took pride in serving in the US Army. As a war movie, the film holds up to today's standards. There is plenty of action, and the fighting is intense, even though it remains PG-13 during the whole duration of the movie. The strongest point of the movie is that it depicts war as felt by generals and other leaders. It is the perfect example of young men dying for old men who give orders. Names are never mentioned for any non ranking officer, instead they are just shown as honorable sacrifices for the greater good of the world. Karl Malden delivers a fine supporting job as the level headed General Bradley, and Karl Vogler does an equally impressive job playing Patton's respected nemesis Erwin Rommel. Patton is an extraordinary movie that is more than worthy of being the main source for a biography on the general. At times the general will make you angry, at other times he will make you laugh, but there is not a second that goes by that you don't want to follow him into battle, and make the other bastard die for their country.",

Scott's performance is great, from his walk, sneer a voice (which is allegedly not what Patton sounded like). He is the best part of the film. It's a shame they went for the PG rating, as I heard the real Patton had a foul mouth that is almost completely cut from the film.I usually cannot comment on scenery, but Patton is a film of art. Huge scenes are filled with interesting objects, and the camera-work maximizes this effect. Battles and towns are beautiful to look at, and make me wish I had seen the Blu Ray instead.I understand the point of the plot focusing on WWII, but maybe a little back story about him could've been added, maybe showing his rise. The film was lo enough, it wouldn't have hurt to add extra time.It's strange the film is PG, the f word is used once and there are two random scenes of gore: a man with a hole through him and a man with no leg, shown graphically. They seem unnecessary in this film, about the management, not the horror of war.One of the best movies about war ever made, Patton should be seen by cinemaphiles, war fanatics, or people interested in the man. 8.4/ 10",

            "content": "Patton was released in April of 1970. A majestic movie about triumph and humility. Victory and death. Franklin Schaffner directs the film like a combat general while George C. Scott's performance is equally commanding.Patton is a war movie. Easily one of the best. In 1970, when America was slogging through Vietnamese jungles - a war action everyone was trying to forget - Patton praised a time when America was a victor. Where there was a clear-cut enemy. An enemy who fought using tactics on the battlefield.Patton stands as a grand military parade.Starring George C. Scott as the titular character, the movie is a glorious showcase of good ole Hollywood achievement. Shot on location in Morocco, Greece, Italy, and England, director of photography Fred Koenekamp captures the beauty, expanse, and destruction of a real war in a real world complete with real, practical effects. Koenekamp deliberately places the viewer as a solider as well as an observer taking full advantage of the movie's Dimension 150 cameras. There are constant views of the horizon, the skies, and the enemy.As gorgeous as the movie is - and man, this a work of beauty - the narrative falls a few times into traps many biopics also trip over: trying to show as much as possible in quick doses within a confined time. This results in a loss of the narrative's timing, the jumping of locations, that are as jarring as a slap to the helmet. What is not jarring is Scott's stampeding through the film. He is a Howitzer with zero concern over backwash.Until that backwash ends up hurting him.Patton's long, final walk in the movie was only the beginning of accomplishments and accolades. Patton would go on to win seven Academy Awards including Picture, Actor, Director, Screenplay, Editing, as well as two technical achievements in sound. Fred Koenekamp was nominated but the Oscar went to another Fred, this one Young, for Ryan's Daughter. That's like Patton being overlooked by MacArthur.Patton is a film about redemption. Coming back to achieve victory after dealing with defeat. Ultimately, Patton is also about sorrow. Where do old soldiers go to die after the war has been won? Patton doesn't seem to know.There are mountains out on that horizon, though.",

To this day, \"Patton\" remains at the top of my list of favorite movies of all time. So, I will apologize in advance if I begin to rave too much about this film.The opening monologue is a display of some of the finest acting ever put on film. As Patton, George C. Scott gives a fantastic performance from start to finish. The real General Patton wrote poetry, believed in reincarnation, was highly religious, and lived for the honor and glory of battle. At the same time, he was crass, vulgar, disruptive, and he severely frowned upon cowardice with conviction. George C. Scott captured all of these facets of Patton's life and delivered a look into a man who seemed in constant conflict, whether it was against the Germans, his superior officers, or himself.Told from the perspectives of both Patton himself and the German command that monitored him, \"Patton\" also shows how the general seemed to single-handedly bring down the morale of Nazi Germany. This is especially evident following the \"slapping incident,\" in which the Germans (incorrectly) focused on Patton while the Allies prepared for Operation Overlord (D-Day).The supporting cast is quite strong here, too. Karl Malden is a perfect choice as General Omar Bradley, an average soldier who happens to wear stars on his epaulets, and who serves as Patton's moral center. Michael Bates is a dead ringer as British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, right down to the mannerisms and the hooked nose. Fans of \"Star Trek\" may recognize Michael Strong, who guest-starred in one episode of the original series, as General Hobart Carver, one of Patton's aides.On a side note, there is one glaring glitch in this movie: The tanks used were not Panzers and Shermans; they were American M48s. This is a Hollywood convention. But, considering that American tanks are named for well-known generals, and the M48 was called the Patton, I think we can let this slide.\"Patton\" is part war movie and part biopic, and it works well on both fronts. This is a must-have for any DVD collection.",

            "content": "Patton is a biographical film about General George Patton during World War II. The film's narrative focuses on Patton himself less than on the actual War. I think that is why it is one of the greatest war movies ever, because it works on multiple levels: the big battles, and the personal drama, and it merges them to become one and the same.Everybody knows what World War II was about, what happened and how it ends but it much more difficult to enter the nitty gritty of history. Looking at it through Patton's eyes the film makes these events palatable and understandable, without any prior knowledge or history education.Of course, the movie would be nothing without the sheer visual spectacle. I am always impressed merely by the scale of the set-pieces in this movie. Nobody does movies likes this any more, and few even dared doing it then. All the battles and \"action\" scenes still hold-up because there almost no trickery. When the movie wants to show a tanks battle: it actually shows a tank battle, with dozens of tanks and hundreds of extras. It is pure unaltered epic cinema.The movie gives you fights in the desert, fights in the snow, fights in the mud. There is HQ staff meetings, there are generals reading maps on the trunk of a car. You have tanks blasting through walls and you have columns driving through cities. It's great, it is cool and you get a real feeling of what a WWII army-life was like. The movie even takes the luxury of creating whole sets (especially whenever Montgomery is included, or the German general staff) just to have a general give a reaction shot to something Patton did.The movie of course relies on a very solid script. Yet, it did feel that the film, at times, is not an honest account of what happened, rather a romantic re-telling. The saying goes that history is written by the victors. This movie could very well be an example of it.\nThe movie is unique in the way it shows the generals rivalries as the driving force of the campaigns. I personally loved this, because it does mirror history. These guys did not really care about saving lives, liberating countries or fighting oppression; they were egomaniacs in a pissing match, to whom will get all the glory. But, I feel it is also a way to denigrate Montgomery and praise Patton.\nThis dynamic is never at the expense of the Patton's legacy. It is against him in the movie, as he has no army for most of it. Yet, it reinforces the glory of his genius. Before he could fight the enemy, he had to struggle with the politicians. Another odd element was that the German general staff's only function is to establish how excellent Patton was.But those are small nitpicks, at the end of the day I still love this movie and it shows WWII better than anybody else.",

            "content": "To fully understand this film you have to understand the time in which it was made. At the height of the Vietnam War, with million of Americans protesting against the war, and anti military feelings at the highest level in American history, this movie struck an unconscious cord in the America public. The Vietnam War had gone on 3 times longer than World War II, 3 times longer than the Korean War, with no end in sight. We wanted it to end. Then, along comes a movie that is a tribute to a warrior. Suddenly we realized that what we wanted in the pit of our soul was a General who would not listen to the politicians OR the public, but would fight and win before anyone could assess the situation. Even the anti-war crowd (I was among them) loved this movie.This movie may not play as well today. Wars are different, and more popular among the public (at least they are supported). But the cinematography and acting was great then, and still is. The opening scene, with Patton ascending the stage from the rear, with a huge Americaqn flag behind him and delivering a rousing speech about killing the enemy is a classic scene. Even if you don't watch the whole movie, see this 5 minute scene, but know that if you do, you will probably not be able to stop watching.This movie is about a General out of his time. WW II was highly political war. The press was watching. The world was watching. Concessions had to be made to the other allied armies fighting the Axis. Patton didn't care. He was a superb strategist, but what really drove him was fighting and winning. Slapping soldiers with PST and shouting \"Why you're nothing but a coward? No problem. Chaffing at holding his position while the Russians advanced, and declaring that the American and British armies should advance through Germany and continue on into Russia? No problem. Patton knew his life was over when this war ended. There could never be another war like it.See this movie! See a war from the perspective of a war lover, and the kind of war lover that we would love to have. Patton would kill everybody before we had a chance to protest that it was too much. We'd condemn him, but be secretly glad at what he had done.In one of the great scenes of this movie a Russian general asks Patton, through an interpreter, to have a drink with him. Patton replies that he's not going to drink with \"any Russian son of a bitch\" When the interpreter tell the Russian General what Patton said he has the interpreter tells Patton the General says that he (Patton) is a son of a bitch. Patton replies, \"I'll drink to that! One son of a bitch to another.\" GREAT STUFF!",

General Patton truly loved war and was a very successful leader albiet with some pychotic tendencies. The film showcases him leading the Third Army with an intrepid spirit. He was always there as they moved closer to their objective. George C. Scott does superb work as General Patton. It is a progressive film showing what measures Patton took to accomplish his objective. An interesting scene featured a lone tank commander sitting on the ground leaning up against a tank. The tank commander tells General Patton when they ran out of gas and ammo they resorted to fighting hand to hand. It seemed the logical thing to do. The General leaned over and kisses the soldier on the forehead. I found that gesture very poignant. And, in another scene, the General stands as his Third Army parades by after smashing through the Siegfrid Line during the Battle of the Bulge. He had trained his troops to be intrepid much like himself. Patton was the right General sent to do the impossible. And yes he was very arrogant and outspoken. Both traits caused him to be relieved when the Germany finally capitulated. Scott does superb work and was awarded Best Actor for his performance. He declined the award. Scott had an impressive acting resume that began in 1951 and spanned nearly 50 years.",

The movie is worth seeing just for the spectacular, on-location battle scenes and other shots of Tunisia, Sicily, France, and Britain.  Contrary to what some might expect, this film also depicts the grim horrors of war.  It glorifies service, sacrifice, and patriotism, but not warfare. It makes viewers appreciate all that our brave soldiers endured to secure a better world for us.  If the movie has one shortcoming, it is the use of later-model tanks rather than World War II-vintage M-4 Shermans, Tigers, Panthers, and Mark IV's.

Scott's performance stands out, and with most people who actually knew Patton dead and gone, it will remain the public's perception of the controversial general.

By the end of his 2-hour commentary, one would be forgiven for thinking that Patton cured cancer while walking across the ocean delivering food to the homeless, but his superiors suppressed the cure for \"political\" reasons. Once one realizes that Province's views are so heavily biased, it throws the veracity of all his comments into doubt.This is unfortunate, as Patton was a fascinating man and having a historian (amateur or otherwise) do the commentary on a historical movie seems like a great idea. For example, I'd love to hear Ambrose's comments on Band of Brothers.But one of the reasons Patton is brilliant as a movie is because it shows Patton's strengths AND faults, his triumphs and travails.

I read a biography of his, or perhaps an autobiography (sorry, don't remember which) and found the portions about his wife and kids to be very interesting. That information would help to better flesh out that he was a continuous person. I almost got the sense from the movie that they suggest he is a wondrous monster on the battlefield and some sort of restricted housewife at home. He wasn't merely captivated by war and killing, but more so by strategy and intelligent thought. He played games which required a great deal of thought with his children. He read books to them and forced them to be original. If any of this back story of Patton the man were included, the film would have been stronger. As it is, it is only a film about Patton the general. This film however, is still strong on its own. I'm only suggesting some room for improvement.

Patton is a portrait of the famous American World War II general of the same name, played by George C Scott.It's a magnetic, compelling performance, from the tub-thumping opening speech through to the end, and it's a shame it did not make more of a star of Scott. I suppose the right role came along at just the right time.Patton comes at an odd time in the history of war films, which is encapsulated by the two screenwriters. On is Edmund H North, a veteran of the days when war films like his Sink the Bismarck! aimed first and foremost to be historical chronicles. However, the other writer is Francis Ford Coppola, the legendary director whose Apocalypse Now later transformed the genre into one that focused on a message or allegory ahead of dispassionate factual accuracy.Patton has a bit of both. The film is pretty literal, with no flights of fantasy, and also draws on a theme from Sink the Bismarck! that the Germans lost partly due to Nazi Party internal politics. However, it is also much more a film about one man than about the war, and if anything draws a comparison between its hero's war conduct and America as a whole in international diplomacy.The production is notably lavish, with huge sets heavily dressed with well observed period trappings, and masses of extras in many scenes. Whole battles are portrayed, always a challenge for any director, although while impressively staged, they left me rather cold.I did not know that much about General Patton, and for that reason I found the film quite frustrating. I was interested to know more, but because it focuses more on the individual than his place within the whole, I came away with more questions than answers. For those, I suppose I will have to watch more of those old 1950s historically accurate movies.",

This was President Richard Nixon's favorite movie, and when he was occupying the White House, he had the film screened for him numerous times. There was a rumor that PATTON also influenced his foreign policy decisions, particularly Cambodia. An amusing paradox with PATTON and Nixon is that it was made by liberals.Directed by Franklin Schaffner and written by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund North, PATTON was a passion project of Frank McCarthy's for more than twenty years. During the war, McCarthy was an aide-de-camp to General George Marshall, Patton's boss. After the Allies defeated the Axis Powers he resigned from the Army to become a producer in Hollywood. McCarthy hoped to gain access to Patton's private papers, but the general's family refused permission. He was no more successful with the Pentagon either.In the 1960s, McCarthy commissioned a screenplay by an unknown Coppola, with some rewrites by North later on. When Darryl Zanuck returned to head Twentieth Century Fox, McCarthy's dream of making his Patton movie was beginning to become reality. The first actor to be offered the role was Burt Lancaster, who refused because he felt the script conflicted with his antiwar beliefs. Rumor has it that John Wayne sought the part and was probably nixed by McCarthy out of concern that PATTON would come across as a typical John Wayne war movie.Rod Steiger and Robert Mitchum also turned down the offer, but it was the latter who suggested George C Scott. Originally, William Wyler was slated to direct, but after heated arguments with Scott over how to portray Patton, the three time Oscar winner departed. Schaffner, who recently enjoyed success with PLANET OF THE APES, was brought in because he could handle both the massive logistics and the temperamental Scott.Using a huge American flag as a backdrop, the film opens with a colorful monologue delivered by General Patton to an unseen audience of troops about to be shipped off to battle. Following the opening credits sequence -with stirring music by Jerry Goldsmith- is the aftermath of the battle at Kasserine Pass where dead Americans soldiers' clothing are being stripped by Arab nomads.Realizing that a new commander is needed to instill order, Allied Supreme headquarter send in the hard-nosed Patton to replace Fredendall, where he wastes no time establishing himself as a rigid disciplinarian. Speaking about the men now under his command, Ol' Blood and Guts confides to his subordinate Omar Bradley, \"They'll lose their fear of the Germans. I only hope to God they don't lose their fear of me!\".",

Although it deals with only a few years of Patton's life--all during WW2--it paints a compelling picture of the famous general. To say that Patton was controversial would be an understatement. Patton's nickname before the war was The Green Hornet:given because he had a reputation for sudden harshness. In fact, during the 30's uprising in Washington DC by WW1 veterans, he beat the veterans with the broadside of his sword. The movie captures Patton's intensity and mood changes. In the famous scene where he strikes a soldier (historically, he struck 2 in different places and both were suffering horribly from malaria) he had just shared some kind words and gestures with some others. It also captures his real thoughts of his superiors. In one particular scene, he is badmouthing a general who then walks into his room. He instantly changes his mood. Besides that, the movie captures Patton's genius in conducting war as well as the respect he had amongst the Germans. It also shows Patton's keen knowledge of history and how it translated to victory in his battles. The battle scenes can be a touch graphic for its time but can be considered mild today. Karl Malden plays an excellent role as General Bradley and complements the brashness of Patton. Patton the man had his faults, but the movie does not.",

He loved uniforms and guns, preferred the nazis from the russian allied forces and lost his job as a commanding officer at the end of ww2 for telling journalists about his views.

Patton's importance in the overall war seems to be overstated, but this can be forgiven given that it's his biopic. What is less easy to forgive is the rather typical Hollywood historical revisions. German generals Keitel and Rommel seem to cower in fear at Patton's name. British generals like Montgomery are portrayed as cowardly braggarts. This is simply wrong. North Africa was won by Montgomery long before Patton even set foot on the continent. Rommel suffered from diversion of his supplies to the eastern front. It's an interesting question as to what would have happened if he had the support he required. This isn't to say that Patton and Bradley weren't great generals. I simply don't understand why the film had to revise history to make their enemies appear fearful and their allies cowardly.",

Not only is it a film about a man fighting Germans, but also of himself fighting his own personality that is his only undefeated enemy. The supporting cast particularly Karl Malden while not looking at all like Omar Bradley makes you believe that he is Omar Bradley. This movie done in 1970 has everything that most movies done now with special effects does not and on top of that it is a very patriotic movie, a man wishing to promote his country as a tool of good here to free the oppressed and destroy the oppressor.

You see, that's the Spanish army on the screen (including the German Heinkel 111 bombers!)playing both the US and British forces and their enemy, the German Wehrmacht. Why Spain? Because they had allowed units of their airforce to be filmed as the German Luftwaffe in the 1968 movie \"The Battle of Britain.\" Spain flew the Heinkel 111 (a licenced copy called the C.A.S.A 112) and the Me 109 single engined fighter (known as the \"Buchon\" in its Spanish incarnation) because of it's ties to Nazi Germany via the dictator of Spain, Fransisco Franco. After WW II Spain was considered a strategic ally of the US, and sent obsolete equipment for its military, which until that point had been equipped with German and Italian equipment, including the famed German \"coalscuttle\" helmet of WW II. That 1948 staff car was Spanish army property. You can bet that the producers and the director paid a good amount to use the Spanish troops. Quibbles: AT-6 training planes are used as US fighters (which is why you don't really see them), the CASA 112s lack the proper German identifaction codes on their fuselages (and the fin swastikas are too large), the Afrika Korps troops wear brown intead of the green uniforms the real ones wore, no real British tanks are used (we only see US M-24 Chaffee light tanks), and the newsreel tanks don't match the movie tanks because they are the real things!

We see the battles from a general's eye, the coordinated war effort from the planners' eyes, and the influence politicians and diplomats have over the direction of the war. The actual fight scenes occupy only a small part of the plot, but are themselves captivating. A night battle with no sound later in the movie is mesmerizing.Scott is a treat to watch. In a memorable, eerie scene he directs his driver and Bradley, at the time his junior, to an alternate battlefield. Although they protest that he is heading the wrong direction, Patton says he \"can smell a battlefield\". He describes a battle that took place on that spot 2000 years before. Being a historian (and believing that he actually participated in many famous battles throughout history) he used historical precedents to guide his decisions. For better or worse, beating Montgomery to glory was also a constant incentive.There are so many memorable moments in the film: Bradley's incredulous stare at Patton exasperation that the war may be over too soon (before he gets another command); Patton saluting two children who show more spit and polish than the troops over which he has just taken command; Patton directing traffic at a crossing; Scott's expression slowly hardening upon learning that he will not be in charge of the invasion of Europe; and, again, the utter devastation on his face after a dressing down from Ike.Patton is a film for thinkers.

A character study like no other, Patton follows the tale of the most battle hungry, mad-dog general America ever had the pride to produce. Over this three hour long saga we watch Patton emerge victorious in Africa, Sicily, and finally in the very heart of Europe. We see how the Germans feared him all the way up to the man they called genius (Rommel) and we see how the Allies feared him even more, or at least his temper and unrestrained tongue. But this isn't a review of the man; it's a review of the movie.There's no real plot to be found here, but that's good. This was set out to be historically accurate from the beginning, and to really get inside one of the most famous American general's head. But, this is the major thing that stopped me from completely enjoying the movie. It simply isn't entertaining. It's powerful, it's interesting, but it isn't entertaining. I'd almost call it a documentary. And in that area it excels. As a war movie this does not stand out. It will not thrill you with action or drama. What it does do is impart respect for an historical figure that cannot be denied. We are shown the way one man fought for his rightful place in history, and struggled to be able to keep his own flaws from getting in the way of his serving the world the only way he could, as a commander. This epic film teaches you everything you need to know about Patton and gave me a soft spot for him on the list of famous soldiers. If you're looking for a fun time watching a movie, this isn't the place to go. But if you're looking to get deep into the character of one strong, foolhardy man, this movie does it flawlessly. I recommend seeing it once, but in the end, it's probably best to keep it to only once. Patton earns a 7/10 as a movie, but earns a 10/10 as a character study. This has been a snippet of my review.

By the way, Rommel himself described Patton as that.This film can hardly be described as historically balanced, containing amongst other things, liberal doses of Brit bashing, a fine tradition continued by the more recent Saving Private Ryan and U-571 in which Holloywood rewrites history to satisfy latent Yank ego in a way more normally associated with Mao's China. No, this is a subjective snapshot of a great man, with his strengths confirmed and his weaknesses excused. It's interesting that the main advisor to this movie was Omar Bradley, one of Patton's friends in the film.History aside, I like this movie a lot. The cast range from sublime (Scott) to excellent (Malden) to just good. But the strongest point of this movie is the script (co-written by Francis Ford Coppolla) which is rich in symbolism, giving the director a strong foundation to build on.Some of the scenes in this movie are continually with me: his meeting with his protege in the graveyard before a battle; his reading the weather prayer written by his chaplain; the end sequence where he walks past the windmill like a latter day Quixote, and of course, the rousing speech at the beginning. For a film like this there is a surprising amount of humour, which Scott makes the most of in his performance to turn Patton into a very sympathetic figure.I think the nearest film I've seen like this is 'Lawrence of Arabia', which is definitely a better movie in almost every way except maybe the cast- although that's more of a compliment to 'Arabia' than an insult to Patton. It would be interesting to make a comparison between the two as they both contain central characters who almost seemed called to do what they did.",

Now I finally had the chance to watch in on DVD in the original version, and it's quite another story.A lot of my feelings about this film have been expressed in other comments before, but one thing must be said again and again: Scott's performance is probably the best kind of acting to be seen in any movie. Granted, the role offers endless opportunities to express the diverse (and sometimes twisted) character traits of the protagonist, and there may be other actors who would have been up to the job as well. They just didn't have a chance to do it, and Scott succeeds 100 %. The famous opening scene (though as such fictitious, with its speech spliced together from several of Patton's quotes) sends shivers down my spine whenever I watch and re-watch it.Jerry Goldsmith's excellent (though somewhat repetitive) score does its own in transmitting the atmosphere of those days, and the movie would not be the same without it.Two opinions from others I take issue with: I cannot join the praise for Karl Malden in this case. His Omar Bradley comes across one-dimensional, unemotional, and uninteresting, though this cannot come as a real surprise against the overwhelming, highly structured figure of Patton and may not be Malden's fault. The other thing is some people's idea that the movie was too long by one hour or so.

Patton's character perfectly: how he embraced his somewhat quirky personality unapologetically, how his unfiltered speech alienated him from other generals and officers, and how he ultimately was right most of the time. Sure, he was a man driven by personal glory, believed in reincarnation, and reveled in historical significance, but his belief and drive made the Third Army one of the most influential and feared on the Western front. He understood his enemies, how the majority of German forces were concentrated on the Eastern front to stop the Soviets, and the necessity to exploit their weakness at a dizzying pace--tentative actions only give the enemy time to regroup.

It started out with Patton going through the military quarters in 1943 at the Kasserine Pass in North Africa, and then depicted the fighting in Europe. Again, Patton was mean and hard-cored all the way. One scene that was unforgettable was his slapping the young, scared soldier; it was this event that caused him to lose his command, something he wanted so bad.

Scott plays Patton brilliantly: a man with a fascinating personality and a fascinating history. The most beautiful thing about this film is that it can be interpreted several ways, despite the fact that it is not an abstract film. One can appreciate Patton for what he is: a brilliant strategist and tactician, a true leader, a man for getting the job done. However, the film also shows the darker side of his pride and showmanship, qualities that may have gotten men killed for the sake of his place in the history books. These two qualities have layers of interplay, referencing each other and giving insight into the other, which alone is a serious feat for any film. Beyond even these relatively shallow aspects, which are already far greater than most films, there are levels of sophistication and insight here beyond what most people are capable of seeing. This film manages to ask questions that most films could never even dream of asking, all at the same time. What relationship do individual personalities have to the course of history? Is the enemy of my enemy always my friend? Do the ends justify the means? What is the relationship between leadership and democracy? Is preemptive military action justified, and under what circumstances? What is the relationship between diplomacy and war? Is war a glorious endeavour? Is war a part of human nature? How has war changed throughout history, and how do societal changes and changes in outlook affect the conduct and outcome of a war? I could write a book on these questions alone. On my last viewing, I was struck particularly by the fact that it often takes a brilliant warrior to end a war, and that we as humans too often see right and wrong based upon whose side we are on. This film brilliantly portrays a man whose time had passed, and yet who found himself perfectly aligned with the times. A warrior in the true sense, Patton took pride in being part of the bloodiest war ever; he is an anachronism, and yet perfectly placed in the modern world. This is a film for the thinker and the philosopher, and it offers new insight into classic problems of human nature and society upon each viewing. I never say this, because it is almost never true, but anyone who cannot appreciate this film is not a very insightful or thoughtful person. There is something for everyone here, except the person who refuses to accept or even ponder the lessons of the past; someone who refuses to analyze themselves and the way they fit into the world. This film is so complex and layered that it makes the Godfather look simplistic; no easy task. I might also mention that this film includes brilliant cinematography, groundbreaking war footage, a great soundtrack, and some of the best acting I've ever seen. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Maybe McArthur was a strong contender, but Patton has to be one of the most polarizing military figures in recent US history. His dogmatic approach to war making was akin to a passionate romance; here was a man who lived and breathed the art of conquering.The character himself is ripe for a multilayered dissection, what with all the complexities that Patton had within himself. He was both brave and sadistic. Incredibly intelligent and stubbornly shortsighted, and because he happened to be fighting for the allies, he is mythologized as fighting for freedom. But as many have pointed out, if he'd been a German he would no doubt have fought to the death for Hitler himself. Unfortunately, the screenplay for \"Patton\" only offers a cursory glance over his campaigns in WWII. It never really analyzes his more controversial aspects, such as his frothing antisemitism and infamous vulgarity. What the film does touch on is the German high command's respect for him, which is unique for a war picture. But other details of his life, such as his service in WW1, and his untimely and tragic death, are ignored. A troubling part of the picture is the film's dated-ness. It is very much a studio film, one that takes zero chances with the narrative, and has noticeably aged. The battle scenes are typical of-the-era goofiness, sanitized through its 1960s lense. It really is a shame that fictional movies like \"The Dirty Dozen\" or \"Kelly's Heroes\" have more shocking scenes of war than a biography about an army Warhawk. As it is, both the writing and direction are barely adequate and leave much to be desired, but the film is still worth recommending for the glorious portrayal by George C Scott. Where the character ends and the actor begins is impossible to tell, and this is the sign of a truly impressive performance.Because the story leads through a rather shallow, Spark-Notes recollection of his war-time experiences, Patton falls short of greatness. The critical eye of the writer is closed just as we begin to understand the tragic image of a man who became unhealthily obsessed with a destructive drug. Patton may not be my favorite film involving either writer, director, or lead actor (Godfather, Apocalypse Now, The Conversation for Coppola; Planet of the apes and Papillon for Schaffner; The Hustler and Dr Strangelove for George C Scott), but for a fascinating portrait of an enigmatic individual, \"Patton\" remains definitive, until they make his next biopic any better.",

You cannot say that this movie is not accurate without looking at the real news footage about Patton. Granted there was a physical difference between the real Patton and Scotts portrait but when the movie rolls across the big screen, size does not matter ! George C. Scott's version of General Patton will always be the most mimicked version of all time. The version played by George Kennedy is dull and does not deliver the deep impact that the original did. The video release of this movie has been through the many different formats including the Selectavision Disc, VHS, Beta, Laser Disc, and now DVD. Why Patton the movie survives the different format changes is because what would a video store and a video collection be without a copy of one of the greatest war movies of all time. Be sure and check it out or buy it and you will not be disappointed. Rest assured, THAT'S AN ORDER SOLDIER!",

            "content": "The film Patton was made during the film drought of the 70's and it suffers from that. Yes few good films came from this time period for the same reasons this is as bad as it is. To begin with, there are so many factual and anachronisms in the film it is mind boggling how the director took a good look at the cut and said \"Yep, that's the best I can do.\" for example, the tanks used for the film were either the M,41,46,47,or 48. Ironically, these tanks were known as the Walker (M41) and Patton (M46,47 and 48). Also, they all debuted following WW2, and in respect of the Walker, not until midway through the Korean War. Another major problem is the directing aspect. Continuity errors and other goofs abound, unacceptable and unprofessional. In total, IMDb holds a total of 81 goofs and errors, there are probably more in there somewhere, I wouldn't be all that surprised if there were. However, by dislike of this film is not limited to the factual and historical errors, my being a college history student, this would be enough for me to black-ball it. Patton also has quite wooden acting, almost canned bits by Bradley (Malden) when he first meets Patton in the HQ. The sole exception to the is Patton (Scott). But even he on occasion has a pause or two were likely him trying to remember his lines and not dramatic. The worst part of this it is not a true biographical specimen like it is touted as. The biggest slight on history is it does not detail the untimely death of Patton. If you want or need a biographical account of Patton for something like an assignment, steer clear. If you are a historian, steer clear. If you are a WW2 movie fan, consider it. If you have no idea what WW2 is and want to learn something about it, read a history book, Killing Patton is a good example. I think that this should be remade with modern practices and standards, it would be quite good. I think Harrison Ford would be good for Old Blood and Guts if he gained five pounds.",

Agreed - it is a sensational film BUT it's portrayal of Patton does anything but praise him - Sure it shows he had all the requirements for war but it also goes a long way to show how close to insanity those ideals are. Coppola's amazingly duplicitous script allows those gun-ho military types to view Patton as some kind of Combat hero while it allows normal people to see him as a war loving crackpot who was lucky there was a war on as he probably would not have amounted to anything if there wasn't. This is not only evident in the script but also in George C Scott's remarkable performance.

He captures Patton in all of his arrogance and egotism, and yet it is a tribute to his fine performance and the intelligent script that he raises him above that and makes it hard not to respect and admire Patton despite all of his flaws.  I know next to nothing about the real Patton, and can't say how accurately he is portrayed here, but I can't imagine changing anything about the character.  In my opinion, Karl Malden's peformance isn't particularly interesting or energetic, and is a little overrated by some of the users on this board, but maybe that's not his fault; this is definetely Scott's show.  He's onscreen almost constantly; the few scenes not involving him are usually of German Colonel General Alfred Jodl and/or Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, who are invariably talking about him.  While their roles are fairly minor, Richard Muench and Karl Michael Vogler give effective performances despite not really looking much like Jodl or Rommel.  When Jodl tells Rommel \"I am not prepared to dispute the Fuhrer\" and Rommel responds with an exasperated glare and a comment of Jodl being \"prepared to accept nonesense\", you get hints of their personalities as well.",

Patton was a man who read his bible religiously (no pun intended) yet gloried in using the enemy's living guts to grease the wheels of his tanks. This is definitely a 'warts and all\" bio-pic. The Director, Franklin Schaffner, had a knack for making serious, no-frills movies (Pappillon, Boys from Brazil) with no superfluous romance or comic relief, and he was well chosen to take on this subject.

Patton emerged as the most accomplished battle commander in WWII.From his troop training in the US prior to the North African invasion (which he led), galvanizing US forces after Kasserine Pass, his leadership in the invasion of Sicily, his establishment of American equal command in Sicily to Montgomery's after an impassioned address to theatre commander Alexander, his dynamic leadership in securing first Palermo & then Messina, to his un-excelled leadership in the Normandy breakout, his brilliant foresight in the concept of breaking off a full winter attack in order to re-direct his forces toward the German encirclement of Bastogne & his subsequent relief of the embattled town, and his successful crossing of the Rhine ahead of any other allied forces all while his supplies were curtailed by his rapid advances as well as a jealous Montgomery.He bristled at the weak leadership displayed by his superiors and contemporaries alike, both American and British. He was surrounded by jealousy. Eisenhower and Bradley, both his once-subordinates who would go on to surpass him, disliked Patton immensely while on various occasions demonstrating their utter failure as battle commanders in futile efforts to break out of the Normandy hedgerows, the failure to close the Falaise Gap, the debacle in the Huertgen Forest, and the disaster in the Bulge (where Bradley's forces were split & some placed under Montgomery's command), not to mention the disaster at Arnhem under Eisenhower's overall command.The fact that Omar Bradley was the principal adviser on this movie explains the frequent spooky background music painting Patton as some kind of crackpot in contrast with the utterly unflappable & capable Bradley, laughably portrayed by the imposing & handsome Karl Malden (a more realistic actor for Bradley would have been Don Knotts).It's ironic that a movie that subtly attempts to skewer the essence of Patton would go on to be so popular. It must have galled Bradley no end. Once again, Patton would have the last laugh.",

Scott's brilliant acting convinces you even more that this man is Patton, with his pearl revolvers and hot temper.     We cant forget Karl Malden either.  His portrayal of Omar Bradley is most accurate.  He comes across as a kind man who is simply doing his job very well.  In fact I cant think of a single person in this entire movie who doesn't play their part well.    I have but one tiny gripe for this movie.  Patton was a known anti semite.

Patton. Patton is a truly amazing film, which will always be timeless. Not only is this an amazing war movie, it is also an amazing character study of the amazing General George S. Patton.First, We will have to begin with the acting. The acting in Patton is superb. George C. Scott perfectly plays Patton, showing off his amazing facial expressions and his masculinity as an actor, which perfectly goes with Patton's personality. The other actors in Patton are also great such as the amazing Karl Malden, who perfectly plays Omar Bradley, and he perfectly goes together in the scenes with George C. Scott as Patton. Michael Bates, Edward Binns, and Richard M\u00fcnch all also play there roles as General Montgomery, General Walter Smith, and Alfred Jodl greatly as well.The cinematography in Patton is also amazing as we get to see that Director Franklin J. Schaffner and Cinematographer Fred J. Koenekamp use multiple wide shots so they show the real spectacle of this amazing film, as you can see the amazing battle sequences composed of thousands of men and hundreds of tanks and artillery pieces. They also combine long shots in the battles with medium shots so you can see the death and destruction of these battles. This makes you appreciate the directing and cinematography even more in this film. The score in Patton is also great, as it has one of the best original scores in any film, composed by the amazing Jerry Goldsmith. The score perfectly sounds like a piece of music the military would use, and can go with almost every scene due to how great it is as a military score. The costume design in this film is also great as Patton's costume in this film really makes it feel like you are seeing actual soldiers.Another reason this film is so great is the fact that this is not just a movie about World War II. In fact, it is actually mostly a character study about the Real Life Patton himself. Patton basically drives the story as the main character as he has a patriotic, and egomaniac, and brilliant personality, which is probably why he was criticized so much. Patton basically is a symbol of patriotism, and not just for America, but for everybody around the world. The film shows Patton with his personality and lust of going into battles that seem hopeless, but still trying to triumph, which proves just how Patriotic George S. Patton really was. Patton is a man who was out of his time period, a anachronism basically, but he was also a man who believed life should be how you make it out to be. Despite all his criticism, he never changed and really lived how he wanted, which shows that he really shows that he had a patriotic, egomaniac, and brilliant personality.The final reason this film was so great was the Screenplay. Francis Ford Coppola, who was the famous director of The Godfather Trilogy as well as Apocalypse Now, wrote this film, and it is has a great script. The dialogue is superb, memorable, and quotable, such as \"Rommel, You Magnificent B---\", and the beginning scene of the famous speech, which also has amazing dialogue, such as the famous quote, \"Now I want you to remember that no man ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb b--- die for his country.\" It is one of my favorite speech scenes in film.Overall, Patton is a masterpiece with amazing acting, a superb script with amazing dialogue, amazing cinematography and directing, and last but not least, a truly great character study about General George S. Patton.",

The main theme had a bold feeling to it, and makes you feel strong. Sound affects were not that well constructed during the days that it was released. The best bit about it was the story, about General Patton a US field commander (I am not sure of all the ranks and roles of the US army but i am sure the facts i presented a true) My comments may not seem all that well so judge it for yourself and see what you think.

Scott played a knockout role as General Patton. The story does an excellent job in taking us through General Pattons campaign and portraying his gungho tough guy personality. The film begins in North Africa and goes through his campaign all the up to Europe. Patton was a defining film for Scott, the cinematography and shots of portraying north Africa were brilliant. This film was quite significant at the time because America was in the thick of the Vietnam war, so this film really created a sense of patriotism and what better way to instill patriotism than making a film about George Patton a rough tough red blooded America that stop at nothing to achieve full victory. overall I give Patton an 8.5/10.",

            "content": "\"All good things must come to an end\" declares Patton to his subordinates on the eve of the end of the war. As eccentric as the character it portrays, this film is a true biopic, with all of the real general's strengths, weaknesses and idiosyncrasies wrapped up in one delightful package.Although the dialogue lacks the routine swearing so often seen in other wartime movies (perhaps to make the movie appropriate for a wider audience), this slight blow dealt to the realism of \"Patton\" is well compensated for by the gripping story it relates. The remarkably bold opening speech prefaces the events of the film and serves as a vivid introduction to the most unusual trait of the general: his lust for war (\"I love it, God help me, I do love it. I love it more than my life\").Most of the entertainment the movie provides stems from the qualities of Patton himself and the effect they have on his peers, subordinates and often superiors (an omnipresent Ike lurks invisibly in the background), which is both a strength and a weakness of the film. Its single-minded focus on the adventures of the general himself prevent it from depicting a more complex, layered narrative, while this same quality makes it an enviable biography of the man, the simple, linear tone of the film echoing the military mentality of the general.The battle scenes are rather unconvincing, with all the combat, gore and butchery swapped for an abstract, objective portrayal which in a sense places the viewer in the shoes of the egotistical Patton who sees the battle as more of a showdown between himself and the Desert Fox. The acting on the other hand, is wonderful and both Scott and Malden succeed admirably in bringing their characters to life.Patton is truly all about Patton, and Patton is all about himself. Anyone who sees themselves in Patton (at least to a certain extent), will enjoy this movie.",

Scott gave an amazing performance and won the oscar.  On oscar night, he refused to accept the award, not even showing up to the ceremony.

It's really interesting how they showed the conflicts amound the allied generals and the perceptions of the German high command, all of which is accurate. By today's standards, it's not a very epic \"historical epic\", but that's okay because the plot is very character driven. At the time the movie was released (1970) the country's antiwar movement was at it's hieght, and people wanted to be reminded of a war that could be won.

I also have great respect for General George S. Patton. He is, by far, my favorite American general of all time. He wasn't the best, I'm sure there were better than him. But his personality and his style are so larger-than-life that Patton deserves a lot of attention.I also like George C. Scott. He was the perfect man for the part, and was very true to it. Patton himself would have loved to see not only himself glorified but also Scott's portrayal of him, especially Scott's voice- a low, gruff manly voice, which was actually unlikes Patton's, a rather high-pitched voice which he detested, but Scott's voice is much more like Patton's character.But my problem with the film is when the film was made- 1970. Had it been made ten years before or 20 years later it would have been far greater. But the fact that it was made in 1970 destroyed how great the movie could have been.The reason? The fact that the message is anti-war. Some stories, such as Homer's \"The Illiad\" or Joseph Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\" are meant to be anti-war. But with Patton it doesn't work. Patton LOVED war. He lived for war. War was his life. He feared dropping out of West Point because he wanted to be in the heat of battle. He was sad when both the World Wars ended because he was no longer in war. The 1920's and 30's were a terrible time for him because it was in peace. But since the movie Patton was made in 1970, the only way it was ever going to be a success was to have it have an anti-war message throughout the movie. Patton would have hated this.If all the actors were alive today (especially George C. Scott), and they made it today, the film could be possibly one of the greatest, if not THE greatest, film ever made.",

            "content": "Before Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down there was a Patton. A serious film dealing with the psychology of the soldier that against the films of the time, that were no more than glorified exploitation pictures better known as Men-on-a-Mission pictures, seems almost revolutionary.George C. Scott famously turned down his Oscar when he won for his portrayal of General Patton and it seems somewhat poignant that Scott seems to have carried across some of Patton's noble intentions. Actors, like soldiers, do a job and if they do it well most do so without attention or fuss. Only a select few are remembered.Patton is essentially a multi-million dollar character study. It is about a man whose sole purpose is war and the intellect and ingenuity he displays while at it is remarkable. Yet to take him away from the horrors of war and he is useless. A lot of the film takes place away from the battlefield. Instead Patton is trapped in London hotel rooms sitting dutifully by the phone but utterly destroyed as his purpose in life is no longer appropriate. Patton may not be instantly likable - his attitude to cowardice is clearly incredibly vile but it is undermined by the humanism he displays for those who have been wounded or crippled in battle for their country.Intrigingly Patton fights for a country and administration that are embarrassed by him. He is clearly intelligent and resourceful but to put the man in a domestic situation neuters him and Scott carries himself wonderfully throughout whether spewing angered rhetoric at his superiors or staring contemptibly at himself. He is almost a rebel except one that fights for the system yet feels free to tear it up from the inside.Karl Malden is definitely a presence that is really missed when not on screen. That stoic everyman quality is fantastic next to Scott's exuberant performance. The direction is strong and while the film is over three hours long its length is not that noticeable until you are well into the third hour of the film.It suffers from a few too many scenes of the same thing (Patton appears to whine a lot and shout a lot) but rather amazingly it works. It does not feel overblown like other historical epics such as say, Ben Hur or Cleopatra, nor is it an overly pretentious war film such as later works like The Thin Red Line. Instead it presents the epic scope of war against the intimate. There are more scenes in confined rooms than battlefields.In a decade when cinema was supposedly changed this film got there before the tent-pole films of the decade in spending a lot of money on what is actually an intimate, personal, layered story. Before The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, Jaws, Close Encounters or Alien there was Patton. And while it isn't quite as good as the films just listed. It is however still a great film that deserves your attention. On top of all this character study it is also just really entertaining. Watch it for the good film it is, even if it isn't quite a great as many of the other films that littered the ensuing decade.",

On the other hand we have the comments in approx an hour after the film where they say along the lines 'he stops being an American and he becomes an ally' As if Americans do it better all the time. Or should i mention the outrageous speech given in the beginning? Knowing a lot about history makes me believe his words (if used by the real Patton) are nothing but brainwashing and propaganda. Unfortunately his character is so clich\u00e9 #know it all - i am the best'' type which caused me nausea through the film in similar comments like that. On the other hand though the film overall is targeted to Patton's life and i think to that respect it has been executed well.

Not only does he mirror his look, Mr.Scott provides an accurate portrayal in language, style and manner of the General. The movie does take some liberty with historical fact but not enough to detract from a realistic appraisal of the time nor the man. One such incident is the apology sequence (after slapping the private soldier (Considine). Not accurate but contains the elements necessary. Supporting cast is excellent, Karl Malden as Omar Bradley is outstanding. Battle sequences are excellent, given this was shot before digital special effects. One such portrayal is the attack by German aircraft in North Africa and shooting between Patton's feet, (didn't happen) but is splendidly edited, dramatic and adds to the courage and dynamic of General Patton. Most importantly it leads to the very real confrontation of Patton and his criticism of Allied air cover. Also of importance, I believe, in the context of history, is the background politics of Montgomery and Bedell-Smith, Ike's Chief of Staff, especially the bathroom sequence. Add this to Patton's later response it is well-done. Viewers should also look for the sequences that show Patton at his weakest, when he exhibits doubt. These come in the close, human relationship with his aide, who is decidedly sympathetic to the general. The music score is outstanding. It will be a timeless piece and one of those scores that will quickly and readily identify the movie.",

This movie is basically about the beliefs of this one man and his adversaries amongst the axis and even the allies.A fairly well done performance but nothing far to spectacular. George C. Scott deserves a round of applause and the rest are just mediocre. The 7 academy awards comes from the weakness of movies released that year (1970) and Patton definitely deserved them under that condition. In todays standard this movie would still be a great movie however in my ratings It barely made it out as a 4 star.The movie depicts Patton to be a much greater icon then the actual history that precedes him. Erwin Rommel of the Germans was portrayed to have utmost respect in Patton and his men when in reality he didn't care much for Pattons troops but rather had respect for his arch nemesis Montgomery. Knowing that it takes a bit away from the film however the overall performance still makes it quite a epic to watch.It can become very slow at times and is intended on being a bio-pic so really the base of this movie is to present the character Patton and some of the events that occurred during his time at war. I would recommend this film to movie goers who love army films without the battles and rather just after math sequences. It isn't the best army flick and there are many better out there but I will give it the honor of saying George C. Scott gave it justice by playing everyones beloved General.",

The settings for the film are excellent and the drama that it captures makes it a great war film.  Every bit deserving of it's academy awards and it's place among the best pictures that Hollywood has ever offered.",

            "content": "This motion picture captures both the legend, and the enigma of George S. Patton, in an unapologetic fashion. Patton, as brilliantly portrayed by the late George C. Scott, is presented as he was: brash, egotistical, uncompromising, yet undeniably heroic. Scott's performance, in my opinion, is one of the best in the history of film, and this picture will always be considered one of the best in its genre.",

When he as chosen by General Bradley to take command he only had 2. Silly point of\ngoofs but caught my eye. Still,\none of the, if not the best war movies ever made.",

            "content": "Damn its been 50years since this movie first came on screen. And my o my, for this generation and more generations to come, this might just be the greatest depiction of human character of all time, in a magnificent and magical way.\nThe role played by George C. Scott is so mind alluring, that not for once it made me feel that this isn't the original general Patton. The whole movie is more like a real life documentation of Pattons glorified Characteristics, which he have every rights to glorify.\nI'm so glad that I've been able to experience this cinema directed by Schaffner. General Bradley also did an amazing part here. Shows the other part of a soldier.\nOne cant simple hate this cinema if they love artwork.\nThis is by far one of the greatest war movie of all time, egen though it is more of a autobiographical screening.",
