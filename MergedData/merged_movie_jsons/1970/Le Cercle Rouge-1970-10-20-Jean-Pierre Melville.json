            "content": "\"Le Circle Rouge\" from 1970 is a French film. That's another way of saying that a lot of Americans won't like it and won't understand this gritty and underplayed film. The title comes from a made-up Buddhist saying, \"When men, even unknowingly, are to meet one day, whatever may befall each, whatever the diverging paths, on the said day, they will inevitably come together in the red circle.\" Melville made up a saying for Le Samourai as well.One thing we've lost in filmmaking in this country is the art of the buildup. You have to get to the point of the story in five minutes. This film is about a jewelry heist, and the jewelry heist happens very late in the film. Corey (Alain Delon) is released from prison after five years. Just before he leaves, one of the guards tells him about a jewelry heist he can get in on. Corey is uncertain, so instead he goes to his old boss Rico and steals money from him. Rico sends thugs after him to retrieve the money.In a parallel plot, a criminal Vogel (Gian-Maria Volonte) is being transported by train and escapes. He winds up hiding in Corey's trunk while Corey is in a restaurant.Corey finds him, hears his story, and lets him travel by trunk. The car is cut off by Rico's people, and in the ensuing fight, Corey loses the money. Now broke, he decides to join the jewelry heist and include Vogel.They invite a former police detective, Jansen (Yves Montand) to join them. He is a bad alcoholic having the DTs. Somehow he manages to pull himself together and meet with them. The heist is on.I would be surprised if there is one page of dialogue in this script, and yet you keep watching. Perhaps influenced by another classic, Rififi, the heist is carried out in complete silence.The director, Melville, does a magnificent job of keeping us interested, even if there is not much background given of the characters. We know that Delon's boss is sleeping with his former girlfriend, and that's about it. We don't know what made Montand an alcoholic. Melville keeps us focused on their objective. The acting is very smooth, with Volonte (Vogel) a standout who also has the best role. His scene of escaping police and dogs is one of the best scenes in the movie.The police commissioner in the movie states that in the end, all men are guilty, even the police. He believes that we are all tainted with original sin. Maybe so. \"Le Circle Rouge\" won't do much to convince you otherwise.",

            "content": "On the eve of his release after five years imprisoned, the thief Corey (Alain Delon) is contacted by one guard of the prison that offers him a jewelry heist. However Corey seeks out his former boss Rico (Andr\u00e9 Ekyan) and steals money from him. Rico sends two gangsters to hunt Corey down and retrieve the stolen amount. Meanwhile the criminal Vogel (Gian- Maria Volonte) is transported by train by the Police Officer Mattei (Andr\u00e9 Bourvil) and succeeds to escape. Corey drives from Marseille to Paris and Vogel hides in the trunk of his car. Corey finds him but does not object to ride Vogel to Paris hidden in the trunk. When the gangsters sent by Rico cut in Corey's car, Vogel saves him from the criminals, but Corey loses the money. Without money, Corey decides to heist the jewelry with Vogel and invites the former police detective Jansen (Yves Montand) to team-up with them. The trio executes a perfect heist but Rico is seeking revenge and Mattei is an unethical but efficient police officer capable to use any means to resolve the case. \"Le cercle rouge\" is another great heist movie by the French director Jean-Pierre Melville, one of the best in the genre crime and thriller. The thin line between the behavior of police members and criminals is impressively realistic. The scenes are very detailed and there are long sequences in absolute silence along 140 minutes running time but the movie is developed in an adequate pace and is never boring. The dream cast with Alain Delon, Gian-Maria Volonte and Yves Montand among others makes this movie totally believable. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"O Circulo Vermelho\" (\"The Red Circle\")",

            "content": "This is only the second film I've checked out on IMDB and both have had negative user comments. In this case the person contributing comments was a tad chauvinistic and appeared to be strongly biased against French movies. I am English and can't get enough of French movies,but I also can't get enough of GOOD movies, be they English, American, French, Italian, whatever. Whichever way you slice it Le Cercle Rouge is a masterpiece, shot by a director at, as the cliche has it, the height of his powers.  Cool, stylish, slick, professional,call it what you will, it's a winner.  Everyone is on top of their game,not least Bourvil in a rare attempt at straight acting - he is best known as a zany comic in a series of box office smashes that don't translate well into English.  The Melville schtick, a set-piece, is a doozy this time around, a jewellery heist on the Place Vendome, carried out in total silence in a nod to Rififfi and if anything surpassing it.  The sombre,muted tones, embody the sense of cool and also the melancholy that informs the film making anything other than a downbeat ending unthinkable. Like the man said, if you only see one movie this year make it this one.",

            "content": "Not having seen this film in quite some time, we caught with it not long ago in the nicely transferred Criterion DVD. \"Le cercle rouge\" is a film that owes a lot to other movies, as it keeps reminding us about \"Rififi\", \"The Asphalt Jungle\", among others, because they all deal with capers that take center stage in the movie and reproduce it in great detail. Unfortunately, one knows that old adage that crime does not pay, and from the start, these men involved in it are doomed from the onset.Jean-Pierre Melville was a director of few words. He didn't fill his pictures with a lot of dialog, as it's the case here. Yet, for not being \"talky\", they had a style of their own as proved with \"Le Dolous\", \"Le Samurai\", and his masterpiece, \"Bob le flambeur\", among others. Mr. Melville had a sense of style that comes across in everything he did. In this film, working with his cinematographer, Henri Decae, he takes us along for a ride through the streets of Paris that shows the vibrant city mainly at night and the bleak winter in France. The score is by Eric Demarsan that emphasizes a jazzy music that accompanies most of the action.Although the film shows Alain Delon, as Corey, at the center of the action, it is however, the smart inspector Mattei who is the real hero of the movie. As played by the great Bourvil, he is a man that shows a lot of patience because he has figured from the beginning how to catch Vogel, and in the process he gets involved in the investigation of the jewel heist in which he knows the escaped man he is tailing looms large behind it. Bourvil gives an enormously satisfying performance as Mattei showing equal parts of determination and tenderness, as it's the case with the three cats he adores.Alain Delon always responded with interesting performances his appearances in Mellville's pictures. In here he is Corey, the man who is first seen leaving prison and promising himself he won't go back, but he cannot pass a good thing when he decides to go ahead and participate in the robbery. His association with Vogel and Jansen, pays off in the way they get the job done, but it will also prove a mistake in the way they will not be able to dispose of the loot as the fence they have relied on has a change of heart.Gian Maria Volonte and Yves Montand are seen as Vogel and Jansen, respectively. They were excellent actors who blend well in the action of the film. Both actors were at their best moment when they took the roles in the film and it shows. Mr. Montand has the more complex character to play as we witness him in his first moment in front of the camera as a man with many demons inside his head.Jean-Pierre Mellville got wonderful results from his cast and crew in a film, that although feels a bit longer, but still succeeds in showing his style in one of the most memorable pictures from the director.",

            "review_title": "One of my new favorite heist pictures: a smooth success for Melville and his cast",
            "content": "Jean-Pierre Melville is a director I've only recently gotten acquainted with (I need to see Bob le Flambeur and Le Samourai again to fully grasp them), but in watching Le Cercle Rouge (The Red Circle, supposedly based on a saying in Buddhism) I realized I was watching as skillful and absorbing a crime film as I had seen in a quite some time. Though his film has dialog, it is mainly to keep the film's scenes rolling along, adherent to the plot. What kept me on the alert, even in seemingly mundane scenes/sequences, was the emphasis on the characters' movements, or behavior patterns. Melville has his story laid out, and he is careful to take his time to tell it (this could seem boring to some, but it does seem to work since he puts a little more emphasis on the weight of the characters/environments over plot). Yet look at each of the four main players: Alain Deleon as Corey (just released from prison, scheming a new heist), Gian Maria Volonte as Vogel (escaping & on the lam from hand-cuffed custody, meets Corey by luck), Yves Montand as Jansen (an aged pro with many years of experience with weapons, a friend of Vogel), and Andre Bourvil as Mattei (an experienced investigator, who is on the look-out for Vogel, and on his toes with internal affairs). Each of these actors plays their parts with precision, detachment, and they each have their own kinds of moments that indicate to the audience what their personalities might be besides as criminals and cops. The heist sequence gives little hints, for example, like how Vogel cops-a-feel off a female statue while passing down the halls, or how Jansen takes out a flask and merely has a whiff of the contents (and what a dream this guy creates). Even Corey's movements involving a photograph of a woman arouse interest. As absorbing and cool the story becomes, and as great the skills were to make it happen (via cinematographer Henri Decae, the editing, and the musical score by Eric Demarsan), it's the people on the screen that gain fascination, in how they stay true to their natures and ideals. Not a film to be missed by French new-wave enthusiasts, and modern-day crime movie buffs might want to take the 140 minutes to soak up the atmosphere of Melville's work. A suave piece of film-making that still ranks as one of my all-time favorites.",

            "content": "THE RED CIRCLE (Jean-Pierre Melville - France/Italy 1970).This might be the coolest film ever made, in the most literal sense of the term. The men here never lose control and never - not once - show their emotions. No dramatic outbursts in this film. Everyone is cool all the time. It's an abstract dream-world, where the men live by their own code, a gangster code with the values of the outside world conspicuously absent. In this masterfully filmed heist saga, Melville tackles the American crime thriller in his distinctly dark and desolate style, yet made in grand fashion with a hefty budget of ten million dollars and with four of the greatest French stars at the time. Alain Delon as the master thief, Yves Montand as an alcoholic ex-cop, Italian star Gian-Maria Volont\u00e9 as an escaped criminal and Andr\u00e9 Bourvil in an atypical role as the cynical police chief.Melville described LE CERCLE ROUGE as his penultimate film and it is indeed a masterfully stylized policier. He also claimed he wanted to shoot a film noir in colour and in many ways he succeeded. The two primary influences for this film were John Huston's 1950 heist movie THE ASPHALT JUNGLE and Jules Dassin's RIFIFI (1955). But unlike these films, where we learn much about the background of the individual gang members, with all their petty needs and worries that motivate them, making clear these are not just ruthless underworld types, but ordinary individuals engaged in a world of everyday worries and human endeavour, Melville, though, tells us almost nothing about his criminals. Why was Corey (Alain Delon) in jail? Why was his associate, Vogel (Jean-Marie Volont\u00e9) arrested in the first place? Or why the ex-police marksman Jansen (Yves Montand) left the force, was it his alcoholism? We never learn the motivations behind their actions and never find out what drives these men. Women are even more absent than in his earlier films, with the \"emotional\" ties exclusively between men. They don't even seem to have personal lives. A sort of an emotional twilight zone and although the setting is not as abstract as in his earlier LE SAMOURAI (1967), Melville still sketches a very eerie world. Melville's favorite actor, Alain Delon, is perfect and almost outdoes himself in coolness, if imaginable.Deliberately paced and with a length of over 140 minutes, Melville takes his time to tell the story, but its slow pace and length seems a perfect way to show the desolate world these men live in. Nothing is ever out of place in Melville's films and here it's no different, every little detail seemingly of pivotal importance for the story. Although LE SAMOURAI remains my favorite Melville film, even up there with the greatest films ever made, this one also belongs to the very best. Camera Obscura --- 10/10",

Most of the film has no music, which keeps the pace slower, and there is the notorious heist scene featuring no dialogue for thirty minutes. For some, that may be intolerable.Melville is a master, and possibly the most underrated director of his era. His name means nothing to so many people, and yet he never made a bad film.

Alain Delon provides the antihero, Melville provides the cool, and a handful of other great talent (Yves Montand, Gian Maria Volonte, and Andre Bourvil, mostly) arrives to add a crisp engaging movie......with very little dialog. This is great, because one certain aspect of the genre tends to be a lot of dialog involving the quick-witted and their various repartees. This movie, however, could be watched with the sound completely off and not too terribly much would be missed. Not to say the sound is bad, oh no, the jazzy soundtrack and the crisp audio catching the little movements makes the slow, patient deliberation of the patients very compelling.What's also really neat about this film is that the color cinematography is pretty fantastic. Usually when it comes to cinematography, black and white movies tend to stick out in my mind, but this film has some very strong and beautiful imagery that makes the movie pure visual pleasure to observe.--PolarisDiB",

            "content": "Viewed at the Golden Apricot Film Festival, Yerevan, 2017. The peak film of the Yerevan week was without a doubt \"Le Cercle Rouge\", the 1970 all star gangland thriller by master of the genre, Jean-Pierre Melville. Not as well known as his younger Nouvelle Vague disciples, Truffaut and Godard, but a much better filmmaker, Melville specialized in deliberately paced psychological thrillers in which top French stars delivered some of their best performances. At the very beginning we are informed that the cryptic title, The Red Circle, comes from a fatalistic Buddhist capsule of wisdom which states that no matter what their divergent paths may be all men end up in the same Red Circle. The three men with the divergent paths here are (1) Corey, a cool gangster just released from prison and hoping to go straight (Alain Delon), (2j Vogel, a desperado killer on the lam, (Italian star Gian Maria Volonte) and (3) Jansen, a retired expert police marksman with a drinking problem and questionable morals (Yves Montand). They come together by fate to successfully pull off a tremendous midnight jewelry heist on Ritzy Place Vend\u00f4me in central Paris but will all end up in the fatal Red Circle due to a complex network of interlocking intrigues and betrayals. Bravado, integrity, and betrayal are recurrent themes in Melville films. Pulling them in to the fatal circle is another iconic French actor, Bourvil, as the wily cat loving detective relentlessly tracking the escaped Vogel all across France from Marseille to Paris, there callously exploiting his major informant contacts. (Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier, another major French character actor). The long heist scene filmed in complete silence is spellbinding and a tribute of sorts to a similar scene in the Jules Dassin technically perfect crime thriller \"Rififi\" of 1955. Together with \"Le Samoua\u00ef\", another Melville masterpiece also starring Delon, Red Circle is an enduring twin peaks of French thriller cinema. Breathless entertainment all the way, and the work of a master craftsman at the top of his game. Cercle Rouge was part of a five film tribute to Ma\u00eetre Melville in the Armenian capital on the hundredth anniversary of his birth.",

            "content": "Here in this film, you have so many elements that you already have in other features from Melville. Pictural and soundly. For instance the crows roars, when Delon and Maria Volonte meet, in the countryside, beside Delon's car trunk; the same you have in ARMY OF SHADOWS, when Ventura walks in the countryside, near the prisonner camp, or the farm. Second the rattling sound during the jewellery heist, when the alarm system switches off, the same sound that you have in ARMY OF SHADOWS, during the scene where the resistants in the ambulance try to pull the escape of Felix, from the Lyon prison. And the scene where Yves Montand, the former cop and sharp shooter decides to get rid of the tripod to pull the trigger against the alarm system button, the same scheme as Denis Manuel removes the rifle lense in LE DEUXIEME SOUFFLE, during the armored truck heist, or more precisely against the policeman on his motorcycle. Heist sequence of course makes us think about RIFIFI scene, dialogue free outstanding moment. And Yves Montand gives here one of his best performances ever. The highlight is during the last seconds of the heist, just before he leaves the jewellery lobby, taking a look, a long look at the alarm lock, which gave him his psychological freedom; the lock that proved him he was not finished. Terrific scene. Anyway his character is full of.nobility, refusing his cut on the loot and offering his help to his partners till the very end of the affair. Only Melville could give us this.

            "content": "The Red Circle (1970)It's not enough to call this a caper film. It's loaded with big French stars of the time (Yves Montand and Alain Delon among others) and it has high production values and a steady pace, so it's a serious movie. It also comes after many years now of the French New Wave, which produced more striking and original films than this. And it seems to have standing in its way its own seriousness, so that scenes are drawn out with stubborn self-awareness, showing every step of some basic activities like going up and down stairs.Part of this is an issue of style, no doubt, and to give the filmmakers (namely director Jean-Pierre Melville) the benefit of the doubt is to highlight these visual and editing choices. But in the end there are some basic issues of involvement that are hard to avoid. It's boring stuff at times. The actors are good, even very good, at being dry and understated. But that's not necessarily good for a movie that needs more than the prospect of a crime to keep us watching. In fact, the crime itself, detailed so beautifully, is disappointing. It has highly clever aspects (the bullet melting perfectly for one), but not enough to sustain normal curiosity.It occurred to me in the first half hour that there might be an intentional parody at work here. When the man escapes from the train, he should truly be running for his life, but he sort of half runs, half stumbles, half looks earnestly behind him. When he does the trick of hiding his tracks in the stream, he cuts directly across so the dogs can find his scent in about two seconds. And, oddly (or not oddly, in a farce) he gets away anyway, right under their noses. Unexplained.But in fact I've never heard wind there is any farce here at all, just a lot of demands for patience. I gave it my best, and it gave it's best in return, which wasn't enough. What almost redeemed it was a very dark ending, relentless and deeply inky. Not a bad film by any means, but bring a book.",

            "content": "Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Cercle Rouge follows the lives of two criminals: Vogel (Gian Maria Volont\u00e8), a murderer who gives the cops the slip while he's being transferred from one city to another by train; and Corey (Allain Delon), a thief just released from jail. Fate decides to join these two men to pull off a spectacular heist. In the background there is Matei (Andr\u00e9 Bourvil), the detective Vogel escapes from, implacable in his pursuit and sometimes ruthless in his methods. Along the movie the viewer meets other minor but fascinating characters, the best of which is Jansen (Yves Montand), a disgraced ex-cop and an excellent marksman.Melville has such a unique style one doesn't need to watch many of his movies to catch on. Le Samourai, Un Flic and Le Cercle Rouge are clearly made of the same cloth: the symmetrical angles; the long shots; the silences; the coats and hats and cigars; the quotes at the beginning; the amazing heists, the fatalism; the unglamorous and inglorious criminal life. Everything that's great in Melville is present here in top form.And his shortcomings didn't bother me so much this time: the illogical, perplexing behavior of his characters and confusing storytelling, which hurt my enjoyment of his other movies, are almost invisible here. Since Le Cercle Rouge preceded Un Flic that doesn't mean he got better with time; perhaps I'm just getting more used to it and reaching a mindset where it doesn't bother me anymore.Melville made unique crime movies. As old as they may be, they show more ingenuity, realism and grace than the modern techno-thrillers in which cool thieves use computer systems and James Bond-esquire gadgets to pull off impossible crimes. Melville's criminals aren't cool: they're lonely, socially awkward and probably aware they're not good for much more than planning heists. They're society's unwanted, living in the night, always one step ahead of the police in a game they know they'll lose eventually. There's nothing romantic about them.Amazingly for a movie of this type, the cops aren't complete idiots either. Matei is smart, crafty, patient and even compassionate. He's not an unlikeable villain or a clich\u00e9, he's just an old man doing his job and doing it right. He knows when to use force and when to use brains. Many movies could learn from him.It's this down-to-earth, unromantic style that makes Melville's movies such a joy to watch and puts him on a special pedestal as one of cinema's great crime masters.",

Delon and Volont\u00e9 have great chemistry and Montand is terrific as a world weary drunk (he actually hallucinates while drying out; it's a really creepy scene). The bleak cinematography by Henri Deca\u00eb captures a gloomy Paris in winter and there's a stunning, albeit sparsely used, music score by \u00c9ric Demarsan. The supporting cast includes Andr\u00e9 Ekyan as one of Delon's sleazy cohorts and Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier as a very reluctant informer. Bourvil, who died before the film's release, steals the show as a wily modern day Inspector Javert.",

The movie is a classic 'heist picture', precisely and methodically moving through the set-up, the recruiting, the job, the escape and the bloody aftermath. The acting is excellent (although often minimalist) with Volont\u00e8 (likely best known to most North Americans as the evil brother Ramon in \"Fistful of Dollars\" and the sadistic El Indio in \"for a Few Dollars More) a real standout.

Delon is better than in most of his other films, except perhaps Le Samoura\u00ef (1967) directed by the same Melville. Volont\u00e8 is as incredible as in all his movies, simply the greatest actor ever. The total surprise of this \"Le Cercle Rouge\" is Bourvil, who plays a unique role throughout all his career, here he is no longer the comic simpleton of many previous films, but a policeman as never seen before. Great direction, great cinematography by Henri Deca\u00eb, everything great. Absolute masterpiece!",

Their lives intersect and robbery is committed....The reviews for this re-release were glowing and when I discovered that Video Search of Miami had a copy I sent for it figuring that its the same price as a trip to The Film Forum to see it.When the disc came I sat and watched the first 40 minutes before being called away. I loved what I saw and couldn't wait to see it again.Six months later I have the time to sit and watch and starting from the beginning I revisit the first 40 minutes and travel on into the rest of the film.Having made it to the end I have to say that I heartily recommend the first hour of this film. This is a film that brilliantly sets a mood and a place and the possibility that something great will happen. Unfortunately once the film gets to a certain point all the possibility runs away like the rain that soaks much of the film.The trouble is that nothing is explained. We don't know what the job is until the jewelry store is cased. Characters come and go as if they will mean something and in the end nothing does. Plot lines are dropped, Corey, the released prisoner is being hunted by the mob and after a certain point that just ceases to be included until a moment of two later on when the crime boss he robs talks to the prison guard who laid out the \"job\". Things just are.In the end this is a just a run of the mill crime story with a great first third.Another problem is that the police inspector takes center stage for most of the later part of the film and while he is an interesting character, he just doesn't do anything interesting. This film is full of interesting people and events but nothing connects to anyone. So much feels left out, to the point that I can only wonder at what sort of a mess the short version was.Can I recommend it? Well maybe, yea, sort of.Its not bad it just sort of wanders off into \"deep meaning\" that means nothing.Frankly Criterion is coming out with a special edition of this and I was watching it so I could decide whether to replace it. I'm not. Although I have a nasty feeling this is going to become one of those movies I keep re-watching hoping to get it, like Heaven and Earth, a Japanese samurai movie I've seen several times and never liked simply because I keep thinking I'm missing something.That said the first chunk of this is really good. Hope for it to be on cable and to have a blackout occur an hour in so you won't be disappointed.",

Actually, I suppose that it is not quite correct because although the first third is the coolest and fastest moving nourish, hardboiled affair, there is something of a near silent pause for the heist itself. Much more visible on the new disc, the meticulous preparations and execution are immaculate, appreciated even by someone like me who thought the actual heist the least appealing feature of the earlier Rififi. The last third of the film comes as something of a disappointment but that is simply the story not in any way a criticism of the mighty directing. Great stuff!",

That is what the film is all about. And a jewel robbery at the place Vendome.Corey (Delon) brings the plan from prison, Vogel(Volont\u00e9)joins him and helps him against two tough guys, who are after him, because he took mafioso Ricos(Andre Eycan) money, while Rico already took Coreys girl friend and left him very much alone for five years in jail. Corey and Vogel find a third man, Jansen(Montand), a former police officer and sniper who opens a security lock by shooting special hand made ammunition into a hole. A perfect plan and cooperation, but they have to sell the booty and there is Mattei in the role of a buyer in disguise. The circle closes. Running to help each other they are shot by the cat loving Mattei and his little pistol.It took Melville 20 years he says to make a robbery film after he failed to get a contract for RIFFIFI. Melville wrote the screenplay and filmed in the south of France and in Paris of yesteryear. The great Henri Decae is as usual the lighting cameraman. It is the one before last picture of Melvilles who died after another film with Delon in 1972.Melville actually wanted Belmondo instead of Volont\u00e9, he didn't like that Italian at all, but Volont\u00e9-Vogel is an excellent fugitive and gives next to Bourvil the most convincing performance. But mind you: Melville notes, that Volont\u00e9 is an instinctive actor, a strange character, very wearying and absolutely impossible on a French set. Melville didn't like him at all and didn't want to work with him ever again.Melville is wrong. Volont\u00e9 give the most lively character in the nowhere of not so many interesting characters. You can see what he is feeling being chased by Mattei and his little dangerous gun and all the dogs of France in winter 70. A wild actor.Also Andr\u00e9 Bourvil, who passed away close to the time of the filming. He also was not first choice, but definitely a great substitute. He carries the instinct of a lonely hunter through the whole film and gets in the end his chance to become guilty once more.Jansen has entered at night the jewelry shop with a rifle and a tripod but risks eventually freehandedly a successful shot. When he meets Delon the first time we already know that the elegant Jansen has a severe drinking problem. After the robbery Montand renounces to take his part of the booty and mentions to Delon, who looks up to him, that he only got into the red circle, because he wanted to take revenge on the inhabitants of his wardrobe. Delon doesn't catch what he means. The audience recalls having seen Montand in a great scene in his haunted house fighting helplessly nightmare creatures that come out of the wardrobe and attack him. At that time a very rare scene, one recalls a long time after. I bet it was ever so difficult to arrange and direct that stuff at a time no one imagined the coming days of digital movie making. Great artwork when art was made by hand.We sure will remember a crew like the actors, still it seems even after 33 years this one stays the less popular of the six thrillers of Melville. What is wrong with it? I am afraid one doesn't take much interest in those three actors (showing three criminals) and their police hunter. We learn too little about Corey and his fatal 5 years away from his beautiful girl(Anna Douking). Montand is still a great sniper, but what made him become a drinking man with funny creatures in his wardrobe. Delon acts as if he is in an earlier adventure of the samourai, Volont\u00e9 is the man in the trunk of Delons American car and superbly moving and Mattei is swell to look at, a great actor at the edge of his life. But how could he ever possibly doubt that all are guilty ?In an interview Melville states, that there is no woman in the film. Not in the very red circle, but I remember well that jolly good looking female Anna Douking (with no future career). We are in the 70s. There in fact rises a woman from the bed of an old mafioso wearing nothing and walks slowly to the door to listen to the voice of her old lover Delon. Bardot did something like that 10 years earlier. This time Melville was directing. Well done.The RED CERCLE has certainly added a few but not many glittering gems to film history. The robbery at Place Vendome and Montands wonder bullet the inhabitants of the wardrobe and Volont\u00e9 escaping Bouvil in white underwear and carrying his trousers carefully across a stream. That is too little for a great gangster and robbery movie. But the 110 minutes never bore you and it is a game on a high level. And there are probably some secrets you learn when you see the film over and over again. None of the secrets is that we are all guilty and the late Francois Perier is also featured.Michael Zabel",

            "content": "Le Cercle Rouge is a typical story for Melville's cinema. His characters are gangsters and policemen, who while fighting the eternal wars one against the other share the same behavior and honor code, with rules of themselves, rules out of the books of rules, rules which do not request many words to be explained and followed. They also share the same dressing code, wearing the same trench-coats borrowed from the requisite of Humphrey Bogart.Le Cercle Rouge brings to screen one of the exquisite teams of actors that could be gathered in a French film at that time. Alain Delon is in his natural element in the role of the gangster Corey, who just released from jail is dragged in a sophisticated jewelry theft. Delon is paired with Gian Maria Volonte who is in this film Vogel, the gangster on the run, whom Corey will recognize and who he will recognize as a fellow that destiny decided to meet together on the Red Circle (a Buddhist concept all invented by Melville for people that fate decides to put on the same track). They say that Volonte did not really cope well with the freedom that Melville used to give to his actors, I do not know if this is true, but nothing is to be seen on screen, and the Italian actor fits perfectly in the dynamics and relations of the film. Yves Montand completes the trio on the bad side of the law with a role which is smaller in words and screen time, but extremely exact and with a performance to remember. It is in the role of the cop that Melville made his most daring casting, selecting one of the greatest comic actors of France ever - Bourvil - in a completely dramatic role. This role was even more memorable taking into account that this was the last in his career.Le Cercle Rouge is a well told story which survives well the four decades since its making due to the consistent art of the director, and to the remarkable acting of its stars, who meld well into the film, playing their characters and not themselves. At a time when the American genres like the westerns and the gangster movies were making their way into the European cinema, Melville and his film are almost typical examples of the moment. A few years later it was the European art cinema which made its way back refreshing the themes and the genres in Hollywood. The dialog between the two cinema schools continues, to the delight of the film fans from all over.",

Melville's crime tales are directed perfectly straight forward without the hipness that permeated the French New Wave .  His protagonist of choice Alain Delon had the ability to portray either cop or crook and the audience would always side with him.  \"The Red Circle,\" is one of Melville's best collaborations with Delon--not as good as \"Le Samourai\" (1967) but superior to \"Un Flic\" (1971).  Nowadays cats tend to say \"they don't make movies like that anymore\" but \"they\" weren't making films like Melville during his time--over thirty years ago.

            "content": "I would hesitate to call this a thriller, since there is little to keep you on the edge of your seat. There is a jewel heist that is engaging, but it is not that different from similar heists in other movies and for me it did not have the suspense inherent in either of the heists in Jules Dassin's \"Tokkopi\" or \"Rififi.\" The details on how the heist was planned are almost entirely missing--director Melvile seems to be more interested in what happened before and after the heist than in the mechanics of it. The overall mood is one of cool detachment.The movie starts with Corey (Alain Delon) getting out of prison, after having been told of an easy jewel heist by one of the prison guards. At first Corey expresses little interest, claiming that he has no interest in winding up in prison again. But the hook has been set. Later in the film Corey has a chance meeting with Vogel, an escaped prisoner on the lam. Once these two have hooked up it is inevitable that they cannot resist the robbery. More than half the movie is concerned with how Corey and Vogel meet. There is some philosophizing about how fate dictates certain personal meetings that have significant consequences. I did not see any great deep insight offered on this--we have all met people who have significantly changed our lives. No mysterious hand of fate is involved, just random chance.Along the way Corey and Vogel recruit the services of Jansen (Yves Montand) as an expert marksman. Jansen is an ex policeman who got out of the force because he could not tolerate the corruption. As we first meet Jansen he seems to have more general global problems than just with corruption in the police department as he is in the depths of the DTs. This scene is perhaps the scariest in the movie. The appearance of Jansen's apartment testifies to the quality of the set design, as seen throughout. Montand and Corey deliver the goods with their restrained performances and they alone make the movie worth seeing. The more I see Montand in these kind of roles, the more I think of him as a French Humphrey Bogart.I liked the variety shows being put on at the upscale nightclub where the mob gathered. I wish the DVD extras had had complete performances of those.The plot is not without holes. The biggest one for me was the fact that the thieves could gain access to the jewelry store by way of a window with single pane glass. No matter how remote that window was, given the heavy security in place it is hard to imagine that any entry was not maximally protected.The musical score is unobtrusive but effective and noteworthy in its own right.The head of the police internal affairs posits that all men are capable of corruption and evil. Is this so? And what about women?",

            "content": "\"Le Cercle Rouge\" is Jean-Pierre Melville's contribution to the heist movie genre, but, sitting squarely between the 1960s and the 1970s, is closer in tone to the gritty, urban crime dramas that would become popular after than the glamorous, playful heist movies that preceded it.Alain Delon, Gian Maria Volonte, and Yves Montand play the three principal crooks who knock off a jewelry store in the Place Vendome, and Andre Bourvil is the principal investigator who brings them down. A recurring theme in the film is the relationship between chance and fate, the red circle of the film's title occurring visually again and again throughout the movie and reminding us of the quotation that appears at its beginning, suggesting that men of like minds will find themselves drawn together. And indeed the early parts of the film are the best ones, as Melville slowly teases us with each man's individual story and keeps us guessing as to how their paths will all eventually intersect. But by the end I confess I found myself getting a bit restless with the film's slow pace.The film is quiet and mournful; the men in it barely talk and don't seem to enjoy either the prospect of the heist itself nor the rewards they will reap from it. Instead, they seem almost relentlessly driven to commit their criminal acts, as if they have no choice in the matter, which confirms one character's opinion stated early on in the film that all men are guilty until proved innocent. It's this quality that makes the film feel more at home with the flurry of movies about urban isolation that became so popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s than with its predecessors from the 1950s and 1960s that made being a jewel thief look like nothing more than a suave good time.Grade: A-",

            "review_title": "Outside the Circle",
            "content": "Spoilers herein.French films have extra work to do in my case. Most of them are intelligent to be sure, but the intelligence is of a febrile sort, hotly conceived but a bit ill and trivial. There are only three French films that I can think of that really have made an impression: `Marienbad,' Godard's `Lear,' and this. The first two are lifealtering in an obvious way. This one moves much more subtly. The game in film narrative is usually to make things whole, to fill a bag with elements that are artificially complete, that reference nothing outside the bag. Its a tough trick, as anyone knows who has written for the screen. Easy to do; hard to do and not seem artificial. (That's why you have so many current writers deliberately being artificial.)Melville's approach is wholly different. Instead of building a world by what he shows, he builds a much larger and more complex one by what he infers but does not show.He has the skin of the bag, to be sure - here called the red circle. There's quite a lot within that circle. But every element of the narrative, indeed most actual movements, are triggered by events or governed by laws outside the circle, beyond what we see. What matters here is not what is within, but what billiards come zooming in from outer space.Yes, some of this comes from other films, primarily Hollywood western and gangster films. That's required because the world of any film is always drawn from those of other films. Its as if by showing some slight fragment (the former girlfriend listening at the door), he directs us to recall another bag which we know well through repetition.It is more important that we never know the cigarette girl - for instance - than anything else, or what happened to the third cat, or just what how internal affairs investigation was progressing.Actually a set of bags, because the power in these references is the ambiguity. This is truly masterful storytelling, importing complexity by the reference of omission, exactly opposite of Melville's whaling namesake. The business about `everyone being guilty' and the coolness are merely artifacts of the technique rather than the point.\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

            "content": "What a waste! As I was watching Melville's \"Red Circle\", I couldn't help but think of life's cruelty. One of the greatest comedic French actors had just started to show how naturally equipped he was for drama, his name was Bourvil but he made a first name out of his breakthrough performance, Andr\u00e9, as to distance himself from the lovable buffoon teaming up with De Fun\u00e8s. And yes, Andr\u00e9 Bourvil as Detective Mattei was mesmerizing without trying, his range of emotions is mostly composed of reactions and the conviction that no matter how hopeless the case is, he must move forward.And it's a waste that such a great actor had to leave the world just when we had a glimpse of his real talent, when he could have ruled French cinema for one decade or two. No, \"The Red Circle\" was his swan song, a final farewell to the screen he graced for thirty years. Cancer was already devouring him while he was making the film, but just as if he were impregnated by the toughness and stubbornness of his character, he kept going. And maybe that's what manhood is about, moving forward and acting according to his nature. And I think if there ever is a lesson Melville movies could teach us, is this idea of virility not as a synonym of toughness, strength, or a way with women (women have actually very secondary importance in his film) but tenacity, loyalty and principles.All the men that populate Melville's \"Red Circle\" are driven by a code, not exactly a code of honor, but close enough. Melville would have never dared to entrust his stories to lowlife criminals, he despised criminals with all his heart but acknowledged that gangsters were the best vehicle to values such as loyalty, duty, friendship, that Cinema made appealing. Two years later, a certain movie made by Francis Ford Coppola would prove him right, and Coppola would also suffer from the claim that he romanticized gangsters. Melville's gangsters are men who have been put in the wrong path and following their existential road, can't turn the clock back and have no other choice than trying to put within their dishonest racket, some bits of honor. You know you're not in the right side of the law, but you never try to betray your own codes, fair trade.And this is why the gangsters only kill when they're threatened, why they let the security guard alive during the heist, causing him to set the alarm, this is why the day before, when Vogel (Gian Maria Volonte) who just slipped away from Mattei, hides in the car driven by freshly released Corey (Alain Delon), he doesn't know that Corey saw him and let him do so. When the two men confront each other, a few lines are said and they're barely audible, the essential is in the eyes, the men know they can trust each other, and later, it pays off, when Vogel saves Corey from a tricky situation. What goes between these two recluse, taciturn men is the telepathic understanding that some things are better left unspoken, except the essential: the heist, in men's words: business, action.Melville made \"Bob le Flambeur\", one of the seminal caper films, but never has a heist looked so fluidly easy and fascinating to watch. There's not one single shot wasted, from the preparation to the execution, everything is perfectly oiled, and I loved the interpretation of Montand as Jansen, a former cop and sharpshooter, they needed one to deactivate the alarm from a thirty meters distance. And Melville is like the God-like manipulator of these figures; his voice sets the tone with a quotation of Buddha about a red circle, a sort of symbolic place where men with a 'history' together end up confronting each other. The line was made up, as it's always the case with Melville, but it serves a purpose, to leave us disillusioned about the heist, this is not what the film is about.We know it's doomed, and it's a masterstroke not to have added some artificial romance as the obligatory 'human factor'\u0085 what leads the men to their downfall is just a chain of events implicating Mattei, Corey's former partner (and obvious traitor) and Jean-Pierre P\u00e9rier as a man with his feet on the two sides. The mechanisms are all set-up from the start and at the end, we're just accepting the facts with resignation, Corey and Vogel had it coming but somewhat, we don't think they deserved it, and the last line coming from Jansen about the Police is ambiguous but gives a hint about his 'personal' motives. Sometimes, it's not just business. All men have history and it's the record they try to settle that drive their actions. Again, that was two years before Coppola.One of the most memorable lines of the film (given the film's overall quietness, any powerful line was a high spot) was: \"every man is guilty, we're born innocent but it never lasts\", says the Chief of Police to Mattei in the beginning and the end, Mattei walks away repeating \"all guilty\", everyone is part of the same game, it's all about deception and betrayal, crooks playing fair, cops cheating, and that's the only way to make these two worlds meet, and this is why there's always one raison to root for all the characters, not enough to make the endings sad, only realistic albeit cynical. That's what this smiling Buddha in the opening title seems to express: cynicism, disillusion, whatever you build will be wasted.And what a waste that these men lost after all these efforts but more importantly that Andr\u00e9 Bourvil died so shortly after the film, and that a director of Melville's caliber would die 3 years later after his second feature film with Delon \"Un Flic\". When real life is cruel, you'll find more relief in Melville's films.",

            "content": "Not only one of iconoclast Jean-Pierre Melville's most highly regarded films, but still hugely influential for many filmmakers, the lodestone for which a great number of crime features still rely heavily upon, name any quality heist film, and you will readily see echoes of Melville's iconic work. From the very first scene on the train with Vogel (Gian Maria Volont\u00e9) handcuffed to taciturn, cat-loving cop Mattei (Andr\u00e9 Bourvil) the maestro Melville creates a bleak, unflinchingly cold milieu, with little being said, the tension is absolute, and for reasons inexplicable your allegiances reside with Volont\u00e9, his guilt over his undisclosed crime somehow immaterial, and it is this moral ambiguity that features so strongly in 'Le Cercle Rouge'.There's a sublime metronomic quality at work in 'Le Cercle Rouge', a cool, relentless precision to Melville's flawless filmmaking, these Stoic characters inexorably drawn together by the merciless mechanics of crime, those that have a predilection, or talent to do it, Corey (Alain Delon) and Vogel's pragmatic need to elude capture with steely-eyed enigma Mattei's singularly pragmatic approach to stopping him makes for rarely less than thrilling cinema!While the immaculately tense, nerve-frying heist is meticulously executed with the filmmaker's signature flair for precision and verisimilitude, this is also where we see the curious re-birth of hopeless alcoholic Jansen (Yves Montand) for me, the film's most innately fascinating character, when we first see him he is almost entirely insensible due to a chronic case of the DTs; and yet, the ex-police sharpshooter is now the most integral member of this gang of recidivist criminals, once again there is a curious moral ambivalence at work, while Jansen is wholly reborn by crime, some of Mattei's actions seem positively nefarious in comparison!The word masterpiece is oft utilized but rarely is it more meritoriously earned than in Jean-Pierre Melville's uncommonly spare and sinuous crime classic 'Le Cercle Rouge'. A true marvel of razor-sharp cinematic understatement, like dead-eyed Jensen's perfectly calibrated rifle, crime cinema in the equally steady hands of a master craftsman is no less lethal a proposition. The final words must come from the film itself; 'Men are guilty. They come into the world innocent, but it doesn't last!...we ALL change...for the worse!",

            "content": "LE CERCLE ROUGE is a masterpiece, even if the ending is a bit too pat for my liking. First, we see Delon - in one of his finest roles ever - released from jail and he is quick to surmise that his wife has been cheating on him, and he knows with whom, too. Gian Maria Volonte manages to elude police inspector Andr\u00e9 Bourvil - a memorable against type performance from a comedian riddled with cancer and in his final role here -- and joins up with Delon in unusual but totally believable circumstances, allowing the two men to bond; and Yves Montand, a drunkard who was once a top police officer and crack shot, now suffering evils similar to those of Ray Milland in THE LOST WEEKEND (US 1945).Jean-Pierre Melville confessed in his autobriography that he had wanted to team up Delon and Belmondo in LE CERCLE ROUGE, but Belmondo felt that his role would be far less substantial than Delon's and decided not to appear in the movie. Looking at Volonte's part, which Melville initially intended for Belmondo, I think the latter was right but Melville also said that he planned to make it meatier if Belmondo came on board.In the end, the acting is exceptional all round, so Belmondo is not missed. Each of the three main characters is flawed in some way, both in terms of behaviour and of some mental ineptitude, and that is a theme in the movie, how everyone is limited by an invisible circle of personal limitations.As a police interrogator (brilliantly played by P\u00e9rier) points out, everyone is a sinner, even a youngster he booked on charges of drug consumption, to put pressure on his father, only to find out that the kid actually took drugs.The action sequences are first class (the heist is brilliant), the dialogue sharp and realistic, and photography remarkable in its simplicity and effectiveness.Ultimately, I expected a little bit more of a fight at the end, but it is a crisp and swift ending which shows the character played by Bourvil as he is: a man doing his job above all other considerations.LE CERCLE ROUGE also left me with the impression that the criminals are on both sides of the circle, but the ones on the side of the law have more power in their hands. I've seen this thought-provoking film some five times in the last 25 years, and will probably go back to it soon. Strongly recommended!",

            "content": "Just as in Rififi, the most compelling scene in the movie is the perfected silence of the jewel heist. The scene is masterful in its execution, each of the robbers having their own specialized job to perform, each one successfully combining their own unique talent towards the objective, and each one, until a month before, complete strangers.Many of the scenes play out very slowly. In fact, the opening scene is a long character introduction to both Corey and Vogel, as we see Corey getting released from prison and Vogel escaping capture on his way to prison. The two characters are then methodically brought together through fate at a roadside diner as Vogel hides inside the trunk of Corey's automobile. From this improbable break in, the two strangers agree to become partners to commit a perfected and precise jewel heist.However, to pull of this heist they must include the help of a third man named Jansen. Jansen is hired as the sure shot gun man. His inclusion into the mix was an interesting and desperate choice. At the time of his hire, Jansen is in a full battle with DT's and spent most of his day on his cot hallucinating over lizards, snakes and spiders. His transition from the disheveled and hallucinatory world of a William S. Burroughs dream into the steady handed and sober sharp shooter is a very quick one and perhaps the only real false moment of the film, but that's just me being extremely picky.One other mildly false note was that of the police inspector Mattei. At times he appeared to be brilliant in the ways of strong arming the right people or gathering information and waiting out for his escaped prisoner to make his move. Other times he appeared to be 10 years past retirement, especially at the beginning during Vogel's escape through the woods.I wonder if I got too much hidden meaning from the beginning of the movie. At the start of the movie, as the police car is speeding through the city, the first image we see is that of a red stop light. My first thought was that this may be the 'red circle' and that if I am to find a deeper meaning in the movie, perhaps it is that this car, or rather the people inside of it going through the red light, will be the ones who will 'stop' the jewel heist. Hmmmm? Perhaps the red circle refers to the triumvirate thieving ring? Perhaps it was the burning sled? No matter.It's a long movie, but it doesn't feel that way. The ending is a bit of a disappointment. It seemed too hurried for a movie that felt like such a delicious slow burn. 9/10Clark Richards",

            "content": "There were heist movies before this one, and indeed the likes of Rififi were an obvious influence on it - but The Red Circle is more than just another entry in an overpopulated genre and with this film, director Jean-Pierre Melville has managed to create something that both thrills on the surface and gives its audience something to think about. Being cool is just as important a feature of the modern crime movie as guns and gangsters, and Melville delivers that with this film in droves; the tone of the film is very relaxed too and Melville allows the bulk of the film to bubble under the cool exterior. The story has a number of angles but the central character is Corey - a thief who is released from prison. His release coincides with the escape of infamous murderer Vogel, who slips from under the nose of Police Commissioner Mattei during a train ride. The first thing Corey does upon release is steal some money from his former boss Rico, and the second thing he does is recruit Vogel and a sharpshooter to help him pull of a jewel heist. But Rico and the police are hot on the thieves' tails...The film is bolted together by four excellent central performances. Alain Delon is calm and calculating as the film's anti-hero, while Gian Maria Volont\u00e8 looks formidable in his role as the escaped murderer. Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier is good also as a dubious club owner, while the real standout performance comes from Andr\u00e9 Bourvil in his role as the police commissioner. The film runs at almost two and a half hours and is not exactly a thrill ride. However, the director keeps things interesting by keeping the action focused on the important elements. The film does feature crime film stapes such as shootings, but they are kept to a minimum. The first two thirds of the movie are really just building up to the suspenseful heist scene towards the end. Rififi was most famous for its heist sequence - an intricately designed scene in which nobody speaks a word. The heist in this film is similar in that it is also wordless, and I have to say that I preferred the scene in Rififi; but Melville's skill in direction and the calm and composed way that it plays out make good of it. The film boils down to an exciting climax that rounds it all off nicely. Overall, this might not appeal to all crime film fans as the action is more than a little bit slow; but The Red Circle is an excellent film and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.",

It feels very long.  Longer than it's two hours and twenty minutes.  You become aware after a while that you're watching a film that needs a tighter script and better editing.  The plot is also full of holes. It takes something greater than the normal suspension of disbelief to buy the coincidence of Gian-Maria Volonte's escaped criminal happening to hide in the boot of the car just purchased by newly released ex-con Alain Delon. And what happened to the subplot of the mafia boss chasing Delon for revenge?  It looks as though it's going to go somewhere near the end and then that whole side of the story just disappears.  And what makes Volonte suddenly turn up at the end to try and save Delon?  It just doesn't make any sense.  As for the philosophy! The \"all men are born innocent, but it doesn't last long\" speeches are laughably silly.  But I don't think they're meant to be.The upside?  Early morning Marseilles and late night Paris look wonderful. The acting, especially from Yves Montand and Andre Bourvil, is first rate. The robbery sequence is exciting (though I've seen better).  And Alain Delon.  My god he's good in this.  I've never seen the man have such presence.  You just can't take your eyes off him.  Melville never really made a true classic (and I think I've now seen all of his main contenders).  But I suspect that if you could cut and paste together bits of Le Doulos, Le Samourai, Le Cercle Rouge and the tremendous opening scene of Un Flic, you'd have one of the greatest gangster movies of all time.",

            "content": "I guess Melville intended this movie to be the definition of the cool; it has the cool approach of the late '60s/ early '70s thrillers\u0097the same discrete quirkiness. LE CERCLE ROUGE, a bitter and fatalist story, is also the playground of Delon, Bourvil, Volont\u00e9 and Montand in defining roles.Bourvil is a cop who has in his flat three cats and a daily routine. Delon is a hoodlum. Montand is a sick, failed cop. Volont\u00e9 plays an escaped suspect. LE CERCLE ROUGE is of course far above a heist movie; Melville uses his techniques \u0096long wordless detailed depictions of every step of the heist, etc.. Yet this particular action drama is far better than his other movies\u0097and it's very unlikely them by being so much better. The look of LE CERCLE ROUGE is very peculiar to Melville, very Melvillian.Delon was sharp and cool; Bourvil brings his craft, and Montand makes maybe the finest role of this movie; his performance has an unexpected warmth .On the other hand, the characters are barely sketched, no more than strictly necessary, and are personae. Or masks; yet the portrayal is inspired, economic but suggestive.Another of the movies that prove Delon to be a good, a very good actor; and the fact that he's not a genius does not imply that he ought to be despised as a fourth rate actor. He's good, he can bear the proximity of a Bourvil and Montand.Only ten yrs. before LE CERCLE ROUGE, Melville was doing, towards the end of the '50s, a boring overlong insipid noir pastiche (starring himself)\u0097and after only a decade, here he is, in full form, with this quite amazing action drama. Stylistically, it's a success.Before seeing LE CERCLE ROUGE, I was not a Melvillian fan; now I guess I rather am one.LE CERCLE ROUGE is a drama\u0097namely, an action drama, one of the most exigent genres.

            "content": "First let me say I'm a fan of Melville. His compositions of a frame, his use of silence, his held shots, but THE RED CIRCLE is not one of Melville's better films. Melville was always a minimalist, he was never a director who had much to say, 60% of his films were always... silence. So a 100 minute movie for Melville, was really only 40 mins of movie with 60 mins of style. His best movies, Le Doulous and Le Samourai, stay right around this 100 minute mark, coming in at 108 and 105 minutes respectfully. And at that length, they take Melville's minimalism and style as far as it can go, without slumping into tedium or filler. At a 140 minutes Red Circle, falls headlong into tedium and filler. It is Melville's emptiest movie, with his customary 40 mins of story now horrifically stretched into two hours and 20 minutes. There's a lot to like in pieces about this movie; the train break, the trunk scene, but they are few and far between.Two nearly identical long scenes of the inspector feeding his cats, the laughably ineffective hallucination scene, and the robbery itself, unlike his earlier works... are flawed uses of silences. Melville, perhaps believing his own hype, takes it too far, they are tedious, tedious scenes. He tries to outdo Asphalt Jungle and Rififi and he fails miserably. And even edited down substantially the movie would still fail, because the 40mins of story that Le Doulos and Samourai had... were brilliant, RED CIRCLE is not. While Melville did the script for all three of these films, the first two were sourced from acclaimed novels of the time. Here in RED CIRCLE Melville goes it alone, making up his own story, and it shows, in a confused and muddled film that ends as poorly and as unconvincingly as any film in recent memory.All in all, not Melville's finest hour. So have to side here with Bluesdoctor, Bornjaded, Mike, and Steve and give this one a fail. ** out of ****.",

So, while director Melville and the actors did great jobs, it all seems like a case of D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Because of this, I had a hard time giving this excellent film a higher score.The one unusual aspect of the film is how the crooks get together. Instead of the usual means, Vogel escapes from prison and just happens to meet up with Corey, a career criminal just released from prison! Both are a good match but having them both work in parallel for much of the film until they meet was a clever touch. Apart from that, as expected much of the movie concerns the meticulous details in planning and executing the crime. I also appreciated how the film showed the crooks in such a cold and detached manner--something relatively common in French crime films but rare among American films until recent years.Overall, extremely well-crafted and worth seeing...if you don't mind that it seems a tad repetitive, you'll see some fine acting, direction and a lot of great tension.",

We were spared all the practising that must have been necessary in order for the guys to co-ordinate their dark deeds.  What a team they made.  And that excapee!!!  How more dangerous can one man look....who was that eyebrow-hooded man?  It would terrify me to sleep next to him. The super cool ways of Alain Delon as he sits in the field, having done do=nuts around the wet field, and waits for the convict to come out of the trunk was a knock-out.  But why did we see him swerving all around the field?  He already knew he had a passenger, and knew his guns were in the trunk, readily available.  The trick of throwing the guy with the gun First a cigarette, then a lighter....which the guy had to in realtime catch with the 2nd hand, dropping the gun, was inspired.The failure of the watchman to hear the activities of the cat burglars was a little hard to believe, but maybe the security guy just didn't want to believe the noises he was hearing meant intruders.Having the police equally complicit in the crime planning, but also showing the cat-tending old detective as morally pure was quite a study in contrasts.  At first, the sight of 3 busloads of cops mounting the hill to search for the convict gave you a Keystone cop feeling, but then the equally ridiculous sight of the convict meticulously taking off his clothes, folding them and throwing them to the other side of the river.....with the sounds of the dogs in the background!!!!!  Why?  To intensify the suspense, I suppose. This film ...reengineered...was considered so good that the Brattle Theater in Cambridge just showed it for a full week (this from a theater that shows an old movie 2 or 3 days, tops).  Well worth it just for the scenes of the talented detective feeding his cats, and the loyalty shown him by his boss to the minister....not what you'd get in corporate America.

A quote then appears on-screen: \"When men, even unknowingly, are to meet one day, whatever may befall each, whatever their diverging paths, on the said day, they will inevitably come together in the red circle.\" Suffused in a mood of fatalism, \"Circle\" stars Gian Maria Volante as Vogel, a murderer who has recently escaped police custody. He hooks up with Corey (Alain Delon), a master criminal. The two form a fast friendship and immediately conspire to rob a jewellery store with the aid of one of Vogel's acquaintances, an alcoholic ex-cop named Jansen (Yves Montand). The trio's gathering is portrayed as something fated, preordained, each drawn to a \"red circle\" like a ship to the eye of a whirlpool. Also sucked into the film's plot is Mattei, a police detective hot on the trail of Vogel. \"All men are guilty,\" Mattei says. Throughout the film he will be mirrored to Corey, hunter and hunted, criminal and Law, different only by degrees.Most of Melville's films are rifts on American genre cinema. \"Circle\" sets about borrowing moments and iconography from Western heist and gangster flicks. It then climaxes with an exhilarating twenty five minute, wordless heist sequence, perhaps designed to showcase Melville's surgical camera work.\"Classical cinema has to do with heroes and modern cinema with grubs,\" Melville would say in interviews, before explaining that he refuses to abide by such distinctions. Like most of Melville's films, \"Circle\" thus seems preoccupied with delving into the nature of evil, and how old fashioned values (honour, chivalry, loyalty) may be possessed by \"villains\" and lacked by \"heroes\". So whilst Melville's \"Army of Shadows\" blurs the distinction between Resistance Fighter and Nazi, portraying both as monsters, \"Circle\" portrays Mattei stooping to deceit to kill the film's three criminals, deaths which result in the collapse of a sixteen-year-old boy, who may or may not survive. Without knowing it, Mattei embodies his own catchphrase: \"all men are guilty.\"Unlike Mattei, Melville's criminals adhere to personal codes. They adopt chivalrous masks, have codes of honour, and late in the film it is the criminal's code of silence which, granted by Vogel, saves Mattei's life. The name \"Jean-Pierre Melville\" is itself a codename, signifying both an authentic personality and a mask.Melville's symbolism is simple but subtle throughout. An early scene, for example, in which Vogel shatters a window in an attempt to escape the Law, is repeated and reversed later on (he intrudes upon Corey and Mattei). Elsewhere a green traffic light becomes a red circle, a stop signal which the police ignore. The film itself is rife with circles, from steel handcuffs (which point to the connections between criminal and law - the ambiguity between men), to circular cigarette burns, peepholes and the orders for \"rings\" placed around fugitives. For Melville, lines of separation never seem straight or straightforward. He would direct one more film before his death: 1972's \"Un Flic\".7.9/10 - See \"Army of Shadows\".",

            "content": "Le Cercle Rouge is the second last film by the brilliant French filmmaker (God) Jean Pierre Melville and was released in 1970. In the film, we follow French criminal Corey (Alain Delon) after he gets released from prison and has an intention to never again return. However, Corey is quickly pulled back into the underworld after an encounter with escaped murderer Vogel (Gian Maria Volont\u00e9) who he befriends. Along the way, Corey and Vogel meet up with a former policeman and a current alcoholic Jansen (Yves Montand), and together they plot an intricate jewel heist, one last score to get out of the crime world for good. All the while, Police Commissioner Mattei (Bourvil), who was the one to lose custody of Vogel, is determined to find him and imprison him.I've spent a lot of time researching Melville as a person watching numerous interviews and reading tons of articles. The quote that I think stuck in my mind the most was Melville's response to what he thinks about gangsters. Melville called them \"pathetic losers\". That quote gave me a whole new perspective on the entity of Melville's filmography and gave me clarity on what\nMelville is really saying with his many gangster flicks.Because in Le Cercle Rouge we don't see characters. We see placeholders. Throughout the runtime, the slick, stylised coolness of the main cast gets contradicted on numerous occasions, making them come off as foolish and stupid, injecting Melville's stance on the patheticness of those who chose to engrain themselves in the crime world.The film's title The Red Circle apparently refers to a saying of the Buddha that men who are destined to meet will eventually meet, no matter what.What does the red circle have to symbolise. Ultimately to me, what Melville is trying to say here is that all evil will eventually meet. It's fate brings all of these pathetic characters together and it is that same fate that destroys them later in the film, in the red circle of life and death. It's a never ending spectrum of death and meaninglessness. Life, death, everything between occurs inside the red circle.Le Cercle Rouge is just as stylish as Le Samoura\u00ef, if not more so. The film also includes one of my favourite frames in cinematic history, this shot, of our three leads driving and having a conversation. I find it absolutely incredible that in all of Melville's gangster films, the country of France looks different. Obviously because they aren't all set in the same town, but these gangster worlds surely can't be so different from one another. The police in Le Samoura\u00ef operate completely different to the police here. The underworld in Bob Le Flambeur looks completely different to what it looks like here. The nightclubs in Le Doulos feel different to here. I think personally, it's this film's incredible use of blue that really separates it from Melville's filmography. Le Samoura\u00ef is covered in grey to view Jef Costello's view on the world, but Le Cercle Rouge is covered in this blue tint. I think this ultimately not just represents Le Cercle Rouge as a much different film than Melville's other films but also goes further into showing the lifelessness found inside this gangster world.With exception to arguably Melville's two war films (Le Silence De La Mer and Army Of Shadows), I'd argue that Le Cercle Rouge is Melville's best directed film. Not a single moment is missing tension, not a frame doesn't feel damp, not a scene doesn't feel like it's missing significance and not earned. Melville doesn't feel the need to cut away from conversations, to awkward, unnecessary, shots, I think this creates such an amazing sense of flow in these talks and make them feel incredibly intimate.Le Cercle Rouge is a triumph. The ones who say this film is missing meaning are ether ignoring it or choosing not to look into it. It's an expertly written, brilliantly acted, tightly directed and wonderfully shot masterpiece, another from the long list from Melville.",

The subtle background jazz is by Eric DeMarsan; very cool.  The blue-toned photography is by Henri Decae; icy. The cast is exceptional and Alain Delon is the king of the trench coat.  Very smooth.

So he adds lots of padding. There is, for example, a scene where the police inspector comes home and feeds his cats. Not only is the scene pointless in terms of advancing the story but it's repeated in its entirety later in the film. The dialog is sparse, with Melville relying instead on action to tell his story, which sounds great except that \"action\" means extended scenes of people walking and driving in silence. The heist sequence is the highlight, although it's been done better in a number of other films, including \"Rififi.",

It's French, arty, under-played to the point of agony, and ultimately downbeat. But viewed from the vantage of 37 years in the future, it's also just a bit vacuous, pretentious and unsatisfying.Others have summarized the story, but I don't think anyone has pointed out the dramatic flaw at the heart of this film: the lead characters, Corey and Vogel, really don't deserve what they get. They play square within their code, never harm anyone who didn't ask for it, and show great courage and initiative. Moreover, Corey in particular is victimized by his former gangland 'friend,' who stole his girl and who repeatedly tries to have him killed, apparently just because he (Corey) dared to 'borrow' a few thousand francs. These are guys who really ought to be due for a break! Instead, things go far worse for them than they really need to, within the logic of the story.One might contend that this is the whole point: that the real villains never get caught; that they collude with the police as needed, sell out their friends, and always come out on top. But that's not shown either. Corey's old gangster friend is not shown colluding with the police. Nor is he shown gloating over his victory. In fact, after materializing several times when he's needed, he's nowhere to be seen at the conclusion, leaving a dramatic tension (his feud with Corey) entirely unresolved!Nonetheless, I'd say this film is well worth seeing for its beautiful photography, its slow, deliberate pacing, its great deadpan performances, its elaborate heist sequence, and its encapsulation of the art-film style of the late 1960s.",

            "content": "Jean-Pierre Meville's 1970 film LE CERCLE ROUGE (The Red Circle) is a crime caper based on the interplay of several initially unacquainted individuals. As Melville's fake quote from the Buddha that serves as the intertitle goes, \"When men, even unknowingly, are to meet one day, whatever may befall each, whatever the diverging paths, on the said day, they will inevitably come together in the red circle.\" These men are Corey (Alain Delon), who has just been released from prison, Vogel (Gian Maria Volont\u00e9), who has escaped from his police guard before he could even reach prison, and the alcoholic marksman Jansen (Yves Montand). In the jewelry heist that these desperate lowlifes plan together, they are pursued by the detective Mattei (Andr\u00e9 Bourvil).Meville's pacing is extremely slow -- it has to be in order to ensure that the audience understands the complex relationships of who knows who -- and suffice it to say, people who don't already like mid-century French auteur films may find this intolerable. However, if you are a fan of the French New Wave, you may find Meville's ability to sustain suspense a delicious torture. This viewer was on the edge of his seat the whole time waiting to find out what would happen next. Melville's visual aesthetic is also consistently attractive: muted colours, careful shots of the characters faces at a couple of key moments, and a striking contrast between the quiet world of these criminals and the bustle of everyday Paris.I must admit that I was prepared for some disappointment, as this was Meville's third film of criminal conspiracy in three years (preceded by the hit-man drama Le Samourai and the French Resistance saga L'Arm\u00e9e des ombres). However, in spite of Meville's continued interest in the genre, LE CERCLE ROUGE offers something fresh and individual. There are a couple of intertextual looks back to LE SAMOURAI in the sets, but Meville shows how talented his favourite actors were by having a couple of good guys in that film play baddies in this one and vice versa.All in all, this is not a must-see, life-changing film, but certainly a classic film that has stood the test of time and well worth seeing.",

He regarded it as his magnum opus although for this viewer at any rate that distinction belongs to 'L'Arm\u00e9e des Ombres'. He jokingly denied ever directing the disappointing 'Un Flic' and died considering 'Le Cercle Rouge' to be his final film.What is certain is that in watching this stylish masterpiece of crime cinema, described by it's director as \"a digest of all the thriller-type films I have made\", one is witnessing a master of his craft in full flow and at the top of his game. The editing is deft, especially in the extended heist sequence, Henri Decae's muted blue/grey palette is mesmerising, Eric de Marsan's jazzy scoring is spot on and the performances top notch.The most interesting piece of casting, ostensibly against type, is that of Bourvil whose deadpan style suits his character perfectly. His performance is even more praiseworthy in that he was obliged to use morphine thoughout filming to kill the pain of the cancer that was to claim his life a month before the film's release. Alain Delon is again wonderfully impassive, Yves Montand quietly steals all of his scenes and a well-dubbed Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 plays the role originally intended for Jean-Paul Belmondo.Although it is generally considered that the jewel robbery is a nod to 'Rififi', Melville claimed to have had the idea of a wordless heist before Jules Dassin came to France in 1953. The fate of the thieves however again shows the undeniable influence of Huston's 'Asphalt Jungle' on Melville's work.Melville once expressed doubts as to where his films would be in fifty years time.

Sometimes things happened for no clear reason.\nPeople have already commented on the artifices and devices that brought the two main characters together.  But how did they manage to plan and execute such a complicated heist, which clearly required a deep knowledge concerning the security devices in the jewellery salon?   Was all the necessary information conveyed to Corey at the beginning of the film, by the bent prison guard? That hardly seems likely.   There was virtually no character development and it was difficult to engender any sense of empathy with the protagonists.  People behaved oddly at times.   Whey did Vogel take off his clothes to cross the stream?  And afterwards even put his tie back on?   How did the Montand character, in the grip of delerium tremens when first encountered, manage to instantly turn his life around?At times I found myself chuckling.   At the duck-like waddle of the French traffic cop.  At the exaggerated swagger of the gangsters.  I doubt Melville intended these as humourous high-points.  People have praised the cinematography.  Yes, some of the camera aspects and points of view were interesting.  But perhaps I was unlucky. The print that I viewed was muddy and dank.    The mood and style of the movie was curious.

            "content": "I have yet to see a film by Melville that lives up to his reputation. This is an overlong noir film without any noir. In fact, there are two films here: the first hour, which could easily have been condensed into ten minutes with all important elements in tact, is basically Le Samourai, that is, Alain Delon posing in a raincoat and not saying much. Delon is wasted. He has no interesting lines, and is allowed only one expression - deadpan, earnest - the raincoat puts in a better performance. In the second hour, a different film starts up, but it's basically the jewellery heist from Rififi, right down to the washed-up old criminal who gets back in form. So, two hours of heist film clich\u00e9s without a speck of humour or irony to redeem it. We've seen it all before: the guy released from prison to do another job, putting together the team (with specialists of course), the surreptitious casing of the joint, the ingenious methods of tackling hi-tech security devices - they even had a gun in a violin case for chrissakes. Then there's the usual unintentionally dislikable cop who slows things down - though I think we were supposed to like him because we are shown him feeding his cats - twice, in identical scenes. There are contemplative moments - but not many of these either. Basically it is slow. When someone ascends a staircase we watch him go all the way up. When they take a lift we are shown the numbers flashing all the way to the top, as if it is supposed to get more interesting the higher it goes. There were lots of little artificially created moments meant to heighten tension...is the cop going to look in the car boot...? he heads towards it...he considers it...but oh...he turns away at the last second. None of it is good enough. There are no highlights, few memorable scenes, no beautiful images. And - worst of all - no women to offset the relentless masculine over-earnestness. The only moment of interest was a brief wordless scene where a bunny-girl in the nightclub gives Delon a flower. She has a sympathetic look - and in my desperation for something worth latching onto, I took some solace from it. Unless you like warmed-up pulp fiction, a complete waste of over two hours.",

            "content": "\"All men are guilty,\" says the chief of the police. \"They're born innocent but it doesn't last.\" Add this bit of nihilism to Jean-Pierre Melville's fascination with the idea of the crook's code of honor and you have Le Cercle Rouge. This code of honor among crooks, however, is not simply a clich\u00e9; it's a figment of the imagination even when film moralists -- realistic moralists by their viewpoint, romantic moralists by most others' -- began to make movies on the subject. Their theme is that it isn't what one does, but how one does it. We most often wind up with stories all about experienced men with their own sense of honor, stories where fate, fatalism and the code run things. For most of humanity, except screen writers and movie directors, this would seriously get in the way of living one's life, raising one's children and being a good friend. This mannered fatalism is something of a self-indulgent notion. Le Cercle Rouge is, in my view, a classic film for people who may secretly enjoy the adventure of just missing the last bus home. But where Melville's Le Samourai - Criterion Collection, in my opinion, is style dominating story, Le Cercle Rouge manages the great trick of combining style with a strong story and with compelling actors. The point of the movie, in my view, is nonsense...but the movie itself is a first-class experience. Melville's hopeless tale of three crooks -- Cory (Alain Delon), Vogel (Gian-Maria Volonte) and Jansen (Yves Montand) - is based on a bit of wisdom which is, maybe, attributed to the Buddha: That all men who are destined to meet, will...along with their destiny they cannot change. Maybe, because some believe Melville himself came up with the wording if not the thought. Either way, we know right at the start that this movie will not end happily, will depend upon fate and coincidence to set things up for us, and will leave us recalling the nihilistic philosophies we discovered and loved when we were in high school. Once Corey and Vogel meet and then gather in the unique talents of Jansen, we are off on a one-way ride to rob an exclusive, heavily protected jewelry story on the Place Vendome. The tension arises because we not only know the French police are after Vogel, we also realize that some determined crooks are after Corey. The great pleasure of the movie, for me, came from admiring the work that Delon, Volonte and Montand brought to their characters, and the intelligent ruthlessness that Andre Bouvril brought to his character, the police captain Mattei. Melville hooked me as he developed these characters and their own situations; he built me up emotionally and then released me when he brought me to appreciate their probable fate and let me see see it happen. Melville establishes his set pieces -- the escape from the train, the escape from the woods, the later shootout in the woods, the meetings with Mattei and a man who refuses to inform -- with intriguing possibilities. He builds tension in all these cases by taking his time; a rare trait in movie making and an even rarer trait now. And Melville takes the time to build up Mattei as an individual. Mattei is a rueful, experienced man. He's a loner. He has a set routine when he returns to his apartment -- he greets his three cats affectionately, he draws his bath and while the tub is filling he sets out food for them. I don't know who Mattei is destined to meet, but I hope it's someone who likes cats. Nihilism is always fashionable among some creative people and some critics. In most cases, I think it's a much harder task to set nihilism aside and to simply live one's life without damaging too many people. (And that's even more challenging to show compellingly in a film.) Le Cercle Rouge is a movie which, for me, tells me little, but it is in its own way, I think, a beautifully put together film.",

            "content": "Jean-Pierre Melville doesn't need a lot of words. Aside from an occasional jazzy score not even a lot of music is required to enhance what is seen on screen - and that's engaging enough if the writer/director succeeds in setting the viewer in the proper mood. Melville's French nouvelle vague re-invention of the gangster genre relies solely on building suspense with following his protagonists around in long takes one after the other, piquing our interest in the characters, their motivations, their goals, and while their backgrounds stay mysterious there's always a surprise in store up ahead. The plot is much more straightforward than in other Melville thrillers like \"Le Doulos\" or \"Bob Le Flambeur\", but \"Le Cercle Rouge's\" big forte is to highlight all the different angles of the four key players: The suave aristocratic jewel thief (Alain Delon), who defines the term \"cool\", the murderer and escaped ex-convict (Gian Maria Volont\u00e9), the former police sharpshooter with an alcohol problem (Yves Montand) and finally the police superintendent (Bourvil in a surprisingly un-comedic role) on the other side of the law. The paths of the criminals cross in order to carry out an elaborate heist, but in fact they are just moving closer together to find themselves in the inevitable red circle, where the fatalistic conclusion awaits.What sets \"Un Cercle Rouge\" apart from other entries of the genre is that we are engulfed with a uniquely elegant French-American flair that surrounds the Parisian dark alleys, where a perfect crime feels chic - if one can only get away with it. Indeed it is mainly a question of style what keeps us on the edge of our seats, and for those who enjoy the aesthetics of film this cinematic composition as a whole surpasses many of the works of Melville's Hollywood idols he tried to imitate and endow with a French twist. Highly enjoyable!",

            "content": "Jean-Pierre Melville is famous in certain circles for leading Hitchcock to voluntarily give up making crime-dramas with a little film called Bob le Flambeur. Whatever majesty was present in his early work has truly been honed to a fine edge in Le Cercle Rouge...Those familiar with the many masterpieces Melville has crafted during the 20th Century will know how much of a formidable duo he and Alain Delon make, specifically with gems like Le Samurai. Well, the team are at it again. Melville and Delon guide the spectator through this sprawling crime/drama/heist film (in truth, it is the work of an auteur so genre is not so easily applied) like a confident instructor leading a graceful waltz.Although technically being before the Nouvelle Vague, Melville is very much a vital part of that vital movement. Godard citing his films as a huge influence in breaking away from the tired techniques of cinema du papa. Although one could group him in with other filmmakers of that time and place, Melville's films still retain a unique and authorial style and tone, all of his own. An aesthetic that is very much present in Le Cercle Rouge.This movie is a great example that you don't need fast paced editing, snappy dialogue and cool soundtrack to make a heist interesting, look out for a 20 minute master-class in tension. Using no dialogue or music for the whole segment. A class, some might say (myself included) that the likes of Steven Soderbergh should have attended.One of the greatest talents in cinema, one who should be more widely recognised as one of film's geniuses.If this tickles your fancy then I will highly recommend Le Samurai, Bob le Flambeur (as have been mentioned) and L'arm\u00e9e des Ombres.",

We have a movie that does not try to convey most if any of the story or the characters through dialog. I would even go so far to say that there is a lot left in the dark - or for the viewer to guess and make up their mind.There is a scene where cats are being fed. What would you make of that scene? What is this supposed to tell us? It is a character beat - it is something that does not further the story or conclude anything. Still (no pun intended) it does help the set the mood - it does continue in the tradition of what came before it.The pacing is something that will not float everybodys boat. The silence (a heist scene is particularly crazy/amazing) is one thing - the time it takes to show us things another. Contrasting that is the music in a club. Which is quite pacy and really contradicts the tempo of the movie and the characters themselves.A very dark and grim affair ... which does not care about good or bad - about morality, when it comes to cops and robbers. No one is safe (no pun intended), everyone has a dark side. What is the difference between the characters? Is there any? And what motivates them really? All open for the viewer to get - having Alain Delon in the main role and other good actors support him elevate the movie. And Delon is quite the household name - everyone knows him it seems ... justifiably so.",

Oh, did I mention it is French? It is, with subtitles. That should have been my first clue... Thank goodness there is little talking so I can play poker more easily while this thing drones on and on...The movie was well lit and well shot. That's about the best I can say about it. Is it always overcast in France? The outdoor scenes lacked contrast due to the flat lighting from the sky but, overall, it was easy enough to see things as they plodded along. Slowly but slowly.I have not made it to the end although I expect I will since I have gotten 90 minutes into it just to see if anything ever happens but it is fight to not stop it and move on to an episode of Hot in Cleveland. At least that is interesting and has some laughs. This is just plain dragging... This supposed to be a heist movie. I wish they would steal something before the movie is over. Please steal SOMETHING!

The three plan a big coup by breaking into a big jewelry store at Place Vendome, and are being chased by a grim inspector and rivals from the underworld. Le Cercle Rouge by the french Nouvelle Vague pioneer and Film Noir master Jean-Pierre Melville is a big, gloomy gangster film about friendship and loyalty, about guilt and betrayal. Centered around this precisely planned break-in, and with a famous heist-scene that is 30 minutes long and without any dialogue, it is the masterpiece in the championship of the neo-noir crime film.It is not unusual that 10 minutes will pass before we hear the first words of dialogue in a Melville film, often being already over 30 scenes into the story. His cinema is one of a grey cinematography that loves the blue monochrome night, when reality is at it's most poetic and self-knowledge most acute, faces sculptured by light and shadow, the modelage of time and silence. It is a cinema of few words, words replaced by gestures, close-ups of silent faces, and just the flicker of thoughts. These faces all tell the same melvillian story: they are all marked by fatality, and death is their destiny.Siddhartha Gautama: the Buddha, drew a circle with a piece of red chalk and said: \"When men, even unknowingly, are to meet one day, whatever may befall each, whatever the diverging paths, on the said day, they will inevitably come together in the red circle.\" (Epigraph to Le Cercle Rouge)In Le Cercle Rouge, like in most of Melville's films, his protagonists cannot escape their fates- they all die, being shot from behind, cold and trist, and the film ends. They are noble on their way to death, not rearing up anxiously like deadly injured animals, but facing it calmly and composed. Gestures and habits become the unchanged rituals of survival: lighting a cigarette, dressing stylishly, adjusting the hat, putting on gloves and driving the car. The life of a gangster consists of ceremonial acts, and the melvillian gangster rises above ordinary people by dying in dignity.Melville casted actors like Alain Delon and Yves Montand on their credibility in the loneliness, betrayal, violence, and male friendship of solitary silence. His is an entirely male cinema, and his protagonists move on a path of self-destruction or self-sacrifice, it is a melancholy realm of beautiful characters dispossessed by fate. And it is this what distinguishes Melville's films from just being crime movies, because they culminate in fundamental feelings and universal emotions. Thus, in addition to the solid structure and crime-plot of his stories, Melville always strived to show the torments of men exposed to their fate.Melville's morality is surprising and demanding: there can only be an absolute sincerity, though it often manifests itself in unlikely ways and tortuous paths. Having been a resistance-fighter in his youth, Melville's life and work stays true to the Resist\u00e0nce. Nobody in his universe seems to know that the war is over, and they do not waste one thought on laying their arms down. Their war is never over. A solidarity connects the typical protagonists of his cinema, especially the bad boys, the scapegraces, the hard-boiled guys of the underworld, and the fighters of La Resit\u00e0nce. A solidarity due to their code of honor, their existence in the underground, the precision of their practices and their knowledge. But also due to their relation to commitment and betrayal, their ability to endure pain and kill each other in the name of morality and silence.Alain Delon gave his best performances in his three films with Melville, with his talents and features being perfectly led and distilled within this unique actor-director symbiose. Unforgotten is his extremely focused and chilling performance as ice-cold and detached killer in 'Le Samourai' (read my review here), the most acknowledged film in Melville's oeuvre. With no visible feelings and thoughts, but just delivering the lonely routine of a killer- yet with a streak of vertigo hinting at a personality disorder making him perceive the world from behind a somnambule veil- Delon was devoted to Melville after playing 'Le Samourai'. His performance in Le Cercle Rouge is even better though, without the vertigo-effect even more minimalistic and austere in the sense of American 'underacting', being an almost abstract figure within the narrative construction, but with his typical unmoved and anonymous compassion.Le Cercle Rouge also has an excellent jazz-crime score composed by Eric Demarsan, who collaborated with the great Francois de Roubaix (Le Samourai) before. It underlines the cool chic and fatalism with modern jazz sounds and the typical European 60s & 70s melancholy in its themes. Melville used film music in the most sophisticated sense, to deliberately sculpture the silence that dominates his films, to form feelings and thoughts with sound when they just flicker on screen.Jean-Pierre Melville's passionate admiration of the American cinema of the 30's and 40's is the fundament for his cinematic determination, but he took it further and perfectionized it. It's beautiful to see the French-American circle close with contemporary directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Jim Jarmusch referring to Melville as one of their major influences.\nIt is a cinema fallen out of time, slow-paced, chic, in absence of modern chaos and cacophony, but do yourself a favor to discover it and shed a tear over what we have lost, and the unavoidable fatality of everything.\nSaliha Enzenauer / Vinyl Writers",

            "content": "The premise of 1970 heist film \"Le Cercle Rouge\" is a violent and unlikely convergence of men in 'the red circle', as spelled out by the (fake) Buddha quote at the open of the film. We meet Corey, a thief just released from prison, and Vogel, a convicted killer who has escaped from the supervision of Mattei, a police detective.Corey helps Vogel out in, presumably, a show of sympathy for a man even more desperate than him. One of the greatest elements of the movie is that the characters never state their backgrounds or motivations explicitly, and instead the viewer is given clues to piece them together on their own. I constructed my own back story for Corey and Vogel, but the beauty of the movie is it's no less valid than anyone else's, and with all of the characters given such an intriguing ambiguity, just enough details provided to make you wonder, the mysterious nature of the characters is definitely a highlight.This has one of the longest setups of any heist movie I've seen, but it's interesting enough. Unfortunately, I found that the heist was not particularly realistic and their scheme not all that brilliant, and this really hurt the movie for me. Compared to say, \"Rififi\", this heist just lacks that stunning, ingenious nature. Perhaps that was intended, as the criminals are portrayed as desperate, wounded people rather than criminal masterminds, but combined with other plot holes (Vogel's bizarrely slow escape, covering what seems to just be a few feet in the time it takes Mattei to go to town and assemble an army of pursuers) the details of the story just kept popping up at me as unrealistic and unimpressive.The movie is shot quite nicely, and it's lack of a soundtrack through much of the film adds nicely to the bleak look and feel. It's still a good movie, but it's not quite the chess game of a heist movie I'd been hoping for when I'd heard this movie spoken of so highly.",

            "content": "\"Le Cercle Rouge\" reminds me interestingly of the three musketeers, as I watched a jewelry heist planned and executed by discharged prisoner Corey (Alain Delon), escaped suspect Vogel (Gian maria Volonte) and alcoholic ex-cop sharp-shooter Jansen (Yves Montand). Unfortunately, the fourth is not D'Artagnan, but a doggedly persistent, and often-unscrupulous police Mattei (Andre Bourvil) hot on their trail.The three musketeers association comes from the impeccable trust among thieves, a sort of unspoken code of honor so strong that in a scene close to the final climax when Corey goes off to a fateful rendezvous with a prospective fence and Vogel is shown in disturbed reflections, you would automatically see that as concern for Corey's safety whereas in a clich\u00e9-ridden Hollywood flick of today, you would see that as a signal of plot twist of betrayal.\"Cool\" is a grossly overused word in describing Delon in director Jean-Pierre Melville's Polar films, but then general consensus is that he is coolest in Le Samourai. I guess that's partly because he's a loner there. In Le Cercle Rouge, he has to share the spotlight with the other two and, as one review has it, they are continuously trying to out-cool one another. Perpetually in their signature trench coats, these characters don't talk much, and do so only to communicate information, not emotions. They just don't reveal their emotions. There is one exception, in Montand's first appearance (well into the middle of the movie), disheveled and shaken with a hangover. But then, in the very next scene, his rendezvous with Corey, he is so meticulously dressed and composed that you could have sworn that this is a different person.For those so accustomed to today's Hollywood flicks, the refreshingly different pace of Le Cercle Rouge may take some getting used to, particularly when there is often a complete absence of background music, as in the long scene on the execution of the job. Not surprising that when first released in the US in the early 90s, Le Cercle Rouge was cut from its original 140 minutes to 100.",

This we have seen before in both French and American films, and it is supposed to represent the cold, unemotional male driven by fate. He is in this world born to be like that and with almost mathematical precision Melville shows them committing their robotic acts of crime. Women are peripheral in this world. Examples : a night club filled with machine like women dancing to choreography that makes Bob Fosse look excessive and they are there just as spectacle for tired gangsters. A naked women is seen getting out of bed fleetingly. She has nothing to say. Nothing to do, And the last image of a woman; a white statue in a stairwell and her cold breast briefly touched by one of the criminals. And there is a nightclub young woman with a rose. Men, heterosexual of course, only count in this world and the police are betrayed as being no better. Both Delon and Bourvil are wasted in this and the only human element is when having drunk too much Yves Montand sees insects, rats etc crawling all over him. This is the nearest you get to any interior world and the creatures are meant to be loathsome. Is this the inside of all guilty men, and that means every male reading this ? This ' philosophical ' film is reductive, inhuman with a hellish fabricated universe. Two stars for the expert film making and the Bourvil character's tender love for cats.",

            "content": "Stylish as few heist films could ever hope to feel.\n\nDirector Jean-Pierre Melville's French neo-noir crime drama Le Cercle Rouge (1970) remains a standout classic among French cinema. Melville's Le Samourai and Army of Shadows were magnificent practice for how doomed his atmosphere feels for Le Cercle Rouge. His slow burn direction keeps you on edge like you're literally along for the ride with these shady characters. Le Cercle Rouge is all about who you can trust when committing crimes and how people can change for the worse over time. It's got chic style with long trench-coats and fedoras like the old film noirs, but with a 70's French aesthetic.\n\nMelville's direction has tons of effortless cool and crazy helicopter ultra wide shots. I love the intense finale heist and all the smaller encounters with criminals along the way. Cinematographer Henri Deca\u00eb uses slick panning wide shots to allow us to see into dark rooms and on rooftops at night. I love the select close-ups for all the little nuances of these tough guys. Editors Jean-Pierre Melville and Marie-Sophie Dubus' sharp cuts between shots and scenes are timed to the music with strict cues. There's neat storytelling in between every moment that lets you know what's happening without ever needing to be told verbally.\n\nMelville's writing feels detailed to the point of being meticulous, enigmatic heroes that are all crooks except for a lone inspector, and hopeless in tone. You always feel a dreadful sense that something will go wrong as there's too many variables and enemies surrounding the trio of robbers. I guess crime doesn't pay after all. The inspector is constantly being told that people never change and will end up immoral by the end of their life. He gets to see possibly decent men otherwise turn to a life of crime. It's 140 minutes of charming characters and depressing results on hopeful scores.\n\nComposer \u00c9ric Demarsan wrote a playful jazz score that's moody for the darker passages and fun during the nightclub visits. Sound designer Jean N\u00e9ny uses the ambient silence of night and little noises in the vault to really unnerve you. There's often disquieting noises in the background for realism and an eerie atmosphere.\n\nAlain Delon (Le Samourai) is captivating as French master thief Corey, fresh out of prison. His calm and measured cat burglar is refined and clever in every way. Bourvil as the crafty and persistent Inspector Mattei. He's often funny and charming in a pleasant old man type of demeanor. Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 (A Fistful of Dollars & For a Few Dollars More) is ruthless and aggressive as escaped convict Vogel. His paranoia and caution is a nice foil and pairing for Delon's quiet and more subtle Corey. Yves Montand's ex-cop sniper is really touching.\n\nIn short, I loved Le Cercle Rouge. It's one of the greatest crime dramas ever made.",

And it is this what distinguishes Melville's films from just being crime movies, because they culminate in fundamental feelings and universal emotions. Thus, in addition to the solid structure and crime-plot of his stories, Melville always strived to show the torments of men exposed to their fate.\n\nMelville's morality is surprising and demanding: there can only be an absolute sincerity, though it often manifests itself in unlikely ways and tortuous paths. Having been a resistance-fighter in his youth, Melville's life and work stays true to the Resist\u00e0nce. Nobody in his universe seems to know that the war is over, and they do not waste one thought on laying their arms down. Their war is never over. A solidarity connects the typical protagonists of his cinema, especially the bad boys, the scapegraces, the hard-boiled guys of the underworld, and the fighters of La Resit\u00e0nce. A solidarity due to their code of honor, their existence in the underground, the precision of their practices and their knowledge. But also due to their relation to commitment and betrayal, their ability to endure pain and kill each other in the name of morality and silence.\n\nAlain Delon gave his best performances in his three films with Melville, with his talents and features being perfecty led and distilled within this unique actor-director symbiose. Unforgotten is his extremely focused and chilling performance as ice-cold and detached killer in \u2018Le Samourai' (read my review here), the most acknowledged film in Melville's h'oeuvre. With no visible feelings and thoughts, but just delivering the lonely routine of a killer- yet with a streak of vertigo hinting at a personality disorder making him perceive the world from behind a somnambul veil- Delon was devoted to Melville after playing \u2018Le Samourai'. His performance in Le Cercle Rouge is even better though, without the vertigo-effect even more minimalistic and austere in the sense of american \u2018underacting', being an almost abstract figure within the narrative construction, but with his typical unmoved and anonymous compassion.\n\nLe Cercle Rouge also has an excellent jazz-crime score composed by Eric Demarsan, who collaborated with the great Francois de Roubaix (Le Samourai) before. It underlines the cool chic and fatalism with modern jazz sounds and the typical European 60s & 70s melancholy in its themes. Melville used film music in the most sophisticated sense, to deliberately sculpture the silence that dominates his films, to form feelings and thoughts with sound when they just flicker on screen.\n\nJean-Pierre Melville's passionate admiration of the American cinema of the 30's and 40's is the fundament for his cinematic determination, but he took it further and perfectionized it. It's beautiful to see the French-American circle close with contemporary directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Jim Jarmusch referring to Melville as one of their major influences.\nIt is a cinema fallen out of time, slow-paced, chic, in absence of modern chaos and cacaphony, but do yourself a favor to discover it and shed a tear over what we have lost, and the unavoidable fatality of everything.\n\nhttps://vinylwriters.com/le-cercle-rouge-the-red-circle-1970/",

I had a major problem with the decisions of the characters in the film. Also the movie is not tight enough. Overall the storyline is weak. it just didn't have that hook, that special intangible aspect to make it a cool movie. It was just sort of bland and the acting was just decent in my opinion except for yves montand of course. \n\nA main  problem  of mine was how vogel and corey met in the first place. That whole scene was just too much to be coincidental. I didn't buy it at all. In fact I thought the entire thing had been arranged beforehand somehow, which would have made a way better plot line. But to tell me that vogel is running, checks the trunks of all the cars and just happens to find corey's open is too much. And then corey, a man just released from prison, goes right along with it without skipping a beat. \n\nThis movie is just a long, slow, weaker version of Rififi. What is most bothersome is that instead of the crooks being cool and crafty, they are lame and blundering. No wonder the movie starts out with them captured or in jail-- I'm not surprised (and they ended up dead-- duh, saw that coming)! \n\nOther ridiculous things: \n\"Hey I just got out of jail-- how about I buy a car with dirty money from a rival criminal?!\" \n\"Hey, let's recruit the new gang member at a known hangout for gangsters!\" \n\"Hey, we can poorly tie up the guard right next to the alarm button!\" \n\"Hey, let's leave the rope ladder with our fingerprints all over it hanging from the roof of the jewelry shop!\" \n\"Hey, let's steal millions in jewelry and have ONE possible buyer for it all!\" \nI could go on and on... (continuing with the fact that the tip of this \"easy heist\" came from a POLICE GUARD!). \n\nYves Montand actually is the onlycharacter that's interesting with any sort of depth in this entire movie. And at least he's not stupid enough to die by getting SHOT IN THE BACK while RUNNING AWAY! \n\nLe Cercle Rouge is an interesting film to have seen, but i have no intention in rewatching it. It's way to dry to be entertaining or interesting. Melville's other work Le Samourai, is one of my favorite movies of all time though",

What's so great about this film's particular brand of cool is it's a non-showy, quiet cool that is pulled off with utter confidence by Melville. A quirky cast of characters gets together to pull off a major heist: a recently released criminal, an escaped convict, and an alcoholic former policeman. Fate conspires to place them all together and to face off against an unorthodox detective. I enjoyed the film very much but the 25 minute heist scene, which is almost completely silent, really elevated the film. Masterfully achieved, I can see how that scene alone inspired a number of heist movies to come after It's too bad, then, that the final shootout is a little hokey and on-the-nose. Still, the ending does not ruin the movie so much as end it with a whimper, rather than a bang.",

I couldn't believe it was filmed in 1970 as the setting feels 1950's.  \n\nMy issues with French cinema is the general overall lack of concern for story line, plot or character development.  Yves Montand's alcoholism and borderline insanity is introduced and never explored and quickly explained away.  Alain Delon's mob backstory drops in and out of the picture.  We never know why Gian-Maria Volonte's character is on the run.  The police work is sloppy and lazy.  The continuity of the story is equally sloppy and lazy:  it's clear weather, then it snows, then it's raining all during one day in the story.  \n\nThe plot twist of the police inspector/fence is overhyped in the description.  It's a red herring in the description as it is merely a set-up in the last 10 minutes to trap our criminals.  \n\nPlausibility and continuity is an afterthought.

I probably wouldn't have watched it if it weren't for Quentin Tarantino's love for Melville's work, but I can say that I might enjoy it a bit more after seeing it again like I did with Godard's films.\n\nThe only thing saving it from me giving it a lower rating is that the cinematography was pretty good, other than that I don't see what all the love is about.",

In Le Cercle Rouge, a 1970s classic, Alain plays Corey, someone who served time in prison but isn't exactly seeking redemption at the end of it. He has a jewelry store in mind, diamonds and necklaces in several impregnable vaults in the store protected with laser rays, CC-TVs and security guards. \nFate brings Corey, Vogel and Mattei together, who team up for this final heist which is shot in dead pan silence, in the final twenty minutes of the film. Vogel is a man on the run after he jumps locks and an astute police officer in a train. Mattei is a retired, pissed off cop.\nThese men speak very little, smoke a lot, wear their fedoras and have very noisy pistols. There is some unsaid code of honor these men seem to guard, in spite of the several long takes of silences they seem to perform to. Maybe this is what the French New Wave actually represented. Suave, mysterious, hard boiled and brooding criminals who generally kept to themselves even in front of their women and died in the end making us wish we knew more about them. \n\nLe Cercle Rouge is a thriller which makes us worry about its characters as they meticulously plan and execute the daring robbery at the end of the film. This is, remember, without knowing much about any of them. One of them might even cut your throat when he meets you next. We never know but we still love and adore them. Is this reason enough to call Le Cercle Rouge, a good film, in spite of its snail's pace? \nCritics, I am told, call this 'deliberate pacing'. \n\nRating : 3/5",

There were 2 such scenes that comprised a large portion of the film: the man-hunt of an escaped prisoner and a heist scene.  \r\n     One of the few details that kept it from being a perfect film, in my opinion, is that could have developed the characters more. Because of those two extended scenes, the rest of the movie is limited into how much development can be incorporated. The director chose to split the remaining time between the criminal activity and the policeman in charge of capturing the escaped criminal. To be a perfect film in my estimation would have given the movie a greater running time to include both worlds, the criminal and police investigation. Another possible option would have reduced the screen time of the police investigation to focus on the criminal element more in depth.  But I can also appreciate what the director tried to do by having the contrast between the police investigation and criminal activity. It is nevertheless a great fun neo-noir heist movie.",

            "content": "Le Cercle Rouge is a step up from Jean-Pierre Melville\u00e2(TM)s previous crime film, Le Samourai (1967). Make no mistake, the latter film stands impressively on its own, but compared to Le Cercle Rouge, Le Samourai simply cannot compete. Specifically because the plot is more complex and the characters are better developed. \n\nAlain Delon, the French version of James Dean, stars in both films by Melville. In Le Samourai, Delon is a hired hitman who religiously adheres to the hitman philosophy: finish the assignment even if it means sacrificing your own life. The story follows a traditional linear convention from Delon\u00e2(TM)s point of view. Everything unfolds in the present, without any additional narrative tools such as, a flashback. More or less, the story development is very simple. \n\nOn the other hand, Le Cercle Rouge is a bit more complicated than the 1967 film. Though the film also unravels by following a linear narrative, the story mixes in three different points-of-views: Delon\u00e2(TM)s character (Corey, a jewel thief), a blond and blue eyed detective (Mattei), and an ex-cop gone corrupt (Jansen).\nThe film relies heavily on chance encounters and their fates intertwine by a mutual contact: Mattei\u00e2(TM)s escaped prisoner, Vogel. What is so interesting about Vogel\u00e2(TM)s character is that he fills the role as the catalyst. If it weren\u00e2(TM)t for his escape, Corey, Mattei, and Jansen would have never met and in theory Corey and Jansen would still be alive.\n\nIn addition to the film\u00e2(TM)s rich storyline, the story develops each character\u00e2(TM)s background meticulously. Outside of their given societal identities: cop or thief, Mattei for example has no other identity. The film makes an extra effort to show his solitary life at home. For instance, when he comes home, neither a wife or children greet him at the door, but instead three cats serve as his primary companions. As for Corey, on the day of his release from prison, the film quickly alludes to his past. As he checks out, the guards hand him his possessions: a watch, passport (expired), wallet, and three 3x5 photo\u00e2(TM)s of a beautiful blonde woman. He shifts through the pictures pausing after each one as if to remind himself that his past identity is dead. It is presumed that the woman in the picture has not visited him once since his incarceration. This is supported by his reluctance to take the pictures with him. With no one to nurture him back to society, Corey quickly finds himself re-adopting to his thief identity. \n\nFrom the opening sequence, the film lets the action dictate the pace of the story. One of the most memorable sequences in the film is a twenty-six minute, no dialogue scene where Corey and Vogel break into a highly secured jewelry store. From the minute they enter the building they communicate solely through gestures. As a result, every move is given extra details. For example when Corey and Vogel\u00e2(TM)s third accomplice, Jansen arrives a few minutes early to the scene, he kills time by doing an unnecessary and precautionary act by removing his black dress shoes (my guess is because he does not want to make extra noise). \nPurposely the film uses sparse dialogue to give the characters a certain impression. Since the story is about professional criminals, they let their actions do their talking.\n\nSteven Spielberg was once asked in an interview, What makes a good movie? He answered with, If you can follow a story without the sound and the movie still makes sense, that makes a good movie. I believe Le Cercle Rouge is one of those movies. It remains true to what a movie is by definition: a visual story.",

One of the great heist films, and perhaps, in its effort to portray seemingly random connections in a meaningful way, anticipates a more modern sense of synchronicity or interconnectedness. It seems as though the main interpretation is fate, however the coincidental connections that arise suggest a pattern. Is it a pattern the characters themselves are privy to?

The same day Corey is released Vogel escapes from the police superintendent Mattei, soon Corey and Vogel\u00e2(TM)s paths cross and the decided to help each other plan Corey\u00e2(TM)s heist, all the while they have Mattei on the heels as well as Rico and his goons around every corner. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the movie there\u00e2(TM)s a quote from Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha who after drawing a red circle said: \u00e2When men, even unknowingly are to meet one day, whatever may befall each, whatever their diverging paths, on the said day, they will inevitably come together in the red circle\u00e2?\r\n\r\nNow obviously the men inside the red circle are Corey and Vogel and the people the surround themselves with including Mattei and Rico. But what is the red circle then? The heist, the place where Corey and Vogel first meet, the club where important facts are made and decided ect. All these places are part of the red circle and it it\u00e2(TM)s here all the men\u00e2(TM)s relationships are established and also where their ultimate fates will be sealed. I think the title and the plot of the whole movie by this definition is very philosophical and that in itself makes Le Cercle Rouge a very special and interesting heist movie that\u00e2(TM)s more than just your average crime flick.\r\n\r\nAs a heist flick Jean Pierre Melville takes his time showing us in a very intense and more than 30 minutes long sequence how the heist is pulled off, and about half that time is shown them just getting into the building.  This is where most heist movies today fail so badly and where Melville succeeds so greatly. A heist should not be over quickly, they shouldn\u00e2(TM)t be pure or even pulled off perfectly. The heist in Le Cercle Rouge is pulled off to perfection in the end, but during the timeframe that it lasts the tension is high and Melville puts in plenty of moments where things indeed can go and almost does go wrong and it gives the viewer a change to think of all the things in the plan that might go wrong, also we don\u00e2(TM)t know their plan before hand, which gives us the elements of surprise and curiosity. \r\n\r\nThe relationships between all the men in this movie is beautifully described and all wonderfully played by the actors. It\u00e2(TM)s a fantastic and awe inspiring movie that everyone should see and love.",

That being said, Le Cercle Rouge is nor (and film in general) at its finest. Melville's direction is tight and awe-inspiring, the cinematography is beautiful, and Alain Delon (as well as the other actors) is truly magnificent. Delon and Melville have the kind of noir magic probably only witnessed before between Bogart and Huston. Le Cercle Rouge begins oddly for noir film with a Buddhist story about people being fated to meet within the red circle. From the opening shots of the film, Melville's characters are driven towards their ultimate fate at the film's end and the film is indeed epic in scope. Ultimately, Melville's film explores the argument that all men are guily, an argument put forward by the police chief. And, in the final analysis, all people in this film are guilty of one crime or another. Asidfe from its exploration of tha amorality of the human race, Melville's film is also enjoyable on a purely surface level: billiard halls, executions, escaped convicts, hallucinagenically depicted bouts of delerium tremens, intricatly planned heists, etc. all compose a film that is as aesthetically pleasing as it is pure bad ass and cool.",

Le Cercle Rouge has a bigger scope than those films, playing with both sides of the law as well as multiple protagonists, but it's all done with the same effortless sense of style and \"cool\" than made those films so memorable. Melville's not limited to his own films for inspiration, though; there's a long heist sequence here whose tension, silence, and limited dialogue can't help but remind the viewer of Rififi, and it's to the film's credit that the comparison doesn't hurt Le Cercle Rouge at all. The plot involves two criminals - one recently released from prison, the other recently escaped - who find their lives intertwined with a dedicated police captain and a sharpshooter battling his own alcoholic demons. But, as with a lot of Melville, the plot is solid, but beside the point; what makes Le Cercle Rouge so amazing is the mood and style of it all, the way it touches on something deeper all while seeming to be a pure crime film. An absolute masterpiece and well worth watching for anyone who loves films made in this particular variety of noir.",

            "content": "Jean-Pierre Melville, where the hell have you been all my life?  He's like the french new wave Sergio Leone, reinventing the crime film and noir through the european filter the same way Leone reinvented the western. You can clearly see why his movies influenced the work of John Woo and Quentin Tarantino. Although not as terrific as Le Samourai, Le Cercle Rouge is still pretty damn good. Like in Le Samourai, Melville's choice to silently observe every single gesture of the characters as they put their plans into action, without ever explaining beforehand what it is exactly that they're doing or even what's their plan to begin with creates a delicious feeling of curiosity. It's like the anti-Hitchcock form of creating suspense, where the audience is kept in the dark just until every single piece falls into place and suddenly everything makes sense. It's brilliant. It all leads to a pretty downbeat and anti-climatic conclusion that feels like nothing more than the inevitable fate these characters are bound to encounter. It's the weight of destiny, which seems to be a recurrent theme on Melville's work. Although I love the movie as it is, I can't help but think that it could benefit from a little trimming and a slightly quicker pace. It's a pretty slow movie, and some portions of it seem unnecessarily long. It's a great 2 hours and 15 minutes film. It could be a 1 hour and 50 minutes masterpiece.\n\nOh, and Alain Delon sporting a moustache is priceless.",

That being said, Le Cercle Rouge is nor (and film in general) at its finest.  Melville's direction is tight and awe-inspiring, the cinematography is beautiful, and Alain Delon (as well as the other actors) is truly magnificent.  Delon and Melville have the kind of noir magic probably only witnessed before between Bogart and Huston.  Le Cercle Rouge begins oddly for noir film with a Buddhist story about people being fated to meet within the red circle.  From the opening shots of the film, Melville's characters are driven towards their ultimate fate at the film's end and the film is indeed epic in scope.  Ultimately, Melville's film explores the argument that all men are guily, an argument put forward by the police chief.  And, in the final analysis, all people in this film are guilty of one crime or another.  Asidfe from its exploration of tha amorality of the human race, Melville's film is also enjoyable on a purely surface level: billiard halls, executions, escaped convicts, hallucinagenically depicted bouts of delerium tremens, intricatly planned heists, etc.  all compose a film that is as aesthetically pleasing as it is pure bad ass and cool.",

            "content": "After the washed-out, nearly monochrome despair of \"Army of Shadows\", the time was right for another journey into the criminal underworld, on another one of Melville's invented chunks of Eastern wisdom. The enhanced vividness of the color palette is evidenced from the very first frames, with a marble Buddha rotating against a pitch black background. To (poorly) paraphrase: \"All men destined to meet in life shall do so in The Red Circle\". As the text disappears, a bright red ovoid form is sketched in its place, like a bloody gash against the black void. \n\nColor is more prevalent, more necessary, than in any other Melville film. For the first time, he allows the luxurious saturation of Technicolor enhance the storytelling itself. Even if the palette and framing weren't top-notch, the langorous, quintissentially European crime epic would still be quite engaging on a surface level. \n\nThe three main characters are introduced as deftly as possible. Our central plot-catalyst (I hasten to use the term \"protagonist\"), is Alain Delon from \"Le Samourai\", playing mustachioed master thief Corey. As he plots his next scheme on the sneak with a confidant while still locked up in a prison cell, we cut to a police inspector escorting psycho Gian Maria Volente aboard a train. While still swathed in Police-issue blue sheets (the blue color motif repeats over and over), he spends a great deal of time picking the handcuffs he's sharing with the flatfoot. The tension is dragged out beyond all reason and then some, only to explode in unexpected (not necessarily violent) ways. \n\nA chase through the woods brings forth the green color scheme for the criminal element. The moss standing out like radioactive waste, grassy fields stretching endlessly into the horizon. Wide angle shots reduce Volente's life-or-death struggle to nothing more than tripping clumsily about some rough terrain. Later, cops will swarm like ants onto a similar field, blue dots creating a perfect lateral line, robotically scanning down the green void in unison. It's a perfect visual metaphor for cops scouring the underworld, methodically sweeping in their predictable way. \n\nA heist unfolds in a jewelry store like a high-tech version of \"Rififi\". A sharpshooter is needed, who happens to be an alcoholic ex-cop, introduced detoxing in his apartment. As Corey calls from a taxiphone, the poor sap is hallucinating various reptiles crawling about his trashed apartment, struggling to walk 10 feet to his phone and shuddering every agonizing step of the way. But once the deal's done, he's out on the streets in a sharp suit and fedora. A new persona, the clothes literally making the man. Who needs AA when you can obsessively train with a rifle to the point where you can shoot a homemade bullet into a lock from 20 yards without using a tripod? \n\nFans of Melville should know exactly what to expect here. Lots of American cars clogging narrow French country lanes, lots of ironies and ambiguities relating to the shared world inhabited by these two mortal co-dependent enemies. Cops and criminals are compared to black ants and red ants, cats and dogs, lions and tigers. The cool detachment allows us to be surprised by the actions of both sides, especially when laws end up having to be broken by the lawmen. What could be more Eastern than the tragedy of the pure spirit being punished for staying true to his code? It goes without saying that truism applies to both sides of this eternal struggle. (And by saying that, I just committed an intentional fallacy. ) \n\nWhat is The Red Circle? A bullet hole? An intangible, all-encompassing strand of Fate? A Dante-esque Circle of Hell? It can be all these and more! But in \"Le Cercle Rouge\" there are no roles for dames, which is a shame but a revealing flaw in an otherwise immaculate, existential sausage fest.",

Another one that came highly recommended was Jean-Pierre Melville's [i]Le Cercle Rouge[/i]. It was a lot slower moving than I thought it would be, but the slower build allowed for the characters to develop into some really fascinating and interesting people. And made this film a great look into the criminal underworld.\n\nThe last thing I expect to see a heist film open up with is a quote taken from Buddha. But that is the great style to [i]Le Cercle Rouge[/i]. It does things one wouldn't expect a film such as this to do. And the one notable thing is how everyone acts in the film. At first I thought everyone was sort of in auto-pilot in the film, but I began to realize that these people were so calm and cool throughout the whole film they didn't need moments to burst out loud.\n\nThe three thieves in the film were really great characters. Corey (Alain Delon); fresh out of jail, Vogel (Gian Maria Volonte); recently broke free during a prison transfer and Jansen (Yves Montand); a former cop with a few drug problems. None of these men really know each other, but the three come together perfectly to execute a risky jewel heist. I thought that the three actors did a fantastic job in the film, and were wonderful to watch.\n\nI also liked that [i]Le Cercle Rouge[/i] flipped the roles of the heroes and villains. The three thieves should be the bad guys, but we find ourselves hating the police characters in the film more. None more than Commissioner Mattei (Andre Bourvil). He was as corrupt as it got, and it was amazing to see the lengths this man would go to in order to get the three thieves into custody. A great performance by Bourvil, and one of the best movie villains ever.\n\nThe movie is hard to follow at times, and the slow pace does lead to some moments where you will be checking the clock. But overall this is a very well made movie, with an amazingly tense heist scene and a excellent finale. A lot of people have called this film the definition of cool, and I can see why that is.[/size][/font]\n[/left]\n[/center]",

I got freaked out because it was late at night and everyone had fallen asleep, leaving me alone with my werewolf fear. However, the next time around, still alone, but this time during the day, it wasn't nearly as effective. The plot revolves around a group of werewolves who see the condition as a curse and a young boy who has been prophesied to save them. The there's the other group of werewolves who kind of like hunting and killing people and they're trying to stop this little boy. The story is good, the werewolves are effective and it has good production. But I think that's part of the problem. The movie is hit by a cool curse. It think's it a lot cooler than it is. Still, alone at night, this could creep you out.\r\n\r\n[B]Rififi[/B] is a truly awesome heist film. Jean Servais (\"Porzi\"), just out of jail, burns the screen with his eyes. The perpetrators execute the heist in complete silence. It's gritty, sometimes funny and then heartbreaking. I loved it. I don't even have the words for how good this is.\r\n\r\n[B]Le Cercle Rouge[/B] is another tight heist film, and a definite influence on at least two Coen Brothers films. Again, the heist is pulled off in silence. This film is on a grander scale than Rififi and show the cop as he tracks the criminals. It features a guy busting out of a moving train window, but that awesomeness is shatter by the ludicrous dance number put on by the women at the night club. Still, definitely worth watching.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to Rififi and Le Cercle Rouge, [B]The Italian Job[/B] is a joke. Michael Caine (\"The Dark Knight\") plays a fast-talking thief just out of jail who orchestrates an elaborate heist, with lots of talking, and complete with mini cars. I lost interest in this, and there was a terrible song that got stuck in my head for the rest of the day. Plus, a groan-inducing ending. I preferred the remake. And that's sad.\r\n\r\n[B]Kiss of the Spider Woman[/B] won William Hurt (\"The Incredible Hulk\") an Oscar for his portrayal of a gay prisoner sharing a cell with Raul Julia (\"Street Fighter\"). To pass the time, Hurt tells Julia the plot of his favorite movie. And they bond. And it really is as boring as it sounds. I guess in 1985, playing a gay character was a bigger deal than it is now, because I thought Hurt did a good job, but not necessarily an Oscar-worthy one. I just kept wondering why they were allowed open flames in their cell and thinking how Hurt looked a lot like Glenn Close when he was wearing makeup.",

In fact, in this film, Melville seems to spend as much time detailing the cop's position as he does (as is his wont) the crook's. Everyone, on both sides, is tough and cool -- they don't blink, they just get on with it, even when shit happens. Red circles appear now and again, but the film is primarily blue and gold.  Probably the fourth best Melville film (after Le Samourai, Le Doulos, and Army of the Shadows), but still great.",

            "content": "Jean-Pierre Melville has disappointed me every time thus far (Army of Shadows and Le Doulos), so I don't know why I expected the critically-acclaimed Le Cercle Rouge to be any better than his other critically-acclaimed films. Like Army of Shadows, it's all gray and brown and dreary blue, as if the studio forced him to shoot color against his will (Le Doulos, in black and white, looks a lot snappier). Also like Army of Shadows, it's a bit too long, and extremely quiet. But while keeping actors quiet works for some directors (if we're comparing talk-free French jewel heists, Dassin does it best in Rififi), Melville's edits lack the visual dynamism necessary to keep an audience engaged through the actors' silence. In his slow, drab sequences, there is little to cling to, which leads me to Gian Maria Volont\u00c3\u00a8's performance as escaped convict Vogel, for he is the only one to draw us in.\r\n\r\nWhen the film opens, Vogel is cuffed to the upper berth in a train, supervised by police inspector Mattei (Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Bourvil) in the bottom bunk. Vogel makes a rather stunning break by picking the lock of his cuffs and then kicking out the train window, leaping through the broken glass while the train is in full motion. He runs madly through the woods, and we never suspect that he'll make it past Mattei's immediately instigated dragnet, but he throws the dogs off his scent by crossing a river, and when he gets out onto the road, he hides in the trunk of a car parked at a restaurant. It's only mere luck that the car he picked belongs to Corey (the icy, ultra-French Alain Delon), a convict himself, released from prison that morning, at which time he robbed an old enemy at gunpoint and then purchased said vehicle with some of the money. Corey sees Vogel getting into his trunk (where he happens to have left some guns), and he drives out into a deserted, muddy field to confront the man. He shows Vogel his release papers from prison, and they share a smoke. Luck gets them through the dragnet, and they drive onto Paris, to Corey's old apartment. Here, Corey lets Vogel in on a job he's planning: a jewel heist.\r\n\r\nThe shop they are planning to hit has just installed a new, electronic safe/alarm system (rather evolved next to the alarm system featured in Rififi, but one that the cast of Ocean's Eleven would sneeze at). To break in, they need an excellent marksman, and Vogel has a connection with a bad cop who's a great shot. Corey calls him on the phone to set up a meeting, and we see Jansen (Yves Montand) at home when the phone rings in the film's only, but very, psychedelic sequence; the man is in bed, sweating and shaking, staring at an opened secret door in the striped wallpaper, out of which lizards, snakes, and rats wriggle and thump across the floor, up onto his bed, and into his face. He seems to be suffering from Heroin withdrawal, and so, later, once he's shaven and showered, met with Corey, and agreed to do the job, when we see him back in his room, wearing a suit, measuring and weighing curious substances, and melting them in a crucible, we are surprised to see that he is molding his own bullet. This bullet will be of the precise combinations of metals that, from the combined heat of the gun and its impact with the alarm system's keyhole, it will melt into and release the lock, instantly leaving all of the jewel cases open for the thieves to plunder. The heist goes off without a hitch.\r\n\r\nAs in Rififi, it's the translation of the jewels into cash through the fence that creates the problem. The fence Corey originally chose backs out of the deal, and he's forced to go to nightclub proprietor Santi (Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois P\u00c3\u00a9rier) for a connection to another fence. Meanwhile, Mattei has been putting pressure on Santi to help him find Vogel, for the business man has strong connections to the mob and all the Parisian crime scene. Santi continues to refuse until Mattei brings his teenaged son in on marijuana charges; he then yields, and when Corey comes to him for a connection with a fence, he provides Mattei, in an improbably disguise consisting of sunglasses and a pinky ring. Corey takes the bait, though, and drives the jewels out to the country estate Mattei has named, telling Vogel to stay at home. Vogel's sixth sense refuses, though, so he follows Corey out to the estate; the moment he walks in and sees Mattei, he tells Corey to grab the jewels and run. He runs too. Mattei, and the hundred-odd officers lying in wait run after; both thieves are shot down. Jansen, on the scene as well, and back on the side of the law, is accidentally shot dead by Mattei, thus proving his strange, misanthropic commissioner's preemptive accusation (at the film's beginning, when Mattei is called in for losing Vogel, the commissioner insists that all men are guilty).\r\n\r\nThis seems a tidy conclusion; all men are guilty, all men are dead, crime doesn't pay, etc. But there are a number of strange loose ends that remain unresolved. What exactly was going on in Jansen's apartment with all of those creatures? He cleans up too quickly to have had a real problem. And what is going on with Mattei at his apartment? Twice we see him come home to his three cats, going through his routine of removing his hat and coat, opening the taps of the bathtub, and placing a dish of food from the refrigerator onto the middle of the kitchen floor for the animals. The second time he comes home, the third cat is slow to appear, and ominous music plays while the camera zooms in on the food dish. We are certain the camera will swing around to reveal a murdered feline, but nothing comes of it. And finally, what of the strange tenderness between Corey and Vogel? In the final scene in Corey's apartment, before he leaves to meet Mattei, they share a moment weirdly tender, even lover-like, and after Corey leaves, Vogel makes his decision to follow while fingering a red rose (brought home by Corey from his initial meeting with Mattei at Santi's). Perhaps I'm overreading, or perhaps Melville was just sloppy; why would he plant these seeds and then leave them unattended?",

On the inside however, the film plays it cool and really digs deep into it's ring of characters. The average film would just focus on the heist, and maybe toy with its characters for effect, but here the heist feels secondary, even though the heist itself is quite spectacular in its own right. Melville spends a generous amount of the film around each of the main characters, it never becomes a film about money, it is a film about motive and purpose.",

The film isa dark and cynical look at the nature of human beings, our interactions with each other, and the obsessions we carry with us. All of these themes are framed around a story about three men planning a heist and the detective that relentlessly persues them. All the main actors are simply brilliant though I am quite partial to Bourvil in the role of a detective, a man feeling pressure from every corner of his life but is still able to reveal depth and emotion in his quieter moments even if he is calculated and determined while on the job. Montand, Delon, and Volonte portray the three criminals and they all do superb work here, capturing the desperation, pain, and hope that each carries inside them. Above it all though is the direction Melville who makes certain scenes and sequences seem simply effortless. The bank heist scene is one of the best in film history and very few moments are as meticulous and well captured as the sequence. Melville, in all of his films, is attracted to and interested in what drives men to do the things they do and in this film, aided by a brilliant script and great acting, he achieves to show us.",
