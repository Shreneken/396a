            "content": "Finally after all these years watched the cult hit classic of the now late George A. Romero's \"1968's\" \"Night of the living Dead\". And for it's time this low budget independent picture was a masterpiece that helped change the landscape and gave upcoming horror films a new path to follow. For 1968 and being in black and white it had plenty of gore, death, and blood. And even a few twists and turns in the plot were found.Set in Pennsylvania in a small farm town the nearby graveyard starts to come alive and one by the dead have risen! And oddly enough this is a panic and epidemic that is all over the country!It's a battle of will and determination for survival against the walking undead! Many will not like this film when comparing today's standards of special effects, graphics, and \"CGI\" yet one can see that this old classic was a gateway to current hits like \"The Walking Dead\".",

            "content": "This landmark 1968 horror-shocker is a great example of what can be done with a limited budget, a simple idea, and some dedicated and talented participants. Very nicely shot, mostly well acted, NOTLD grabs your attention from the very beginning to the very end - and what a classic end it is.The story begins with Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and her brother visiting the grave of a friend of their mother, and takes off almost immediately, as they are attacked by a horde of cannibalistic zombies. Narrowly escaping, but losing her emotional balance in the process, Barbara escapes to a house a bit farther down the road where she meets Ben (Duane Jones), the hero of the film. They discover a family with a sick little girl and a young couple in the basement of the house and they all get to work barricading themselves in and preparing weapons and other defenses. The rest of the story concerns the group dynamics between these survivors as the dead close in on their refuge, the story of what is going on in the rest of the USA - revealed through TV reportage and radio broadcasts, and sheer survival. The human side of this film is an interesting and accurate character study concerning what happens to people whose very lives are threatened.The horror of this film is, unlike a lot of its recent descendants, less a matter of blood and gore than a matter of the real active horror of realistically depicted scenes of murder, death and cannibalism. Though the black and white footage involving blood and gore is certainly effective, there may not be quite enough of it for today's average horror fan. The photographic techniques of this film are innovative and powerful - showing just enough of the sheer hideousness of the film's basic concepts to disturb viewers, but not enough to allow them to detach from the film's protagonists.I strongly recommend this film to anybody interested in the art of film making, and to those who enjoy the horror genre, though it is hard to imagine any serious horror fan who hasn't already seen this.",

            "content": "A wave of mass murder sweeps across America as the recently dead return to life to kill and feast on their victims.  A group of people board themselves up in an abandoned house to try and hold out against a small army of the undead. This is the classic low-budget horror film that is the model for recent hits such as the Evil Dead and The Blair Witch Project.  George Romero stages a national disaster but reduces it to a single house for greater effect.  The story focuses on the weaknesses of each of the characters in the house - their cowardice, their greedy, their stupidity etc.  This makes the drama inside the house almost as palatable as the danger from outside and makes the characters more believable and important.The undead are not huge works of special effects, nor are they anything other than lumbering beasts.  But the threat they pose is well demonstrated - the film makes them feel unstoppable and relentless and makes their lingering presence more menacing and less comical than it could have been. The use of an unknown cast also makes it more realistic as none of them have any baggage.  Duane Jones is the standout actor as Ben - who is not without flaws himself.The downbeat, realistic atmosphere to the film gives it a greater sense of tension and continues right through to the very depressing conclusion.  An excellent flagship for low budget horrors.",

            "content": "I don't think George Romaro ever had in his mind the masterpiece he created when he made Night of the Living Dead, one of the greatest horror movies of all time and gave birth to the zombie genre. The monster that is the zombie has been a little experimented with before with the film \"White Zombie\" but never like the dark depths that George took it too. To think that this film almost never would have made it to the public since George threw it in the trunk of his car thinking nobody would ever buy it, low and behold not only did the film sell but has one of greatest group of fans to follow it. Such a degrading film for it's time with naked, scarred up, chewed up zombies eating human flesh, there was no film like Night of the Living Dead. The metaphor that we are guaranteed 2 things in life: birth and death, the slow inevitable death that is walking towards you as if you are looking at your future self is just horrific. George was way ahead of his time and that's why Night of the Living Dead still gives me nightmares to this day.Barbra and Johnny drive to rural Pennsylvania to visit their father's grave. When Barbra is afraid Johnny teasingly frightens; whereupon they are attacked by a zombie. Johnny tries to rescue his sister, but is then presumably killed when the man shoves him head first onto a tombstone. Barbra flees, with the killer in pursuit; eventually she ran off to an empty farmhouse where she discovers the half-eaten corpse. Running out of the house, she notices a man named Ben arrives in a pickup truck, drags Barbra back into the house, and barricades the doors and windows. Meanwhile, hiding in the cellar are a married couple, Harry and Helen Cooper, their daughter Karen, and teenage couple Tom and Judy. Harry asks everyone to hide in the cellar, but Ben deems it a \"deathtrap\" and remains upstairs. As they fight through the night for their lives, they try to escape to a safe house but the zombies outside have pulled up the table with the salt and pepper and are a bit hungry for some human flesh.George casted a black lead, which was so unheard of at the time, I'm sure he never looked at the color but what a groundbreaking moment. He's the smart man who knows how to fight and even hit a white woman, what risks George took with this movie. The film is by no means perfectly made, but you have to understand that this was a low budget film made by a group of friends, however, when you think compared to today's low budget films that have no story with it, it's all about the gore, Night of the Living Dead broke that mold. I have a little tradition every year on Halloween, I have to watch this movie because it is one of the best horror movies of all time. How could you not still get the chills when little Karen turns into a zombie and goes after her mother with a shovel, her mother screaming \"Baby!\" and falls crying and screaming as her daughter just continues stabbing her to death, God, what a horrific scene! Taking a chance with a depressing ending, not to spoil too much as I feel that I already have but I envy anyone who sees this film for the first time because I like to see their reactions to this movie. A groundbreaking film, a horrifying story and a cast and crew that gave all effort, Night of the Living Dead is a terrific scary movie not to be missed.9/10",

            "content": "Along with \"Carnival of Souls\", this movie stands out as one of the definitive black-and-white horror movies of a bygone drive-in movie era. This movie scared me horribly when I first saw it back in the sixth grade. I had seen other scary movies before, but I think what makes this film so frightening is that there is a somewhat scientific explanation involved and that the horror is occurring to average people. The terror is not due to some supernatural occurrence that we know to be fantasy such as a vampire or some other relic from a 30's or 40's Universal horror film. Also, the drama is playing out in and around a farm house in rural Ohio, not some mythical haunted mansion. This puts you into the dilemma with the players. The fact that such bad acting is in play here just adds to the realism rather than making the film campy.This movie showed something that could have only occurred pre-Watergate. At one point, the people trapped in the farmhouse discover a television and turn it on in search of news of what is going on. Something almost as remarkable to today's audiences as the dead rising from their graves is seen to occur. In Washington, reporters confront a government official about the situation, the government official tells the reporters the truth, and everyone believes what the government has told them. All of this would be truly remarkable in today's environment of mutual mistrust between citizens, government, and the media. Also, although we don't have actual vampires as the villain here, we have a similar dilemma. As the radiation causes the dead to become animated and seek to eat the flesh of the living, each time a victim is bitten, that victim eventually dies only to rise minutes later seeking the flesh of the living themselves, producing a problem that grows geometrically, just as vampires do.Finally, this film has something important to say about race. Unique to 60's films, the group in the farmhouse accepts Ben (Duane Jones), an African-American man, as a leader since he is smart and a quick thinker. This portrayal of an African-American as protagonist and problem solver is also unique to films of forty years ago. The ending is quite powerful, and you have to ask yourself, did race have something to do with the actions of the rescue posse? I don't know if this question was hung out there intentionally by the film's creators for the audience to ponder, but it is a point that is almost impossible to ignore.",

            "content": "A car drives up a road, towards a graveyard. Cut to the graveyard, a woman and her brother have brought flowers to their mother's grave. Soon the brother starts taunting his sister, saying: \"They're coming to get you, Barbara\". Barbara laughs it off and after her brother runs away, she heads to the seemingly innocent man visiting a family member's grave to apologize, and out of nowhere he grabs her. Her brother attempts to fight him off but ends up being killed in the process and Barbara escapes to a farmhouse nearby.That's how this incredible, highly influential masterclass in horror film making begins. What is still so fascinating about this film is that it retains its ability to genuinely, truly scare the crap out of you. It's not just a 'jump moment' film, George A. Romero sets the mood perfectly with a sublime script and truly effective use of music. As far as modern low budget horror films go, this is nearly the best of them, surpassed only by Sam Raimi's masterpiece \"The Evil Dead\".\"Night of the Living Dead\" isn't scary because of the zombies (although the flesh eating sequences are still among the greatest and most horrifying horror scenes ever made). The film is still effective because it all has a feeling of impending doom. It seems hopeless, disturbing, terrifying because of the claustrophobic mood it sets. It's not the zombies that scare us, it's the idea of being trapped in a small area with nowhere to go and death itself standing right outside your door. What a brilliant film!8/10",

Out of the blue, they are attacked by a strange man and Johnny is murdered. Barbra runs and releases the brake of Johnny's car since the keys are in his pocket, and flees to an isolated farmhouse, where she locks herself inside. Barbra is in shock and soon she finds a man, Ben (Duane Jones), who is also escaping from the inhuman creatures and he reinforces the doors, windows and openings in the house. He also finds a shotgun and a radio and they learn that the radiation from a satellite that was returning from Venus has somehow reactivated the brain of the dead.Then they find five humans hidden in the basement: Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman) and their daughter Karen (Kyra Schon) that is sick; and Tom (Keith Wayne) and his girlfriend Judy (Judith Ridley). Harry has an argument with Ben, since he believes that the basement is the safest place for them and Harry does not agree. Along the night, the tension between the two men grows while the house is under siege by an increasing legion of living dead. \"Night of the Living Dead\" is my favorite horror movie and I do not know how many times I have watched this movie (the last times had been on 31 March 2001 and 15 January 2002). I was very young the first time I saw it and I was impressed with this movie. Today I have just seen a colorized version and despite my preference for the original black and white classic, I have nothing to say against this latest version.\"Night of the Living Dead\" is the debut of the cult director George A. Romero and it is amazing the movie he made with an extremely low-budget. The story is scary and tension increases along 96 minutes running time. The conclusion is ironic and a sort of justice against the decision of Ben, who refused to stay in the basement and caused the death of the whole group. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"A Noite dos Mortos-Vivos\" (\"The Night of the Living Dead\")Note: On 10 August 2014, I saw this film again.On 13 September 2015, I saw this film again.",

On these the zombies will capitalize. One of the best aspects of this film is the lead character. Romero has always presented intelligent non-stereotypical black characters in his films.

            "content": "It is very rare nowadays in Hollywood that $112,000 will cover anything more than the cost of catering on most movies. And yet that was all it took for George Romero and a number of friends of his in Pittsburgh to make what is without a doubt one of the most significant horror films of all times, the 1968 shocker NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Detested by a lot of critics in its day for several scenes of unsettling gruesomeness (though Herschell Gordon Lewis' gore films earlier in the 1960s beat him to the punch for true stomach-turning horror), the film is now understandably highly prized of its relentless, logical approach, and for being so utterly uncompromising.Not much more needs to be said about the plot: it merely involves seven people who have barricaded themselves inside a rural Pennsylvania home after having been attacked by flesh-eating ghouls who have returned to life from the dead as the result of an exploded Venus probe bringing back a dangerous and unknown form of radiation. What Romero and his co-scenarist John Russo (who took partial inspiration for this film from Richard Matheson's classic 1954 end-of-the-world vampire novel \"I Am Legend\") show, however, is the strain built up by the way the characters, especially the ones portrayed by Duane Jones and the film's co-producer Karl Hardman, react to the horror that engulfs them...whether to stay on the ground floor, or to hide in the cellar, and how best to escape even as more and more of the undead surround the place. As it turns out, of course, there is no real way out, and there is no actual good end to the whole horrible situation.Romero, who would continue his travail through the world of the undead through several sequels over the ensuing four decades, shot this film in black-and-white largely on location just outside of Pittsburgh over several weekends in the second half of 1967. NIGHT has, in many ways, the feel of a 1950s \"invasion\" film (think INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS), but its setting of an isolated house under siege clearly has its roots in Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 classic THE BIRDS; and the scenes of the ghouls munching on human flesh, though brief in nature, were then, and in many ways still are, shockingly contemporary. The cast of primarily amateur actors does well at being totally naturalistic, and the low budget look of the film gives it a documentary feel that hadn't been seen in horror films before, but which would be revisited in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.Even after four decades of parody, imitation, and sequels, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is still not for those with weak constitutions, and for those who have seen far more graphic shockers, it will likely seem painfully old-fashioned. But for true horror connoisseurs, it is up there with the very best, and is an essential film of its kind and its era.",

In Night of the Living Dead, there is good pacing, surprisingly good acting from a list of no-name actors, and the most important part that sticks with the film to this day, the sense of dread in the film. In this movie to this day you get that feeling of hopelessness, people get attacked for no reason and nothing can save them. Whether it's family-togetherness, love between a couple, or even the law-enforcers at the end, this was all tapping into the uncertainty level people were having at the time and still today it has meaning. Topping this off with Romero's (at the time) large use of gore adds to the overall uneasiness of the film. Finally at the film's current times, there is a great subtle final nail in the coffin attack with the sad fate of the character Ben. Being the only sole voice of reason is shot, which, at the time of filming brought harsh realities of such other African-American leaders who were brought down unfairly such as Malcolm X or Martin Luther King, even if this wasn't the original idea Romero had.Overall, no matter how cheesy some of this movie make look to modern eyes, Night of the Living Dead is a classic for offering horror without a shred of hope, forever influencing every horror movie in it's wake.",

Romero's debut film doesn't just kill off the sweet innocent teenagers (in the aforementioned most gruesome fashion) -- which would become a staple of horror, along with zombies themselves -- he kills off everyone. Even the film's brave hero, a black man with a shotgun (a subversive decision in itself for the 1960s) gets shot in the head by a pack of zombie-hunting white men and tossed on a bonfire to end the film (the ending is filmed in photographic stills, which creates a somehow more disturbing, documentary-like grisly realism conclusion to the events).What's truly scary about 'Night of the Living Dead' isn't the zombies, it is the behaviour of human beings: it doesn't matter what kind of monster or demon you survive a battle with, in the end it's the ugliness of human nature that is going to defeat you.

And it began a series of imitations and sequels, none of which get bonus points for determination or originality.Judith O'Dea and her brother, Russell Streiner, visit their parents' grave in a remote cemetery. O'Dea prays solemnly while Streiner, evidently a non-believer, playfully mocks her and teases her about a disheveled man approaching them -- \"Here he comes. They're coming to get you. Woooo.\" And suddenly this creepy character who looks like Art Carney DOES grab her and viciously starts wrestling her to the ground. When Streiner intervenes, he's knocked out, allowing O'Dea a few moments to escape. It's a shocking scene. The gray and barren cemetery looks like the setting for a family drama or even a comedy, and it's suddenly horror time.O'Dea winds up being barricaded in an empty farm house along with half a dozen other varied characters. One of them, inevitably, is the stock character who is domineering, dilatory, and stupid. Prima inter pares is a bright, industrious, practical African-American, whose race is never brought up.The trapped humans can't make any phone calls as zombies, by ones and twos, gather around the old house. It quickly becomes apparent that they're afraid of light. At the same time, a light bulb goes on in the head of the experienced viewer, that sooner or later the power will fail and the electric lights go off, leaving the house in darkness except for what light can be provided by improvised torches, burning furniture, and Molotov cocktails.It's a good cheap movie with a couple of revolting scenes, including the horde of revenants chomping with no visible enthusiasm on the barbecued bodies of a young couple caught in an exploding pickup truck. Chomping on the beautiful young woman is not so objectionable but there is such a thing as excess. It's a nice touch that Judith O'Dea is so shocked by her narrow escape and her brother's death that it takes her some time to recover. Usually, the character gets about thirty seconds.One by one, the living humans are pulled out of the house or otherwise captured by the zombies and eaten by them. Here the direction is sometimes very clumsy. The windows have been hastily boarded over. There are a dozen zombies outside with their hands reaching in through the spaces. You have a rifle and you know you can kill the zombies by shooting them through the head. So -- do you stick the muzzle of your rifle through the spaces between the boards, where the mortified hands can grasp the barrel and pull the rifle away? No. No, you don't.I didn't care for the ending at all. A sheriff's detail has been making its rounds, killing the zombies off until all are now gone. As they approach the farm house, the lone survivor peeks at them from a window. \"There's another one!\" And, POW, the lone survivor is no more. Everybody -- including those we've come to care for -- winds up mincemeat. \"King Lear\" was a tragedy too but it tried to tell us something about human nature. In this instance everyone dies because the writers decided arbitrarily that they should.Still gets bonus points, though, for being the first of its kind.",

Because I had seen other movies like this, I thought it was clich\u00e9d, but then realized that those movies were the clich\u00e9s and this set them up. The zombies are frightening, the feasting on human flesh is disgusting, those poor people, trapped in that house, not just fighting the enemies outside, but their own, inside, make for quite a film. It's easy to laugh at this because of inexperienced actors, cheap sets, and, basically, pretty bad special effects. Nevertheless, there is a throbbing threat that begins with the car in the graveyard and goes all the way to the unfortunate ending. It's a very frightening movie and set the standard for a raft of others to come. I don't like slasher movies and I'm not fond of gore in film, but it is a part of cinema today, and a lot of imagination went into this.",

This wasn`t the first time a certain TV guide got films mixed up because a couple of weeks ago it confused the 1967 war film THE YOUNG WARRIORS with the 1983 vigilante thriller about high school students and their poodle wiping out scumSlightly disappointed I wouldn`t be seeing the colour remake I still sat down to watch the original because as I said I remember liking it from years ago . I wasn`t disappointed with what I saw but the flaws do jump out at you and bite you in the neck . The acting isn`t very good with Judith O Dea over acting with the rest of the cast under acting . This a great pity because if we had the same type of performances seen in something like 12 ANGRY MEN this movie would have been a masterpiece . I also couldn`t help noticing a few editing errors where it`s suddenly pitch black outside then it flicks to broad daylight then it`s pitch black again , and I don`t think I`ve seen many films recently with such an intrusive soundtrack . I can however forgive these flaws because NOTLD is guerilla film making at its very best , it`s got a simple strength and that is it has a very good script where both imagination and drama grabs you and doesn`t let go - A crashed satillite returning from Venus reanimates the dead ? Utter nonsense of course but the scenario is so well written you can`t help being swept along with the terror as the protagonists watch the world disintergrate on TV . Compare this movie to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and tell me what one is more enjoyable ? No contest is it ?I liked this movie many years ago and still like it today . Such a pity the production values didn`t come up to the standards of the script , but that said it`s still more compelling than the stuff coming out of Hollywood today",

A mysterious plague caused by a satellite that expands a high level of radiation, it creates the recently dead to rise from their graves and scout the countryside and surrounding a farmhouse for feed on and where find shelter a hapless group. The legions of dead people who stalk the house are looking exasperatingly for live humans .The first time the Zombies appeared was in \u00a8White Zombie(1932)\u00a8. From then on Zombies remained a firm staple of terror B-genre , bringing the dead back to life was a popular pastime in the 30s and 40s. The early zombies were basically genteel beings and generally likable and agreeable types. Romero created in Pittsburg his own production company Image Ten Productions with his friends, John Russo among them and they each contributed 10.000 dollars and formed the budget for his first movie which made Romero world famous. George A. Romero cast an African-American Duane Jones, unusual by the time.When Romero directed this claustrophobic picture , he gave birth to the modern Zombie genre and the film has had a lasting importance, giving interesting consideration to the violence executed by the zombies. It was initially dismissed as exploitation, but when was re-released , it struck deeply with a disillusioned youth angry with the desperation about Vietnam. It was one of the first successful independent terror productions influencing and inspiring countless imitations, copies and rip-offs. Followed by three equally cellebrated sequels, \u00a8Dawn of the dead(78)\u00a8where the zombies attack a shopping mall ,\u00a8Day of the dead dead(85)\u00a8 about flesh-eating zombies taking over the world and scientific experimenting on zombies and \u00a8Land of dead(2005)\u00a8 with high budget played by Simon Baker,Asia Argento and Dennis Hooper. And also an inferior remake in 1990 by Tom Savini with Tone Todd(Duane Jones's role) in which again a bunch of people are pursued by ghouls Zombies .",

It stands as a great example of imagination over budget and has influenced scores of horror pictures.

The story is full of claustrophobic suspense and unrelenting chills! Even now, several decades after its making, this film is still as frightening as ever. In fact few horror films ever reach the terribly scary heights of Night of the Living Dead.The films cast is great. Duane Jones is strong as the leading man. Judith O'Dea is touching and sympathetic as a traumatized young woman. Russ Steiner is memorable as O'Dea's joking brother, who delivers the films most haunting line \"they're coming to get you Barbara...\".

Romero, because it is a milestone in the zombie genre. \"Night of the Living Dead\" is essentially the foundation for the zombie genre, and it paved the way for the genre and shaped it into what we have today. And as such, then Romero really established something unique and cemented his own name to be forever associated with the living dead.I am not going to be a fanboy and look past all the flaws and shortcomings to this movie, because they are there, for sure. But still, this is an entertaining movie, and taking into consideration the year in which it was made and released, was quite a bold venture into the cinema.Without delving too deep into the storyline, as I assume that as a horror fan you will already be more than familiar with \"Night of the Living Dead\" in one of the many variants it has come in. It is about a group of strangers trapped in a small farm house with hordes of the living dead surrounding them, wanting to eat their flesh.The story has been made immortal by George A. Romero, certainly, and it is an entertaining story that is brought to the screen by a rather visionary directing at the time being. And the cast that they had gotten together for the movie were also doing quite good jobs. There were some rather memorable performances throughout the movie.As for the effects, well, take into consideration that this movie is from 1968, so it would seem rather crude by today's standards. But the effects serve their intent and purpose well enough, and helped to flesh out the movie on the screen, no pun intended.\"Night of the Living Dead\" is a movie that you can't be familiar with if you are a zombie aficionado.

            "content": "This movie succeeds in many respects, that it is the prototype of modern zombies, and many movie situations. It's also good as to where the emphasis is (story and characters) and that it has substance.The emphasis isn't so much on the zombies but on the characters and how they deal with the zombies; the debate as to the best defence, the escape plan. The characters (aside from Harry Cooper) are sympathetic, Ben is just trying to keep the zombies out and figure an escape, Barbara is shocked and delirious, Tom and Judy want to stay together, Helen trusts the judgement of others and cares for Karen, and Karen is unwell. The movie is not boring either, it doesn't drag out, and long.Not only is it the beginning of the zombie genre as we know it, it's also appears to be the beginning of the concept of being besieged that make up many horrors and sci-fis. While there is a debate in the farmhouse, the zombies know what they want and they all want it. And while they aren't a team they do not fight amongst themselves. In modern movies where the protagonists are besieged, the enemy is intelligent, physically strong, fearless, stealthy (in some cases), unusual, works together, often has superior numbers, and has often never been fought before. A number of these factors are possessed by the zombies in this movie. The besieged protagonists in many movies have to deal with limited resources, frightened members, injured members, and an enemy from within. This concept has been passed on to numerous movies since (such as the other \"Dead\" movies, Aliens, Ghosts from Mars, and Dog Soldiers as well as many others), but none have really given the entertainment and substance that this has, with Aliens being the only exception. I cannot speak of the succeeding \"Dead\" movies as I have not yet seen them.This film also has substance (however even though most horror movies are predictable, plot less, and clich\u00e9d that is what quite often makes them my escapism; but this one is still superior); there is a plot, the story flows well, has structure, and there are no inconsistencies. It's also backed up with a social commentary, I am not saying a good movie needs to send a message, but it adds to the goodness of this film. It's a social comment on the late Vietnam War era; the establishment don't know what to do and humans are being made into killers (quite literally). And even if you disregard the social-commentary, it still makes good entertainment.The movie achieves everything above, without the use of stunts and over the top special effects.All in all, the result is a good movie, good characters, structure, and substance. One of the best horror movies ever. It has earned itself a 9/10. Romero and Russo do many proud, judging from the votes.",

Romero placed the movie in real, ordinary locations and that was one big innovation for the genre. And it is after all these years still scary as hell in the horror scenes, but the long preparation scenes in between and radio and TV broadcasts coming through are now somewhat old-fashioned and actually boring. The ending is still as intriguing as the movie itself.There has been a lot of second-guessing about the double meaning of this movie. While the sequel was clearly about consumerism, this has over the years had many interpretations: criticizing American society, the wrongs of cold war politics, racism, misogyny, government and media disinformation and mistrust, the Vietnam war and the military at large. A certain theme is the overall apathy by the general public, the so-called silent majority. Gary Streiner, sound engineer of the movie, dismissed most interpretations recently during the Berlinale Classics screening as unintended but in interviews Romero has said the movie reflected the tensions of the time: \"It was 1968, man.

Inside she finds other survivors but before long they are surrounded by flesh eating reanimated corpses...\nZombie films were nothing new in 1968, they could be traced back at least until the 1930's (White Zombie), and a few had been shot in colour by this time (The Dead One - 1961; Hammer's Plague of the Zombies). But what sets Romero's film apart is that here the dead aren't brought back to life by voodoo but by radiation, therefore giving a modern, scientific explanation to it. And unlike previous zombies these ones devour human flesh. Both these factors were to prove pivotal in the sub-genre and 50 years on countless zombie films have been made (not always a good thing!). Horror critic/historian Kim Newman credits NOTLD as being the first modern horror film and indeed he has a good point, though in my opinion I would give that honour to Hitchcock's masterpiece Psycho. And gore by 1968 was nothing new (the films of HG Lewis, eg Blood Feast).\nThis was filmed on a low budget and at times it shows. Some of the acting is a little wooden, including a few of the ghouls. But Romero manages to deliver a powerful film in which the tension steadily builds (it is quite heavy on dialogue at times) to it's shocking finale. I'm not including a spoiler but one death in particular is very brutal, especially for it's time. There are obviously political references here too, just as there are in say Dawn of the Dead.\nIt's a movie that deserves to be viewed several times but be warned - there are many releases out there and they can vary greatly in quality. These include colourised versions, one of which I have just watched. OK, it shows up the gore but otherwise it's pretty pointless. This was filmed in black and white and that's how it's meant to be seen. If you consider yourself a horror/zombie fan but have not yet seen this then you really need to!",

After many viewings, I am still terrified when the man walking among the cemetery monuments (Bill Heinzman) suddenly begins to attack Barbara (Judith O'Dea) before moving on to her brother, Johnny, (Russell Streiner), and then begins to chase her into an isolated farmhouse before being joined by what becomes an army of his fellow ghouls, mysteriously raised from the dead. Heinzman not only imitates Karloff very well, but he looks like him! It's a very frightening nightmare brought realistically to life on the screen.Although the music is stock material, it was well chosen for its fear effect and downright eeriness. Considering its low budget, Romero's ability to create a film that reaches such a high mark on the chill meter is very commendable. In other words, I was scared spineless from the very start.One of the problems with the film, however, is that it fails to sustain the intensity of its opening scenes and loses its punch along the way. I understand that the dialogue is often spontaneous, but it is also often weak, as is at least some of the acting. This may be controversial, but I didn't get the racial theme that many IMDb reviewers noted. I saw Ben as just another \"non-dead\" victim without observing any social or political significance in the color of his skin. Harry views both Ben and Tom, who is white, with contempt. I didn't understand why Ben didn't shout out \"Help! I'm not a zombie!\" as soon as he heard gunshots outside. He had to know that the zombies were incapable of aiming and shooting weapons. Also, the scientists and military officials in Washington were not very credible. They were actually laughable, as was their silly dialogue.In spite of the weaknesses, this film remains as a remarkable, pioneering classic in the horror genre, and it will continue to arouse much fear and trepidation within me for some time to come.",

As for those who may not find that older films have much appeal, this one does. Its story not only carries its own origin but also contains a well thought out written tone and a very addicting plot. Not to mention this film even has gore. Yes, gore.The premise is very basic, a group of random individuals happen to meet up at house to hide from flesh-eating entranced humans, otherwise known as zombies. Bruce Capristo, the head of the makeup department did a great job at making the zombies look like normal people. Yet, the audience and characters alike can tell the difference between themselves and the zombies. Weird as it is, this will be the only movie Capristo would take credit for. After this he did not move on into other movies. It's also surprising to me how after this movie became a hit, that none of the actors really moved forward with their careers either. Because of this, the actors in this movie remain \"no-name\" actors.Which brings me to my next point: characters. In most cases, when a movie has such a basic premise, character development ends up taking a back seat. Why? Because most audiences are more interested in seeing the plot device in action more than they are in the main characters. But what Romero and his screen writing partner, John A. Russo did was balance the screen time between the scenes of confronting zombies and the lead roles discussing how they're going to escape. This keeps the audience from becoming too bored with too much dialog or too much zombies. This holds true because too much of one thing isn't good in general. There needs to be a balance.What remains the most potent about this picture is just how overwhelming this situation is and how quickly hope can be lost if this were to be a reality. Oddly enough, one would think that because zombies move so slowly, it would be easy to evade them. Better think twice about that claim. Even for these undead beings, they are relentless. To think if you had twenty to fifty of them around you,...sounds like its time to curl up in fetal position and go to that happy place every person has in their head. This is what Romero does with his audience, by creating a hopeless tone. It will seem like any direction taken towards escaping won't work and it's done very effectively.But while this is effective, another great aspect to this tone is by instilling a small glimmer of hope every time an opportunity opens. This is what makes this story so gripping. I would feel right to let go and give up, but it wouldn't because you know there has to be a way to win. Also, the musical composer, William Loose did a fair job at the score. It definitely sounds like music and it does contain a reoccurring theme for the film and for the zombies themselves, so it does work.The last area that surprised me was just how gory this late 1960's black and white film was. I mean, how did audiences back then take this film? People must have flipped out so much that it caused mass hysteria. It's obvious in a lot of scenes that the people parts used in the zombie scenes were animal parts but wow. I'm surprised Romero was let back into the film business after that. I actually wasn't expecting much at all but I'm pretty sure Romero had a lot more to put on the screen. I liked how things went with Romero's first film piece. It was evenly paced and kept me wondering what would happen next. How many films are like that nowadays?Film legend George A. Romero has brought a treasure to generations to come, even if many would call it at the time malignant. When in fact, zombies are exactly that in our culture today. Night of the Living Dead is well constructed and boasts gross imagery even for 1968.",

Maybe it was because the DVD version of Dawn of the Dead was the same as my director's cut version (which is cut), or maybe, more realistically, it was due to the fact that the version of NOTLD (which is how overweight virgin internet reviewers like to call it) was some f*cking b*stardized 1999 version with new footage added.A name cropped up in this new version. Bill Hinzmann. Now, 99% of the population have better things to do than know what this guy is all about. Us 1% that do care know that he was the original zombie in NOTLD (which is how etc)...who also made an eighties movie called Zombie Nosh about his character from NOTLD (which zzzzzz). Now the moron, along with original writer John Russo made a version of NOTLD (whi) that has new footage and takes 15 mins of footage out of the original. Because there's no copyright on NOTLD (w) and therefore any spazzy out there can do what the f*ck they like to NOTLD. So do you know why I did? That's right. I wiped my *rse on this particular version of NOTFLD and went out and bought the proper version for 2 quid.Which leads me to this review. Maybe one day I can watch the 30th anniversary edition withoutexpelling my lower intestinal tract out my ringpiece in a wide purple tubed arc in my living room, but not just now. Let's stick with the original.Barbara and Johnny head for a graveyard to pay tribute to their wasted dad who lives in a grave three hours' drive from their house, but once they get there BILL HINZMANN who is a zombie attacks them and you know the drill. Johnny gets wasted and Barabaararararara head for the farmhouse where, upon finding a stronger character called Ben, she just zones out and lets him do all the work.It's great this movie. Even though it's ancient, and in a geeky way doesn't adhere to the rules of zombieness, it's still great. You can never go wrong with loads of menace and shouting (see Al Pacino's career). There's not that much gore in here, but in my opinion the fact that the cast sit down to watch telly half way through the film just about sums the future up.....Anyways if you haven't seen it. See it. It only cost me two pounds. Any problems, I'll give you Bill Hinzmann's address and you can kick his head in.It's in black and white too, which isn't a problem to me but seems to fry certain brain circuits of people posting reviews on the IMDb.'i love notld its great but black n white but a kid kills its mom see it now'",

            "content": "Night of the Living Dead starts on an ordinary Sunday afternoon, just like any other. Barabara (Judith O'Dea) & her Brother Johnny (co-producer Russell Streiner, uncredited) are about 200 miles outside Pittsburgh in an isolated graveyard where their dead Father is buried. While laying a reef they are attacked by one of the recently re-animated living dead (S. William Hinzman), Johnny is killed but Barbara manages to escape to a nearby farmhouse. There she meets Ben (Duane Jones) whose truck has run out of gas, together they fight off a few zombies & begin to board the farmhouse windows & doors up. They are not the only people seeking safety & shelter however, in the basement Harry (Karl Hardman), his wife Helen Cooper (Marilyn Eastman) & their ill daughter Karen (Kyra Schon) plus two teenage lovers Tom (Keith Wayne) & Judy (Judith Ridley) are also hiding from the ever growing hordes of the undead outside. They must work together to try & escape the constantly growing in number flesh-eating zombies that surround the farmhouse & seem determined to get in...Co-edited, photographed, co-written & directed by George A. Romero who also has a small cameo Night of the Living Dead was the first film in Romero's fantastic series of zombie films with Dawn of the Dead (1978) following, then came Day of the Dead (1985) & more recently Land of the Dead (2005) & is an absolute classic that every horror fan should see at least once. The script by Romero & John A. Russo works very well, even today. It moves along at a nice pace & never becomes dull or boring. I liked the fact that Night of the Living Dead features real people trying to survive & not concentrating on phony Government bodies & authorities, the character's are both believable & well balanced. I like the idea of them being real people with real fears. The farmhouse makes for a great isolated location & the film builds up well as more & more zombies swarm over the house & we lean as the character's learn through news broadcasts although the exact cause for the dead to rise is somewhat vague & isn't touched upon or explored in great depth which wasn't a problem for me at all, in fact I'd have probably preferred it if no solid explanation was given at all. With a supposed budget of around $114,000 Night of the Living dead is a bit wobbly around the edges but is technically fine, as long as you don't expect the production values of a massive Hollywood blockbuster which unfortunately I imagine most people do these days. The black and white cinematography is acceptable & works in the films favour, continuity isn't too bad, director Romero manages to create some great scenes that will forever live on in horror film history like the opening in the cemetery & the terrific downbeat ending that works perfectly, the music is non-discript & bland but expected considering it's mostly free stock music & the special effects are decent as well with a dead body that has lost it's face, some rotting zombies, some gunshot wounds & we even get some cannibalism & intestine eating. The acting is OK & about as good as one would expect, no-ones going to win any awards but then again no-one embarrasses themselves too much. Night of the Living Dead is a classic, it has stood the test of time very well & makes for an entertaining watch even now. Definitely worth watching, recommended. The remake Night of the Living Dead (1990) is also a very fine film as well.",

            "content": "A threatening musical score counterpoints a tranquil country road setting in the opening scene of \"Night of the Living Dead\"; that road appropriately leading to a cemetery. Very soon, a childhood torment becomes a reality as brother Johnny repeats to his sister - \"They're coming to get you Barbra...\" The first undead creature they encounter results in tragedy, as Johnny stumbles and cracks his head on a stone. Barbra (correct spelling as listed in the credits) for her part breaks the first rule of zombie escape as she heads for a confined space, a lonely country home in the middle of nowhere.We learn that others have beaten her there, having retreated to safety in the wake of mass revivals of dead corpses, the story gradually revealed via a series of radio and television broadcasts. Apparently, radiation on an earthbound satellite that was part of a Venus probe has triggered some kind of awakening in the brains of the recently deceased. The victims have become a \"virtual army of unidentified assassins\", having a penchant for the flesh of living human beings.It would be easy to dismiss NOTLD as a trash zombie flick, but if you follow it closely, an intelligent exposition of the story transcends the film's limited budget and it's skimpy production values. In fact it's the dark and grainy aspect of the movie that gives it a character and a step up on the typical \"B\" grade horror flicks of the preceding era. The classic scene of the nighttime advancing corpses is one that will stay with you long after the movie is over.The movie maintains it's story line consistency as well; when the Cooper's young daughter succumbs to her illness and dies, she comes alive hungry for human flesh and without regard for her closest target, dear old mom. In turn, Helen Cooper comes back none the worse for wear after young Gina hands her a thrashing in spades. As the zombie horde finally breaks into the farm house, protagonist hero Ben barricades himself in the cellar against his own earlier advice, killing the Cooper's a second time, as advised by news reporters covering the countrywide phenomenon - \"Kill the brain and you kill the ghoul\".It's the little things that writer/director George Romero pays attention to as well that make this a horror classic. Remember brother Johnny - well he shows up later in a quick cameo as a member of the zombie horde, returning for his sister.I recall how \"Night of the Living Dead\" created a stir upon it's original release in 1968. Now almost forty years later, movie making technology has advanced to the point of leaving virtually nothing to the imagination. But your first glimpse of the bloody skeletal head at the top of the stairs in NOTLD is the kind of image that nightmares are made of, after your imagination takes over.",

The human characters feel authentic, have good dialogue and have some genuinely interesting and engaging interactions (something lacking from plenty of zombie films).The zombies are very well done. The effects are not as graphic and grotesque as the likes of the Walking Dead as expected, but they are creepy and sinister in their own way.We are given a very solid plot too. The action commences almost immediately, and we are drip fed exposition and explanations throughout the film which was a great decision in terms of the pacing.What really gives this film its charm and its enduring ability is the direction from Romero. Right from the get go there is a sense of unease and dread injected into the very fibre of the film. The whole thing is full of tension and suspense.From the camera work to the score to the setting, everything just fits together to make Night of the Living Dead a terrific piece of cinema.",

            "content": "This was director George A. Romero's feature film debut \u2014 wild to think about considering the classics he has under his belt now (Dawn of the Dead, Creepshow, Monkey Shines) and just how known his name is. Reading some of the reviews that were made at the time is equally wild, such as this one from The New York Times: \"Night of the Living Dead is a grainy little movie acted by what appear to be nonprofessional actors, who are besieged in a farm house by some other nonprofessional actors who stagger around, stiff-legged, pretending to be flesh- eating ghouls.\"I mean, they aren't wrong, but this movie still holds up as a cult classic among horror lovers \u2014 who HASN'T said \"they're coming to get you, Barbra!\" in an imitation of poor short-lived Johnny's voice? It did well upon its release, too \u2014 despite a budget of just $114,000 it grossed $12 million domestically and $18 million internationally. It seems surprising now, since much of mainstream horror is FILLED with unspeakably disturbing images, that it was criticized at the time for its \"explicit gore\". It's part one of three (followed by Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead) \u2014 the stories for each film all written at the same time but executed with quite a few years in between each release \u2014 and Romero has talked about it being heavily influenced by Richard Matheson's 1954 novel I Am Legend.It was the first movie to introduce the modern idea of a zombie \u2014 though they never use the actual word, opting instead for both \"murderer\" and \"ghoul\" \u2014 as a reanimated, flesh-devouring creature.It's heavily ad-libbed and roughly shot \u2014 no real bells and whistles here, though I admired the stark black and white and the use of shadow and light throughout. I think it added to the movie in a real way to have it feel so raw and real.Whether it was initially intended by Romero or not, there's lots of commentary and themes throughout: on society in the 60's as a whole and peoples' disillusionment towards law enforcement and authority as a whole, the Vietnam war (\"We may not enjoy living together, but dying together isn't going to solve anything.\"), and racism (Ben being chased by an all white zombie mob with a torch was very reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan, the upper class white man being offended and angry by Ben not ceding to his wishes and to his grabs for power, Ben surviving an attack of the undead only to be killed by a group of white law enforcement). Romero has said that he didn't cast Ben \u2014 a black lead among an entirely white cast \u2014 on purpose, or as any kind of statement; he said he simply gave the best audition. But once Duane Jones was cast and they started filming, they became aware of the symbolism and the themes that it was important to play into. In general, it was less about monsters turning against people, but people turning against people \u2014 there is no real community formed, no solid efforts to work together to face the threats head on. They are very divided throughout the whole film, and more of them are killed by human error and mistakes rather than the undead themselves.Barbra was like a silent movie star \u2014 so expressive despite not much dialogue. She becomes almost catatonic early on in the movie, and there's lots of tension between her and Ben in several scenes \u2014 again, playing into the racism and general attitude towards people of color in the 60's.I do love that they never call them \"zombies\" \u2014 one of the news reports on the radio said \"there is an epidemic of mass murder being committed by a virtual army of unidentified assassins\", they are called \"marauding ghouls\", and, one of my favorite lines: \"yeah, they're dead, they're all messed up\". Apt.There's several amazing shots that I loved: the shot of the open field as the ghouls all silently lurch toward the house is great. The overall feeling of dread and suffocation is awesome. Them feasting on the bodies in the car was definitely a contributor to the \"explicit gore\" mentioned. And the zombie daughter killing her own mother by repeated stabs with a spade \u2014 as writer R.H.W. Dillard, a defender of the taboo in the film, said, \"What girl has not, at one time or another, wished to kill her mother?\".But maybe my favorite was when the zombies finally are fully encircling the house, beating on doors and windows, and the camera pans to each actor as they express their concern and fear, the lighting as dramatic as ever, everyone SO expressive. The ghouls are slow but unrelenting, and in that moment you kind of feel the full weight of hopelessness.And then there's the ending \u2014 solidifying humans being more dangerous to one another than any outside force, the unreliability of those in power, and the fear of any \"outsiders\" clouding our judgment to a fatal degree. I loved the darkness of it, the finality.I don't think I even need to say it, but it's a classic for a reason \u2014 worth a watch if you've never had the pleasure (or a re-watch if you have!).",

Other movies in his career, such as \"Martin\" and \"The Crazies,\" are notable, but it's Romero's first film, \"Night of the Living Dead,\" that gets all the attention. The 1968 zombie classic made his career, and influenced many follow-ups.Johnny and Barbara are brother and sister. They travel to a cemetery to visit their mother before her grave is moved. Barbara does not take too kindly to the cemetery, it disturbs her. Johnny playfully jokes with her, saying \"They're coming to get you, Barbara.\" And once a slow-moving man approaches them and attacks, the nightmare begins. Johnny is killed and Barbara flees for her life. She finds shelter in a tiny, deserted farmhouse. Soon, she realizes that she's not the only one hiding out. Five other people have isolated themselves in, and the struggle to survive continues. Boarding up the house is only a temporary delay before more flesh-eating ghouls attack. Should they stay upstairs or hide out in the cellar? In a time when hilariously awful B-grade horror films were being produced, \"Night of the Living Dead\" was a shocking surprise, and still is. The MPAA rating system had a fit with Romero's film, and when it was released to the public, it scared the living daylights out of everyone, including little kids who thought they were seeing a normal Saturday matin\u00e9e(Roger Ebert's rave review for the film also examines the reactions of the audience).The film definitely has an advantage in being shot in black and white. It gives off the feeling of an amateur documentary, that this could really happen.Next to the mood and atmosphere, why does \"Night of the Living Dead\" work so horrifyingly well? Well, in all of Romero's movies, not just the \"Dead\" films, there is social commentary littered throughout. And you'll definitely find that this film has a message or two. Some saw the film as an insight into racism. It was the first film to have an African-American hero, after all. But Romero chose Duane Jones for Ben simply because he fit the part. Also, many fans examine the film as an example of the Communist movement, that you couldn't trust anyone or anything. The zombies could be anybody. They could be your neighbor, your daughter, your husband or wife. It is truly a scary concept.The film also has undeniable claustrophobia. We are uncomfortably sealed in with the survivors, and once the zombies get in, we're not getting out. Not even the cellar can help our protagonists.In 1968 and today's generation, \"Night of the Living Dead\" rang and still does ring true to every viewer. Is this what our world will come to be? Will we be unable to trust the ones we know? Will they become emotionless, mindless murderers, and will our society crumble? Romero's film is not just a 60's horror film, and it never ages. Despite the difference in years, the dead are very much alive.",

In their version, the people in the farmhouse were hosting a party but everyone forgot to bring the groceries! So the problem became how to fight off angry and hungry party guests. In this case, just hand them whatever you can grab (wood, nails, etc). In the scene where Ben flips over the table, the dialog was: \"The first thing we got to do is get rid of the table! If they don't see a table, they won't expect to eat!\"after he flips over the table: \"Hey Chlorine! This table has better legs than you do!\" \"Oh really?

Our story has a group of people gathered inside a farmhouse where they not only have to battle the dead but also each other.George A. Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is without question one of the greatest horror films ever made and it's also quite possibly the greatest \"B\" movie ever made. It's rather amazing to see how well this film still holds up decades after its release and it's even more amazing to see how well it holds up no matter how many times you watch it. The film is a reminder of what can be done with a low budget and some creativity and it remains one of the greatest shockers ever made.Even though the gore level would be topped in DAWN OF THE DEAD and countless other movies, there's just something so dark and sinister about this movie. There's no question that the B&W cinematography adds a layer of fear because you just look out into those dark fields, see the dead slowly come towards you and it just shows that time is running time. The opening sequence is perfectly done because Romero shoots it at a frantic pace and it just puts you right there in the action. The same is true for the chaos at the end when all hell breaks loose.Romero did a remarkable job and managed to make the film almost seem like a documentary. The rawness of everything just makes it seem all the more real and there's no question that some of the most famous moments in horror history can be found here. The most chilling aspects are seeing the world around these people collapse as they can't even work together even when facing death. To this day the scene in the basement between the mother and her child is one of the most haunting ever filmed.NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD features some raw performances but I think they just help the film ever more. Duane Jones is perfect as Ben and I think Judith O'Dea is also extremely good in her role. The supporting players are just as effective and together you've certainly got a great group of characters to root for or against.The film is about as great as you can get and it constantly gets better with time. Romero has now made a total of six films in this series and fans will debate whether this one or DAWN is better. To me, both are pretty flawless movies and the highest quality of zombie pictures.",

Romero and Russo tackle head on major issues that remain timely and topical even today: The unreliability of the clueless media, the danger posed by average citizens having easy access to firearms, people failing to put their differences aside in order to work together so they can survive a perilous situation, and society starting to come apart at the seams when faced with a baffling problem that it's patently unprepared for and hence unable to properly deal with. In a movie rich with dark and delicious ironies, one of the richest and mot biting ironies of all is that the idea proposed by the selfish and cowardly Harry Cooper (well played to the slimy and sniveling hilt by Karl Hardman) to hole up in the basement is much better than Ben's insistence on remaining upstairs. Wholly deserving of its classic status.",

One third of the east coast is terrorized by the recently deceased and these slow stumbling zombies crave human flesh. The earliest form of defense is to shoot and then burn. After all; bras, draft cards, flags...almost everything was targets of the torch in the late 60s. A group of people think that they have found safety in a farm house near a cemetery.

            "content": "Night of the Living Dead (1968) follows a group of Pennsylvanians who barricade themselves into an old farm house when a zombie outbreak breaks loose. This is a brilliant and game changing film. It had a super original concept for the time and I highly appreciate how this helped to progress horror! You can definitely tell most zombie movies have taken inspiration from this movie.Despite a few mistakes that weren't too noticeable, this was a really well filmed movie. There were a lot of zooms for dramatic effect and a really interesting use of shadows. The cinematography and editing gave the film an ominous and almost experimental flare.The acting was for the most part very strong, and the characters were well written. I particularly loved Ben, he was a clever yet compassionate character. Alongside this, I found the differences in Ben and Barbra's characters to be very intriguing.Something I found to be effective in the film was how they used news and radio footage to explain what was going on and help the viewer to understand. The theories brought up to explain why the dead were rising felt unique and refreshing.This movie was super gruesome for the time and, in my opinion, this aged very well. The visual effects looked good and genuinely horrifying; the scene where Karen turns into a zombie was terrifying and really caught me off guard even though I expected it.The score was pretty crazy but super fitting! Also, I really liked the sound design as I feel a lot of thought went into it. The echoes used were powerful and I wish I could've seen this in a cinema!Lastly, the movie was paced very well and managed to be consistently tense and gripping all throughout. It leads up to a hectic and chaotic climax, with an ending that really shocked me and I did NOT see it coming!",

            "content": "A farmhouse is besieged by zombies.I can't say I enjoyed Night Of The Living Dead, but I appreciate that it is brilliantly made and the impact it had on future horror movies.The plot is quite simple, a group of people try to survive an onslaught of 'ghouls'. We not only witness the gruesome horror of the reanimated dead, but the awful actions of some of the living in response to it.I've been guilty of overthinking movies in the past but there feels like there is a subtext. You should probably google to find deeper opinions on the matter, but the lead character is an African American and given that the movie was made in the latter part of the sixties, how the character conducts himself in comparison to the white characters it is (for the era) quite provocative. Also what happens at the end is pretty shocking and I'm sure plenty has been read into it, along with what (politically/socially) the zombies and living represent. Personally my take is that it (irrespective of politics or minority/majority groups) gives a pretty pessimistic view of humanity in survival and chaotic situations.What impresses me the most is how on a small budget George A Romero managed to create something truly powerful and plausible considering the subject matter. Roger Ebert famously wrote a review not of the film, but of the audience's horrified reaction, which is not surprising when you consider the era and how realistic the gore seems with the black and white cinematography.Performances seem real due to the improvised dialogue and non-glamourised characterisation, like we are watching a documentary about an actual apocalypse. The news reports shown are particularly effective to create an atmosphere of impending doom.Every zombie movie or television show owes everything to Night Of The Living Dead and, for me, along with Romero's sequel, Dawn Of The Dead, it is the high point of the genre.For me it's is a 8.5/10 but I always round upwards.",

            "content": "I've debated writing about this film for the site for a long time. It's beyond a seminal movie and it's also from right where we call home. There's probably no modern horror movie as important as this one for so many reasons and so many films have their inspiration right here.I've spent a lifetime in advertising, so I can see how making television commercials and industrial films as part of The Latent Image pushed George Romero, John Russo and Russell Streiner to make their own movie.And horror movies? Horror movies sell.Shot between June and December 1967 in Evans City with friends, relatives, local actors and interested locals, this movie was made for around $114,000 but looks like so much more. The crew had been through the ringer - they did the original Calgon \"Ancient Chinese Secret\" commercial - and they knew how to get the most out of every shot.You have no idea what it was like as a kid to drive past Evans City nearly every day, knowing that the dead lived there.The movie was a huge success, obviously. That's why we're talking about it here. And yet, there's so much that makes it a regional film, as it has local people like horror host Bill Cardille in it. And it feels, well, exactly like living in Western Pennsylvania. We've been preparing for the zombie uprising since before people knew there was such a thing.The movie starts with Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny (Streiner) in a cemetery, arguing over visiting their parents. Their sibling games soon give way to terror when what looks like a homeless man murders Johnny and sends Barbara racing away, finally discovering what seems to be an abandoned farmhouse. There, she meets Ben* (Duane Jones), a black hero saving a white woman in a time that these things just weren't done. But the true joy of Night of the Living Dead is that unlike modern elevated horror, this is no message movie. These are just the right people to tell the story.It's funny because Romero has often cited Richard Matheson's I Am Legend as his inspiration, but that author has said that this movie was \"kind of cornball.\" What does he know?The movie ups the tension when we discover that a married couple, Harry and Helen Cooper, and their daughter Karen have been hiding in the basement, The young girl has been bitten by a ghoul and Harry is obsessed with barricading himself and his family in the house while Ben wants to escape. In truth, no one is right and everyone pays the price. There is no happy ending in Evans City.Perhaps the most astounding thing to me about Night of the Living Dead is its public domain status. Its original distributor, the Walter Reade Organization, never put a copyright on the prints. There was one under its original title, Night of the Flesh Eaters, but when the name change occurred, Walter Reade also removed that copyright notice.That's why when the VHS era started, you could actually buy this movie, as well as why it shows up in so many other movies and in DVD multipacks. There's also the unfairly maligned Savini remake that this site needs to get to someday, which I love because Barbara is a more capable heroine and also because I saw it in a theater near Zelienople and when they said the name of the town, people lost their minds.Roger Ebert's review of this film has always stuck with me: \"The kids in the audience were stunned. There was almost complete silence. The movie had stopped being delightfully scary about halfway through, and had become unexpectedly terrifying. There was a little girl across the aisle from me, maybe nine years old, who was sitting very still in her seat and crying ... It's hard to remember what sort of effect this movie might have had on you when you were six or seven. But try to remember. At that age, kids take the events on the screen seriously, and they identify fiercely with the hero. When the hero is killed, that's not an unhappy ending but a tragic one: Nobody got out alive. It's just over, that's all.\"That's probably why I like it so much.*According to an interview on Homepage of the Dead, Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman said, \"Duane Jones was a very well educated man (and he) simply refused to do the role as it was written. As I recall, I believe that Duane himself upgraded his own dialogue to reflect how he felt the character should present himself.\"",

            "content": "Without Night of the Living Dead, there wouldn't be any Walking Dead or any of the modern history 'walking contradictions Zombies' movies. Before this movie, zombies were mindless human beings control by voodoo witches or doctors. Surprising there is no zombies is this film, at less not call 'zombies'. They are call 'Ghouls' here. George Romero wasn't really trying to make a zombie movie at all. At first, Romero was making a teenage alien movie comedy. After failing at that idea, the straight angle is that Romero didn't made the zombie movie. He mold it, drawing inspiration from Richard Matheson's I am Legend, a horror/science fiction novel about a vampire-like creature plague that ravages the world and really much rip it off. Night of Anubis and Night of the Flesh Eaters later becomes Night of the Living Dead- the modern day gore full horror. I would rather see a horror movie that could actually scare me to just one with a bunch of gruesome scenes turned into a movie. While this movie has some pretty ugly gore scenes, the story plot is very interesting. Since the movie is in the public domain, there is many versions of the film such as colorization version. The colorization version is alright, but seeing green zombies just reminds me of Frankenstein. I would rather have the grey zombies in the color version. The original copies are the black and white low budget film that tells the story of survivors of the zombie apocalypse whom trapped in a rural farmhouse being attacked by unnamed living dead creatures. Night of the Living Dead takes place in real time (there are no forward jumps or flashbacks), bringing us an hour and a half of a group of people defending themselves from murderous zombies. This temporal continuity is quite unusual in contemporary film. The first survivor is Barbara (Judith O'Dea), a main character whom trauma makes her useless. She is over-acting. Act naturally, Judith. It's interesting how women are portrayed in this film: Quiet, defenseless, reliant. Barbara while visiting somebody's tombstone with her brother Johnny was attack by the very first zombie played by Bill Heinzman. Bill Heinzman plays it off following Boris Karloff's monster in Frankenstein in the way, the creature moves. WIthout Bill Heinzman, we couldn't know how zombies can move. She is the first character to come into view, but the real hero is Ben (Duane Jones), the only survivor who has a bit of common sense and looks like he might be the only one worthy to survive. Without giving it away, the ending to the film is shocking. The movie came out the same year Martin Luther King was assassination. I really don't buy the happy accident casting for it was controversial to cast a black actor at the time. There clearly some social commentary in the film due to the dramatic shift in tone from most other horror movies at the time, the constant emphasis in the radio and TV broadcasts of just how inhuman these 'zombies' are and how people should feel no problem dealing a tremendous blow to the head, and the merry band of rednecks who are chomping at cigars and blowing the hell out of everything they encounter. It didn't help that theme of 'zombie' came from Haitian culture. For me, the creepiest, most unnerving part of the movie isn't the zombies, but rather that theremin-scored photo montage that plays over the credits. A lot of people think the movie was made due to the late 1960s critique of American capitalism with the zombies represent capitalists, and \"cannibalism represents the ultimate in possessiveness, hence the logical end of human relations under capitalism\". I can see the movie themes being something about the Vietnam conflict to racism in America. I just don't see that. I think of it as just a good zombie flick with no message. Yes, the movie is low budget with bits of bad editing from day to night. The zombies can be a bit silly in the modern term with over-acting. Also having intrusive soundtrack, but the movie does have some reason to be well-known. Check it out, zombies fans.",

            "content": "\"Night of the Living Dead\" is dirty, unwholesome and indefensible. We return to it for the same reason we go back to sleep and willingly return to a nightmare. We want to revel in ugliness and horror. The same is true for two other powerful horror movies, \"The Exorcist\" and \"Psycho.\" All three are nasty pieces of work; this one is merely the crudest.George Romero directed, co-wrote and co-produced this exploitation film on a shoestring budget with bad actors. The script is well-plotted, but the dialogue is bad whenever the characters reveal backstory or talk about their feelings. The direction, photography and editing are amazingly skillful considering the limitations on money; and the creepy stock music is deftly chosen throughout.To review the cast: the leading lady overacts. The black leading man looks uncomfortable whenever he has large chunks of dialogue. The two young lovers are extremely ill at ease. The angry father hits one note and hits it loud. The mother often hesitates slightly after her cues. The TV people, however, come off as natural and often comic, especially the simpleminded sheriff and the real-life Pittsburgh newsman.Many of the scenes are memorable for their combination of the everyday and the extraordinary. Who can visit a graveyard without thinking of the lumbering man who turns out to be a killer zombie? The whole fantastic idea of the dead eating the living can be seen as a metaphor for the familiar conflict between the past and the present.The filmmakers recall Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds\" when the zombies invade the boarded-up farmhouse, scenes that have themselves been parodied and imitated endlessly. This familiarity adds to the feeling that we're watching something we once dreamt. The most unpleasant scene, even worse than the zombies chomping on human flesh or fighting over intestines, is the spade murder in the cellar. This is a crude imitation of Hitchcock's infamous shower scene in \"Psycho,\" but Hitchcock's (and Saul Bass's) artistry allow us to coldly admire it even while reveling in its horror and perversity. The spade scene allows us no such distance. It is undiluted nastiness.\"Night\" ranks among the scariest horror movies, partly for raising the bar on gore. Yet raising the bar far higher has made later horror movies far less scary. By the 1980s, horror movies were gore-splattered freak shows with expensive puppets, and now they're freak shows with digital characters that seem to belong in video games. \"Night of the Living Dead,\" by contrast, looks like a documentary.",

Things just seem to come magically together, from casting, to great camera work, to spooky effects. My knuckles are still white from the latest viewing. I keep thinking there is some provocative subtext to the story, especially with Afro-American Jones in the lead role and playing a real hero. But I still can't find one. Instead, I think it's exactly what it appears to be: one heckuva fright film. The first and last parts are the best, concentrating on shudders the way they do. The middle part is more like human interest, random characters thrown together having to sort things out. Anyway, Romero did for Zombie films what Lugosi did for vampires. No, it's not as gory as most fright films of today. But the technique is perfect for the material, so catch how a bunch of near-amateurs manage to trump the professional Hollywood crowd.",

It should be noted that Romero was not involved in making that cut. Turning our attention back to the original... this is a marvelous argument, when making a case for fans and young enthusiasts directing. When they are talented and/or have something to say, it can turn out this excellent. This was immensely shocking when it came out, and to this day it's powerful. The script is well-written and treats the audience with respect. No one here acts stupid simply because it was convenient for the author; if or when they do, it's believable, such as the person being (understandably) emotional, and you're at no point pulled out of the experience of the viewing. And in fact, the well-developed, credible and diverse characters do a lot of smart things, and you find yourself cheering for them and hoping they make it, rather than with the newer flicks, where, frankly, it's not uncommon to have the reaction that goes something like this: \"...well, if you're that daft, maybe they should kill you\". The pacing is spot-on, you never feel completely safe for the hour and a half, but it doesn't overwhelm you to the point of over-stimulation, either. This masterfully builds and maintains an atmosphere of terror and impending death, in a bleak and unpleasant world. George understood that horror does not have to involve a force that moves swiftly; they don't even have to possess superior physical strength. The fear comes from this grotesque twist on the mundane and usual. People, potentially even someone you used to know. And it is also derived from the determination, the unstoppable nature... and that they do not need to be fast. Time is on their side... and so are numbers. The acting is a tad mixed, though none of it is downright poor, and O'Dea is stunning, playing catatonic. It's worth mentioning, too, that this has a teenage-ish couple who are in love, without them being constantly randy, irritating or dumb. It's honestly rather sweet, and adds to the humanity of those we follow in this. I will not give away very much of the plot, though I can reveal that this starts with two siblings driving to a cemetery. The dialog is well-delivered, and exposition is handled convincingly, and comes across as being natural. This is intense, scary and dark. It helps to try to forget everything you know about the zombie-sub-genre from later releases. The music is a well-composed score, and always fits. FX are well-done for the time and the budget, and definitely inventive. They don't distract, and they work. There is a moderate amount of gruesome and fairly graphic, bloody violence, disturbing content and gore in this, as well as brief nudity, and mild and infrequent language. The Trilogy of the Dead disc set includes a photo gallery of 8 stills, 5 pages of liner notes, and a trailer. I recommend this to any fan of these movies. 8/10",

            "content": "A film that popularized \"zombie movies\" never actually uses the word \"zombies.\" The living dead are only referred to as \"ghouls.\" To an audience that presumably didn't understand the concept of a zombie (since they were not very widely known at the time), it's explained quite well and in a cleverly deliberate manner. None of the characters immediately understand what is happening because why would they? Only through a series of newscasts does the situation become clear. The characters learn that the recently deceased have come back to life (thanks to some radiation effects) to kill and devour the living. This is their first encounter with what we will later call \"zombies.\"'Night of the Living Dead' is, like many horror classics, a movie that is eventually scary. By that I mean it's not scary right away like modern horror movies. The first half is a bit slow and totally dated. It doesn't really hold up in a cinematic way, and it certainly isn't frightening. It comes across as unintentional comedy, or perhaps even intentional comedy. Either way, the material is inherently silly and benign. Around the midpoint, something genuinely horrific happens. Then the tension escalates, and the possibilities suddenly seem endless. Everyone felt somewhat safe up until that point. Sure, one character had died and it is implied that plenty of other unseen people had died off screen too, but the deaths and violence are tame. This moment opens up the floodgates. From there, a series of atrocities take place that would still be considered shocking today and were most certainly beyond shocking when audiences first saw them in 1968. These moments aren't so funny. Even though the film is 50 years old, I still won't mention spoilers, because that's the level of respect I give to these moments. They deserve to unleashed on viewers without prior notice.In addition to making a visceral fright fest, Director George Romero also tackled racial dynamics, though he admitted this was unintentional. Nevertheless, this commentary resonated with audiences in an impactful way. In the 1960s, Black characters were hardly ever presented as heroes or even as equals to their white counterparts on screen. But the lead in this film is a competent, composed Black man who takes charge when everyone else behaves hysterically in response to the \"ghouls.\" A white man feels threatened and compelled to assume control. Though none of this is directly addressed in dialogue, one cannot help but notice the implications. It gives the film layers and makes it more than just a well-crafted zombie flick.It's an additional element like this that makes 'Living Dead' an all-time horror classic.",

            "content": "This is one of those all-time classic horror movies, enjoyed by generation after generation and extremely notorious for being graphic and frightening, just like THE EXORCIST and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's also one of the films responsible for ushering in a whole new wave of horror in the 197's (for good or bad), where the emphasis was on gore and realism instead of the Gothic fantasy tales produced in the '60s by Corman and Hammer.It's amazing, really, that a film made on an extremely low budget (with locals as extras) and basically set in just one location can have such an excellent reputation. The reason this film works is that everything is perfect: the scares, the acting, the camera-work, the makeup. The black and white photography is a virtue in this case; instead of dating the film (keep your distance from any suspicious colourised versions you see floating around) it emphasises the fear of the unknown, the fact that in the shadows something horrible could be waiting to pounce.The opening of the film sets the scene admirably and is the creepiest part. After a bit of dialogue between a brother and sister in a cemetery (including the infamous line \"I'm coming to get you, Barbara!\"), we see a man stumbling across the graves in the distance, quiet, slowly closing in. This is our first sighting of a zombie and remains one of the most subtle and chilling moments in the history of the genre.Of course, with a film of this status, there have got to be flaws, one being the character of Barbara, who is quite simply an idiot. She doesn't help, she looks stupid, and she acts badly with it. Frankly I could have done without her character completely, she adds nothing to the film, does nothing apart from sit around and be simple. Thankfully this atrocity is countered by Duane Jones, who plays the hero of the piece; he's believable and one of those characters you really feel you can turn to and rely on in moments of need. Karl Hardman makes a good and slimy antagonist, and the rest of the cast all do well, considering the fact that they were amateurs.As well as the gently creepy moments, there are plenty of sudden shocks, hands bursting through windows, a close up of a rotted face. These counter the quieter and more psychological shocks well. The way that the number of zombies outside the farmhouse gradually builds up is a gradual slide into hopelessness, portrayed very well and preparing us for the final horrific moments where the zombies invade the building. I love films with siege situations, everything from DOG DAY AFTERNOON to ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, and this is one of the very best.Although it was made in the '60s, the gore level is high for this film; today I would say it isn't suitable for the squeamish although obviously in the wake of the slasher overdrive it's not quite as shocking as it was on first release. A trowel murder is particularly nasty (and you have to admire the ingenuity of using chocolate sauce as a substitute for blood!), as are some scenes of cannibalism, which have been oft-copied. Action fans should also give this film a go, as there's plenty of shooting and Molatov cocktails being thrown around, although this film is more dialogue-concentrated than, say, DAWN OF THE DEAD. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is one of those rare beasts, a horror film which actually does deserve its own reputation and shouldn't be missed.",

We know that something strange is going on, because just as Johnny exits the car, the radio comes back on, and we discover that something had knocked it off the air. In the cemetery, Barbra is then attacked by a strange man but manages to escape, finding refuge in a local farmhouse where she, along with a few others who found the same refuge, struggle to survive repeated attacks from what turn out to be recently deceased people brought back to life by a strange radiation.The horror element is very well done. There are some very graphic moments of the \"ghouls\" eating flesh, but it isn't gratuitous - the purpose of those shots seems to be to introduce the viewer to the same horror being seen by the characters. Inside the farmhouse, as this small group tries to survive, the focus is on the dynamics between them, shifting back to the ghouls only when an escape plan is worked out. Radio and TV are used very effectively to allow the characters (and the viewers) to gain knowledge of what's going on not just at this farmhouse but all over. Interestingly for 1968, the movie portrays a black man (played by Ben Hanser) as taking charge of the situation in the farmhouse. That the radiation came from outer space plays upon a fear that did exist in the early years of space flight - what if something terrible came back from outer space with an astronaut? (Remember the lengthy quarantines the early Apollo astronauts were subjected to after their flights.) The low budget feel of the movie isn't a problem, and in fact in some ways adds to the creepy feel. I might take issue with the title. It gives away what might have been the highlight - struggling with the authorities to figure out just what these \"murderers\" actually are",

            "content": "As countless others have already stated, I think everyone can agree that this film is nothing short of a masterpiece. The black and white camerawork adds a mysterious and foreboding atmosphere to a movie already filled with chilling imagery. The reason why it is simply one of the best horror movies ever made is because it's like the Beatles of zombie movies. It changed everything about the genre and influenced everything that happened after it. Virtually every zombie film coming out nowadays can trace its origin back to this one. Romero was a revolutionary figure in the genre and pioneered the use of zombies as we know them today. Before this film, zombie movies were few and far between, and the zombies in them bore little resemblance to what comes to mind when people think of one now. If you want to understand how truly inspirational and influential this movie is, all you have to do is look at any zombie film released since this one, and see how many have zombies that look like walking corpses, eat human flesh, can only be killed by destroying their brain and cremating the body, transmit the zombie virus by biting humans, and prefer to swarm their foes in a large group. The movie definitely does its job when it comes to holding the audience's attention for the entire duration. Romero knew just what scenes to film and what order to put them in so that it can captivate and amaze the viewer. It takes the zombies in the film a while until they are able to show up at the farmhouse in a large horde, and so the viewer will have to keep watching to know what happens to the survivors in the face of these overwhelming odds. As the undead congregate all over the surrounding area of the house, the audience begins to understand that what the zombies lack in intellect or fighting prowess, they make up for in sheer numbers, and that's what makes them scary. Towards the end, it really does feel like a hopeless situation as the cadavers begin to overrun and spill into the house itself, but there's no way I can do it justice. You'll have to see it for yourself in order to experience the eerily silent approach of hundreds of the flesh eating monsters. This is a rare instance of a movie that never loses its haunting power and scares every time I watch it (for me anyway), and throughout the whole thing there wasn't one single moment where I lost interest. Each scene feels urgent rather than the characters talking just for their enjoyment. Overall, Night of the Living Dead is a must watch for any self-respecting horror aficionado, and without Romero, zombies as we know them might not even exist today.",

            "content": "In preparation for the upcoming \"Army of The Dead\" from Zack Snyder, we decided that now would be a good time to go back and look at the forerunners in this loose collection of films, sequels and remakes that make up this iconic series. Where else to start but with Romero's influential 1968 original.Whilst on a trip to lay some flowers on their long-departed father's grave, Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny (Russell Streiner) are attacked in the graveyard by a relentless assailant. Separated, Barbara runs to an isolated farmhouse with her attacker in slow but consistent pursuit. She's saved by Ben (Duane Jones) who tells her that the attacker is not alone, and dozens of people have inexplicably started attacking strangers with little regard for their own wellbeing. He fortifies the house as the number of assailants rises, but unbeknownst to them, they are not the only people taking refuge there.This viewing was an interesting one for me. I've seen this film many times before and can accept some of its low budget issues. I can appreciate the film for its influence, inspiring hundreds of filmmakers from around the world to just take up a camera and make their story. You can draw a straight line from this film to \"The Evil Dead\", \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" even to non-horror stuff like \"Clerks\" and \"Blood Simple\". Though not the first ever Zombie movie, this is one that establishes a lot of principle ideas, most particular the relentless bleakness, they cannot be overcome - you have already lost and it's only a matter of surviving as long as you can.However, my wife has no such built in admiration and it was clear that she didn't enjoy it much. Seeing it though her eyes a little bit, those budgetary constraints show up - particularly in the dialogue, both the rough and ready semi-improvised nature of it and just the simple act of whether or not it was audible. It's quite slow to get started, with a long time spent with Barbara as she tries to get to the house and some of the editing across the version I saw was pretty brutal. The characters, beyond Ben, aren't particularly well distinguished and the performances are generally fairly poor. (They are all amateur actors after all)But, this is my review and my respect for the film and it's place in history trumps the failings that you can pick on. Reverence if not flat out love.",

            "content": "George A. Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\" is not standard horror. In fact, there are several minutes where this classic zombie film is just plain boring. There is brilliance, however, in the film's static nature, like how one of the main characters, Barbra (Judith O'Dea), is in speechless shock for most of the film. And despite the horror fan's craving for gore, suspense and active characters, \"Living Dead\" tantalizes its audience and then stuns it with unexpected turns of events instead of using the typical rise-and-fall horror structure.\"Living Dead\" could be described as the king of the B horror movie. Its title, flesh-eating half-humans and cheesy violence keep the movie walking that fine line between horror and comedy. The difference is that the plot contains events that break horror conventions. Look past the use of Bosco chocolate syrup and black and white film in 1968 and you'll notice the film is more about humans vs. humans than it is humans vs. zombies.The story opens with a girl and her brother visiting their father's grave when they're attacked by a zombie. The brother gets knocked out while the girl runs and takes shelter in a nearby vacated home where she's later discovered by Ben (Duane Jones), the take-charge type of horror movie character. They board up the house and light fires to keep the zombies away and soon they discover five other people were hiding in the cellar. Together, all seven of them argue about survival tactics and things get heated between Ben and Mr. Cooper (Karl Hardman).\"Living Dead\" ends up being one of those films exposing how human nature rears its ugly head in these kinds of life-or-death situations. Padded by some probably unintentional racial tension between Ben and Cooper, as the arguing continues you are forced to wonder who the real savages are: the ones outside the house or the ones inside it. Culminating in an excellent and largely unpredictable ending sequence as the zombie threat becomes imminent in the house, \"Living Dead\" ends up becoming a surprise to everyone.With sub-par acting, unnecessarily long scenes of the news playing out over the television and nothing that's actually scary, it's amazing how \"Living Dead\" manages to win over its viewers. There are literally just scenes where Ben is boarding up the windows listening to the radio and you wonder if the zombies are just chilling outside playing cards or something. But there's great effectiveness when Ben keeps telling Barbra to stay calm and not be scared and she just won't say anything, much to our dismay. \"Living Dead\" is more psychological than you'd ever expect from something with all these B-movie characteristics.",

This film still frightens many people (including myself) thirty some years after it was made.  It is always amazing to me each time I watch this film how it still manages to appeal to my most basic fear instincts.  There have been countless movies since this one that have been made for a hundred times as much money that I have seen and forgotten, but I am sure this one will always stay with me.This film does such a fine job of shocking and frightening that it is easy to forget how George Romero made it remarkable in other ways.  It was quite a coup in the late 60's to give a black character the lead in a movie and Romero quite cleverly satirizes race relations throughout the film.  I think he is making a point of asking if human beings are really any better than the flesh-eating zombies.  This is most potent at the end, when the black character is assumed to be a zombie and is shot and killed.  Would they have made that mistake with a white person?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  This is also a point that was severely botched in the 1990 remake, when they actually had Tony Todd's character become a zombie.  In a way, that misses the entire point of the original.Regardless, if you are a horror movie aficionado or someone interested in sociology, this movie must be seen.  One thing is for sure.

Romero has gone on to define a genre, a feat that very few have accomplished. Many films have been influenced and have imitated George's creation but few successfully.NOLD is seeped in history and has become as intriguing as the chiller its self. There's really not too much to comment on that hasn't already been said before. The dead are played mindlessly well.

            "content": "Never once was the word ZOMBIE ever mentioned in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and yet this cult of cult classics is largely regarded as \"THE\" inspiration for the zombie genre, if not culture. Producer George Romero, in the footsteps of Ed Wood, scraped up a little over $100,000 dollars (equal to about $800,000 today) to fund the film. And if you want to know the hard truth, Wood actually raised MORE money than Romero back in the day! NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD may actually have had its beginnings in Vincent Price's THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, made in 1964 and in Italy. The storyline is strikingly similar, with Price battling homicidal zombies, and almost as graphic. Another reported source was INVISIBLE INVADERS (1959) featuring a large cast of walking zombies. In all fairness though, producer Herschell Gordon Lewis remains the grand daddy of gore, with a series of gruesome BLOOD FEAST opuses he churned out in the mid 1960s. The difference is that Lewis' films were hard core, straight in your face blood spatter, while Romero put some thought into the assembly, if at least a psychological slant. Romero did his homework, and one scary Halloween film he did produce, though quite unaware it would become legend. Co-star Judith O'Dea commented that she auditioned for the role in a horror film (to get an acting credit on her resume), believing it would be filmed and forgotten. Case in point, such juvenile props in the form of Bosco chocolate syrup for blood and roasted chicken (from a local market owned by a cast member) for human flesh and bone! OY! O'Dea added that there was practically no script, just direction and/or suggestion, so lines were added off the top and in the moment of each scene. Shear genius or not, Romero took a chance and rolled the dice. Another interesting footnote is that the eerie music score was partly lifted from a 1950s cult drive classic, TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE (1959), and this subsequently inspired an LP album after the film's debut. Talk about a Royal Flush. The film made millions and remains popular on dvd to this very day. Compared to the cycle of contemporary horror films, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD has aged gracefully, but it still packs a \"sentimental\" jolt every now and then and must be commended for its ultimate dare in the first place. Filmed on location outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which even brought wide acclaim to a small town cemetary where it all began. For horror buffs, completists and/or just about anyone else who can enjoy the psycho analytical ride into the post hypnotic twilight zone. The opening drive up the lonely mountain road into zombie oblivion remains addictive. A Friday night Halloween weekender and mindbender!",

            "content": "\"I was trying to come up with a concept about a new society, revolutionary...in political terms, that's taking over and devouring the old society.\" \u2013 George A. Romero George Romero's \"Night Of The Living Dead\" marked the implosion of the white, middle class, American nuclear family and portrayed the collapse of post-war patriarchal authority into a kind of mad hysteria. What followed - the sexual, political and social \"revolutions\" of the 1960s - were not so much rebellions against tyrannical paternal and political despots, or against the rigid repressions of suburban family life, as they were carnivalesque revelations that the emperor had no clothes. That 1950s suburbia offered nothing but hypocrisy and fake decor. As such, Romero has his nuclear family holed up in a farmhouse - the impotence of the father mirroring the clownishness and impotence of various authority figures on his television screen - until the unit collapses under the weight of its own stupidity and children-turned-zombies avidly consume their own parents. As is always the case with Romero, the zombies are actually the good guys, the new zombie order literally consuming the outmoded old. The zombie horde then become a darkly humorous vision of hippie communalism who are the preferred refuge of the children of the white middle class.But the rebellions of the 1960s went nowhere, hope fading and forgotten. Hippies and campus radicals from middle-class backgrounds grew up to be yuppies, and their influence on the larger culture was mostly a matter of an easily saleable \"lifestyle.\" Once the social upheavals of the 60s had passed, consumerism turned out to be the real winner, so it's entirely appropriate that Romero's second zombie movie, \"Dawn of the Dead\", takes place in a shopping mall. Here our heroes live a fantasy of commodity abundance and unhinged consumption, whilst the zombies draw inexorably closer, the mall reminding them of their happiest pre-death moments. In this world there is no satisfaction, only lack, the zombie's unquenchable lust for flesh mocking the consumer's unquenchable desires.Then came \"Day of the Dead\", arguably the best film in the series. Here, 60s radicalism and 70s consumerism are shunted aside in favour for an assault on Reaganism and the military/scientific complex, where pathologically macho soldiers try to keep the zombies at bay whilst scientists try with futility to either \"destroy the zombie plague\" or \"tame the zombies\". The film is relentless in its deconstruction of military authoritarianism and scientific claims to supreme authority, but mostly it's the film's treatment of Freud's reality/pleasure principle and its thick fatalism which makes it so unique. Here, the zombies embody a kind of sympathetic, undeveloped and (pre-language, pre-entry-into-the-Symbolic) ego-less desire (they do not know why they want/desire), which contrasts with the libidinal economy and the twisted viciousness of the human characters (who bury the true motivations of their desires and hypocritically stand for social order).Each of Romero's zombie movies were intended to be a snapshot of the decade in which they was released; \"Night\" the 60s, \"Dawn\" the 70s and \"Day\" the 80s. \"Land of the Dead\", for financial reasons, was released in the 21st century, but it is actually a broad critique of 90s American society. Here, social class and warfare comes to the foreground, the film imagining America as a paranoid bastion of humanity and freedom, standing tall against the \"foreign horde\". In \"Land of the Dead\", the ruling class live lives of elegance and supreme wealth in the exclusive and gated high-rises of \"Fiddler's Green\", while the masses outside do their dirty bidding and scrape by on low incomes, distracting themselves from their worries with sex, drugs, gambling and violence. The leader of this late-capitalist America, a George Bush styled madman out to make the rich richer and who \"refuses to negotiate with terrorists\", subsists by sending into zombie territory teams of mercenaries who steal zombie loot (he achieves this by distracting the zombies with fireworks- a kind of metaphor for media spectacle and social brainwashing). The zombies themselves are, once again, the good guys, often linked with the rebelling humans who wish to rise up against their overlords. When the zombies break into the city - led by a black zombie of course - it's symbolic of the proletariat finally rising against their masters and demanding restitution and justice, though Romero knows this is but a futile, 1960s pipe dream. He ends the film with the zombies defeated, the humans infected, and the rebels disillusioned, the masses going their separate ways at the end of the film, wandering off into the horizon like so many disillusioned cinematic anti-heroes of cinema's golden age, specifically the existential road movies of the early 1970s.8.5/10 \u2013 \"Day of the Dead\"8/10 \u2013 \"Land of the Dead\", \"Dawn of the Dead\"7.5/10 \u2013 \"Night of the Living Dead\" Despite their tiny budgets and at times poor acting, these films still operate fairly well as popcorn movies. What elevates them, though, is the allegorical qualities of Romero's trashy plots.",

Two major reasons:1) It's technically dated. While the b/w cinematography is excellent and the zombies look quite convincing, the \"nervous\" editing style often looks clumsy and inept.2) There are some huge lulls. All those radio and TV bulletins, which are supposed to be \"enlightening\" and explain what's going on, actually interrupt the action boringly. Watching the heroes watching TV for about 10 minutes isn't that interesting.There are some chilling moments in this film, and the pessimistic finale is ironic and brilliant, but the film as a whole just isn't as effective as it (probably) was during its first release. Another person here mentioned that it's also kind of a homage to \"The Birds\". I agree, but even with a higher budget, this film would still be far inferior to that amazing Hitchcock classic.",

            "content": "George A. Romero's feature film debut is that influential horror flick whose contribution to its genre as well as pop-culture has been so immense that cinema will forever be indebted to it. Night of the Living Dead marks the birth of a new sub-genre of horror & is the first film to employ the storyline of zombie apocalypse.Over the years since its release, this seminal classic has garnered a strong cult following & there's no denying that its influence remains as effective as before but for me, Night of the Living Dead turned out to be a pretty mediocre experience considering that it has aged very badly & what was once scary now comes off as unintentionally hilarious.Set in an unspecified time, the story of Night of the Living Dead takes place in an abandoned farmhouse where a small number of people stack up to hide from the flesh-eating corpses that have been mysteriously reanimated. As the dead people surrounding the house escalate in number, the attempt to survive the night starts looking less promising for the people inside.Shot on a shoestring budget, making fine use of black-n-white photography & presenting an odd set of characters, Night of the Living Dead violates many taboos over the course of its runtime & Romero's direction makes sure that the presentation is as explicit as its content. The performances by its amateur cast has few standouts but it's the characteristics given to the ghouls (now referred as zombies) is what leaves a lasting impression.On an overall scale, Night of the Living Dead adds a whole new chapter to horror filmmaking & has inspired countless number of zombie flicks, some of which even transcended the genre of horror. It may not be as frightening today as it was during its time of release but it still retains an ability to shock & disgust viewers to an extent with its explicit, graphic & uncompromising content.",

So if you judge the film as being one of the first true zombie films to take off in the mainstream, it's a much more enjoyable experience.

The movie takes place in the Pittsburgh countryside. Innocently enough a brother and sister are visiting their father's grave site when they encounter a strange individual. He attacks and kills the brother whilst the sister flees the scene. She stumbles into a country farm house that will later become a house of horrors. Meanwhile a young black man seeks safety inside the house and tries to make it into a refugee from the chaos and death that's follows him. Awesome horror flick. This has to be one of my favorite horror films of all time and the best movie franchise. Often imitated but it's never quite exactly duplicated or replicated. George A. Romero and company came across something big and it changed the face of horror forever! Followed by two darker sequels and an excellent remake. Black and white hasn't felt so creepy since Nosferatu!Highly recommended! One of the essentials.Followed by: Dawn of the Dead Day of the Dead Check out Last Man on Earth, it's the original Night of the Living Dead and it's just as good.

            "content": "I think it's safe to say that Night of the Living Dead now has a certain status which sees it stand alongside other such film canon entries which double up as legendary pictures of the genre. It's a status that sees it nicely slot in with the likes of Hitchcock's Psycho; Carpenter's Halloween and the original Nosferatu as additions to a genre which arrived with a bit of a bang and have seemingly been inspiring film-makers as well as fascinating those that study the subject alike, ever since. Towards the end of Romero's 1968 picture, you can quite literally see both the very fabrics and the core conventions of a sub-genre being born; you quite literally observe the very ideas and traits many films since have been inspired by and taken inspiration from, like the three mentioned examples and a range of others in the genre's canon, the mannerisms and aesthetics which were being explored for the first time appear to have gone on to inspire and influence. Contextualised, the film is beyond ranking or rating; the final thirty or so minutes not only stares into the abyss, it ventures beyond the damn thing and into a whole new realm of both genre reinvention and guerrilla movement film-making.To a modern audience, the film's premise sounds old hat but here explored within this particular field for what appears to be for the first time and here done with wonderful invention and execution. The film will open with a car speeding along an isolated country road to some foreboding music, that sense of them trying to escape or get away from something feeling prominent, before the two of them in Barbra (O'Dea) and her brother Johnny arrive at a graveyard to pay tribute to a deceased family member. The editing is slow, deliberate and shows things such as a car driving for extended periods; Johnny even hears something on the radio which cuts out or judders but dismisses it quickly so we too write it off as nothing specific. The film goes to some lengths to detail Johnny as the sort of person he, with his sister defensive in the background as she gets on with what's to be done, whereas the dialogue is non-specific to any kind of plot. We get the feeling the two of them are quite rich, what with their clothing; new car and fact they've driven so far for something according to some as so minor.It's here Romero pulls the first of a few rugs out from beneath us, an attacker in the cemetery killing the character, in Johnny, we came to learn the most about during these early exchanges, while Barbra escapes via the car to some chaotic editing thus completely upsetting the balance from what came before. The terror and immediacy of the situation is emphasised when she arrives at a local farm house, the emphasis on the anonymity of the character when compared to Johnny doubles up with the ambiguity and mystery surrounding precisely why the attacker did what he did and what the creatures outside approaching desire, as well as where she goes from this point. Barbra is saved before effectively being pushed back to a mere supporting role following the arrival of a young coloured gentleman in Ben (Jones), whose presence then reveals a family of three hiding out in the basement with two others whom are a couple. Here begins a somewhat terrifying hour and a half upon which many have fraught to follow; an historical piece doubling up as a fascinating piece of drama during which we will become involved and engrossed.Ben is perhaps the closest thing we have to a lead, a man of most probably quite humble backgrounds appearing as the sharpest; smartest; most heroic and most logical individual within the premises of the farm house. His ability to adapt to the situation in the manner he does, put across via his reaction to the deceased farm house owner in comparison to that of Barbra's as well as his fortifying of the house proper highlights an extension in power of a previously marginalised minority over that of the richer, more upper-class white individual incarnated within the character of Barbra. The holing up is not without interior incident, father and husband Harry (Hardman) believes the basement is the perfect place for waiting out the strange goings-on whereas Ben believes being on ground level with exits and room to move works better. Romero goes to great length to show the boarding up, nailing up and fortifying of the house; the extended sequence of this as well as the arguing between what is the best course of action essentially a listing of various \"zombie\" sub-genre conventions quite literally being announced and embedded into film form in list fashion.Historically as well as a gripping piece of drama, it is quite stunning. Romero etches out as much tension as is possible, the film dismissive of any kind of formula in one sense because it is composing the formula in front of our very eyes. Its ability to spread focus and attention on each character inside of the house as well as those on the outside trying to react to the situation instills a greater extent of chilling reality come the finale. Romero's film features several sequences of the characters gathered around an in house television during which the fictional anchorman distributes information regarding the creatures therein now effectively serving as the basic pieces of knowledge regarding zombies that audiences have taken to every single film of this ilk ever since. In this regard, as well as many others, the film is amongst one of the best; most terrifying; most immersive and most important ever made.",

Schaffner unleashed PLANET OF THE APES, George A Romero, a director who couldn't direct, got together with a bunch of actors who couldn't act and lumbered out NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. And the world became a stupider place.Romero was the Sex Pistols of movie-making. He didn't really know any chords (self-admittedly a student, piggybacking off the techniques of his heroes), but he worked with the little talent he had to bludgeon his way into the industry.The budget is non-existent, the story is basic - dead people come to life and attack living people - the music is genuinely chilling, the camera angles creatively discomfitting, the gore is graphic, the film-making sparse, the acting non-existent. The effect: priceless.NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is arguably the seed that started the moronic zombie movement in film. The zombie concept - the reanimated dead - was not new - on film, it dated back to at least FRANKENSTEIN (1931) and NOSFERATU (1922); in literature, popularized by the world's most famous zombie, Jesus Christ.Romero was the Eddie Van Halen of zombiedom - he didn't invent fingertap, but everyone points to him when they think about it.Called groundbreaking (rightfully) at the time of its release, LIVING DEAD suffers credibility so many years on simply due to one thing - the community theatre performances. A film is only as good as the actors who are trying to suspend our disbelief on the screen. If the actors are not in the moment, neither are we.So don't revile me for comparing this budgetless B-Lister with the A-List movies above. That is the main excuse for bad movies of this ilk - the cry goes up: \"You have to take it in context! You have to compare it to films of its time!\" Well, I just did and, budgetary considerations aside, in 1968 there was still such a thing as Actors. But NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD had none.And don't read too much into the politics of Duane Jones, an African-American, in the lead role. By Romero's own admission, he was simply the best actor in the group (which says very little, believe me). He relates the anecdote of having the film \"in the can\" in the trunk of his car and hearing the news of Martin Luther King's assassination. Suddenly, Duane Jones was a symbol of righteous blackness.As Ben, Duane Jones leads a motley group of \"indicating\" actors boarded up in a farmhouse, to escape zombies on the prowl outside. An allusion to radiation is made as the cause of the zombie epidemic. (Radiation: the universal contaminant! Only one million 1950's sci-fi films use it!) One by one, all Ben's compatriots are killed or eaten by zombies.Final scenes show white doughy guys scouring the countryside indiscriminately killing people who look like they're milling aimlessly. You wouldn't want these guys patrolling your local mall. Neither would you want to look dazed, having just escaped a zombie - doesn't sit with white doughy guy protocol of \"shoot first, don't ask any questions.\" Which happens to be George A. Romero's film-making protocol.--Reivew by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",

Being it was in black and white, there was a limited amount of visual gore. Most of it was implied. You see the zombie bite someone, and then the rest of the zombies pile on, so you imagine the gore. Dawn of the Dead (1978) was in color, and had a thousand times more graphic gore.The racism that went on during what was an apocalypse for the people involved was a bit much. I think it was over-done in that regard. I have a hard time thinking that if zombies were coming through the windows, my main concern would be whether or not any interracial friendships were blooming.In general George Romero tended to be very heavy-handed in pushing a theme in his movies.

And it wasn't afraid to make it real by giving us real people; the actors aren't all professionals, but some had training, and Duane Jones as Ben, though not \"written\" for a black actor, is really the only one that could've pulled it off with such humility. We know why he's mad at the situation he's in \u2013 we would be too.Race, class, power, and, as Romero put the whole \"zombie\" concept, revolution, all in a story filled with gruesome deaths, REAL scares (the opening cemetery scene is a knock-out), and it takes its time to build up to the WHAMMY moments that knock you down; by the last ten minutes, you'll hopefully, if you are locked into it, be little slabs of jelly.",

            "content": "It's amazing how one low-budget flick influenced and redefined an entire genre.Before \"Night of the Living Dead\", zombie movies were mostly movies that relied on its atmosphere and not necessarily its horror or gore and were mostly set at exotic, far off, locations. Zombies weren't flesh eating monsters, they're were slaves that were controlled by a master, as showed in classic zombie movies such as \"White Zombie\" and \"I Walked with a Zombie\". George A. Romero completely threw this existing genre elements overboard and almost completely reinvented the genre. Sometimes I miss the old zombie flicks but George A. Romero introduced us to a totally new and great world of horror movies, that influenced many later movies. Copied a lot, never surpassed.Perhaps the best thing about the movie is that its low-budget but that this mostly doesn't show on screen. With creepy zombies and simple locations, George A. Romero creates a creepy, as well as realistic (and maybe because of that creepy) atmosphere. The movie could had easily gone over-the-top and became a real campy one. Considering the resources they had, they did an extremely good job with this movie. The movie is shot in atmospheric black & white. Perhaps this was done to tone down the graphic moments of the movie? Or just because it was the cheapest thing to do? But whatever the reason is, it works well for the movie and its atmosphere and it reminded me of some old '30/'40's atmospheric horror classics. George A. Romero definitely knew his classics.The story is kept very simple and chooses not to really explain anything. It focuses on just a few characters and mostly chooses not to show anything else that is happening to the world at the moment. It makes you feel close to the characters and their fears. It's one of the reasons why \"Night of the Living Dead\" works well as a creepy horror movie, although it nowhere ever gets really scary or real tense. The movie is mostly predictable, which is also due to the formulaic, stereotypical horror-characters that we're all accustomed to but in the '60's still were quite renewing and became later genre-defining. Still the movie is a bit too amateur like for my taste at times. The directing and editing is really off at times and the acting is just plain bad. The two main character played by Duane Jones and Judith O'Dea pull off quite alright but everyone else is terribly overacting and clearly has no talent for the movie business. It was like watching an Ed Wood movie at times but luckily the moments and atmosphere of the movie compensated for this.As for the gore and graphic moments, it's was pretty shocking for '60's standards and so was the fitting ending but of course in todays perspective it's all rather toned down, also especially when you compare it to George A. Romero's later movies, such as the direct sequel \"Dawn of the Dead\".Not as good and entertaining as \"Dawn of the Dead\" but considering the resources and the enormous influence this movie had on later genre movies, this movie remains a classic horror must-see!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "I didn't see much mention of this version of \"NOTLD\" so I'm posting this for anyone who might come across it and be interested.In 1998 a \"New\" version of \"NOTLD\" was created and released. Of course such releases have become common practice lately, dating back to \"Close Encounters\" in the early 80's and the complete re-thinking of the most recent \"Exorcist\" film. But in this case, rather than uncovering new \"never before seen footage\" as most expanded editions do, this version promised new footage conceived and shot by the original author of the screenplay, John Russo, and a new score in full stereo.I'm not a big fan of revisionist film-making--if the changes are noticeable it affects the experience of the movie, if they're not, then why bother? But I don't have a problem with messing with a movie as an alternative experience, like the \"green zombie\" colorized version of \"NOTLD\"--if the original was that good (example: the original Star Wars) there's not much you could do to it that will erase that success. The changes to the original re-released films like \"The Abyss\" and \"Terminator 2\" didn't really affect the overall experience much, they were more or less like \"extended mixes\" of a pop song rather than \"re-mixes.\" Less is more, but if you're a fan more can be a fun alternative.Here, the case is different, a serious \"re-thinking\" of a revered and classic (albeit low-budget) film. It's obvious that the motivating factor behind such an unusual move (was there really something \"missing\" from the movie originally?) must be money--yet to read the accompanying materials with the DVD package certainly makes a case that the new concept was done with a lot of love. In other words, it worked well on paper and appeals to the curious film fan, certainly.Then, of course, you watch the damn movie, and understand--within 30 seconds you realize the concept wasn't viable, at least not with the budget and talent gathered for this project.I'm glad I saw it, I'll say that, because I'm a fan of film both good and bad, especially THIS film which was already good and bad, and sometimes seeing something truly terrible teaches more about how a good movie is created than seeing a \"revered classic\" that is flawless. The 30th Anniversary edition of \"NOTLD\" points out several things that are wrong with movies today, and movies in general: 1)over-foleying of sound f/x. I know it keeps foley artist's employed, and the technology is there,but we don't really need to hear ants hiccup, the way movies are today. 2)Always use real actors, no matter what your budget. The use of the new soundtrack composer in a pivotal role was a serious error: he looks like the uglier brother of Edward Norton in \"American History X\" and can't act. 3) A soundtrack shouldn't stand out. Here, the new music sounds like little more than demo patterns on a cheap Casio keyboard someone left running. Simple themes repeat over and over until you want to cry out \"Uncle,\" or turn the power off, and the composer, with due respect, needs to learn that soundtrack music shouldn't be \"songs,\" but atmosphere. The effect here is of watching a silent film with your stereo playing in the background. The bursts of the original score only highlight how miscalculated the new score is. 4)Showing is better than telling. It was scarier when we didn't know the history of the first zombie we see, or even that he was a zombie at all, and it's redundant to show zombies eating flesh so early in the film, while the radio broadcast is informing us that people are being cannibalized. It's no longer scary, it's dull, and this movie was dull enough already--if it was going to be re-thought, care should have been taken to improve the dull \"talky\" moments in between zombie attacks.In the final analysis, this \"new\" version (that's several years old now) has a couple of moments of good gore and make-up, but nothing worth checking out. The music is obnoxious, obtrusive and cheap, as well as the new scenes which do not in any way fit in with the old ones. And the new \"slant\" that the book-end scenes with the preacher give to the film push the \"When hell is full the dead will walk the earth\" theory over the \"radiation created the zombies\" theory. It's a whole other movie, and not one I'm interested in. I never cared why the zombies were around in the first place and adding \"God's judgment\" into the mix ruins the \"fun,\" frankly.This \"new\" version has probably been forgotten already, and that's a good thing, but for some reason I still give the creators a nod of respect for trying something different, even if they failed miserably.",

And that about sums up what I think of this film's impact on the horror genre.The dead come back to haunt the living. How they come back is one of those science fiction theories that lacks real plausibility but that didn't stop the screenwriter from concocting this tale of impending doom. There's a film noir quality to the low-key lighting effects as the main characters huddle inside a house that's been boarded up to prevent the carnivorous zombie-like creatures from devouring them.If you get your thrills from seeing flesh-eating zombies, this is for you. Not only is the gore rather explicit, but close-ups of hungry zombies smacking their lips over a meal is what makes this the sort of exploitation film Hitchcock tried to stay away from. He got his effects with a bit more wit and wisdom.For a low-budget thriller, the performances are about what you'd expect. DUANE JONES, as Ben, is the hero of the tale and he does give the best performance in the film, which is not saying too much. It's the script that could have used some refinement with dialog that's enough to give you a few chuckles before the tale reaches an unsatisfying and rather abrupt ending.",

I'm in the genre from the eighties but as you might know, I'm not into 50's and 60's flicks. And this one shows me again why. I agree that it was the first flick that started it all but face it, where's the gore. zombie flicks are know for their gore and here most bites are done off-screen. The zombies itself looks really well for the time being but still it's all a lot of talking. If you look at Dawn or Day then that's something different. the red stuff flows and the gore is there. naturally it wasn't really done to show gore but look at Blood Feast. It did contain the red stuff and the gore and don't get me wrong. A good horror doesn't need blood, look at Halloween or Texas Chainsaw. No drip is included. It is one that you must have in your collection to have all the 'of the dead' titles but for me, too much talking and didn't deliver any frightening moments, maybe the zombiechild in the cellar but still...Of course it's famous as the first zombie flick were zombies really walk and don't wander around, S. William Hinzman did set a new thing towards the zombie flicks.

Harry also bothered me... i cant understand how people can be so selfish and cowardly. i would understand if he was thinking of his family, but he was only thinking of himself and his own safety. and really, the risk was minimal because clearly the living were more adept than the zombies. the nature of the characters, even though i disliked them, enhances the movie because throughout the film, there was always something that was less than optimal if one was under attack by zombies.",

Barbra, still shaken from the shock of seeing her brother killed is eventually joined by Ben (Duane Jones) who takes measures to fortify their farmhouse hideaway as more flesh eating ghouls bear down on them.Created by John Russo, George A. Romero, and Russell W. Streiner from their Pittsburgh based production company, The Latent Image, which had specialized in industrial films and TV commercials. A massive commercial success upon release making $12 million domestically against a roughly $100,000 budget the film was subject to much controversy due to its violence and gore with many critics expressing disgust with the film. In the years since its release, the movie has become a respected cultural touchstone admired not just for its contributions to redefining the horror genre and establishing the modern day framework of the \"zombie\"(here called ghoul) and the story beats and tropes, but also for its strong direction from George A. Romero, and strong performances particularly from Duane Jones as Ben whose casting is seen as an important benchmark in black leads in film.The movie does a great job at establishing its simple premise and deriving tension not just from the flesh eating hordes, but also from the interactions between the characters. Duane Jones is very good as everyman Ben who carries himself with a no-nonsense drive while also carrying human fallibility with bursts of frustration or anger. Judith O'Dea is a good foil as Barbra with her character very much psychologically broken from bearing witness to the violent carnage and unable to communicate or think clearly. Other characters are present in the movie as well such as Karl Hardman as the stubborn Harry Cooper or Keith Wayne as the well intentioned but overly impulsive Tom and every character has a distinguished trait that brings life and energy to the confined setting of the farmhouse with character often expressed just as much in what's not being said as what is. The movie is a chilling apocalyptic nightmare with its limited confining location and dark aesthetic used to great effect to create chills and desperation.Night of the Living Dead is a classic for a reason. From its strong central performance from Duane Jones, to the tension filled direction by George A. Romero, to even the socio political subtext that can be read into with the film's chilling ending and underlying but never spoken tensions Night of the Living Dead has more than earned its legacy.",

            "content": "George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead revolutionized the horror genre...for better or worse. You get the cheap, modern horror films that no one likes. But you have the likes of Halloween and Friday the 13th that owe their debts to this terrifying zombie film. Made in 1968 and under a very miniscule budget, the film holds up well today. I won't lie when I say some of the zombie scenes actually scared me...and that is coming from someone who has seen countless horror movies. The black-and-white cinematography led to some of these scares and of course led to the frightening overall atmosphere. I can't imagine how children and adults for that matter reacted to the film upon release. Yeah, you have those 50's monster films but they do not hold a candle to Romero's revolutionary flick.How did this young man attending Carnegie University in Pittsburgh change the genre or filmmaking itself as people knew it? Firstly, it is considered to be one of the most profitable films ever made which is shocking considering it was made outside the studio system. It made about twelve million dollars domestically making it more than 250 times its budget. In addition, Romero filled his movie with explicit violence and gore. Yeah, he was not afraid to show zombies happily eating someone's shoulder. The violence was seen as controversial which is why it received negative reviews at first. Roger Ebert famously wrote a column about this experience at the film's midday premiere that was filled with children...most of whom were in shock by the unexpected violence. Also deemed controversial was the casting of a black man, Duane Jones, in a movie full of white people. His character was the smartest character in the movie. Romero simply said that his audition was the best one there was and that is why he got the job. Choosing Jones for the lead role amongst other things was given scholarly interpretations given the 60's political climate with Vietnam and Martin Luther King Jr. Romero denied such things, but one can easily see such interpretations. Finally, this paved away for future horror movies. It set the template for zombie film to come. There was no happy ending either. Everyone died. I was rooting for Jones's character who survived the zombie horde but ultimately perished by a bunch of rednecks. That ending even shocked me. I really liked it because it deviated from the norm. Even to this day, it is still rare to have such an ending although its not unheard of.Romero wrote the script because he felt people had a thing for the strange and the bizarre. His script was heavily influenced by Richard Matheson's I Am Legend. He couldn't use vampires as depicted in the novel, yet he chose these flesh eaters that he named ghouls. Romero was not even thinking about zombies as we think about them today. It was not until the film's major success that zombies became a thing in our culture. Romero shot the film with a very tight budget. They had no money to make long-decayed zombies hence the idea to make them as the whole zombie virus was in its infancy. They used chocolate syrup for blood, and it actually looks realistic on the black-and-white screen. You can tell that the film had a limited budget, also made obvious by the location setting, yet everything looked so real. The zombies were really scary when in attack mode. Everything did feel small and contained, and I felt like that affected the story sometimes. That is really my only complaint.Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and her brother are visiting their father's grave when zombies suddenly attack them. Barbra is able to get away and finds shelter in a seemingly abandoned farmhouse. She is joined by Ben (Duane Jones) who was only looking for gas. But with more and more zombies surrounding them, Ben tries to board up all the windows and doors. They soon realize they are not alone. Some people were hiding in the basement. They fight amongst each other about who will be in charge. It is going to be a long night for everyone if they can survive the zombies...and each other.As someone who has seen many horror films, almost all characters seem clich\u00e9d such as the damsel in distress, the strong leading man, etc. I have to keep in mind that this is the film that started it all. The performances are really good. I do not know too much about the actors except for what I have seen here. Duane Jones deserved a better career after this committed role. His character is strong and was part of a great ending. Jones had the best audition out of anyone as he played his part with a modicum of intelligence, which makes sense because he was a former university professor. As you can see, there are no big stars. Two of the actors, Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman, were actually heads of the production company that Romero used.Night of the Living Dead is a horror classic. Horror movies of the modern age has this movie to thank. It took time for people to get used to the gore and violence associated with these type of horror flicks. Romero did not hold back from showing guts and blood. He ended up writing an anthology of zombie flicks including his famed sequel Dawn of the Dead. Flicks that would forever change the world as we know it. I felt like the pacing was slow at times as we got to know the characters, but the action stands out. For a tiny budget, I am impressed with what I saw. Romero was able to think out of the box to create an independent feature that would single-handedly change a genre.My Grade: B+",

Romero can't think of anything for Barbra (Judith O'Dea, whose look should prove without a shadow of a doubt that Romero had in fact seen Herk Harvey's film) to do than sit around staring insanely. The other characters are just as bland and illogical, although it's nice to see a black hero. Duane Jones gives the film's only decent performance. The only way Romero knows how to move the narrative forward is with the television and radio news programs, which provide us with far too much explanation for what's going on. The movie starts to pick up when the (far too many) characters attempt to escape the house in which they've boarded themselves up. There are a couple of surprises along the way, and the dread does begin to build. But then the final twist is far too predictable. Whatever little it was building towards falls apart. 6/10.",

The acting is all over the map, production values are weak, and the script is essentially juvenilia. The only area in which the film does excel is cinematography. Romero does make creative use of the camera and the film's atmosphere is effective. But this alone can't make up for the rest of the movie's shortcomings.Nor can all of the film's weaknesses be blamed on a low budget. The story is an early tract of 60s counterculturalism, with its shadows of moral relativism and nascent political correctness. The script tries hard to rebel against stereotypes, but in fact relies heavily upon them. Essentially a morality tale without a moral, Night of the Living Dead is doomed by its soulless core. A pretentious amateur production poorly conceived and badly executed, Night of the Living Dead is anything but the classic it is supposed to be.",

Maybe it isn't quite as scary now as it was on its release in 1968 when it caught everyone by surprise. The commercials for it at that time looked pretty intense, so anyone who did go see it on its original theatrical release got pretty much what they deserved. At the time there was simply nothing to compare with it. It's relentlessness never let up for even one moment. Even now, watching it and knowing everything that's coming, those first fifteen minutes as Barbra escapes into the farmhouse are some of the most effective horror minutes ever made.",

No real expectations, but I still was a bit over-excited when I started the movie.\nThe opening scene was great! I was just waiting for a zombie to pop up, but it came in one hell of another way! The rest of the movie is, I'm afraid, decent. It's not a horror-masterpiece. Sure, it's an important film to the genre, and it's also very cult concidering Romero's popular sequels DAWN OF THE DEAD and DAY OF THE DEAD. My rating would be a lot higher if it wasn't for the script. The dialogues are toasted. The acting is ok, and almost every character is disturbing. The only thing George counts on as entertainment, is zombies. But since the zombies looks more like ordernal people (and moves like one), it doesn't get much more than a decent film. And the ending is maybe one of the most stupid endings in a movie ever.  \n6/10",

Except for one specific scene, the gory elements don't work. Watching the \"ghouls\" eat flesh is simply disgusting, and compromises the movie's overall impact. Fortunately, the movie also has much genuine suspense and some truly horrorfying scenes. The one gory scene which does work is also the most shocking and disturbing scene of any movie I've ever seen. It is when the injured little girl viciously attacks her own mother. The cold, vacant look in that girl's eyes. It's the stuff nightmares are made of. No aspect of this movie is better than Duane Jones' great performance. Jones was the only black actor in the movie, and no reference was ever made to race. For 1968, this was an amazing thing. No reason that it should have been amazing, though. Jones was simply the best actor for the part. The movie also deserves credit for how it gets \"right to the point.\" The story starts off in a seemingly ordinary way. The brother and sister (Barbara and Johnny) soon come face to face with one of the ghouls. Everything else evolves from that scene. Again, a great, landmark horror movie.",

            "content": "This low budget independent jewel of a Horror Flick I stumbled across accidentally on a late Saturday night. It was close to midnight as I felt sleepy and decided to go to bed despite the noise and chatter of my crowded house. My Parents threw a party with friends and relatives all about. My room was the furthest away despite the noise. I jumped into bed and clicked on my small Black and white TV. As the screen appeared I see a reporter wearing horn rimmed glasses in a noisy newsroom with teletype machines ringing in the background as he describes the escalating carnage of ghoulish deceased beings ravaging the cities and town of the United States. I thought it was the local news reporting this outrageous unbelievable story. I was so gullible and naive at the tender age of 12. I yelled out that the Dead have come to life put on the Television for all to see. My obnoxious Uncle Bernie says very funny oh I saw that zombie Picture last year. Then posted on the screen on top the words in white read,\"A DRAMATIZATION!\" I was so embarrassed. Any way I continued watching the movie by my lonesome. The basement scenes are forever edge in my memory as you see the impossible odds stacked against the living few in the boarded up farm house in nowhere, Pennsylvania. The clock ticks ever so slowly as the dead count grows and our players are wondering if help will ever come .Duane Jones gives an outstanding performance as the protagonist. The glue that holds the group together in this terrifying situation. Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman) the antagonist who insist that everyone should stay in the cellar for cover against Ben's (Duane Jones)objections to be more aggressive against these Zombies. Barbra (Judith O'Dea) was in a catatonic state throughout this film jabbering about her brother Johnny hoping he's still alive despite getting his head crushed against a tombstone. What also shocked me the most wasn't the gore so much or the violent death scenes. The Coopers sickly girl with a trowel in her grasp taking the life of her Mother was unforgettable. The appearance of Wrestling Announcer Chilly Billy Cardille. Cardille a Pittsburgh celebrity in his own right who hosted the ever popular Chiller Theater. His appearance was sort a comfort, familiar face. My eyes opened, as I thought to myself ,\"there's a familiar, friendly face.\" Hired by Vince McMahon Sr. President of the World Wide Wrestling federation as the voice of Wrestling in the Northeast corridor of the United States. The matches were shown on the UHF Spanish channel in New York. In the early 1970's Bill was fired. Bill was replaced, nepotism by a goofy kid with cleft chin,southern accent,bulging eyes, saddle shoes and wearing a red blazer Vince McMahon Jr. Cardille was certainly a relief in this movie despite the blood,gore and ravenous ghouls fighting to get a piece of the living flesh throughout the long night in countryside.The Ghouls ripping away the boards from the vulnerable edifice. To cut the tension in those gross scenes, writer George Romero gives us at times a rest-bud, a relief as News reporter Bill Cardille gives the Sheriff a badly needed cup of Joe. Sheer genius on the part of George Romero as his film effort was on time and way under budget. George claimed he could make a better Zombie Apocalypse movie than a professional studio. He nailed it.",

            "content": "Night of the Living Dead wasn't the first film to ever use the idea of an apocalypse; The Last Man on Earth did almost the same thing four years earlier - but it was Romero's film that popularised it, and this film is pretty much responsible for every zombie film ever made post-1968. Through excellent black and white cinematography, a claustrophobic atmosphere and some shocking scenes of zombie slaughter; Night of the Living Dead is an out and out horror classic. This film upset many people upon it's release in 1968, and despite being over three decades old - the film has lost none of it's nastiness. The plot is very simple, and it follows the idea of the dead returning to life and feasting upon the living. We follow a farmhouse full of people trying to evade the carnage. There is never any solid explanation given about why the dead are returning to life - only an idea about radiation from space. This actually helps the film, though, because there is never an attempt to save humanity or discover why it is happening; we just follow the people in trouble, and that immensely adds to the horror.Romero constantly makes sure that the audience is aware that we're following a group of people without much hope. The scene is always isolated, and the sparing use of radio and television gives the protagonists their only window into the wider world. Romero's use of the camera enforces the isolation in the farmhouse. He uses a lot of close-up's and angled shots, which adequately show the closed space. One of the things that this low budget zombie flick will always be remembered for is the fact that it was the first horror film to feature an African-American. This casting is just one example of Romero's lust for rule breaking, and there are many moments of zombie carnage in the film that seem to be there just to upset the more conservative Americans. These scenes also serve the film in it's bid to be frightening, and when combined with the hopeless, downbeat aura of the film; it's all very horrific. Many of the 'zombie rules' were created in this film, and the build up to the ending that sees two of the main characters killed is absolute pure brilliance. On the whole; horror cinema wouldn't be the same without this film. The fact that it's aged so well is no coincidence.",

            "content": "Cinema freaks all over the world (and horror buffs in particular) should bow their heads and thank Romero endlessly for this film he made. Night of the Living Dead is an undeniable masterpiece any way you look at it and a stunning victory for low-budget artists, rich on inspiration.\nWARNING: Dangerous plot and structure spoilers from here!!Horror anno 2004 would have looked completely different if it weren't for Romero and his risky, innovating views. He single-handedly rewrites the entire genre and adds some radical new ideas. Extremely brutal and thought-provoking ideas that teach us that good DOESN'T necessarily triumphs over evil or that the hero's fade isn't automatically secure. In fact, there aren't any heroes in Night of the Living Dead\u0085only scared victims who're fighting for their lives. The film starts with a moody tone, showing two young siblings on their way to visit their father's grave on the countryside. A tall, slow moving man approaches them and from that moment on the film turns into a non-stop wholesome of frightening images, unbearable tensions and downright nightmarish events. Still not knowing what is going on, a group of isolated people has to hide themselves in a farmhouse, while evil grows numerous around them in the form of recently deceased human beings! As a viewer, you can't help but sympathize with the players, yet their situation becomes more hopeless by the minute and even if there is a slight bit of hope for them\u0085it doesn't take long before Romero adds a new disastrous twist. This immensely controversial structure keeps on rushing by at high speed until it explodes into an astonishing anti-climax that leaves everyone breathless! You really have to rewind and double-check if what you saw at the end actually happened! See it in order to believe what kind of apocalyptic and inhuman ending Romero thought up here. Night of the Living Dead is a shocking portrait that makes your blood pump faster to your heart for an hour and a half non-stop. Surprisingly simple and modestly shot, but ten times more effective and haunting then any other horror movie ever before. An essential cinema experience that has to be seen by every self-respecting film fan\u0085 George A. Romero's film is slightly influenced by the equally brilliant `Carnival of Souls' (a still vastly underrated film by Herk Harvey) but he himself opened the way for upcoming cinematographers such as David Cronenberg, Tobe Hooper and John Landis. There's no end to this film's influence and importance! The uncut original '68 version is favorable viewing material over the 30 years special edition that contains extra footage. There's an additional opening sequence in that one that more or less spoils the atmosphere right from the beginning. Tom Savini's 1990 remake, on the other hand IS worth a watch\u0085since that one was made with an overload of respect for Romero's debut. Night of the Living Dead unquestionably receives a rating 10 out of 10, which still doesn't says enough about its brilliancy! If you haven't seen it yet\u0085.do it now!",

The essential story is that the group of defenders is not finally defeated by the ghoulish menace that surrounds it, but by its own internal inability to unite and work together to counter the threat. There is also an underlying suggestion that this dissension is caused by the fact that the hero of the situation, and the only one with any authority and sense of decisive purpose, is undermined because he is black. He's also by far the best actor, and carries the film. The suggestion is that oppression, of whatever nature, can only be defeated by resolute and united opposition. There is also the suggestion that this sense of oppression is generated by ghosts; in other words that it's a paranoid illusion.The women, except for the totally traumatised Barbara, are attractive but utterly hopeless, and amateurish actors. Barbara has one good line in the very effective and creepily atmospheric early part of the film, when she says to her doomed brother: \"You just complain in order to hear yourself talk\". The eventual climax can be seen coming a long way off. But it's still powerful, and devastating. This is another example of how a thoughtful, seriously low-budget picture can resonate and outscore and outlast a multitude of blockbusters. Thought-provoking.",

Not many people knew what film gore was, nor had they ever seen an African American man play a hero in a horror film. Night of the Living Dead was so far ahead of its time that it continues to blow people away to this day.The moody black-and-white film begins with a creepy score and a brother and sister, driving to an out-of-the-way cemetery to place flowers on a grave. Barbra, the sister, is not at all comfortable about being in a cemetery, and her dorky brother Johnny knows this. When he sees a tall, vacant looking man stumbling through the headstones, he teases his sister that the man is \"coming to get her\" in what is now a piece of classic film dialogue. What Johnny does NOT know is that the man is indeed coming to get her...but he gets Johnny first. From the moment Johnny's head is bashed in, all innocence in the world ends. Barbra must now run for her life, stumbling barefoot through a once-pastoral and now sinister countryside. The ghoul follows her to an abandoned farmhouse, where the rest of the cast soon assembles.Ben, our hero, quickly takes the lead. He is level-headed and calm, despite the horror that awaits outside. Whilst Barbra sinks into a near catatonic state on the living room couch, Ben boards up the windows and gathers the weapons, never giving in to the panic that we know he must feel on some level. Ben is a true hero, a humanitarian and a gentleman. He is also the only black character in an all white cast. This must have been unthinkable in 1968, as Ben takes charge of the small group of survivors and is quick to punch a white loudmouth jerk right in the face when the man becomes unreasonable. The rest of the cast includes the loudmouth's pretty wife, their daughter who has been bitten by a zombie and is slowly dying, and a young couple who are clearly very much in love. Oh yeah, and the hundred or so zombies milling around outside the house, eating bugs and attempting to break into the house and get their hands on the living within. This film has aged very well and its gore scenes remain quite shocking, considering the time it was made. The camera never flinches; we are shown stark, clinical footage of zombies eating human flesh and ripping at intestines as though it were a game of tug-o-war. In the films most harrowing scene, we even get to see a little zombie girl commit matricide with a garden trowel. Through it all, the camera simply stares at the atrocities with a detached eye. It is truly chilling.The final scene of this film is utterly devastating. I was literally in shock the first time I saw it, my mouth hanging open at the horrible injustice of it all. There is, needless to say, no happy ending. But this film is so innovative, forever changing the genre, that it has to be seen if only once. George Romero's film is absolutely flawless, simply because it is so rough, so low budget, and yet so grittily realistic and shockingly different. This film is pure horror. You won't soon get it out of your head. It has the power to disturb for a very long time.",

They have to learn how to get along with themselves in order to survive what's out there. The plot is extremely basic, but it serves its purpose of setting up suspenseful moments and sending unnerving chills down your spine. The way that the story is told, piece by piece through radio and television news bulletins, and through anecdotal dialogue, helps give a tale that's primarily set within a few rooms of an abandoned farmhouse a much larger scope. Although dated in a technical sense, a lot of the concepts and clich\u00e9s in modern zombie culture draw origins from this 1968 independent horror film. Zombies eat brains. If you are bitten by one, you will later become one. Blows to the head and burning are the only effective methods of stopping them.\"Night of the Living Dead\" from George A. Romero is, in my opinion, the movie that marks the turning point in horror, away from the Hollywood studio produced campy B-movies of the 40s and 50s and into the low-budget cult classics of the 70s and 80s. Controversial for its time, the movie shifted the genre away from stories about goofy comic book mutants and little green men, and into a realm much darker. Aside from the fact that the plot revolves around flesh-eating zombies, the film is actually quite grounded in reality. The lead character, Ben (Duane Jones), scrambles to board up the windows in order to keep the zombies out of the house. Harry (Karl Hardman), is constantly bickering with Ben as to what the best plan of action is in the situation. The human struggle of cracking under pressure and stress drives the narrative.Although we are never given much information or background about our heroes, the performances from a bunch of unknowns are all pretty serviceable. There are no standout moments that I can think of where an actor really botched the delivery of a line, but I will say that some of the dialogue isn't all that great. The news bulletin where they interview government officials in Washington D.C. stuck out like a sore thumb to me.The editing is pretty rough in some places too, with some jarring cuts and continuity errors that really throw the viewer off and disconnect them from the movie. The sound effect that they chose for Ben's rifle also just sounds pathetically weak. The punches and smacks that are thrown in the movie are packed with more life and volume than the gun.\"Night of the Living Dead\" is a flawed but highly influential piece of cinema. It spawned entire sub-genres of both zombie movies and low-budget monster flicks. It's nothing all that special in comparison with the sheer number of imitations that have come in the fifty years since it was released, but it's mark on movie history warrants a watch through for anyone who wants to know where many of their favorite tropes originated from.",

Its part of the charm. But I do also think that the film is very scary and very intense.Barbara and her brother, Johnny, are going to a graveyard to mourn the loss of their mother. A few minutes after they get there, they are attacked by what looks like a an escaped mental patient. He kills Johnny and chases after Barbara. She runs away and finds that there seems to be a lot of escaped mental patients all over the place. She gets to an abandoned farmhouse where she soon meets a man who seems to know something about what is happening. When they tell each other what happened and turn on the radio, they are horrified to learn that the escaped mental patients are not mental patients, but are in fact dead bodies that have risen from there graves and have been cannibalizing people who are alive. Things are made worse when it is discovered that it isn't just them two in the farmhouse.I find this film scary because of the grainy realistic feel of the film. It was cheaply made, with no color and no real talent, but it remains scary to this day.Many people have criticized this film for its very graphic and sickening violence, but that gross violence enhances the film rather than become a distraction.Funny thing about this movie is that it was horror Meister George A. Romero's first film. When it was released in 1968, it was not critically acclaimed. In fact it was shunned buy mostly everybody who watched it. Since them it has become a legendary horror film, and one of the most potent and interesting to this day.contains zombie violence",

            "content": "Zombies have been around for quite some time now but it would not be until a little independent film known as Night of the Living Dead was released and created the modern zombie. The film was released in 1968 and was directed by George A. Romero. The film stars Duane Jones and Judith O'Dea. The film was a critical and financial success due to the film's budget of $114,000. The film would also prove to be controversial due to it's depiction of violence. So much so, that the MPAA ratings system would be created.A group of people are trapped in a farm house where a bunch of the undead are waiting outside.Night of the Living Dead is a film that for me, while a good film, is better to be appreciated than enjoyed. Let's be honest, this film is truly groundbreaking for it's time. Without it, we would not be having the zombie media that we have today like The Walking Dead. But, like any groundbreaking film, there has been better films since. But again, I can still appreciate what this film was able to do. The film's flaws are mostly budgetary but that is what makes the film interesting to watch as a look back at independent film making. Other flaws include how female characters are written which is something Romero expressed regret about since. The characters overall are not very interesting. The only character I truly care about is the main character Ben (Duane Jones). Now the film has racial tension in key scenes which, according to Romero, was not the point because the character of Ben was going to be white but Duane Jones, a black man, had the best performance. This just makes the film more interesting to watch. It is basically a character study. I really enjoy seeing the characters strategizing about what they should do next. The film is filled with hokey moments overall but nothing that takes away the overall creepy and disturbing nature of this film. The black and white nature of this film truly helps with the overall creepiness. I should note that I watched the 2004 DVD release that had both the original black and white version and the color version and for my first time viewing, opted to watch the film as it was originally released. The film is extremely slow paced. Perhaps a little too much. Yes, it does help build the tension and at times effectively so. But there is also backstory and exposition which is a mixed bag. Especially when we are given back story for characters we frankly do not care about too much. Finally, the ending. All I can say is that for someone who does not know, they will surely be shocked.Night of the Living Dead is a good film. But there are films that are more enjoyable since this film's release but there is no doubt about this film's significance in the horror genre.",

A young woman named Barbara is visiting her dead father's grave with her brother Johnny when...This film has so much of a great reputation amongst horror fans and cinema scholars alike. Does it live up to this?In a word- YES. Not only does it feel real (it's based in the America it was made in and looks almost like a documentary) but you get the impression that the events that take place in the course of the film could actually happen. We are witnessing the fabric of society unravelling magnificently due to the disaster which has occurred. Life (and death) will never be the same again after this literally Earth-changing event.Hitchcock may have ripped up the horror rulebook by disposing of Janet Leigh's character Marion Crane early on in Psycho when the audience wrongly thought of her as the main female character who would make it to the end of the film. But George A Romero goes one better in Night. Barbara is still in the majority of the film but is so traumatised by her ordeal that she is rendered catatonic for the rest of her tenure. And what a great performance it is- a mental breakdown captured on celluloid, a brilliant portrayal of a response to trauma. Watch the scene where Barbara comes across the music box. It's one of the most unsettling scenes I've ever seen.Romero also holds a mirror up to societal tensions and conflicts throughout the film. Duane Jones as Ben is the lead of the movie but is also African American- unheard of except when depicted by Sidney Poitier in mainstream Hollywood films that felt groundbreaking and progressive but also marginalised. These films squarely tackled race (and rightly so). But Jones just happens to be black and this is never mentioned in Night. His race isn't an explicit issue in the film- but maybe directs the actions of other characters (check out the conclusion to Night. There are MANY different readings and interpretations of this. It's the most shocking ending I have ever seen in a film and just as relevant today as it was back then. I actually get a shiver down my spine just thinking about it and what we see during the end credits of this film).But there are other societal echoes within Night. Notice how Ben gives his monologue regarding the backstory as to how he ended up at the farmhouse. Jones is truly astonishing especially here. But then watch how he reacts when Barbara tells her story- her account is no less serious or devastating as she's just seen her brother being knocked unconscious after being attacked by a member of the undead during an event that should have been humdrum and routine. She is termed hysterical by Ben who tells her to calm down. Different oppressed sectors of society with equally disturbing back stories to tell but instead of each being given their time to share their experiences, a member of one group tells the other to effectively shut up. 50 years on, this film is still relevant.This film also has a lot to say about the family of that time. The traditional family is under attack from the zombies (as Robin Wood expressed using his theory of 'Return of the Repressed'). The notion of Mom, Dad and 2.4 children (possibly with an apple pie on the table) is no more. The new family in the farmhouse consists of disparate members of society who are forced together to survive against what has gone wrong in the outside world. In fact, in one scene we see Ben actually taking apart the notion of the family and the household from within as he starts taking apart furniture like the kitchen table to barricade the doors and windows with. The scene where the mother is stabbed to death by her daughter who has been bitten by a zombie represents the death of the outdated notion of the family in it's purest form. The new killing and replacing what and who has gone before.The first time I saw this film it had actually been colorised but still worked. The thinking behind this colorisation was probably the video company thinking that all horror films made within a certain timeframe were 'kitsch', camp and unworthy of serious analysis or enjoyment. I believe the term is 'so bad it's good' (vomit). I remember an advert for a screening of the film on the UK's Channel 4 that billed the film as a typical 60's drive-in B movie- cue emphasis on bad acting, rubbish make-up and all round tack. Wrong on EVERY count.It was a revelation when I first saw the film as it was intended to be seen in black and white. It's actually a beautiful film with every frame resembling the work of the Nouvelle Vague rather than some Grindhouse fodder made on the cheap to be shown to the stoned.I saw this film yesterday on the big screen. It was the Criterion 4K restoration and it looked and sounded amazing.If punk is seen as Year Zero for music then this is Year Zero for horror and one of a whole slew of films that represented a turning point for American film in general.Fun fact- this is the film on in the background when Harold is having a sandwich made in Halloween 2 (1981).",

I saw it a hundred times...A simple story, but so powerful, so efficient, and with no professional actors. No \"hollywoodian\" actors I mean.The very first scene, where we see an American flag put at the cemetery entry, which can be interpreted as the Vietnam mess - the film was shot in 1968 - is very meaningful for the rest of the film. And typical of this very period. The counter culture one.What I particularly like in this masterpiece is that there is not useless love interest between the characters, for instance Ben and Barbara's ones, as we could have expected. And I appreciate this.Yes, this movies describes the human behavior very well. After all, are the real human creatures better than the dead ones? That's the real question of the movie, that's my opinion. The characters fighting for their lives in the small house are shown in such an intense way...Films made now, in 20... are not so powerful. Sorry.And the final moral, where we finally find that the coward, nasty character - Cooper's one - was damn right, concerning the safety of the basement. All long the film, well almost, he told everyone that the basement was the safest way to stay. Ben, the lead, did not agree, so did the audience who loves this fighting character.And, at the end, that's this very basement that saved Ben.The bad guy was right at the end. That's very unusual. And concerning Barbara's character, all long the film, she is too scared to fight, help Ben to protect the house against zombies, she stays still, terrified, and only in one of the last scenes, she at last decides to fight at his side, fight like a tiger.

            "content": "After having just watched Carnival of Souls for the first time, I rewatched this one especially after finding out George A. Romero was inspired by the previous film when making this. It starts with a grown brother and sister named Johnny (Russel Streiner who also produced) and Barbra (Judith O'Dea) going to the cemetery to place a wreath on their father's grave. It's there that the first ghoul arrives to attack the sister and kill the brother. When Barbra goes to an abandoned house, Ben (Duane Jones) is the only one there since the dead previous tenant is upstairs with her face skin already eaten. It later turns out there are others emerging from the cellar. Among them are Tom (Keith Wayne), his girlfriend Judy (Judith Ridley who was married to Streiner at the time), Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman, the other producer who also did makeup and engineered the sound effects), and his wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman who would eventually become Hardman's real life spouse). The latter couple's daughter Karen (Kyra Schon who's Hardman's actual offspring) is lying in the cellar since she got bitten by a zombie. I'll stop there and just say while this movie was not completely scary, it was effectively atmospheric and provided a great shock at the end, even more so when the stills (also provided by Hardman) were presented during the closing credits. Some of the dialogue provided by Romero and John A. Russo might have been a little too talky but they do provide enough explanation as to why things happen as they did. And you gotta dig the stock music from the TV series \"The Fugitive\" and an eventual \"MST3K\" entry called Teenagers from Outer Space. There was later a 30th Anniversary Edition with an added opening and closing scene but I don't recommend that. But I most definitely recommend this, the original Night of the Living Dead.",

            "content": "Something unusual is happening in the Eastern third of the United States. The unburied recently deceased are returning to \"life\" and feasting on the flesh of those that are still living. And the problem seems to keep getting worse. The story focuses on seven characters in particular, who are forced to barricade themselves inside an isolated farmhouse. Ben (Duane Jones) is a real take-charge kind of guy, and he must deal with a near-catatonic Barbara (Judith O'Dea), and a harried husband / father, Harry (Karl Hardman), with whom he argues about methodology.People regard this as a landmark horror film - not just a landmark zombie film - for very good reason. It's all the more impressive since it was the feature filmmaking debut for the young George A. Romero, who wrote this with his friend John Russo. His direction is slick and assured, and the end result is a definitive example of how to work with a minimal budget. In fact, the lack of the kind of spit and polish that one would get with a Hollywood product only helps to completely sell the material, rather than distance us from it. It has a vivid, frightening atmosphere that draws us right in, and its characters are convincing. Harry may be an obstinate Jerk, but it's not as if he never makes any sense. One can see his argument, as well.The black & white photography is superb, and Romeros' sense of pace is wonderful. He doesn't make his audience wait long for the bad things to start happening. His images, sequences, and dialogue are now the stuff of legend. \"They're coming to get you, Barbara.\" The stock music used adds immeasurably to the appeal. And while its moments of grisly violence may not disturb a modern viewer to any great degree, this was considered quite shocking and gory in its day.The no name cast is uniformly solid. Jones is a tough, decisive hero. O'Dea is just fine, although given how her character ultimately becomes kind of useless, this may be a sticking point for some people. Hardman is excellent as the human antagonist. Marilyn Eastman, Keith Wayne, and Judith Ridley are all appealing in other key roles. And who can ever forget the face of S. William Hinzman as the very first zombie that we see? Russell Streiner (who produced the film with Hardman) and director Romero appear unbilled.The legacy of this horror masterpiece pretty much speaks for itself, with several sequels and scores of imitations resulting for almost half a century now.This one is a must see - and not just for horror fans.10 out of 10.",

            "content": "Like everyone else reviewing this film, I'm a horror fan. Hopefully, they're all horror fans too. I think I have good taste and know a good horror movie when I see it. Night of the Living Dead is considered one of the greatest and most important horror films of all time. It's impossible to ignore that and the fact that the film's director, George A. Romero, gets a lot of attention because of it. With the current state of the genre, tastes and styles continuing to change so much and so fast, a lot of the attention on Romero is negative. Many young horror fans are going back to see his earlier films and wondering why they are, and he is, so famous. I consider Romero to be a horror director with a very inconsistent record of hits and misses. He's mostly known for his \"Dead\" series of zombie films, but it's also worth mentioning that he has a lot of military plots in his films. In Night, you don't really see the military, rather you see an army on TV, comprised of gun-carrying U.S. citizens.The 1960's were a decade where a great deal of Hollywood films went into color. While Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 hit Psycho was in black and white, 1961's Breakfast at Tiffany's was in color. And the trend went back and forth again, until into the 1970's, where almost no films at all were released in black and white (except for David Lynch's Eraserhead). For the purpose of mood, most 60's horror films remained in black and white (The Haunting, Repulsion, Village of the Damned, Black Sunday, Spider Baby, The Innocents, Carnival of Souls). About black and white itself, it's often a very boring way to watch films. But it's also quite gritty. And used by certain filmmakers to achieve a realistic tone to their films' subject matter. Especially in the 60's. Most of Night of the Living Dead certainly feels realistic. For its' time, at least. It seems to be a movie about a group of people trapped inside a fairly enclosed space, with tensions mounting, then things reach a boiling point and their shelter starts to feel like a tomb.Night of the Living Dead features zombies and raises the question of where they come from without doing much to answer it. That's because we follow the characters as they enter the farmhouse and they wait for news or for others to come to their rescue. So, realistically, were we in the same position as any one of the characters, we would know only what the TV and radio were telling us. There were zombie films made before Night- White Zombie and Plague of the Zombies, as well as potentially, any film featuring The Mummy. And Frankenstein, as well, is a re-animated corpse. But while those were relegated to being cult films and failed to break through into the American mainstream, Night did in fact make a big impact on American filmgoers. I believe it may have first cracked the drive-ins. And, if there were grindhouse theaters at that time, this probably played quite a few of those. With a film like this, you really have to consider and know its' history before passing judgment on it. Also, when you do pass judgment, you have to make it personally relevant.Night has - and I know I'm not alone in seeing it this way - not aged well. It remains what it was in the 60's and styles in the genre changed so fast, the film's approach as horror was near completely obsolete by the arrival of Wes Craven's shocking and much less restrained debut, The Last House on the Left, a mere 4 years later. Though 1974's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was something of a return to Night's much less overt and in-your-face violence, Hollywood's approach to horror was also becoming more explicit, as early as 1973's The Exorcist, one of the bloodiest and most graphic horror films of its day. But even in the case of Chainsaw, the message was clear- black and white was being permanently retired by cutting edge, amateur film directors getting their start in the horror genre. Which is both a good thing and a bad thing for Night. The film became an instant classic. But it also, I think, failed to keep its' impact into the mid-1970's and the rapidly changing styles.My personal feeling on the film is that it is mostly boring. As its' focus is more on human-created tensions, I admire Romero and the fact that Night's been mostly successful (as the IMDb's rating can attest to) with film fans. But, this film is too realistic to be scary. I find films scarier when they are more like a nightmare, even surreal, but with elements of reality. Depending on the concept, horror films that concentrate more on characterization often lack a true sense of the chaotic and irrational quality of a person's worst nightmare. In a situation like this, where people are upsetting you and challenging everything you say and do, I feel more apt to be angry than scared. However, the film does have a few standout sequences that are an important signature to any good horror movie. One is a death scene involving a gardening spade. Another is a montage of zombies eating the internal organs of their victims. And the last is a scene of one of the main characters, Barbra, having a dissociative fugue while walking through the empty farmhouse (a moment that feels torn right out of Carnival of Souls, which Romero admits was an influence on Night).",

It is really nutty and crude and grotesque, but brilliant and scary, too. There's no question that it's rawness makes it seem like our own home movie, and so our own reality. It's not just a Hollywood trick to have zombies breaking down your door.The fact that the main character and most sane person is African-American is no small thing. Not only does this logically pull from the Haitian roots of zombi-ism, but it breaks barriers of basic interpersonal racial hierarchies. That is, the movies, lagging behind much of real life, had rarely played the black male in a lead role with such honest lack of self-consciousness before--maybe ever. I'd have to wrack my brain to see what other films are contenders, and I don't mean to dis the great contribution of Paul Robeson, Sidney Poitier, and others (which includes a number from the 1960s), but Night of the Living Dead is at least a contender in adding to a normalcy for the next generation, a seemingly more liberal and \"enlightened\" society of young people who are now, thankfully, the norm. Look who's president.What makes the movie important beyond this, in terms of movie-making, is that it fits in with a broader trend to a naturalism in the details, that now-famous shift in the late 1960s to filming with less polish and more everyday believability. I just watched MASH (1970) and was surprised to see it there--you forget how movies from the early/mid 1960s, even great ones about middle class people like The Apartment (1960) and Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961) or even The Odd Couple (1968) are stylized and \"perfect\" in some controlled (and brilliant) way. I like those kinds of movies, sometimes prefer them very much, but I see the penetration of this other kind of home-movie no-nonsense truth. And so do other people. Night of the Living Dead is the highest grossing film of 1968.You do wonder why our hero doesn't just call for help at the end. He is too smart to just get shot, but once that happens, the film does something conspicuous--it turns to still frames in a newspaper kind of texture, as if we are seeing documentary photojournalism in print. This adds to a kind of realism and finality, but it also reminds us of African-American victims of violence in the 1960s, seen this same way in the news. The fact that the white authorities are typical rural guys of the time, rednecks in some stereotyped way, and that they casually kill this black man, takes on significance.Not that the zombies are real, or that the acting is consistent (it sometimes is stellar). But as a style, you enter the film with different eyes, and different--not lower--expectations. Like watching a silent film, or Star Wars, or any variety of movie, you learn how to watch it right away, and adapt to its rules. The world within this film is bizarre and gripping and fabulous, in every sense of the words. Director Romero puts it together with such intuitive artfulness, you accept all its foibles as necessary to the end. Don't expect The Shining or Frankenstein or any alternative horror flick, and take its odd genius for what it is.",

Though its true that \"Psycho\" might have been the first true modern horror film, it took the rest of the decade for the genre to catch up to Hitchcock's masterpiece. The movie that truly signaled the changing of the guard, that dragged horror kicking and screaming into the modern age, was George A. Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead.\" The film's biggest contribution to the horror genre, and all of pop culture truthfully, is the modern conception of the zombie. Before this film, the only version of zombies known to the world were the traditional voodoo zombies, undead servants controlled by a master. In \"Night of the Living Dead,\" the zombies are corpses risen to life to feed upon the flesh of the living. The only way to kill one is to destroy the brain through whatever means. These are the rules that have come to define the entire zombie genre. For the record, Romero never intended to completely redefine the zombie. In his original script, he referred to the creatures as \"ghouls,\" a similar but distinct mythological creature. His main inspiration for the movie was Richard Matheson's \"I Am Legend,\" which was a novel about vampires. These specifics ended up not mattering. From the moment it was released, the ghouls in \"Night of the Living Dead\" were zombies. Henceforth, everything that acted like them were also zombies.Another aspect that has elevated the film into the upper-echelon of great horror movies is George Romero and his actors taking the material one-hundred percent seriously. The director intentionally invited a number of subtextual angles. \"Night\" is about the end of the sixties. The film is literally about a new culture arising to devour the old one. Society as we know it is overturned. The rules of life and death, as traditionally understood, are completely rewritten. Early on, Johnny makes a dismissive reference to religion. Later on, a news report says there's no time for ceremony when disposing of the dead. Religious certainties are invalid now too.If \"Night\" isn't the first modern horror film, it is, perhaps, the first post-Vietnam horror film. There's a stark quality to the way the film is shot. It frequently feels like a newsreel. These aren't movie stars in a glossy production. These are normal people involved in horrifying circumstances. In opposition to generations of Gothic horror films, the horror isn't in some exotic forgien land. It's in your backyard. By the same accord, the film brings the horror of Vietnam home. Romero and company have repeatedly denied the casting of Duane Jones, a black man, in the lead role having any significance. Yet his presence undeniably affects how the viewer watches the film. For all the layers in the film, its most universal point is that mankind is incapable of communicating. If Ben and Mr. Cooper worked together against the zombies, they might have survived the night. Instead, they bicker, argue, and compete. Humanity will never be able to get anywhere because we can't stop arguing with each other over petty, pointless bullshit.You can read a lot into \"Night of the Living Dead.\" As sophisticated as the writing is, \"Night\" is still a low budget horror film made by a first time crew. The seams show repeatedly. The camera positions are frequently awkward, sometimes creating unintentional dutch angles. The editing can be hazardous and sudden at times. The film is scored with stock library music which frequently blares and is as inelegant as possible. The story has a thrown-together quality at times, reminding the viewer how quickly and cheaply it was shot. George had a lot of stuff on his mind but the writing is still, at times, pulpy. Barbara is a defenseless woman who spends half of the movie as a frantic wreck and the other half unconscious on a couch. There are long sequences of characters walking through the house or boarding up windows which come off slightly as padding.If \"Night\" wasn't remember for birthing the modern zombie genre, it would be remember for its then-shocking amount of gore. The movie was released in a post-\"Blood Feast\" world so it's not like splatter films were a new concept. However, no movie before \"Night\" treated gore in such a visceral way. Zombies have bloody holes blown through them, which they easily shrug off. Ben stabs one ghoul in the head with a tire iron. The most infamous moment follows the explosion of the pick-up truck. An undead orgy of feasting follows, the zombies fighting over a trail of intestines and chomping down on organs and body parts. Though crude, the gore is still sickening today strictly because of the matter-of-fact way its handled. The film is going for shocks. A little girl stabs her mother to death with a trowel before gnawing on her dad's arm. Ultimately, the downbeat, bleak tone of \"Night of the Living Dead\" grants its violence more power. This is a world without happy endings. The government doesn't swoop in at the end to the save the day, like \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\" Instead, slack-jawed rednecks shoot the hero in the head, mistaking him for a zombie. The ending is sudden and nihilistic but more than makes its point.A strong helps seal the deal. Duane Jones is charismatic and gives a committed performance, even making Romero's sometimes awkward dialogue work. Karl Hardman is also notable as the bristly, hard-edged Harry Cooper. Some of the actors, like Keith Wayne or Judith Ridley, aren't as good though, giving stiff performances. Sometimes the low budget details are distracting, sometimes they are affective. Either way, \"Night of the Living Dead\" is unforgettable, still scary to this day, and surely one of the most influential horror films ever made.",

            "review_title": "The Landmark Zombie Film of All Time!!!",
            "content": "Freshman director George Romeo reinvented the zombie movie with his low-budget, black & white chiller \"Night of the Living Dead.\" Previously, virtually all zombie movies revived the undead through the use of voodoo, as in the Bela Lugosi classic \"White Zombie\" and the RKO feature \"I Walked with a Zombie.\" Primarily, these zombies were manipulated like puppets by a human master, but \"Night of the Living Dead\" changed the modus operandi of zombies. Romeo's reanimated dead were controlled by nobody but their ravenous cannibalistic appetite for human flesh. Although he produced this nail-biter on a reportedly minuscule budget of $114-thousand, Romeo exploited his dearth of financing and an unknown cast fully to his advantage because we in the audience weren't sure either who would die or when they will bite the dust. Romeo made three sequels \"Dawn of the Dead,\" \"Day of the Dead,\" and later \"Land of the Dead.\" In the first two sequels, the heroes change, but Romeo adhered to his humans-holed-up-against-the-zombies scenario. In \"Dawn of the Dead,\" the human survivors barricade themselves in a shopping mall, while in \"Day of the Dead,\" they fortify themselves in a missile silo. The other thing that set this threadbare thriller apart from other chillers was its explicit content. You actually see mutilated dead people as well as zombie munching on human body parts.\"Night of the Living Dead\" opens innocuously enough with quarreling siblings Barbra (Judith O'Dea of \"November Son\") and Johnny (Russell Streiner of \"The Majorettes\") visiting a cemetery to see their father's grave. The obnoxious Johnny does his best to scare his sister Barbra because she abhors cemeteries. Little does poor Johnny know that a cadaverous-looking man limping through the cemetery is a zombie. Moreover, this man (Bill Hinzman of \"Satan Claws\") attacks Barbra. Johnny intervenes, but the zombie kills poor Johnny when he smashes Johnny's head against a tombstone. Barbra locks herself in their Pontiac and searches for the key. Too late she realizes that Johnny has the key. Meanwhile, the desperate zombie picks up a brick and smashes a window with it. Mind you, this doesn't seem like the act of a mindless monster. As the zombie struggles to get to her, Barbra improvises and releases the hand brake so that the car coasts downhill. She manages to escape and finds the farmhouse. The zombie staggers after her and things look bleak. An intelligent African-American male, Ben (Duane Jones of \"Vampires\"), shows up and wards off the zombies with a tire-iron and a torch. Eventually, Ben supervises the motley collection of survivors as they contend with the mounting numbers of zombies. While Ben struggles to board up the house, Romeo relies on a radio newscaster to provide exposition about their predicament and present a bigger picture of disaster. The Zenith radio plays as integral a part in the action as any of the human participants. As he ransacks a closet, Ben discovers a repeating rifle and ammunition. Not long afterward, Ben and Barbra learn that a family has hidden themselves in the basement. The premise of \"Night of the Living Dead\" is that the dead get a new lease on life thanks to radiation from a crashed rocket. The radiation revitalizes them so they can walk the earth and feast on the flesh and blood of defenseless mankind. It seems that a space probe returning from Venus exploded in the atmosphere. The only way to kill these shuffle-footed corpses is to shoot them in the head. Meantime, if firearms are available, people can rely on flaming torches to hold these corpses at bay. Seven total strangers take refuge in a secluded Pennsylvania farmhouse where a legion of corpses besieges them. The zombies comes in all sizes, shapes, sexes. In fact, one of the zombies is played by a naked woman! Essentially, \"Night of the Living Dead\" is like a cavalry versus the Indians with the Indians having surrounded and cut-off the cavalry.\"Night of the Living Dead\" has a terrific ending that is laced with irony.",

We experience real horror as we realize that it is not really a scarry looking man but a kind of zombie. After quickly dispatching her brother, the zombie starts to chase the already shaken Barbara. What follows is a very tense, well directed chase. Barbara somehow gets away from the man/zombie and makes it to a house. In the house she meets a few people that have taken refuge from the apparent army of zombies that are now walking around the area trying to kill anyone they see.We then meet the real star of the movie, a black man who serves as the \"sane\" leader of the refugees giving them direction on how to fortify the house against the attacking zombies.What follows are many tense moments inside the house as the people argue about what they need to do to survive.

            "review_title": "Undying Relevance",
            "content": "\"Night of the Living Dead\" is a remarkable film for manifold reasons: a low-budget exploitation horror film cum cult classic turned widely seen and acclaimed masterpiece culturally and stylistically; credited with redefining a word, \"zombie,\" never muttered in the film, yet launching the subgenre of zombies popular throughout media to this day; a movie supposedly never intended as social commentary, nonetheless, prominently featuring an African-American lead and an ironic, tragic ending during the Civil Rights movement, on the eve of of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Even today, with the current pandemic, the picture takes on added relevance, with the characters and audiences sharing in stay-at-home orders, glued to such communication and news devices as radio and TV, fearful of the encroaching enemy outside, coming to get you.Of course, in reality, one may be more likely to be viewing films such as \"Night of the Living Dead\" than boarding up their doors and windows. Regardless, as with subsequent zombie movies, there's the spread of disease, although, here, there's not so much a virus as some space-age radiation nonsense (\"The Andromeda Strain\" written the next year and later adapted as a 1971 film contains a similar premise), although, indeed, the following year, the first men on the Moon would be quarantined over such concerns. The lead, Ben, at one point, voices concern over the disease their ghoulish attackers may be spreading. The Cooper's daughter, infected by one, is somewhat quarantined in the cellar--although social distancing becomes a problem. Even though the radiation raising the recently deceased is reported as the main cause of outbreak, then, there is still an element of it being a contact--albeit, specifically through biting--disease.While many look back to Haitian or African folklore or, as director George A. Romero specifically cited, the vampires from the novel \"I Am Legend\" (adapted as movies in 1964, 1971 and 2007), I see a more specific cinematic influence here, namely, \"Frankenstein\" (1931) and its sequels. Like Frankenstein's monster, the undead here are slow-moving, foot-dragging and mute or otherwise grunting reanimated corpses. They are scared and held back by fire. Heck, I think I even caught a brief glimpse of one ghoul that was wearing Frankenstein-esque makeup. The main difference, I suppose, is the cannibalism, but the killing of the living remains. So, too, to an extent does the metaphor of monster as movie. Granted, unlike Frankenstein's monster, the zombies aren't edited together from various body parts; rather, they disassemble the flesh and organs from others--something of the inverse of Frankenstein's creature and more akin to the mad doctor as filmmaker consuming raw material to make a meal. Recalling the history of nitrate film, too, the main threat to this reanimated picture is a decomposing body and, ultimately, catching on fire.How striking, then, that \"Night of the Living Dead\" was photographed in black and white and oft with chiaroscuro lighting and filmed at night--in the vein of those classic Universal monster movies and horror films of yesteryear. A generally effective score, too, is recycled from other sources. On the other hand, the style here was otherwise revolutionary, with camera angles seemingly chosen on the fly, sometimes abrupt editing, canted views to reflect the strange and uneasy subject matter--guerrilla filmmaking to reflect the sudden and relentless attack from the army of undead. While I must scratch my head as to why characters hide from slow moving and relatively smart (they use tools, after all) but weak zombies, yet, now, in the age of fast and strong zombies, characters choose to run from them, the shacking up in a country house here is admittedly affective of a claustrophobic and isolated panic. Moreover, it should be remembered that this was a gory picture in its day.Intended as such or not, the casting of an African-American lead was a stroke of brilliance, as well, and quite rare in American films then. The picture assumes considerably more subtextual resonance. Romero may've realized this after the fact, as he seems to have intentionally layered more social commentary into subsequent projects, whether, say, the Vietnam War in \"The Crazies\" (1973) or materialism in \"Dawn of the Dead\" (1978), for example. Consequent of this casting, \"Night of the Living Dead\" plays as an interracial couple shacking up, where the black man is the \"boss,\" and being attacked by a Zombie Klan, apparently all white, only to, then, be further slaughtered by a Bull Connor type sheriff and apparently all-white militia. The struggle between Ben and Harry also seems to take on a racial dimension. The concluding still photographs, as audio continues and only to be interrupted by fiery motion, plays out like police or news reporting on the results of a lynch mob. It's not so much that Ben may've been tragically mistaken as ghoul, rather that he was seen as inhuman in the first place by undeadly racism--a disease passed on from since-deceased ancestors but rising like the dead to attack the still living, one that the TV talking heads and radio voices may portray as mostly coming from the Southeastern United States, but a wound that, in fact, has spread all over the place.Sure, \"Night of the Living Dead,\" a low-budget exploitation flick isn't as technically and performatively flawless as a Hollywood studio product. There's too much telling and not showing, including by radio and TV, and Ben and Barbara waste time telling each other stories, one of which sounds more extravagant than anything Romero and company could've filmed within budget and, worse, Barbara recites the opening sequence we just watched. The actress playing Barbara isn't great, either, and she's certainly done no favors by a scenario calling for the damsel-in-distress routine, nor are some of the other characterizations more than generic. Indeed, it doesn't look or sound flawless. We sacrificed those production values and assembly-line touches seen in the countless, mass-produced entertainments from Hollywood to see something we hadn't seen before. And the shock was so great that the studios and other filmmakers reintegrated the zombies, as well as other themes and style, back into their machinery. They're no longer coming to get you; we've long been slayed and have been consuming such fare ever since.",

The term 'zombie' had been coined many times before, possibly earlier than 1932's White Zombie, but was a label given to creatures and humans under voodoo spells in many different incarnations. In 1968, writers John Russo and George A. Romero took the term and applied it to the walking dead - brainless creatures who existed for nothing other than human flesh; a shuffling army that would stop only if their brain was destroyed, or their head removed from their body. The film was Night of the Living Dead, and although it was ridiculously criticised for its gory content (which was very extreme for its day), changed the face of horror forever, and would influence movies right up to the modern day.The now-familiar story begins with siblings Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny (Russell Streiner) visiting the grave of their father. With Johnny teasing Barbra about monsters and ghoulies, a man attacks Johnny, causing him to hit his head on a gravestone while Barbra flees to a nearby house. Traumatised by what she has just witnessed, Barbra is joined at the house by Ben (Duane Jones), who quickly starts boarding up the house to halt the encroaching zombies. They watch the news reports on the television about this strange attack, while married couple Harry (Karl Hardman) and Helen (Marilyn Eastman) emerge from the cellar, claiming their daughter has been attacked and is lying unconscious. With the outside fires set by Ben only delaying the zombie onslaught, they must hatch a plan to escape.It was alarming watching this film again after a number of years, after devouring many horror films in the past ten years or so. Living Dead's basic concept and plot devices have been used time and time again throughout the decades, and is a massive testament to the legacy of the film. It plays out like a guidebook on how to make a zombie film - the retreat, the do-good male lead, the annoying guy with a shirt and tie, the make-or-break run for the escape vehicle, the overwhelming final attack - are now so familiar. Yet after seeing this basic plot played out hundreds of times, Night of the Living Dead still seems fresh and ground-breaking, never coming across as clich\u00e9d or a tired idea.Of course, most horror films lack the social bite or political commentary of Romero's zombie series. While its 'sequel' Dawn of the Dead (1978) used its shopping mall setting as an attack of America's consumerist obsession, Night uses its informative news reports as a damning indictment of the U.S.A.'s gun-ho attitude and ultra-violent tendencies towards infiltration, possibly a reaction to the country's ridiculous response to the emergence of communism. And although Romero's claims that Duane Jones was cast solely on his audition, rather than the fact that he was black, the now-legendary final scenes prove to be either a massive bit of luck, or a pre-meditated stroke of genius from the writer's as a metaphor for the racial tension that was so prevalent in 1960's America.All that aside, this is simply great horror. Though (in my opinion) Romero's follow-up Dawn of the Dead is a better film, Night of the Living Dead is where it all began. It's grainy, hand-held, black-and- white cinematography not only adds a low-budget dirty quality to the film, but also proves what greatness can be done with an original idea, a lot of heart, and a heap of innovation, regardless of what your budget may be. Obviously, it's not scary anymore, and the gore levels are incredibly tame by today's standards, but the tension and claustrophobic atmosphere is still as effective as I would imagine it was back in 1968. And the final moments of pessimism that the film leaves you with does nothing but ensure the film is engraved into your memory. Romero may have lost in touch with his modern zombie films, but this is a staunch reminder of the horror auteur's genius.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

She seeks shelter in an abandoned farmhouse and is soon joined by a trucker, Ben (Jones) who looks for help and together they protect themselves with some other people against flesh hungry zombies.

            "content": "It was interesting to see Night of the Living Dead turn into such a cult classic, and I think that one of the biggest reasons that that happened was because of its simplicity. You might notice a trend in the horror genre, the less extravagant they are the better, and this is a perfect example of the less extravagant category. Shot in black and white several decades after color became normal in mainstream film, Night of the Living Dead scares through some of the same tactics later used by other classic horror films, notable Halloween, with the slow but relentless Michael Meyers stalking constantly. He's slow, but like the zombies in this movie, he is virtually unstoppable. Granted, the zombies can be killed with a shot to the head or some other way of separating the brain from the rest of the body (pleasant, isn't it!), but their sheer numbers compensates for this weakness. Because we don't see the events that lead up to what is famously referred to as `an epidemic of mass murder being committed by a virtual army of unidentified assassins' (White Zombies fans are sure to prick up their ears at this radio broadcast), it's reasonable to assume that the vast majority of the human population has fallen victim to the walking dead, and the people we see barricading themselves in the house are the few remaining survivors.\nOne of the strange things about Night of the Living Dead is the way it is structured, or I should say the time that it takes place. A lesser director might have concentrated on the widespread attacking and panic that lead to most people being turned into zombies, but not only would that not have been possible with this movie's famously miniscule budget, but it's not really the point. That timeline would fall flat because it would force the movie to focus on a few select people, who would just happen to be the ones that survived long enough to become characters with names and personalities (well maybe just names, let's not go crazy here, this IS a horror movie\u0085). It would kind of kill the suspense.While it may seem that the movie started right on the middle of things and that we've already missed all the good stuff, I think it's important to keep in mind that, given the movie's budget and intentions, George Romero wanted it to be as simple as possible. It has a little bit of a character study, featuring characters in an extreme crisis situation who can do nothing but quarrel amongst themselves like blithering idiots who can't stand to see anyone else in power (as well as a blonde woman who periodically can't even speak). The movie is about a bunch of people thrown into this situation and how they deal with the situation and each other in order to survive the night. It's telling, for example, that throughout the entire trilogy we're never given a real reason for why people were turning into zombies in the first place, because it doesn't matter.From a technical standpoint, the movie is brilliant because of Romero's sheer ability to get so much out of so little. The movie is crudely shot, but I think that actually adds to the effect because it gives it something of a documentary feel, not the polished look of so many modern horror movies whose special effects do nothing more than remind the audience constantly that they are movies. Night of the Living Dead really couldn't afford to look so fake. The acting is terrible throughout, but the important part is that the zombies looked at least halfway like zombies. Consider the abysmal sequel (which was recently remade into one of the best horror modernizations ever created), in which the zombies look like nothing more than masses of extras with cheesy blue make-up all over their faces. In this movie, it's not hard to see that the make-up is crude, but the crudeness of the film stock as well as the shooting itself gets past that. Ironically, it's more effective because you can't really see it so clearly. Night of the Living Dead has become a cult classic because of how daring it was (in such ways as the horribly ironic ending) and how frightening it managed to be despite its miniscule budget. Granted, even this titan of a horror classic has been subdued to the point where it tends to generate more respect than fear (as is the case with most older horror films which are actually well made), but it's position in film history is unmistakable, even today, when it's sequel has been massively improve by a recent remake. It is black and white and seems ancient, but Night of the Living Dead remains a movie for current aspiring horror filmmakers to study and emulate.",

            "review_title": "Very Progressive Film-making For 1968",
            "content": "Night of the Living Dead is different in every way from any movie of its kind up until its release in 1968. For example, its cinematography is gritty, blunt, and brassy, with brutal closeups, truly lurid imagery, and inspired use of hand-held camera-work that sends you head on to the edge of your seat. Another example is how its characters are in no way horror film stereotypes. Aside from its hero being a mild-mannered, confident, and dignified black man, which was a bit bold of George Romero in the '60s, especially in making a low-budget independent debut, all of its characters are their own beasts. They are down to earth, with very human flaws and realistic emotional responses to everything.I don't consider this film to be very scary, though. Yes, it has a very creepy atmosphere, great suspense, and two jarringly wicked scenes of violence. It has a perfect setting for a movie about being trapped by surrounding zombies, a crumbling old house amidst a long field and a graveyard in the country. However, despite its ranking as one of the most popular movies of the horror genre, it doesn't afford the luxuries of an ideally scary film, such as being kept up at night, your dreams being affected, its weight on your mind for the next couple of days, having a strange feeling of not wanting to be alone at night, your nerves being on end, etc.Romero, however, delivers a great, infinitely inventive movie. At its core, the plot basically consists of debating on a decision between staying upstairs in a house or going down into the cellar. I mean, come on. What formula could that possibly be following? Its back-story is told in a very very clever fashion, as the hero rapidly goes through the house securing the windows and doors and preparing weapons and building fires whilst we hear the radio in the background with an announcer informing us of the epidemic and what places have been overtaken by mysterious stoic killers and how their victims have risen and begun killing as well, and we as the audience put the pieces together. In this review, I've given just a few reasons why I think this film is so well-written and well-directed. Granted, you will never see any of the actors doing much else, and thankfully so on account of their incredibly campy performances, save for Duane Jones, who plays the hero, Marilyn Eastman, who plays the humble but sneering wife of the egotistical family man who constantly fights Jones, and the earthy, laid-back man who leads the posse. It's a low-budget film, though, but it's very original and spawned many lesser clones.",

He could've killed every single one. of course as usual, it fails to explain how the dead could rise and live anyway. Why do they breathe?

We exchanged a few words and went our separate ways into the auditorium. The next day I spoke with a mutual friend who informed me that my female friend had fled the theatre before the movie ended and had wound up at his place shaking badly and needing a drink. I just watched \"Night of the Living Dead\" again today and I can tell you that nothing has changed. It hasn't lost any of its impact. It's still a nasty piece of business.\"Night of the Living Dead\" is B-movie schlock on a low budget, nothing less, nothing more, and it pulls out the standard radiation-from-space explanation for the goings-on; however, it takes a giant leap beyond its genre limitations. It sets us up with a generic story and stock characters then pulls the rug out from underneath us. The hero is not only African-American but is clearly the smartest and most capable character in the picture. Remember, this is 1968 and there are few African-American role models in mainstream American films other than Sidney Poitier. There's a social sub-text in the movie leading to an ending that should not be revealed. Horror movie endings are a touchy subject. I don't need a happy ending, but I don't want a gratuitous, gimmicky twist at the end, either. I prefer an ending that's a logical extension of the story. It can be the ultimate horror, maybe the result of a fatal warp in the protagonist's character or some overwhelming desire that blinds that person, or the ironic twist of fate that the protagonist never saw coming.\"Night of the Living Dead\" opens in a graveyard. There's a spat between siblings, a graveside visit, some bitching about the wreath, a tasteless joke, a gaunt old man lurching toward them - and wham! The movie's got you by the throat. Ten or so minutes into the movie and either you can't leave or you want to leave really badly - the option my friend chose. This time around I understood one crucial thing. This movie means business. It's lean, mean, grim and macabre. It's not particularly gory by today's standards, but many of the images are genuinely shocking, and the panic of the opening minutes never quite subsides. George Romero made this film with a great deal of care and skill, and the results are there on the screen. The musical score, in particular, gets under your skin. The actors are very convincing, particularly the actress who plays the woman in shock. I wonder if my friend ever watched this movie again.",

She goes to a house kept by Ben (Duane Jones) that is mercilessly attacked by the Living Dead. While there we meet the Coopers Helen (Marilyn Eastman) her husband Harry (Karl Hardman) and their sleepy daughter Karen (Kyra Schon).How did this one film change horror?1. slowburn: there is a story, it creeps up, and the suspense of the Leinengen vs the Ants story is palpable.2. Bleak Ending: before Night... there would be a last minute messiah that would solve the problem and save the day\n3. Low budget: you can make a successful horror with no budget.4. Dimming censorship: with Vietnam happening on the nightly news the gruesomeness of Night... was acceptable on the big screen.5. Blatant messaging: the terror is not them it's us. Powerful. All hood zombie movies that's it\n6. Zombies: duh...Romero admitted to the messaging. He also liked to play with audience about the idea of the zombies being the good guys. Truly, this is the best adaptation of Matheson's I am legend ever attempted. Ben (Duane Jones) has a house it's being attached by zombies whereas in legend they were vampire creatures. In this case you add additional characters for story.Like Matheson the twist are the zombies are the good guys. They are the counterculture of the summer of love creeping into your home. They include a black man of power, a woman on her own without family, and a divided family all under siege by the symbol of counterculture (the zombies) scratching at their door.The only true hope to overcome the patriarchy outside is for these parallel movements: civil rights, women's rights and family rights to join in with the counterculture. However, there lay the horror. They do not want to or realize the hoard outside is merely attempting to co-opt their ideas for their own and usurp them.At its core it is a home invasion movie with the additional fun of zombies.Can you watch Night... with out it's social commentary? Sure, you can try. However, it's obvious and blatant with the last minute slapping the fun off of your face.",

I was not impressed at all with the incorporation of new footage that was shot over 30 years later. It was just silly, the dialogue, the acting, everything. It's just so hammy. On top of this we're supposed to pretend that old Bill Hinzman and young Bill Hinzman look alike. It's thirty freakin' years later! He doesn't look remotely as scary as he did back then.

We get limb gnawing, stabbings, and blood. The Acting is excellent!. Duane Jones is AMAZING here, he is extremely likable, amazing in the acting department, had some classic dialog, and i just loved him overall, his amazing performance will be remembered forever!. Judith O'Dea was good for the most part, but didn't have much to do but looked shocked, and she got on my nerves sometimes, still she got the job done. Karl Hardman is fantastic as the asshole i hated him. Marilyn Eastman does what she has to do well. Keith Wayne and Judith Ridley are both likable and did fine with what they had to do.

I first saw this movie upon its initial release and during a midnight Hallowe'en showing at our local theater. The place was packed full of teens just out of a football game, and in the first couple minutes they were all yelling and making fun of the opening. Then -- Wham! The first killing shocked the entire audience into silence, and kept them screaming in their seats throughout the remainder of the film. George Romero's lack of funds to make this a big budget film only served him well. It plays like a documentary, and that is what makes this film so wonderfully frightening. The dead come to life (never mind the explanation of how, as it doesn't really matter) and become ghouls preying upon the flesh of the living. Only a trauma to the head will stop their desire for human food. Commendable for allowing a black man to be the lead heroic character, and Duane Jones is perfect in his tragic role. A movie about survival, emotional bonding/dis-bonding, and human values. The gore is proper without being overdone. Tame by today's standards, and that's too bad. Look at this film and you'll long for Romero to go back to what made him famous -- terror and gore and human plight in doses justenough to keep you on the edge of your seat.",

The monsters he created did not rely size or weapons to induce fear. They were mere human bodies but without life or conscience and a voracious appetite for human flesh and they multiply by turning their victims into one of them. What can be more fearful than being slowly consumed alive or seeing your loved ones turned into one of them.Restricted to a low budget, Romero turns his disadvantage around. Most of the movie takes place in a farmhouse, where a small group of people seek refuge from the onslaught of the living dead. There is a great attention paid to the affect of the terror outside on the people holed- up inside; their fear, confusion, clash of ideas/egos, the consequent altercations and the tragedy of it all are well-depicted. At the same time we are informed of the wider extent of the terror through news bulletins. The actors are little known but deliver some good performances. The black-and-white prevents us from noticing a lot of blood and for the most part the movie plays on the psychological fear of the viewers. But there are some very disturbing scenes and images peppering the movie, and each time we see one of those, we start dreading the one to come next.This is horror at its best.",

There are quite a few goofs which are obvious(too many to name), but the feeling of dread permeates throughout this terrific horror film, and I still haven't seen another zombie film which captures the spirit of this 1968 classic. I was equally impressed with the performance of Duane Jones as Ben, a surprising black hero in a film where everyone else was white; he has a calming influence and is easily the man in charge, but not in a very arrogant manner, although I didn't like how he kills Harry, who's the father of a sick young child, and husband. Who's to say how we would react if we were in that stressful situation? Harry was also clearly a coward, but was his murder justified? It's somewhat disappointing that the late Jones seems to have downplayed his role in the film, but that doesn't take away from a strong performance. He is probably one of the main reasons that I'll watch this film in the future, and he gives a memorable performance.",

When they arrive at the spooky graveyard, Johnny teases his jumpy sister: \"They're coming to get you, Barbara.\" But the joke is on him, because they are really coming to get Barbara. And Johnny, too. And the hole country for that matter. A mysterious epidemic causes the dead to rise from their graves and attack the living. One of those ghouls attacks Barbara. Johnny defends her, and Barbara flees in terror. She reaches a secluded farm house and meets other people who seek shelter. Can these strangers work together in order to survive? Or are they going to destroy each other, before the ghouls even reach them?\"Night of the Living Dead\" is one of my favorite movies of all time. It certainly is the best horror movie I've ever seen. That being said, it's difficult to explain why I love it so much. It is a low budget flick. There are some glaring editing mistakes and the acting is subpar most of the time. But like no other movie out there, \"Night of the Living Dead\" is able to turn its trash atmosphere into pure art. It's such a gritty and dirty experience, you feel like you need a shower afterwards. There are two main reasons why this movie is so effective: the director George A. Romero and the subtext of the screenplay.Romero didn't have much to work with, but he made it count. The scene where Barbara explores the empty farm house is exquisite. The lighting is reminiscent of German Expressionism. The awry camera settings and the contrast between light and dark are great devices to elucidate Barbara's trauma. There is a scene where Romero pans over the barricaded interior of the farm house. The intersecting planks form an abstract pattern that is strangely unsettling. You'll soon realize that this movie might be cheap, but surprisingly artful as well.\"Night of the Living Dead\" was a watershed for modern horror because it was insanely gruesome for the time: There are zombies hunting people and eating the flesh of their prey. But it's not the explicit gore that makes this movie so effective. The true horror stems from the way Romero depicts these acts of violence. They come across as surreal and deviant, like you're having a sick fever dream. The subtext of this movie is incredibly rich. The screenplay tackles many unwieldy political topics - war, racism and marriage are only a few of them. \"Night of the Living Dead\" is a relentless, apocalyptic nightmare that has nothing for the audience except unnerving pessimism. The ending of this movie might just be the best ending in movie history: It's poignant, courageous and subversive. \"Night of the Living Dead\" is an utterly unique, matchless horror movie. If you haven't seen it, watch it. Now. And if you already saw it, watch it again. Now.",

            "content": "This is my #1 favorite horror film of all time. It is the only movie to ever give me nightmares. I started getting them as a teenager, put into the same situation as the film \u2013 one among a small band of people trying to survive a zombie apocalypse, surrounded by an increasing number of the living dead.Aside from the nightmares, this is my #1 horror movie because it creates an atmosphere of absolute dread \u2013 something that I appreciate in a movie (thus my screen name AnDread). The protagonists face what seems to be a pretty much hopeless situation, surrounded by numerous antagonists who want to eat you, who can't be reasoned with, and who continue to grow in number. On top of that, they are faced with in-fighting and incompetence. Perhaps they could survive if they just learned to work together, rather than constantly argue with each other. But this is Romero's not-so-subtle point: compromise rather than dominance is the key to survival. He has said that he thought of the living dead as a revolution, a new (single- minded) generation cannibalizing the older, obsolete generation. Actually, I think of them more akin to a natural disaster \u2013 or Godzilla, a monster birthed from our own violent ways, a new creation bent on destroying everything old.The nihilistic ending still gives me chills \u2013 it's one of the bleakest movie endings ever. I don't want to spoil it. I'll just say that when I saw it for the first time as a teen, it hit me pretty hard. I had never seen any movie end like that.For such a low-budget film, Romero does a fantastic job using sound, lighting, practical effects, and performances to maximum advantage. The acting is excellent. Some may not be impressed with the way the characters are written, or the way they are portrayed. But while both are handled with a simplistic, at times seemingly melodramatic, approach, the writing is more layered than you might first think. And I think most people would agree that the performances are highly memorable. Duane Jones as Ben and Karl Hardman as Harry Cooper make this film work so well; seeing their increasing aggression and rivalry ratchets the tension to an almost unbearable degree. This dynamic is so complex that I see it a new way each time. While I've always identified with and rooted for Ben \u2013 quite a feat for an African American protagonist in 1968 \u2013 on recent viewings, I've come to realize that Ben isn't always that reasonable either. If he hadn't been so pushy and competitive with Cooper, maybe things could have turned out differently. Judith O'Dea as Barbara and Marilyn Eastman as Helen Cooper also deserve mention. Some people criticize O'Dea's performance as wooden or the way her character is written as sexist, because she's either hysterical or catatonic through much of the narrative. But I think plenty of people, men and women, would be like Barbara in a similarly horrifying situation. Although she has a minor role, Eastman as Helen is a great counterpoint to both Barbara and her husband, spitting sarcastic barbs at Harry and trying to become part of the larger group. I can't say that Keith Wayne as Tom and Judith Ridley as Judy add much, except as a counterpoint to the Coopers, a couple who tries to hang on to love during a crisis. Kyra Schon as Karen, the Coopers' daughter, George Kosana as Sheriff McClelland, and Russell Streiner as Johnny (who, according to IMDb, is uncredited for some reason), show just how memorable minor characters can be. Streiner and Kosana speak two of the most memorable lines in horror movie history \u2013 \"They're coming to get you, Barbara,\" and \"They're dead, they're all messed up.\" And to many, Schon's big scene is one of the most disturbing scenes in all of horror cinema.The black and white cinematography also adds to the bleakness of the film; for me, the often washed-out look and dark lighting make the zombies more frightening than in any of the subsequent films, with skin tones of blues, greens, and grays, and bright red blood flowing. Something about watching the ghouls stumble around in the shadows, and blood pour out in dark swatches, adds a sinister air to them that doesn't quite translate to color, even in the more realistic and disgusting effects in later films.Many have already spoken eloquently about the film's social commentary and influence on later horror films, and culture generally. I'll just say that Romero and John Russo (who co-wrote the script) tapped into already existing horror elements and current social anxieties around civil unrest, clashes with authorities, and Vietnam, by creating a new genre, the flesh-eating zombie film (as opposed to the Voodoo zombie), and virtually helping to usher in a new horror aesthetic \u2013 bleaker, gorier, and more focused on gritty realism than stylized aesthetics.",

I did not find this movie had all that much social commentary in it, lets face it the guy was wrong holding up in the cellar was the smart move to make...just not holding up in the cellar and sneaking around when help finally arrived. Still it is not all bad as the zombie attack at the end was good and it was rather bloody for a film of its time and you have to know Romero did not have much of a budget so he did the best he could with what he had. Also, if it were not for this movie other zombie movies including the much more superior Dawn might not have been made. Still you can tell it is his first effort and the rules for zombies had not yet been established as sometimes they run here, but most of the time they are slow.

Here is where I beg to differ! Unlike, say, \"The Maltese Falcon\" (forefather of film noir) or \"Psycho\" (creator of the slasher genre), NOTLD doesn't really stand out or hold up as a film. The aforementioned movies have a style, interesting characterizations, sharp dialogue, and classic lines that make them truly memorable. I'm no film snob, but I also know when a movie is just not good, and NOTLD is just...not...good!Directed by George Romero, NOTLD is obviously made on the cheap, shot in black-and-white, and possessing an all too lifeless, monotone tone throughout. The main female, the (coming to get you) Barbara literally goes mute for most of the film due to the terror of seeing the first zombie, most coincidentally after her nerdy, jerk of a brother teases her as a wannabe-ghost in a graveyard as they are visiting a family member's tombstone. Barbara escapes the attacker (her brother not so lucky) and she finds a nearby farmhouse, where she holes up. THIS is where the clich\u00e9 elements of the zombie genre had their began! In addition to Barbara, a ragtag group of people join her, the heroic loner Ben, the bickering married couple Harry and Helen and their daughter Karen, and the young tween couple Tom and Judy. This group of strangers must band together to fight the zombie threat. Ben and Harry are at odds as they butt heads as to the best courses of action to survive. The men strategize and plan, while the women just kind of stand there and support them, or say nothing like Barbara! The misogynistic time in which the film takes place is all too apparent, but it's interesting that Romero cast an African-American as the male lead in essentially a film that founded a new genre. Usually, it's stereotypical casting in films like this one and it takes forever for the liberal world to catch up!While Romero should be credited for starting a new genre and taking risks that other directors might not have taken, the movie itself is a very flawed, dull exercise to get through. I kind of feel about the zombie genre the way I feel about movie musicals...just not my cup of tea!",

She hides out in a farmhouse with other human survivors such as Ben, Harry Cooper with his wife & daughter, and two other people as they defend themselves and the house from the walking dead including trying to find a way out.This is a groundbreaking work of art that started it big for the zombie genre in horror movies! What started out as a Independently made movie by first time writer and director George A. Romero shot on a low budget it then transformed into a success and a masterpiece of pure annihilating terror that struck a chord with audiences everywhere. The scenes of violence, gore, ghastly images and claustrophobic themes shocked audiences when it originally came out even though it's still disturbing and scary today as it was back then.Most recommended!Followed by \"Dawn of the Dead\" ( 1978), \"Day of the Dead\" and \"Land of the Dead\". Unofficial prequel: \"Zombi 2\" ( a.k.a. Zombie Flesh Eaters, Zombie). Remade: \"Night of the Living Dead ( 1990)\".",

This movie from 1968 will cause nightmares. No other movie ever put to film a movie as creepy as this. Low budget black and white amateur actors' absolute genius. Without question the best horror film ever made. George Romero really pushed the envelope with this one. The violence is still stunning to this day. The scene with the mother and daughter is just awful. I can go on and on. And \"WOW\" what an ending. Unlike no other. This film is so sad, creepy, violent, and pulls no punches.

            "content": "Who would think that a very low budget horror film, one of the first grindhouse films, could end up being a genuine classic and one of the greatest scary films ever made? It's definitely thanks to the tension and the script and the performances, and for some reason the low budget really works, mainly because of the direction of George Romero who has gone on to legendary status because of this. A cast of amateur actors get together (although a few would later become professional) and prove that you don't have to be a trained thespian to be convincing. With a cast led by Judith O'Dea as the petrified Barbara (witnessing her brother mutilated by zombies) and Duane Jones as the heroic Ben, who comes upon Barbara in an abandoned farmhouse and protects her from the approaching danger. Five others join them and the conflict of joining in battle together to fight these undead creatures is also mixed with how their personalities conflict, creating a brilliant structure.Filmed in black and white which makes the film all the creepier, this isn't the gory slaughter film of legend, but a very intense thriller that is gripping from start to finish, and certainly worthy of more than just cult status. With horror films very popular in the late '60s (with \"Rosemary's Baby\" being the most prestigious, and many Gothic classics released through Hammer or American International, as well as various European directors making their own contribution to the genre), this is one of the more unique because it's set in modern day, looks cheap but is actually quite artistic and convincing. Perhaps as a film coming out in a year where there were still threats of nuclear war, this served as a metaphor for the type of damage it could do, and it led to a whole series of not so great follow-ups that only serve to make this seem all the more well made. Jones is certainly fantastic in this, and he ends up becoming one of the best heroes in a horror movie ever put on screen.",

If you took out the zombies and birds and replaced it with a psycho, it could have easily been Psycho. And so on . . .That is my main complaint. Yes, this movie brought zombies to the mainstream, and I am insanely thankful for it in that right. I think for that alone it deserves to be remembered for centuries past its time. Besides that, however, nothing about this movie stands on its own two legs. Everything from the sets to the characters to the situation to the camera style was borrowed. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, about this movie can be called even remotely original, even for its time.From a modern view, this movie is pathetic. None of the intensity of zombie video games like Dead Rising or the scares of Resident Evil. None of the coolness of more modern zombie movies like 28 Weeks Later or other newer Romero films.In its time, I'm sure I would have given it at least a 9/10 because it would be the first time I'd have seen zombies on screen.

            "content": "It would have been better if all three of the original films were in colour, but this is still a great classic from director George A. Romero. Basically the film starts with Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and her brother Johnny (Russell Streiner) visiting a graveyard to place some flowers, and Johnny is trying to scare his sister because of her nervousness in graveyards. Then soon enough a man comes along, and attacks Johnny, but this is no ordinary man, and Barbara doesn't wait around to see him properly. She finds herself hiding in what seems to be an empty house from more of these \"creatures\", eventually joined by black character (there's one in all of them) Ben (Duane Jones). As they try and board up the house and protect themselves from these things, they find the phones are dead and there is only one radio and television channel being broadcast, all emergency. They also find they are not alone and that there have been people hiding in the basement for ages, these are Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman) with wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman) and sick (from being bitten by one of the creatures) Karen (Kyra Schon) and friends Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley). The television and radio broadcasts confirm from many sources that these creatures are recently dead people rising back to life, and most believe this is the cause of a satellite crash which is continuously spreading radiation. They also explain that these creatures have only one instinct, to feed on human flesh, and like the daughter, turns into one of them, and eats her own father, and kills her own mother (both then controversial moments). In the end, all survivors except Ben are either killed by their own doing or by the undead, and all bodies burned on the bonfire by farmers, and Ben is mistakenly shot (another then controversial moment) and also burnt. The film may be old, but it still has the power to shock and maybe sicken audiences, even if the picture quality isn't brilliant, e.g. lighting techniques, but still a good classic horror. The film was number 93 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Outstanding!",

Actress Kyra Schon says she was not asked to attend a horror convention until 1988 -- twenty years after the film's release -- and was even teased by her classmates. And the social commentary of having a black man as a leader was never intentional, though contributed to its significance later on.I have wondered if perhaps its falling into public domain was its greatest asset. While it may have not helped the bank accounts of those involved, it did allow the widespread use of the film, and it has been referenced in other films countless times.

            "content": "The beginning of all modern horror films, and along with Psycho the most influential horror movie ever. Although it draws on many of the early monster movies of the 30's, with a seemingly unstoppable beast tracking down prey, and enhancing the atmosphere of those films for the new wave audience. However, aside from that NNOTLD is a breed apart from anything else at the time. Tonnes of gore, shocks the cinema goer had never experienced, unexpected twists and turns, downbeat, scary, with unusual protagonists and new ways of story telling, the world didn't know what had hit them.It was the late sixties. Veitnam was proving that America was not all-powerful, and asking questions about who were the good guys, about motivation, about the human race as a whole. Anti-war protesters were being beaten and gassed for what they believed, while America was attempting to destroy another place...for what they believed. Hippies were spreading a message of love, new ideas were flourishing in all areas, from making peace to making war, and technology was becoming more important and influential. The result was that the good guys were often over-looked, good deeds were mostly forgotten, and many lives were thrown away aimlessly and without purpose. Those who survived wondered why, and had no clue why they were here. It seemed outside, bigger forces were at play, and that unseen beings were controlling the public. NOTLD was released.A brother and sister are travelling to their parents' graves in the countryside, a trip that has become an annoyance rather than a mark of respect. Johnny, the man taunts his sister Barbara like he used to as a kid, scaring her, saying the infamous line 'they're coming to get you Barbara'. A man walks towards them and suddenly attacks without warning. Johnny is killed and Barbara flees to a nearby farmhouse. She enters a near comatose state. Another man arrives, Ben and begins to board up the doors and windows, telling Barbara that he too was attacked by a number of people, and witnessed a town coming under siege. The attackers seem to have no regard for their own safety, and feel no pain. Soon people who had been hiding in the basement appear, and together the group try to figure out what to do. The TV says the attackers can be killed by a heavy blow to the head, and seem to be scared of fire. It seems that, inexplicably the dead are coming back to life and eating the flesh of the living, who in turn become zombies. The group argue over the best solution, tensions arise, and all the while, the number of zombies outside grows, waiting.The film has great depth and terrific acting from amateurs. No-one is safe from harm here, and it seems that the group's downfall is because they are human and cannot work as a group because personal interest and opinion always interferes. The zombies do not argue, they will happily wait for their chance and strike with stunning force, as a unit. If you take down one, there are 10 more closing in. The group could have escaped earlier, by running past the few zombies, and it seems the house becomes their coffin. If they had not fought amongst themselves they may have had a chance. But even then, where would they have gone? Ben as the main character is seen as revolutionary because he was black, but this was not in the script. Romero has since become a champion of the disenfranchised- women, children, other races. His performance is strong. Judith o' Dea as Barbara does not have much to do, but is good, and the other stand out is Karl Hardman as Cooper. He has a wife and injured daughter and feels Ben is endangering them with his schemes. Tom and Judy are a local farm couple, innocents who try to think clearly and are punished for it. Indeed it seems that when a good plan comes around, it is stopped in its tracks with devastating results. Though human error is the major mistake in a darkly ironic twist.Although it was filmed in BW, the gore is there. People are eaten and burned, flesh is chewed on the full screen, bullets are driven through chests. The shocks are genuinely shocking, and the film's atmosphere is claustrophobic and we sense the dwindling of hope. The overall tone of the film is stark, and it seems the future only holds violence. The film struggled to find distributors, and was shown in matin\u00e9es to unsuspecting youngsters-we can only imagine their reactions. Truly a horror classic, and one of the most nightmarish films ever made, with a view of the world as a terrible place filled with pain and stupidity. We cannot overcome creatures which cannot think. Death is shown as a creeping inevitability, and the good guys almost always lose. 10 out 0f 10.",

            "content": "Hmmm, I don't know about this one. At points I couldn't take it seriously, and at others I was engrossed in the characters and story. Fair to say, Night of the Living Dead is a very decent horror movie, and certainly an influential one for it's time... but I can't help but be distracted at its sometimes dated style.Firstly, I loved the photography in this film. It is probably one of the finest I have seen to date in a horror movie that manages to encapsulate the story wonderfully and bring out the real claustrophobic atmosphere present within the story. The way this is done so well is particularly through the highly dramatic lighting used throughout usually creating dark shadows across faces and objects to great effect. I also enjoyed the overall feel of the film, created by the actors and the music which always helps to bring out the dramatic moments in the film. Performances were on the whole, very good, with only a few dumb moments here and there.The story is fairly paced, but does take a little while to fully establish itself and the conflict at hand successfully. I was actually ready to change the channel near 1/4 of the way in, but I stayed with it and was glad because it finally did pick up and move on somewhere interesting. Characters were well written with realistic dialogue and most were decently fleshed out, however I was a little annoyed at the killing off of a character 5 minutes in, that I was actually enjoying watching.Aside from the pacing, perhaps the most dated features of the film are indeed the effects and make-up. Sure, they look great for a movie made in the 60's, but they just don't hold up that entirely well today. Furthermore, there are some major unanswered plot holes everywhere in the film that bugged me all the way through that I wished they had clarified just a little, but nonetheless, it isn't anything to dislike the feature for.In the end, I was entertained by Night of the Living Dead, but necessarily scared. I guess my standards are just a little higher than audiences of the 60's having seen horror films from 40 years after this film was released. Nevertheless, I absolutely recommend it to classic horror fans and just about anyone looking for an entertaining and possibly scary couple of hours to pass away.8/10",

But that's not to say that it is bad - Primitive Technology on YouTube has shown me time and time again that early man was brilliant. And in a way it was refreshing to take a break from overdone gore and overacting. Well, overacting is still here. The plot is pretty simple by today's standards too. A couple of people, led by a Mr. Ben (Duane Jones) attempt to survive against a wave of zombies while trying hard not to attack each other first. And more than 90% of the movie takes place inside the same house which they barricade and raid for supplies. As far as the simple plot goes, I feel they do it justice, and it is supplemented by the interesting to watch power struggle between Ben and Mr. Cooper (Karl Hardman) and the racial undertones that the movie infers. But aside from the inherent fun this movie offers, about halfway through, the movie becomes a little repetitive. Even though new characters are introduced, the tone feels quite samey for the entire middle leg. It's not until the run where Tom (Keith Wayne), Judy (Judith Ridley), and Ben run out where things get moving again. Perhaps I am just accustomed to today's thrillers which keep up at a breakneck pace for the entire runtime, but it felt not too much was happening during that period. Overall, I think it a successful and worthy grandfather of modern horror.",

And while it may not have been the \"first\" zombie movie ever created, it set the rules and the standard for which all other zombie films are judged. Now, that is not to say that there aren't good zombie movies out there. But this is the film that essentially started the modern zombie genre. It's as simple as that. Filmed in 1968 on a budget of only $114,000 it has made over $30 million. It was also selected in 1999 to the National Film Registry. Not bad for such a low-budget movie. And because it was so low-budget, the director (George A. Romero) had to be extremely creative. So he filmed in black and white, enlisted ordinary people dressed in clothes from Goodwill and even used chocolate syrup to simulate blood. And it worked! He also used unknown actors like Duane Jones (\"Ben\") and Judith O'Dea (\"Barbra\") to play the lead roles. And they turned in the performances of their careers. Again, there are plenty of good zombie movies which have been made since this one. There are also plenty of very bad zombies movies made since this one too. But if you're looking for one that is extraordinary then you need look no further than this particular film. On that note, because of an error when they initially registered it, you can probably view it for free over the internet as it is in the public domain. Like I said, it's the best zombie movie--and probably one of the best horror films--you will ever see. So if you haven't seen it then it's worth your time to check it out.

            "content": "1968's \"Night of the Living Dead\" quickly pulls us in with siblings playfully arguing after spending three hours driving to a lonely cemetery to place a wreath on their father's grave, brother Johnny (Russell Streiner) ever the cynic, recalling how scared sister Barbra (Judith O'Dea) was long ago at this eerie place, and still is: \"they're coming to get you, Barbra!\" No sooner has he said it than a lone stranger (Bill Hinzman) accosts the stunned Barbra, her brother quickly coming to her rescue but killed when his head strikes a tombstone, the terrified girl unable to drive away without the car keys (still in Johnny's pocket), running endlessly until finding an abandoned farmhouse with a locked gas pump nearby, a partially devoured corpse on the second floor. It's not long before she's joined by Ben (Duane Jones), a studious intellectual who lucked into an unoccupied truck after a run in with these 'creatures' at a roadside diner, boarding up all doors and windows until he can figure out a plan of action. A 1939 radio (and later a 1952 television complete with rabbit ears) conveys the seriousness of their emergency, that mass murders are taking place and the killers are reported to indulge in consuming the flesh of the people they kill. At the midway mark the two discover occupants hiding in the cellar, Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman), their injured daughter Karen (Kyra Schon), and young couple Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley), all gathering together upstairs to learn more about the escalating horror. Director George Romero himself handles the mike as a Washington reporter asking questions about the Venus probe that might be responsible for the sudden resurgence of the recent dead (some form of radiation), coming back to life mere minutes after dying so that funeral arrangements must necessarily be discarded and the body burned, otherwise another so called 'ghoul' will rise to feed upon the living. Ben thinks it's advantageous to remain upstairs while Harry argues that the cellar is the safest place, neither side willing to yield until the need to find shelter at a rescue station requires the use of Ben's truck if they can distract the ghouls long enough to fill the tank. Disaster strikes as the gasoline is ignited by a burning torch, Tom and Judy roasted alive to provide sustenance for the eager horde, Ben shooting the cowardly Harry in response to his reluctance to unlock the door, dying in the cellar as his now undead daughter is prepared to rise again. The barricades fall, a stunned Barbra becomes the unlikely victim of her own brother Johnny, Helen's attempted escape but a short one as she finds daughter Karen feasting on her own dead father before grabbing a trowel to stab her mother repeatedly in gruesome fashion. Now the only remaining survivor, Ben retreats to the basement to await the coming dawn while Sheriff McClellan (George Kosana) and his brigade march toward the farmhouse. Here at the 79 minute mark we find a newscast conducted by WIIC-TV reporter Bill \"Chilly Billy\" Cardille (beloved host of Chiller Theater), inquiring how a ghoul can be killed: \"beat 'em or burn 'em, they go up pretty easy!\" (Chilly Billy puts in a shorter appearance ten minutes later, roughly 120 seconds on screen). Ben hears gunshots and decides to see what's happening, the resulting climax an uncompromising yet inevitable finale to a lean, mean movie that expertly pulls no punches, a rarity in its relentless approach with no trace of comic relief. Renowned critic Roger Ebert was quick to point out the reaction of children dropped off to see what parents assumed would be a fun time with a typically cheap horror film, its bleak, documentary style all too real for young minds more easily terrified. Cowriter John A. Russo denied any inspiration from Vincent Price's \"The Last Man on Earth,\" but Romero did admit being influenced by its Richard Matheson source material, the 1954 novel \"I Am Legend,\" the title changing from \"Monster Flick\" to \"Night of Anubis\" to \"Night of the Flesh Eaters,\" filming off and on in two week spurts from June to November 1967 on location in Evans City PA. Not once are the creatures referred to as zombies, the filmmakers barnstorming ideas on what would be the most horrific thing a human being can do to another, cannibalism the ultimate choice, spawning five direct sequels by Romero and countless imitations over the decades, not truly flowering until after the release of \"Dawn of the Dead,\" inspiring a rash of Italian ripoffs of often dubious quality. The original sporadically made the rounds in syndication beginning in 1971, and on a personal note your author first viewed it for Halloween 1978 on Pittsburgh indie station WPGH-TV, channel 53, all alone in a darkened household, no better way to endure its indelible chills.",

The cast of a black man in the lead role (at a time when that was almost unheard of) was another cool piece of history. The music wasn't bad, and the effects were decent for a low budget. On the bad size; this is still a low-budget, early film, and it shows. The acting, dialogue, pacing, and plot are all jarring and off-beat, though the tragic ending was a good choice. There are points where you can tell the actor is stumbling through dialogue, or where a shot was obviously done because they didn't have the budget for a real shot. More modern films/TV (the Walking Dead, Army of Darkness, Shaun of the Dead) are better films because they have the budget to be better.

Not, frightened out of my cinema seat scared, as when I saw it on theatrical release but still, in your face, jumpy and relentlessly worrying. Considering how influential the movie has been over the years it shouldn't be a surprise to be reminded how good it is but it certainly is remarkable how well this seemingly modest b/w film from the late sixties holds up and still packs a punch with no wasted moments from the brilliant humour infused opening to the dramatic and nuanced ending.

After being attacked in a cemetery while visiting her father's grave, the \"main girl\" Barbara makes her way to a seemingly abandoned farmhouse. It is their that she meets up with six others and they battle to survive a world-wide zombie attack. There isn't much else to say about the plot. It is a 'survive the night' type of zombie film. I always wondered what I would do in the situation that they all were in. Would I do what Ben said and stay in the boarded up house, or what Mr. Cooper suggested by going down into the cellar and wait for help? Both options are set up for doom unfortunately. And that's what the entire \"Dead\" series meant for me. There was no hope or chance of survival. No matter how much the characters fought to stay alive, there was no chance of it.Night of the Living Dead is to this day one of the best horror movies ever made and is the first of it's kind to be made.

            "content": "Romero's classic practically invented, never-mind defined, the zombie genre. It's single-handedly responsible for the majority of tropes associated with it - including but not limited to 'killing the head', zombie cannibalism and 'turning once bitten'. 'Night Of The Living Dead (1968)' also set the standard for the kind of stories told using these shambling creations. Not only did it establish a sense that the in-fighting between humans is far deadlier than the actual foes lurking outside, but it also paved the way for the 'horror as social commentary' angle that a lot of features now aim to replicate. Whether or not it was an initial intention, the film is actually about racism. The main tensions that plague our human characters are, it's implied, racial and the bleak ending makes it clear that even the end of the world can't wash away humanity's prejudice. This subtext is bold, especially when you consider the time and political landscape to which the piece was released. I mean, a black protagonist is, sadly, rare enough today. That's why the movie's statement still stands strong even if you watch it purely for its straight-up horror. That's entirely possible, too. It's clearly inspired by silent horror of the 1920s - especially an extended sequence in which a traumatised woman runs around a proverbial haunted house - and the Universal classics of the 1930s (apparently the iconic zombie saunter was inspired by Boris Karloff in 'The Walking Dead (1936)'). It pushes boundaries in terms of violence, though, with on-screen cannibalism, brain bashing and other gory injuries being pretty prevalent. The choice to shoot black-and-white makes things feel markedly more realistic, almost like one of the many news-casts used to deliver exposition throughout the experience. It also masks the fact that the blood is, in reality, chocolate sauce. The narrative itself is slightly slow, especially as it transitions from the first to the second act, and some of the character conflicts don't quite ring true - especially considering where they end up. Still, you care about all the core characters and things get suitably tense towards the end. It's important to remember, too, that the picture is paving the way for an entire generation of filmmakers. As such, the plot developments that seem so familiar - and, even, old-hat - to modern audiences are actually brand new, seen here for (essentially) the very first time. Audiences in 1968 mightn't have even known the villains were dead; the title could've been hyperbolic, after all. Overall, the piece is entertaining, downbeat and socially-conscious. Sometimes, where it all started seems all too familiar. Still, the film holds up to this day. It's an easy recommendation to fans of the genre. 7/10",

The inadvertent result of that is a powerful layer to the subtext which shows men not getting along and fighting one another even when they're hunkered down under zombie attack.The reason I didn't rate the overall film higher is the hour to an hour and fifteen minutes in the middle (yes, 70-80% of the film). It's painfully slow, and I thought Romero focused too much first on the nailing up of the place, and then on the argument about whether to go down into the cellar or not. The worst segment was the back and forth between the young couple before they go out to get gas - it's laugh out loud bad, between the wooden dialogue, poor acting, and tight shots on her insipid face. All I wanted there was either a meaningful scene, or a return to the zombies, who had been absent for far too long.I find myself trapped in the reviewer's dilemma of wanting to credit a movie for the period in which it was made and it's ground-breaking influence, but at the same time, being true to my experience in 2019. I wouldn't want to pop it in again or recommend it without reservations, both of which top out my score in the higher end of the average range.",

            "review_title": "Seminal 60's shocker",
            "content": "This little 60's movie is one of the most important in the horror genre. Not only was it the first of George Romero's zombie films but also one of the first films to take a traditionally supernatural horror idea, give it scientific plausibility and deliver it with both a gritty realism and shocking violence. This was a horror film that was part of the new breed of movies that had started to be made in the late 60's. Its shocking ending recalled the nihilistic final scenes of the likes of Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and Easy Rider (1969). Its violence echoed the horrors of the Vietnam War that was raging at the time. It went against type by casting a black man in the lead role. Night of the Living Dead was truly a bona fide counter-culture horror movie.Shot on an incredibly low budget, the grainy black and white image gives the film a somewhat unique feel. How many other films that have depicted gory violence have not been in colour? Admittedly this was a budgetary decision but it does give NOTLD an almost documentary feel at times, which gives it quite an unusual impact. Perhaps the one low-budget limitation that does let the film down is the library music used. This unremarkable soundtrack really feels like it belongs in another movie and doesn't do too much to add to the claustrophobic terror on the screen. But, in every other respect, this is low-budget film-making at it's best. Not only is it a thrill-ride but it is intelligent. Every character is flawed in some way, i.e. can we honestly say that the hero Ben ultimately made the right choice in defending the house?Night of the Living dead is not the best in Romero's zombie series but it is a hugely influential work. It not only laid down a template for all zombie movies that followed but also, along with Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), was one of the American horror films from the 60's that presented it's terrors in a contemporary world and, as a result, helped usher terror films into the modern age.",

But hang on in there, it picks up! Interesting to note that this probably is the first American movie where an afroamerican is the 'hero' and takes the position of leader of the pack. He is also the driving force of the movie. Not too sympathetic, but always up and about even if a bit unstructured, he fights stubbornness and prejudice.The music gets too dramatic and typical for its time sometimes, but also it has some fine eerie moments. Also eerie is the opening sequence. There are elements of comedy apart from the at best funny dialogue, pay attention to the living dead! Recommended if you like the comedy of camp and an untypical story. It gets just about as gory as I can handle as well.",

            "content": "\"Night of the Living Dead\" looks like a nightmare, feels like a nightmare, as a matter of fact, it IS a nightmare; a harrowing experience we impatiently wait for its conclusion, something that disturbingly raises itself above all the preconceived notion of cinema's horror and give the genre a whole new resonance in 1968. And George Romero, a then gifted 29-year old director, pulls the strings of our emotions with a remarkable craftsmanship, guiding us from disbelief to shock until one of the most haunting endings from any film, all genres considered.I liked \"Braindead\" and \"28 Days Later\", but as much as I 'enjoy' zombies' film, I didn't expect much when I watched \"Night of the Living Dead\". I respected it for it's the one that started it all but I couldn't apprehend that the film would scare me more than \"Jaws\" or \"The Exorcist\". But the more I think of it, the more I realize that this is precisely the mindset Romero expected us to have, to better catch us off guard. And in a way, the low budget quality of the film and its B-movie feel, plays a significant role by adding a level of realism in the nightmare, making it much scarier. The black and white, the relative anonymousness of the actors, the shakiness of the camera emphasize the realism of the movie as it looks like the cameramen are also trapped in that nightmare, a more sophisticated direction would have deprived the film from that crucial touch.The film borrows though some tricks from previous masterpieces of horror. Take the ghouls, the way they walk, the sounds they make, their hideous faces are already disturbing but what provokes the sheer sensation of terror is the mass effect. Imagine one ugly cockroach invading your room, you know you can handle it, but if it's an invasion, the only reasonable reaction is to escape. The film, like Hitchcock's \"Birds\" is driven by the same sense of urgency introduced by the first zombie coming at Barbra, the seemingly heroine of the film, and completed by the discovery of the corpse with a fleshless face in the farmhouse, one of these powerful moments that make you take the film a little more seriously. And like in \"Birds\", the horror is emphasized by the fact that we don't know why and how these things happen, all we have is the clues given by the national broadcast program on radio and TV, punctuating the films between so many thrilling sequences.Trapped in this claustrophobic setting, we're left with people trying to figure out what to do and where to hide? Not only the decisions must be taken quickly but the debates going over the things to do create an even more heart-pounding subplot. There are obviously two polar forces, the hero Ben and the cowardly Mr. Cooper, and while the acting is sometimes perceived as a minor force in horror film, here, the two characters approach their roles with a remarkable level of authenticity. At one point, Cooper asks with disbelief if he was supposed to get off the cave and help a woman because he heard screams, Duane Jones' reaction is perfect, he quietly replies: \"yes, exactly\", the film is one of there trapped-into-critical- situations that makes you forget it's about monsters but human beings trying to act for their survival. While we can't help but root for Ben, at many points, we feel like we wouldn't have been as heroic as him.And during that hellish journey, Romero's mastered directing enlighten us about the zombies in the most unsettling ways: when the teenage couple dies in an unexpected explosion, the horror of their death is not enough, we endure a gruesome aftermath where the ghouls take their bodies and start eating their flesh in an orgy of blood and human remains. The part is disgusting because we knew the victims, and taking their death for granted wasn't enough, Romero intelligently avoids the horror's tricks that tend to undermine deaths' shocking value to relief the audience and make the protagonists, witness from these deaths, their potential demise. And while panic reaches the consciences, the death's imminence highlights people's inner personalities, and the antagonism between Cooper and Ben evolves until the house gets too small for the both of them. The directing even allows some subtle moments where Ben sees Cooper hiding behind a door when he was supposed to let him enter the house, then, we understand that rooting for a character is almost pointless, as confirmed by the catatonic state of Barbra, the female lead.In the process, all the protagonists are getting killed and become ghouls themselves, contaminated by the presence of Cooper's daughter who was bitten by zombies and eventually become one, and it only takes the providential help of TV for Ben to understand how to kill the ghouls, by shooting in their heads. The morning after, an armed posse executing zombies one by one and while it could have ended as a classic B-movie, Romero's film ends as a disturbing masterpiece when Ben who survived all the nightmarish mayhem is taken for a zombie and takes a bullet between his eyes. The film ends while the credits show him disposed with the other ghouls in a bonfire ready to be set. I really didn't see that coming, and I was left speechless staring at the TV screen many minutes after the film finished. How could they have killed the hero? With the assassination of Martin Luther King, I guess it's almost impossible to overlook a social commentary aspect, but whether it was intentional or not, the ending is the strike of genius that cements the film's greatness. In a year full of heart-pounding thrillers like \"Rosemary's Baby\" or \"Bullitt\", \"Night of the Living Dead\" is a groundbreaking tour de force that would change the face of horror forever.",

Fear is so subjective that I am fully aware that what frightens me might not automatically frighten you. But in the case of Night of the Living Dead, I have trouble understanding how anyone isn't affected the same way I am. It's that powerful to me.I'm not the biggest Romero fan in the world, but I am of Night of the Living Dead. What he was able to accomplish with an obviously limited budget is nothing short of amazing. Romero created more atmosphere in the opening ten minutes of Night of the Living Dead than most directors with unlimited budgets ever could. Some of the acting may not be the best you'll run across, but for me that only adds to the film's authentic feel. They seem like real people trapped in that house. The special effects may not be as realistic as those in other zombie movies, but I've never seen what someone eating a kidney really looks like. It works very well with me. Finally, the ending is as bleak and powerful as any horror movie I've seen. Most directors would have been tempted (or forced) to give it a happy ending. Thankfully, Romero isn't most directors.In short, Night of the Living Dead is the stuff of real nightmares.",

Actually this cannot be called a Zombie film as this Zombie thing was introduced later but this deserves to be named as the Guardian/Ancestor of those films. Moreover this is human horror story and too damn realistic and horrifying to handle unless you enjoy fake make up monsters instead of humanly possible ghouls shown in this film. Night Of The Living Dead is about a group of people who have locked themselves in a house to hide from flesh eating ghouls roaming outside who are causing a mass murder. It is engaging from the beginning because it doesn't give any time to charcters to introduce themselves which was never useful in such a script so in result we see the first monster in the very first 5 mins. There is no stopping after that and we keep seeing lots of them and then we are introduced to other people hiding in that house. Screenplay takes charge from the beginning and doesn't lose it for entire 96 minutes of this narrative. Background score seems outdated now but must have been trendsetter then, I am not quite sure. Cinematography is excellent, i could feel the cameraman's feelings while looking at those close angles, zoomed shots and those 2 mins with end credits are shot outstandingly. All the actors in the film came from unknown and stage background hence they put non dramatic and sober acts. George Romero had a terrific script and design in hands but in spite of having heavy burden of making a groundbreaking horror film, he didn't stotter. He delivered a fine piece of new-style horror filmmaking. Night Of The Living Dead is known as Cult with which i don't agree completely but i agree with the fact that it is certainly a Great Movie and an inspiration to the filmmakers in this genre.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "If ever the term \"classic\" seemed more appropriate then Night of the Living Dead is the perfect example of what classic really means. A film laced with fear, dread, social commentary and layered with atmosphere so thick it could smother the air.Night of the Living Dead follows Barbara as on a trip to her father's grave she and her brother are attacked by a listless person who seems to move awkwardly and destroys everything in its path. Eventually she holes up in a farmhouse with other survivors including Ben as they work together to survive the terrifying events surrounding them. Whether you like this film or not does not diminish the fact that this rightly deserves its place in history as one of the finest zombie (or ghoul depending on your preference) films there is.The pace is admirably quick: from the beginning with Barbra and Johnny at the graveyard, the ghoul/ zombie it sets a consistent pace that grips the audience and keeps you hooked. The acting is decent, though Judith O'Dea does, to a degree, let it down slightly with a character that's just too emotionally wrought to oftentimes care about. But where she lacks Duane Jones compensates entirely with a performance of outstanding brilliance. The quiet intelligence of his character; how he thinks through many of scenarios placed before them - Jones is a joy to watch time and again. The ghouls/ zombies look fantastic and act it too; the shambolic way in which they move, the slow pace that persists, they feel and come across as genuinely terrifying.And it must be said that the small trace of a score is beautiful. When it's not present we hear the smooth notes of birds whistling on high, the natural sounds proving as unnerving as the gentle strum of notes in the background that precipitate the altogether disturbing sequences especially that cellar scene!Maybe it's talked about too often but I can't mention NOTLD without discussing that end! Even to this day it leaves an hollow emptiness in the stomach at what happens to Ben and the impact it courts upon the viewer never quite fades - yet despite my desire for a semi happy ending I have to concede it needed this dark, bleak ending to leave that impression. If you love horror and haven't yet seen this, do so, it's one that I feel is mandatory viewing. So turn off the phone/ computer/ laptop, put down the shades and embrace Romero's outstanding low budget film.",

I'm glad we have a rule book for how to survive a Zombie Apocalypse and how to defend against them now, because it seems back then that they were brighter than some living humans?Some of the acting was pretty bad, in fact it was only really the character of Ben that seemed to have any ability at all. I did kind of hope that they would all get eaten actually, except Tom because he was cute.\nI also loved the ironic ending, holding out for so long against the undead only to be shot by your rescuers.Not a bad story for undead fans, but essentially not my thing. I had to give up watching The Walking Dead, because it was too real, so I just hope I don't have nightmares tonight. It would have a higher score if I liked the genre, I only watched it to expand my horizons.",

The house lights dim, and the curtains part. Ominous music begins as we open on a black and white shot of a deserted back road. A car appears in the distance, moving along the winding road toward us; passes; turns up a hill and cruises slowly through a cemetery. The car comes to a stop and a bickering brother and sister, who have come to put a wreath on their father's grave, get out. The brother pauses before getting out when he hears the car radio come back on. Ominous music. They go to the grave and place the wreath on it. The brother teases the sister, trying to scare her- and then notices a man, dressed in a black suit, moving toward them. The brother runs off, leaving the sister to fend for herself when the man in the suit suddenly attacks her. At this point, the carefully measured camerawork of the preceding shots gives way to canted low-angle chaos. And so begins director George Romero's creepy classic, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.Eschewing the staid cliches of the past, Romero and company give us zombies with \"bite\"; ghouls fresh from the grave who crave human flesh. Unlike many of its predecessors, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD delivers- in a big way. Crossing lines few fright films of worth have ever dared cross, Romero gives us numbing horror as well as well-drawn characters in tense life-or-death situations. Although \"inspired\" by Richard Matheson's brilliant vampire novel I AM LEGEND (as well as the first feature film based on the book, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, with mis-cast Vincent Price in the lead), NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD quickly branches off into its own dark terrain, which Romero explores unflinchingly with his stark, documentary style of filmmaking. It was a powerful film when it was first released, and it's a powerful film today. Romero redefined the zombie in fright films, and thereby helped redefine contemporary film (along with Alfred Hitchcock). Not bad for a regional \"fringe\" filmmaker.",

This movie is worth the hype. There isn't anything wrong with \"Night Of The Living Dead\". This is Romero's masterpiece for many factors. The whole zombie situation idea is revolutionary. Romero took the basics from the zombie movies from the 30's and 40's and takes the sub-genre into a macabre new dimension. Also, the direction is simply excellent. Romero knew how to shock a still naive audience in the late 60's. He created a creepy movie based on it's dark, scary atmosphere. I'd say that this is the best example (along with The Texas Chainsaw Massacr) of an unsettling movie. Forget about \"Dawn Of The Dead\", \"Day Of The Dead\", \"28 Days Later\", etc. This is the king of the Zombie sub-genre. The sequels were highly influenced by the splatter and gore wave that the Horror experience in the 70's and 80's but it wasn't space enough for scariness or atmosphere. The sequels are all about fashion film making and new techniques of gore and visuals. \"Night Of The Living Dead\" is scary enough in all aspects. Visuals, music, plot... Duane Jones is also somewhat a hero in the genre. He delivers one of the most complete performances in Horror cinema history. His performance is solid and believable even that the situations are extremely fictitious. He's surely on the top 5 performances ever in the genre. I cannot praise this movie enough as it's truly a breakthrough movie in the history of cinema. Even that I'm not a fan of the sub-genre, I give the respect that this movie deserves. The ending is truly great, it's chilling, well directed, and leaves a lot for the imagination. No time for happy situations this time. I wonder if this movie shocked audiences big time as \"The Exorcist\".",

It is a classic example of low budget film-making at his finest how great Romero was and is at making films.The film is set in rural Pennsylvania, and in a small house a small group of people are having to survive against the newly raised living dead. In the house is a family, with a sick child, a black man who becomes the leader, a mentally damaged woman and a young couple. As events unfold they find out through the media that the dead had risen and that only way to stop them was to shot them in the brain or cut off their head.It's a basic story but it is layered. The film has a lot of scares in it and the apocalypse story is very exciting. There is a political sub-context to the film, especially in the politics of race, because this was one of the first films to have a black man as the major hero of the film. Other intreputions of the film is the Vietnam war and the Cold War. Romero is a very political director and this was carried on into his other Living Dead films.The story behind the film is also interesting. It costed $10,000, which even in 1968 was a pitent. Romero had to use up very favour available to him to get this film made.The special effects are simply, but easily covered by the black and white film and the acting isn't great, but the people in this film were amateurs, you didn't expert Oscar winning acting. There is also a bitter ending to this film, which I thought was very fitting for this type of film.If you like horror films or zombie films then this is a must see.",

            "content": "Sure, there were Zombie movies before 'Night of the Living Dead': a few years earlier there had been the Zombie/Vampire apocalypse movie 'The Last Man on Earth' (based on Richard Matheson's short story 'I am Legend' which also served as an influence for Romero), in the fifties there was Cold-War paranoia classic 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', back in the thirties there was the Bela Lugosi classic 'White Zombie'\u0085even going back, arguably, to 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'. All of these movies carry certain elements present in 'Night\u0085' but the all-out assault and apocalyptic cannibal carnage of Romero's debut feature film meant that Zombie movies were NEVER the same afterwards.In the middle of Pennsylvania, Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny, a brother and sister visit a graveyard to visit their father's grave but unbeknownst to them the dead have begun to reawaken and, stripped of the accoutrements of civilised, conscious thought, are reduced to ravenous cannibals. Barbara escapes to a house and meets Ben (Duane Jones) and together with an assorted bunch of others try to withstand both being laid siege by zombies as well as the corrosive internal power dynamics and individual survival instincts rife within the group.One of the things which contributes to the lasting power of 'Night\u0085' is the creation of a believable atmosphere where we can feel the reeling minds of the characters swept up into an unprecedented situation, deprived of crucial information (the cause for the dead's unholy resurrection is speculated at within the film but never categorically confirmed) and thus fumbling in the dark as to the best solution. Another key factor is that, in a similar way to 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', the monsters here are not figures of folklore like the Wolfman, or Dracula\u0085or even the similarly revenant Mummy, but instead are our friends, neighbours, and family members. Indeed, it is this nightmarish vision of a society's anger turned inward which has led some to see it as a critique of the family and the Vietnam war, in addition to the searing attack on racism we see in the shocking final sequence.Certainly these sociological dimensions add a fascinating layer of analysis to the film (something Romero would continue in the next instalment of the '\u0085Dead' series 'Dawn of the Dead') but this should not detract from the visceral quality of the film which (despite the parodies and scores of lesser Zombie movies that followed) remains as bold and fresh today as it was when it was released on the unsuspecting public back in the day.**************************Public domain movie.

Not so, as many found out and like any classic horror film, \"Night of the Living Dead\" has rightfully earned a place in cinema history as a landmark.Released in 1968, post-Kennedy's shattered vision of Camelot, an ambitious filmmaker named George A. Romero grabbed up a camera and started rolling, capturing the actions and horror of a group of people who hold up inside a farmhouse as hordes of the living dead storm the countryside and proceed to lay siege to the terrified occupants inside.There are no heroes in \"Night of the Living Dead,\" only people who make quick decisions and end up either dead or alive to reap the consequences of those decisions. Most characters are either strong and determined (like Duane Jones' character) or are blatantly stupid and reckless (Karl Hardman's character).\"Night of the Living Dead\" did of course, virtually define a new genre - the zombie flick. Romero would follow up \"Night\" with two sequels: the adrenalin-laced action epic \"Dawn of the Dead\" in 1978 and the claustrophobic, tension-filled closer \"Day of the Dead\" in 1985. And there were also plenty of knock-offs over the years too.What helped to make \"Night\" so popular was that it was filmed in no particular style, thus giving it a unique and genuine feel; it was almost as if what you were seeing on screen was actually happening. Looking at \"Night\" during the day is surely your best bet, since I certainly wouldn't recommend doing so.Even in 2004, \"Night of the Living Dead\" still shocks its viewers, with the gore, tension, and genuine frights. Tom Savini (George's right-hand special effects man on \"Dawn\" and \"Day\") would later remake \"Night of the Living Dead\" in 1990.10/10",

            "content": "George A. Romero's 'Night Of The Living Dead' (1968) is undeniably a classic. To say that this film was made on a tight budget would be an understatement, it was literally made on a shoe string. Many people would argue that a low budget doesn't always mean a great film, and they would be right. I have seen countless examples of low budget films that were absolutely awful, 'Lesbian Vampire Killers' of last year is a great example. However, what a tight budget does is force the film maker to use all of their initiative and resourcefulness to try and make the film a success; if the film maker is good then the movie can be great without relying on a budget. Fortunately in George A. Romero we have the absolute master of the horror genre and a brilliant director, therefore the resulting film is one of the greatest horrors of all time and is still terrifying to this day.There are many important aspects to this film, none more important than the use of Duane Jones, an African American man in the role of the hero or leading man. It was made towards the end of the Civil Rights Movement and was one of the first horror films to have a black leading man. This is excellent as it challenged the audience of the time to not only except this man as their equal but as their hero.Another fantastic thing about 'Night of the Living Dead' is found in its simplicity. This is grass roots horror that pretty much rewrote the rulebook. Horror today in the main relies on special effects and before that relied on make up; an amazing example is Rick Baker's Oscar winning work on 'An American Werewolf in London'; however when watching 'Night of the Living Dead' you will notice that the 'zombies' do not generally have heavy make up on, and yet they still manage to remain scary. This is all to do with Romero's impeccable direction. Simple shots of hands grabbing people through boarded up windows have you screaming at the screen and guessing who is going to be ripped apart next.Overall, it is rare to say a film is a perfect example of how good a genre can be but Romero's classic certainly does show how good a horror film can be. Many would still consider it to be the greatest horror of all time, I am not of this opinion, but it will still always remain on a pedestal in my mind due to its influence upon character archetypes, horror settings and future low budget productions.",

And it was a very different horror film, one that gave me \"Zombie Nightmares\" for years. What made it different is that the heroes didn't prevail at the end. The character of Duane survives to the end of the film, but is accidentally killed by the redneck posse. So the ending was kind of ironic and scary.Hey, let's talk about Duane, shall we? He's the hero of this film, and it was quite a stretch in 1968, the year Dr. King was killed, and NBC was mortified by the notion of William Shatner kissing Nichelle Nichols. Yet here he is, not only being heroic, but talking down, beating and eventually killing the fat, white character.Obviously, this film was made on the cheap, but it was made effectively.

This film opens with Barbara and her brother Harry, who drive six hours out into the countryside to visit their mother's grave and an isolated cemetery. While paying their respects, Harry reminds Barbara of a childhood memory, and while trying to scare her, they are approached by a man who is walking very strangely along. The man grabs Barbara, and Harry begins to fight with him, until his head is thrown against a tombstone. Barbara tries to escape in the car, crashes, and begins running through the woods. She finds an old farmhouse in a field and hides out there, and notices an entire clan of these walking-dead. After time other people arrive at the farmhouse, also hiding from the living dead. While hiding in the house, listening to a radio for updates on the mysterious phenomena, the zombies begin to break in - and they have to fight back. It's up to them to save themselves from these flesh eating zombies .The most influential and probably the most bootlegged movie of all time (due to the movie never receiving an official copyright), \"Night Of The Living Dead\" is a classic on every level, and that's saying a lot because I don't really care for zombie movies to begin with. I'll openly admit that too, I'm not really a fan of zombie films - I think they're alright, but they're just not really my thing. But \"Night Of The Living Dead\" is the exception. The film is black and white, and I really enjoy old films like this so I thought it was really neat because it gives it a vintage feel. The acting - eh, it's okay. Not bad, not great - just average really. But it doesn't really matter. The story is the strongest and most unique element of the movie, and the special effects used were phenomenal for the time, especially considering this movie's beyond-low budget. The zombies looked great and the gore effects looked fine, but you have to consider that this film was made in 1968. There are some great scenes in the movie, and the opening scene where Barbara is chased through the desolate forest by the mysterious man was terrifying.All in all, \"Night Of The Living Dead\" is a horror classic. I don't typically like zombie movies, but I loved this. It's packed with a great story, some good gory scenes and chases, and some fairly realistic-looking (and scary) zombies! What more could you ask for? Definitely watch this one, it's one of the great horror classics of all time. I think most of us can confidently say that this is the king of all zombie films. I'd also recommend the eerie 1962 low-budget horror, \"Carnival of Souls\", if you enjoyed this film, because it's just as good, if not a tad bit better. 10/10.",

            "content": "Ok so this is this great legendary horror classic that a lot of people consider one of the best ever, and I like it too but I think it's reputation is a little greater than the actual movie, it's a little slow and gets a bit too dull and draggy in the middle for me to personally regard it as great, and it may very well be responsible for the modern zombie movie as we know it and created a lot of the rules behind our beloved shambling flesh eaters, but I just think there are numerous better classic zombie flicks out there, not least of all the sequel to this one, which is my very favourite! What I enjoy the most about this film is the grim atmospherics that come from the low budget rural settings, as well as its keen focus on the characters as their situation hopelessly falls apart and they fail to work together enough to survive the night. I love how effectively the tension slowly grows throughout and how it goes from being unnerving to downright terrifying in the final act. Gore-wise it's pretty tame now, but back then I'm sure the whole experience was quite a bitter pill for the audiences to take, with the utterly hopeless and oppressive world that it presented, where there was no happy ending, no answers given, and where the unsung hero of the story gets unceremoniously shot down and burned away like nothing... it's a very political movie, and the late great George Romero had said that he kind of stumbled into making it that way, but that's a little hard to believe when the mere fact that the main character and leading man being played by an African American in 1968, was political enough, but then you see him punching out a hysterical white woman and taking charge of a chaotic situation after usurping the white male patriarch as it were, is overtly so if you take the decade into consideration, as well as quite a powerful and heartbreaking statement in the closing images of how the poor man ends up, even today... It took courage to end the movie that way, and Romero was right to stand by it and not compromise his grim vision. Duane Jones really carried a lot, if not all of the movie with his performance, which must have been a bit of a burden on him to make a strong impression, but he certainly did it all with grace. Of the various titles they were considering at the time I'm glad they chose the one they did because it's one of the best horror movie titles of all time, it's iconic. There was a kind of dark allure there that made a million teens and their sweeties want to hit it up at the drive in back in the day! Once again there are other zombie pictures I love more, but this solid old milestone that pushed the envelope and made zombies a household name is of course deserving of a little consideration as it deserves its place in horror movie history and remains an engaging and haunting work by a brilliant young director that is always worth revisiting. \"The prelude of the night is commenced in the music of the sunset, in its solemn hymn of the ineffable dark.\"",

The biggest thing here is deciding how to properly weight a movie by cultural significance. It's widely agreed upon that this is ostensibly the progenitor of the zombie movie and that is an incredible, historic and remarkable feat that makes it worth watching, if only for it's cultural significance. The flip side is that this movie came out in '68 so it's not exactly the most cutting edge, the acting isn't particularly nuanced for a lot of people, Barbara is a very annoying damsel character and we don't even get the full zombie visual feast here. That said, it is legitimately tense at times, it's creepy and effectively done and basically the humans are the only weak link here.Absolutely worth watching just for the sake of watching it and it's still a legitimately good movie. If you're able, at least stream it somewhere but I'd say it's worth a rent for the casual film fans and a buy for full on aficionados and addicts.",

If scenes of the dead don't turn one's stomach, it'll be other elements of the production.

I did not find anything smacking of social critics ,of social protest or leftist propaganda. Its huge success and reputation were fully merited. It has a remarkable touch of originality and freedom. It's one of the very few horrors seen in a while by me that is actually scary. It's not leftist propaganda, but a straightforward horror drama with a Sci\u0097Fi premise. The documentary look is very felicitous. This is a GOOD film, beyond the genre's complicity.In LIVING DEAD at least, Romero was a director who really had something to say\u0097in terms of movies, I mean, not as leftist manifestos. Here's a B movie of the highest rank, with merits at the face\u0097value. Very good, very impressing, powerfully conceived, scary and uncanny. This impressionistic take it adopts enhances greatly the force of the events described. Romero was a director of conception\u0097of cinematographic conception.Romero's feature is one of those movies that are in fact much better than you were ever told (others,to name a few, are\u0097ROPE,THE MAN FROM LARAMIE,Mat\u00e9's thrillers,etc.). I repeat, if necessary, that it's not a leftist parable, but a horror that succeeds in being a good movie. It does not need the academic rubbish about being a concealed parable, a '60s protest, etc.. Those who say such things need to get a life and start enjoying films for what they are, not for hidden agendas.",

It's very dated, however, and probably wouldn't scare an 8 year old today. \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" is scarier than this, so don't expect any nightmares. And gore hounds, this also isn't for you. It may have been controversial and shocking in the '60s, but this movie wouldn't warrant anything more than a PG-13 today, and even that's stretching it.

            "content": "During one late Sunday afternoon, a brother by the name of Johnny (Russell Streiner) and his sister-Barbara (Judith O'Dea) visit their mother's grave. When Barbara is attack by a strange man. Her brother tries to save her but ended up getting killed. Barbara ends up running for her life and take shelter in a old farmhouse. She finds herself with a sensitive but tough African American man (Daune Jones) and a few people (Karl Hardman, Marilyn Eastman, Keith Wayne, Judith Ridley and Kyra Schon) in the house. Then later, they finds themselves trapped in the farmhouse and these strange people are trying to get in the house. The people trapped in the house find out that these strange people are actually the dead coming back to life from a freak accident by a space probe, which is return sent by NASA. This space probe is highly radioactive that wage a relentless attack, killing (and eating) everyone in their path.The premise of this film does sound Hokey but it works, thanks to Co-Writer/Director:George A. Romero (The Crazies, Martin). This is Romero's first film. Romero borrows inspirations from the film-Carnival of Souls (1962) and Richard Matheson's novel-I Am Legend (Which it was previously filmed as The Last Man on Earth and The Omega Man). Romero wrote the script with John A. Russo (The Return of the Living Dead). This is a smart screenplay. The only real fault is the Cast, which it is a mix of professional and amateurish performances. But in someways, that what makes the film realistic. Romero and Russo never let their characters have the easy way out. Night of the Living Dead went on to be a Cult Favorite and went to be a Worldwide Hit.The Best DVD to view \"Night of the Living Dead\" is from Elite Entertainment. Which the DVD contains two audio commentary tracks by the Cast & Filmmakers. DVD is presented in the Original 16mm aspect ratio. DVD has been remastered in THX with Superior Picture and Sound Quality with the original Mono soundtrack with the first time in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also contains the original script, trailer, film parody titled \"Night of the Living Bread\" and more. Night of the Living Dead ended up remade in 1990 with the original creators:George A. Romero and Producers:Russell Streiner and John A. Russo. The remake is not as affected as the original. But the original 1968 film proves that the Original is always better than the remake. DVD from 20th Century Fox is been colorized and the film looks odd and even foolish in color. DVD has an fine Pan & Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an good digitally remastered:Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in DTS 5.1 Surround Sound). This DVD is also included in the original Black & White (Which the Elite DVD has an sharper transfer in the Black and White Print). Too Bad, the Black & White Print only has the Dolby 2.0 Mono Sound. Since the Colorized version has the Dolby/DTS Tracks! DVD's oddest feature is the running commentary by the Mystery Science Theater 3000 Fame:Mike Nelson!. Which Nelson comments has some amusing moments and hilarious jokes about the cast in the film. Despite the DVD from Fox, the Elite DVD is worth getting. Only die-hard of the original 1968 film will get the colorized version on DVD. The new DVD from Dimension Extreme has an new stronger Full Screen transfer although the sound reminds Mono for the 40th anniversary edition. It has some of the same special features from the Elite Disc like commentary tracks for example. But the best thing about the new DVD is the 83 minute documentary from the cast & crew talking about... how was like to make this instant real cult classic and an 15 minute featurette with Romero. There's plenty of DVD's of Romero's movie out-there, because it doesn't have no copyright. Romero and the producers would have been richer in their wildest dreams if they put that copyright. \"Night of the Living Dead\" is still talked about for over 40 years and it still remains of One of Romero's Best.

He should have become a big star. This was 1968, and Jones was the only black actor in the movie-yet there is not a single reference made to race. That was admirable. The film has a genuinely creepy feel to it. I wouldn't quite call this the best horror movie of all time, but it does contain the most horrorfying scene of any horror movie I've ever seen.

The actors, all solid, are unknowns, so, once again, the horror seems more real, less manufactured.Confining most of the action to an isolated farmhouse outside Pittsburgh adequately sells the wider menace and creates a sense of claustrophobia.

An all consuming sense of fear, hopelessness and despair prevail throughout the film and as strong as the shock value is and as convincing as the \"living dead\" were, the atmosphere created by the black and white filming was what stamped this as a classic.

            "content": "\"Night Of The Living Dead\" is not only a film that all Horror fans must see, it is a must-see to anyone even remotely interested in cinema. George A. Romero's 1968 masterpiece is, without any exaggeration, one of the most important and influential films ever made as it basically recreated the Horror genre and influenced everything to come - and all that with a low budget and actors most of whom had never been in a film before. Literally every Zombie flick ever made after 1968 took its influence from \"Night Of The Living Dead\", and it is debatable that the world of Horror cinema will ever see classics of a comparable influence again. This immensely creepy and genuinely scary stroke of genius is one of the most brilliant masterpieces the great genre of Horror has ever brought forth, and no Horror lover or cineaste in general could possibly afford to miss it.The film delivers everything one could possibly desire in Horror: constant tantalizing suspense, genuine scares and shock moments and an incomparably creepy atmosphere which is intensified by a stunning black and white cinematography. The plot is, as one could guess, about the dead coming back to life. Dead people rise from their graves and walk the earth as living dead, hungry for the flesh and blood of the living. The reasons for their awakening are only vaguely explained, with an undefined radiation. The film ingeniously explores a small group of people who are forced to form an alliance in a small remote farmhouse, desperately trying to prevent the masses of flesh-hungry fiends from getting in. Hardly another film could claim a mood as genuinely creepy and menacing as it is the case in \"Night Of The Living Dead\". The masses of brainless, flesh-eating zombies looking for the living to feed on are doubtlessly one of the creepiest sights a cineaste will ever stumble upon. Arguably THE classic shocker of its time, \"Night Of The Living Dead\" has long become one of THE all-time classics in cinema.Zombies had walked the world of cinema ever since Edward Halperlin's 1932 masterpiece \"White Zombie\", in which Horror icon Bela Lugosi enslaved the dead via Voodoo. It was George A. Romero, however, who established the idea of flesh-eating Zombies with \"Night Of The Living Dead\" - which makes this one of the most innovating films ever brought to screen. The film itself also had its influences - Italian director Ubaldo Ragona had created a masterpiece with an equally apocalyptic atmosphere four years earlier, in 1964, with \"The Last Man On Earth\" (starring Vincent Price!). Another film that influenced this one is Herk Harvey's \"Carnival Of Souls\" of 1962. All three films are masterpieces that no Horror fan could afford to miss, yet it is this one which single-handedly changed the entire Genre forever. The gore is extreme for its time, and it is save to say that people back then must have been shocked about the explicitness of graphic violence. The main shocks, however, are provided by the stunningly creepy atmosphere that will leave audiences breathless even after repeated viewing. I am sure I don't stand alone among my fellow Horror fans when I describe this film both as one of my personal favorites of all-time, and as one of the most innovating, creepiest and greatest masterpieces ever in Horror. I can not praise this film enough, so I will end this review with a recommendation - in case you have not seen this, stop what you're doing and go for it right now! \"Night Of The Living Dead\" is an essential masterpiece of Horror and no fan of cinema can afford to miss it! 10/10",

But as a child, this film had me transfixed, mesmerized, and it now lives somewhere deep in my subconscious mind.While the film might come off as dated to some viewers nowadays, there is no way anyone could not see how unparalleled this work is. Even through some corny dialogue that was most likely improvised, and a few similarly corny supporting actors, mostly everyone in the film is exceptional, and Romero's techniques are admirable in so many different ways. The tension is continuously rising throughout the entire film until the epic climax. I must say that this is probably my favorite of all of Romero's films, and while I enjoyed his 1978 version of 'Dawn Of The Dead' also, I feel that in recent times he has just gone downhill.Honestly, I feel that the black and white aspect just makes the film even better and just helps to further solidify this film as a true classic, and one of the most wholly original horror films ever made.

            "content": "Of all the lines uttered, spoken, and screamed over the course of \"Night of the Living Dead,\" this one (by way of Pittsburgh TV anchorman Bill \"Chilly Billy\" Cardille) may be the most chilling and ironic. In 1968, there was no way of knowing that a \"little\" film would open the floodgates for a new era in cinematic fear, oft-refined by the original ringmaster himself, George Romero. But it did, and for fans of the genre, it is a contribution we should all be thankful for.For those who know Romero and his contributions to horror (while ignoring misfired sidesteps like \"Bruiser\" and \"Monkey Shines\"), Chilly Billy's line is a contradiction of the anarchic chaos at work in his filmography. The director has often stated that his debut is about \"revolution\" (and it certainly came at the end of a decade known for at least declaring it), but as I age, I find myself wondering just whose revolution is taking place amid all the warring elements (unless, of course, Romero is commenting on a revolutionary mentality, in which many factions adhering to many different ideologies and persuasions knock heads and only worsen preexisting problems). It has become more apparent with each successive film that Romero hedges his bets with both human and zombie, while pledging a moderate loyalty to neither.The ambiguity and cynicism of \"Night\" still leaves a seriously unsettling mark. If anything, Romero set his film apart from the classical style of Universal, the period pieces of Hammer, and the Gothic offerings of Italy's Mario Bava by transgressing mere hints of moralistic commentary and twist-of-fate ironies and transposing them into an instantly recognizable, rural American setting (the countryside of scenic Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)\u0096populated by people not unlike our friends and neighbors\u0096therefore blurring the line between cinema as mere gaudy escapism and pushing it closer toward something resembling pure, visceral experience. The perfectly integrated use of stock music only adds to the unfolding documentary reality.The film begins in a deserted world, save for brother-and-sister duo Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny (Russell Streiner), who have traveled to an isolated graveyard to place a wreath on their father's grave. There is an altercation with a mysterious man, and a terrified Barbra flees to an isolated farmhouse. Soon after, night falls and a faceless horde of zombies descend upon the building, as a small group of survivors take an increasingly desperate stand against the walking undead. Romero (and co-writer John Russo) uses this seemingly simple scenario to catapult fireballs of scientific and sociopolitical subtext through the general survival plot. And the survivors are an interesting bunch, shrewdly undercutting the director's point that a half-dozen humans in an escalating situation will find ways to pick apart, antagonize, and even kill one another, equating themselves (if not more so) with the bloodthirsty carnivores outside the door.My first experience with \"Night\" came late in my childhood, with next to no foreknowledge of what I was in store for. Responding in a manner similar to how I'd later (at 12) react to Romero's \"Dawn of the Dead,\" I found myself shocked, impressed, and generally in awe of what I had just witnessed\u0096granted, I found the dialog scenes of the middle act to be stretched and tedious (and if the film retains a glaring flaw, that's it), but the film overall broke a lot of my perceptions of what was \"acceptable\" to show in a black-and-white film. Accustomed to the goreless, vulgarity-free \"propriety\" of movies-sans-color, I expected a relatively coy experience (which couldn't be farther from what I got), and nothing remotely resembling up-close gore, glimpses of nudity, or a half-dozen curse words. In addition to its commentary and well-crafted suspense, another reason \"Night\" holds up so well is because it truly is a turning point in the streamlining of carnage in mainstream cinema. As much as Romero enjoys pushing our moral and political buttons, his films endure for just giving us a blood-caked good time. With zombies.",

            "review_title": "Admittedly dated and corny at times, NOTLD is as hugely influential on modern horror and popular culture",
            "content": "The granddaddy of modern zombie films and arguably also the progenitor of the modern day horror film. NOTLD's story should be familiar to modern horror audiences, even if you've never seen this film before, as this film's influence on survival horror films cannot be emphasized enough. The recently dead mysteriously rise and come to life to mindlessly feed on the flesh of the living, who then in turn become the undead themselves to create more undead flesh eaters. The film follows a disparate group of survivors who have found shelter in an abandoned farmhouse where they barricade doors and windows, share information/stories about what they think is going on outside, bicker amounts themselves over what to do in the situation, and all of the usual tropes we typically see in horror siege films. Writer/producer/director George A. Romero gets credit with this film for creating the \"rules\" for zombies (i.e. zombies are slow and dumb, anyone who dies will rise to feast on the living, you must destroy the brain to kill a zombie, etc.), in much the same way Bram Stoker made established the rules for modern vampire depiction with Dracula in 1897 or how Curt Siodmak established the rules for werewolves with his script for \"The Wolf Man\" in 1941. Romero's zombie rules are taken for granted at this point, but it's a major achievement that may not be quite appreciated, to have essentially invented a movie monster that has continued to endure for over than 50 years. Romero's zombie rules have been followed by most zombie movies up until \"28 Days Later\" when filmmakers and authors started playing with the rules (much the same way that's been done with vampires and other creatures of the night), but Romero's rules have still been adhered to by everything from Max Brooks' \"Zombie Survival Guide\" to Robert Kirkman's \"The Walking Dead.\" Without \"Night of the Living Dead\" we would never have had the many end-of-the-world classics like Lucio Fulci's \"The Beyond,\" Sam Raimi's \"Evil Dead,\" Stuart Gordon's \"Re-Animator,\" Robert Kirkman's \"The Walking Dead,\" Charlie Brooker's pre-Black Mirror TV mini-series \"Dead Set\" or the above mentioned \"28 Days Later,\" not to mention a ton of great zombie fiction from authors like Stephen King, Joe R. Lansdale, and Brian Keene, or some great tongue-in-check zombie films like Grindhouse's \"Planet Terror\" or Simon Pegg's \"Shaun of the Dead,\" or some fun lesser but entertaining zombie films like \"REC,\" \"Dead Snow,\" \"Dead Alive,\" \"Zombieland,\" \"Le Horde,\" \"Shock Waves,\" \"Juan of the Dead,\" \"The Dead,\" \"Night of the Comet,\" \"Demons,\" \"Pontypool,\" \"Return of the Living Dead,\" or the super gory \"Zombie 2\" (Wondering about Zombi 1? Romero's sequel to NOTLD \"Dawn of the Dead\" was released in Italy as \"Zombi\" and this Italian production was marketed as a sequel). Romero also gets credit with \"Night of the Living Dead\" for establishing the horror film siege scenario that's endlessly been used to this very day (everything from \"Assault on Precinct 13\" to \"Aliens\" to \"From Dusk till Dawn\" to \"The Mist\" to \"30 Days of Night\" to \"The Purge\"). Sure there were siege films going back as far as \"The Lost Patrol\" or \"Rio Bravo,\" but Romero established the plot, story, and genre elements that remain strong to this dya. The cultural influence of this \"Night of the Living Dead\" cannot be emphasized enough. Looking at the film on it's own, Romero doesn't just tell a zombie siege film story, but also injects a smart political subtext into the film about race relations. Ben, a black man, and Mr. Cooper, a privileged white man, clash throughout the film as to if it's better solidly barricade themselves in the basement or to stay upstairs with the partially barricaded doors and windows to have a potential path for escape if needed. It's notable that Ben has the only gun in the film and Mr. Cooper desperately wants to literally wrench it from Ben's grasp to take control of the situation. For a film in the 1960s, it's quite provocative to cast a black man in in the heroic lead role, telling a group of white people what to do. Romero admitted that he didn't write the character of Ben as a black man, but that after casting the excellent Duane Jones, the story began to take on these elements of race and politics. SPOILER ALTER! At the end of the film, it's undeniable when Ben, the only surviving member of the group, is casually killed by a redneck posse and his corpse thrown on a bonfire, quickly followed by black & white newspaper photographs of the incident, that the audience would think of the recent assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom X. \"Night of the Living Dead\" also works as a Cold War parable for US involvement in Vietnam. The US has better technology and know how, but were overwhelmed by the sheer numbers and the relentlessness of those who they were fighting. So overall, although the acting is admittedly not the best (except for Jones) and the production values are pretty low, \"Night of the Living Dead\" is a classic that has greatly influenced innumerable books, movies, comics, TV show, and popular culture ever since and in ways than cannot be over stated.",

The casting of a black actor (Duane Jones) as the protagonist is to me, simply interesting casting. Let's face it. This is a horror movie. It's dead people coming back to life and wanting to eat you. In short, it's a whole lot of fun.Of course there is the irony that the black guy is the only one in the movie with any brains, as he endures a Jeff Foxworthy nightmare image of white hicks, whether it's the recently deceased type, the Living Dead, or the permanently confused Barbara, the cowardly Harry, and finally meeting his executioner, the fat dumb sheriff, who, when asked if the creatures are slow moving, utters this immortal dialogue: \"Yeah, they're dead. They're all messed up.\"I could go the artsy-fartsy route and think even Hitchcock would enjoy the novel introduction of the first ghoul at the cemetery. There are scenes inside the house that remind me of Welles' \"Touch of Evil\" and the claustrophobic rooms that Janet Leigh endured in that film.The idea is so simple. Dead people come back to life. This idea reached the ultimate comic conclusion in \"Dawn of the Dead\", which featured a shopping mall that strangely looks like your neighborhood mega-center. Take a real good look next time you are there!In short, the film not only succeeds as compelling cinema, but is a fun horror romp. The black and white gives it the look of a classic. (There is much lost in the remakes...yes, the blood is red.) There are enough disgusting scenes that color would be gratuitous. The 'homeyness' of the scene with the television set propped up on two chairs is disturbing considering the crowd of ghouls that stand just outside.What happened to great horror films like this?",

Even for someone who isn't a huge fan of the horror genre itself, I still found myself really enjoying this film.Beyond important for bringing zombies or \"ghouls\" as they're called in this film to the screen, the film does a great job creating tension, setting up great characters, and killing them off. Romero understood from the inception of zombie movies that the most important thing in the film are the characters.I've read that this film is important because of its depiction of violence and use of a black male lead which I think is awesome. There is also subtle messages embedded in this film about racism, which I love because it's done in such a subliminal way, unlike the films of today where it must be spelled out in a way that often times comes off as preachy. My one complaint about the film is that it comes off as almost kind of boring in how meticulous and realistic it is in the first act, where they are boarding up the windows, listening to the radio and discussing plans for how they are going to survive the night, but it's also what I love about this movie.This film is a strong 8 on the enjoyable and a 10 on its importance to film history and influence factor. It would've been a 10 if I saw it in 1968. Loved it!",

The character he plays in the new scenes offers to much plain comic relief which this film doesn't need. The new scenes just stick out like sore thumbs, they are executed in a much different fashion and while the original does seem quite timeless in it's setting the new footage is to obviously new footage. I mean, how many priests would you have seen in the 60s with a skin head and a goatee. So in conclusion, the extra scenes are a bit of fun to watch as an extra but add nothing to the film and perhaps take some of it away, but the music is perfect and it even brings it up to date while still keeping it's old style. Music:8/10 New Footage:4/10 Overall with new footage & music 8/10 P.S.(I have never heard the original music but here it isn't that good)",

It changed the way horror movies were made and while zombies had appeared in movies before, it would re-define the zombie sub-genre of horror forever.You take a group of people who are just regular everyday kind of people, people anybody can identify with and put them together in an abandoned farmhouse during a crisis. You provide them with every tool necessary to survive and then spend 90 minutes watching as adults demonstrate that William Golding was on target in this adult look at the Lord of the Flies.The stark contrasts of black and white only make this film better and you should avoid watching any colorized version of this film. It needs to be seen in black and white. In spite of it's low-budget origins, the movie shows a really talent with lighting effects and demonstrates what can happen when extremely creative people work within the limitations of low-budget film-making.While there might be flesh-eating zombies lurking on their doorstep, the real enemy facing the people trapped in this farmhouse are themselves. Their personal prejudices, cultures and attitudes become their greatest adversaries and instead of coming together to fight a common enemy, they get torn further apart as they struggle for their own power and identity.In Night of the Living Dead George Romero hold up a mirror for us to gaze into the reflection of our own dark souls and it's not a pretty sight.One final note. While I'm a big fan of MST3K, Mike Nelson's riff on the film is just a cheap shot and while funny at times, distracts from the beauty of this classic on the genre.",

I know it's a classic and it is definitely due it's certain amount of respect for being a pioneer film in its day for the horror genre. But in reality, the movie is slow, the acting is subpar for everyone but Duane, the soundtrack is out of place and overwhelming and the ending is well.... Dumb. A good movie is ruined by a bad ending. It's not because the movie doesn't have a happy ending, but mostly because it just happens. We spend an hour building up all that tension in the household, leading up to the climax: the final showdown with the overwhelming horde of the dead. And then BOOM. Our lone survivor is so unceremoniously shot in the head. Its Romero, so I know it's for shock value, but in my opinion, it cheapens the film. There's no reward in it for anyone. Even with a sad or unhappy ending either the good guys or the bad guys get a payoff, but in this case it's nothing. It's good for it's time period; edgy and gory (which comes across great despite being black and white), and holds strong with a concept that is still quite scary in itself.\nI can't rate NOTLD lower than a 5 out of respect for one of the classics that launched so many wonderful successors, but could it have been better?

The story is what it is, which is quite usual in a horror movie, but I was not convinced at all when it comes to the acting and the script. They were pretty bad, to be honest. Some shots, moments or scenes were sometimes alright themselves, but together they really didn't fit. They were both bad and alright every second time. Also, some character behaviors were quite unnatural, I think. For example when Ben suddenly began to beat up Harry Cooper while barricading. Yes, Mr. Cooper was a jerk, but not too much of a jerk to deserve to be beaten up in the middle of a crisis. I don't see the logic in that case. Also, when Ben shot and killed Mr. Cooper while Helen Cooper watched just right next to them. She didn't react at all! It looked like Mrs. Cooper was kind of unsatisfied with Mr. Cooper's behavior before the incident, but she was his wife. It just didn't make sense to me. But it doesn't stop there. Generally, I think Judith O'Dea (as Barbra) was one of the worst actors in this movie. She did ok sometimes, but very unprofessional overall. Her running and fleeing looked so silly, and it ruined most of my experience, especially because she was one of the main characters. About an other thing, I suddenly spot a big mistake. I don't know if the production was aware of it there and then, but I noticed something about the dead woman on the stairs. At first, the woman was half eaten, but in the shot when Ben dragged her to a room, it was obvious that the woman suddenly had a normal face, because there was an actress playing her in that shot. It was quite obvious to me, though. Anyway, the only things I think were good in this movie were the makeup, the practical effects and the ending. Those were impressive!

As brother Johnny says, \"They're coming to get you, Barbara!\" in his best Boris Karloff impression, a mysterious stranger limps towards them.We learn that a rogue satellite returning from a Venusian orbit knocked out radio for a while, but there are far more sinister and gruesome circumstances coming. The film quickly launches into them from Barbara's terrified, imperiled view. We learn along with her (and other survivors she encounters) the nature of the crisis. Victims are being killed and devoured by hoards of undead corpses. There's a great claustrophobic atmosphere, as the survivors hide in a farm house, fending off invaders who bash away on the house relentlessly. Director George Romero proves how much can be accomplished with a shoe string budget. His take on the re-animated dead person coming back to seek human victims idea is the inspiration for many similar films, but nobody has equaled this movie. He creates a very believable scenario for these average folks struggling for their lives against an ever-increasing army of blood-thirsty ghouls. I love how they move slowly and mindlessly, yet, with only one weakness, prove to be formidable and dangerous.A cast of mostly unknowns, but that is used as a plus; the audience can identify with these everyday people in this situation. The acting is pretty intense and believable; I was particularly impressed by the little girl zombie-fied: she was scarier than Linda Blair in Exorcist. Another strength is how the \"outside world\" information funneling through was so effectively done as parallel to the farm house group's story. The film is not afraid to kill off characters, some with poetic justice, others in tragic and ironic twists of fate.Brilliantly done.

Indeed I have waited two days before scribing any thoughts.I watched an original black and white print although I read of some colorized versions? The film was made in 1968 at the height of racial tensions in the U.S. that is why I mentioned the Ben character. The film does have a racial undertone between Ben and Harry in the house.The ending is one of those not to be revealed cinematic moments and only adds to the film and pushes up the rating.

            "content": "\"Night of the Living Dead\" is a somewhat overrated film but is still a classic of the genre.**SPOILERS**Traveling to a cemetery, Barbara, (Judith O'Dea) is savagely attacked, and seeking an escape, she comes across an abandoned farmhouse in the middle of nowhere. After a while, Ben, (Duane Jones) comes to her aid, and together they decide to stay in the house for protection. Later that day, from the basement emerges Harry Cooper, (Karl Hardman) his wife Helen, (Marilyn Eastman) and local kids Tom, (Keith Wayne) and his girlfriend Judy, (Judith Riley) and they decide to formulate battle plans against the threat outside. When it's finally decided that zombies are the ones outside, having arisen from the ground due to a radiation leakage from a returning space rocket, the house is boarded up but they still come after them on numerous occasions. After trying many different ways of getting out, they resort to increasingly dangerous ideas and attempts to get out alive.The Good News: While overrated, this is still one of the better entries in the genre that has a lot going for it. One of the main things is that there's one of the greatest mounting dread style of film ever done. This one here has a fantastic time building up the tension and gradually making it so that the villains here are built up into a credible menacing force. By doing it with one of the simplest of tactics, gradually getting more and more numbers for each attack, since there's nothing more unnerving than being attacked by a greater-growing enemy, and here this exploits that masterfully. In the beginning it's obvious there's only a couple outside amongst the group, but by nightfall there's a whole horde out there and it's done by introducing a couple new ones during each attack, making it obvious that their numbers are growing and it affects them accordingly. Of course, it would all be moot if the attacks weren't good, and here they are really glorious. It's hard to pick a stand-out one, since there's a lot of great ones that should be rewarded, but this one doesn't have a stand-out as they all are. The initial clearing of the house is fun, the journey to the gas pump is thrilling and ends in glorious irony, and the sequence where they break through the barrier into the house and must both repel the attack and replenish the defenses is one of the classic battles in the film among the many, since it manages to both keep the film entertaining and interesting by having a lot of action on-screen all the time as well as keeping the film suspenseful since it shows that there's stronger attacks each time and are trying to keep the intruders out with less-successful measures each time. That is a fantastic ability, and by incorporating it in here, this one keeps the film running along and interesting all the time. The final half of the film is where it's best parts are at, since it features all the defenses breaking down, general pandemonium as everything happens at once and there's a general feeling of excitement and intrigue as to what's going to happen, especially once the zombies finally get into the house. It's also helped along by one of the greatest endings in the entire genre, being both logically, cruelly ironic and just flat-out surprising all rolled into one gigantic barrel, and it's all the better for it. The last big punch here is the outright-classic pacing. The film wastes no time in getting things going and rarely pauses, not wasting time on numerous story threads or subplots. The action is always centered on the group of people trapped in the farmhouse, with only brief glimpses at the outside world achieved through their television set and radio. This is a masterful touch, as it really puts the audience in the house with the characters. The viewer knows nothing more than they do, will only learn what they learn when they learn it and no more. This really heightens the sense of claustrophobia that comes with being trapped. These here are the film's best points.The Bad News: This here had some problems with it that lower it's rating slightly. The biggest flaw here is that the middle portion of the film is that there's nothing in here all that impressive about the film. After the attacks subside and they're safely inside the house, it begins a long series of scenes that are simply everyone yelling at one another for the duration of the time, and it's hard to stay interested in a film when that's all that's happening. The yelling is over the most moronic things as well, which makes it harder to make it through these scenes since we get nothing else in here other than those sorts of scenes, and it gets grating after a while. There's also some qualms about the idiotic decisions made, especially about the daughter. It's known by all the characters that a bite or scratch turns the victim into a creature, yet this one decides that the best place for rehabilitation is inside the house, with no medical treatment for the condition in reach of everyone around them. There's also smaller problems, mostly based around the zombies. A long way has come in the design of the creatures, and these primitive-looking ones could be seen as a down-grade by some. The last one is the black-and-white photography, but its nothing major. These here are the film's few problems.The Final Verdict: Somewhat overrated due to certain areas of the film, but still good enough to be one of the better films out there in the genre. Still quintessential viewing for all horror film or zombie genre fans, while it's hard to think of who won't enjoy this one.Rated R: Violence and Language",

It is a creepy film. Throughout the film, the characters debate whether it is safer to go outside or stay indoors. This was a good aspect of the movie. Should the characters brave the outdoors and try and get past the zombies or would they die quickly? Alternatively, should they stay indoors and risk zombies breaking in and cornering them?The ending of the film is quite scary as well.

There were several other doors between me and my bedroom door, and I just knew that as I walked past 'em there were gonna be...

            "content": "There's not too much story to the 1968 horror film Night of the Living Dead, just a basic idea of having a few characters trying to survive being trapped in a house threatened by flesh-eating zombies. Yet today Night of the Living Dead is considered to be the quintessential zombie movie; it even went into the National Film Registry. Whether it deserves classic status is something I'll ask in this, one of my reviews on horror and Halloween-themed movies and TV episodes this October.While the plot is fairly simple, Night of the Living Dead is good for a genuine old fashioned scare, without relying on overly graphic violence (though there is a lot of violence). It creates an atmosphere of suspense. Radio and TV reports seen in this movie establish a sense of crisis in a large part of the United States. The news that the zombies attacking the living are eating their victims is grotesque; seeing the zombies actually doing this is scary. When the zombies are swarming the house, the suspense is thick. How will Ben survive? Nevertheless, I found myself questioning some things. I've always wondered why zombies attack people- if these were good people before they died, what is it about death and coming back that suddenly makes them evil? Maybe the zombies aren't the people they were in life, they're just mindless living things that by nature need to eat. The movie suggests radiation caused the reanimation of the bodies but doesn't give any conclusive answers as to what the zombies are- basically, leaving its audience to decide for themselves.Feminists have criticized this movie, according to Wikipedia. Indeed, I did notice the character Barbra is helpless, speechless, then hysterical. But the other women are able to debate what to do; one woman guards a young child who has been bitten by the zombies. The women aren't perfect, but neither are the men. Even the hero Ben, in deep trouble, flees to the cellar which he had argued earlier was a death trap- I guess he decided he was wrong. All of these characters die- but why? What was the point to that? Maybe, Wikipedia suggests, it was a reflection of the violence of the Vietnam War, which was still being fought when this movie was made. It's something to ponder anyway.Happy Halloween.",

            "content": "When I set out to review the 30th Anniversary Edition of Night Of The Living Dead on DVD, I had no idea of the treat I was in for. My editor advised me to look at the 30th Anniversary edit first, but I went against that and looked at the original 1968 cut first. I am glad that I did, because the 30th Anniversary edit takes all the impact out of the film. Zombies and other such flesh-eating monsters are much more frightening when you cannot completely explain their actions and motives, which makes the writer's attempts to recut the film so that it does further explain them all the more laughable.But I am getting ahead of myself here. It is hard to imagine what the audiences of 1968 were thinking as they sat down to a film that, at a fairly luxurious pace, shows a pair of siblings driving out to a small town cemetery to place a wreath on the grave of a relative. More than three decades later, the brother's haunting line \"they're coming to get you, Barbra\" is often used to introduce menus on DVDs containing one version or another of this work. Ninety percent of this line is in the delivery. It sounds so creepy that it accounts for most of the atmosphere in the film.The zombies themselves often look indiscernable from their living (in the true sense of the word) companions. Whether this was deliberate, or simply an effect of the low budget, I have no idea. By the time the delivery of the aforementioned line and the stock music sinks in, it becomes a moot point. These zombies convince because of the acting rather than the special effects.In a world where multiplex theatre and cookie-cutter garbage from the RIAA supposedly bring in millions of dollars per year, it is easy to miss the message that I got out of Night Of The Living Dead. Indeed, directors of certain other zombie films seem to have missed it. In essence, the zombie is the ultimate expression of mediocrity. They move slower than a Uwe Boll film, they can be easily beat down, but there is just so many of them that they overwhelm through sheer force of numbers. They don't think (although the same can be said for many who are supposedly alive), but they can help undo the best-laid plans. It is a pity modern directors don't seem to get this, but zombies are the ultimate statement about the society based around endlessly buying junk we don't need that is around us.The most striking thing about the film is that it has a vivid and rich atmosphere that many modern horror films lack. In spite of being shot full-frame, the film's visuals look more striking and vivid than many modern films that were shot anamorphically (this means you, Soul Survivors, et al). The scenes in the graveyard particularly benefit from the narrow, constricted, monochrome photography. There was an unofficial web site for a black metal band that proclaimed monochrome to be the only real thing in the world, and this film does a lot to further that argument. The stark look of the scenery and the characters furthers the horrific element. Like in The Evil Dead some twelve years later, George Romero chose his locations very well, giving the film a still-life look in many places.The film's pace never really gets above a crawl, but that helps it in many ways. The slow, tense atmosphere builds to a culmination in the end credits that, through simple still photography, communicate just how mad the world has gone in the past ninety minutes. Unfortunately, the writer of the film attempted to recut it in 1998. Among his many mistakes were the addition of attempted explanations for the sudden plague of zombies. Another was the addition of an unsubtle religious tone. When one experiences the beauty of Romero's original version, one realises the tale works more when it goes into less detail.I gave the original Night Of The Living Dead a ten out of ten. Don't bother with the 30th Anniversary Edition. It is another classic example of why revisionism in film does not work. The original has retained its influence for more than thirty years, and there is a good reason. See it now.",

            "content": "The seminal zombie flick, Night of the Living Dead, can now be crossed off my list of films I need to see. Here is a tale of the undead that is still copied and paid respect to today, some forty years later. Even writer/director George Romero continues to add installments to the saga with his most recent entries gracing theatres in the past few years. It is interesting to note that this film, the most notorious zombie flick, never uses the \"Z\" word. This might be because the word just wasn't part of our lexicon. Instead we are treated with the slow moving \"ghouls\" leaving \"partially devoured\" victims in their wake. It really is just low-budget terror entertainment more than anything else. I had always heard about its great social commentary, and I guess you can make parallels to the red scare and communism, but in the end it's all really just a film to instill fear in the young and laughs for the unaffected.I jest a little about the laughs as this is not as poorly acted as one might think. Sure there are moments of cringe-worthy deliveries and over-acted moments, but for the most part everyone is restrained enough to allow the themes of survival, heroism, and humanity's penchant for destruction to resonate. From the get-go I will admit to being worried, especially with Judith O'Dea's shrill screams for her brother to stop scaring her\u0097\"Johnny!!\" I think the amateurish acting helps lend some character to the film, though, being such a cheaply made one, (I mean that cost-wise not production-wise as the film is very well made), especially since Romero shoots most of it in close-up. It's as though he wants us to see firsthand and up close the mostly unsuccessful attempts at naturalism.The sheer simplicity of it all is what really stands tall when the credits finally role. At the center of the tale is this inexplicable outbreak of the recently dead being brought back to life with a hunger for human flesh, thus turning their victims into ghouls too. Scientists believe the destruction is a direct result from a satellite beacon returning from Venus that was shot down as it entered our atmosphere with extremely high levels of radiation \u0085 possibly the most obvious comment on the Cold War. Horrors have always been the strongest comment on politics and societal distress because of the inherent fear they bring. Films give us an embodiment of the evils and monsters out there waiting for an opportunity to strike. With Night of the Living Dead, we are being overtaken by radioactively triggered automatons, stumbling into our homes looking for blood. Could this be the mechanical and emotionless face of Communism seamlessly integrating their way into our world? A wave of fear that people who look just like us could in fact be the enemy? Maybe. The ghouls consist of our brothers and sisters and friends, and once they have been turned, they show no remorse or kinship, only a lust to turn you too. Huh, maybe I've changed my mind during the course of writing this review; I guess there is more social commentary than I initially thought.To get back to the surface, though, the story of these three small groups, trying to survive against the onslaught, I enjoyed what Romero did. He gives us the semi-locals\u0097Tom and Judy\u0097both young and unsure of their place, doing what they can to help, but letting emotions get in the way; the older stubborn Harry Cooper, entrenched in his views that his need for self-worth shields him from the right and smart moves; his wife and ill daughter caught in the middle as they must stick with Cooper no matter if he is wrong; and our outsiders, Barbra and Ben, caught up in the mix and truly the wild cards. Barbra is catatonic for most of the film, but her eccentricities cause immense unease and some of the best tension offered. As for Ben, Duane Jones is the epitome of the manly man hero. His take charge attitude is perfect as he will never back down to Karl Hardman's overly brash Cooper, nor allow the wild Barbra get to him, willing to smack her if needed. Ben is the one with a head on his shoulders, looking for survival no matter the cost, trying to help as many as he can, but unafraid to leave them behind if they don't want to jump onboard.So, when all is said and done, Romero has crafted something here that I'm sure was odd and unique back in 1968. This is the backbone to every zombie story you can think of, it started a trend that doesn't seem to have an end in sight. Utilizing the media as a main character even in his first film, the newscaster becomes a voice of reason. Our implicit trust in the man on TV/radio, the person accessible to everyone and therefore must be the authority on the subject is the real scary aspect of the story. Our heroes do what they are told, not because it's the right thing, but because it is the popular choice. I will say that the ending is superb and in tone with what had been going on. America as a land of cowboys, shoot first and ask questions later \u0085 ah, McCarthyism at its finest.",

I first enjoyed \"NotLD\" on the big screen way back in the antediluvian days of college, pre- videotape/DVD/BluRay collections, pre-Internet, pre-Androids etal., when Romero's unassuming film was burning up the midnight film circuit and burrowing deep into the collective unconsciousness of horror fans and cinemaphiles everywhere. Little did I know at the time just how influential this little homegrown nightmare would prove to be, but there was no denying its raw power to shock and unsettle unsuspecting audiences, and all on a budget just somewhat above rock bottom.Imagine, if you will, several hundred Boomer college kids packed into a darkened auditorium, most of them likely intoxicated on one thing or another, all eager to see this scary movie that so far they'd only read about. They knew that Roger Ebert hated it, which only made it more alluring. They knew it pushed the boundaries of graphic depictions of murder, and that, too, made it all the more the forbidden fruit. And, perhaps most of all, they knew it wasn't a \"Hollywood\" movie, and that made its rising star all the brighter. Imagine now that very first viewing of that rough gem in all its lo-fi glory...Almost a half-century later, even the most forgiving retrospectives will admit to the film's flaws; only the most churlish could deny them. The acting is at times unpolished, and the make-up is simply crude by today's standards (one can only wonder how it might have looked had Tom Savini not been dragooned off to Vietnam). The camera-wrangling is well-informed, though, by Romero's prior commercial experience, eminently bolstered by darkly evocative lighting and editing; the choice to shoot in black-and-white was, of course, a financial one, but turned out to be the serendipitous one as well. I can't even conceive of this film being in color, and have steadfastly refused to ever watch the colorized version. \"NotLD\" remains a classic example of inspired (and inspiring) make-do indie film-making and quite rightfully deserves its many accolades and awards of honor. It's far from perfect--even the script is a let-down at times with its occasionally clunky dialog--but it hits all the right dramatic notes, tapping into a nervous zeitgeist in a way that still works in a post-9/11 world--perhaps even more so than ever.If George A. Romero & Co. hadn't made \"Night of the Living Dead,\" I have no doubt that someone else would have eventually come up with something similar. But he did, and the face of horror and indie cinema in general is all the better for it. Long live the living dead!",

It is a classic masterpiece that was well ahead of it's time, it left a lasting impression in film history - and importantly for me, I bloody love it.Brief Plot:\nA small group of stranger's board themselves up in a Pennsylvanian farmhouse to escape waves of cadavers that have come back to life from the dead to feast on the flesh of the living.Detailed Plot:\nWhen siblings Barbara and Johnny visit their father's grave in Pennsylvania they are attacked by undead corpses. Barbara manages to escape and takes refuge in what looks like an abandoned farmhouse. Another stranger turns up and does his best to secure the building from the walking dead. They are surprised to find 5 more people taking refuge in the house, who have so far remained hidden and safe in the loft. What little news they can get from TV and radio is grim and does not offer much hope. With fear of the walking dead mounting, and trapped in an confined and isolated location, tempers flare and emotions deteriorate but the rag tag group have to try their best to survive until help comes.My Thoughts:\nWrap-up:\nThis is one of my all-time favourite films, and one of the films responsible for my love of horror and zombies. It holds a place in my collection (and heart) that I can never envisage it losing. Although NOTLD isn't a complex film by today's standards it offers complexity in different ways; in the interpretation that you take from it, in what you believe to be going on, the dynamics of the characters and their interactions, the isolation, the fear, the confined space. Different people have studied different aspects of it and written all sorts of essays about it. Some people saw this film as a critique of Cold War politics and the potential fallout; some people saw the film as a look a domestic racism in America during the late 1960's; it's been suggested that the film might be a subtle nod to the destruction of humanity caused by the Vietnam War; maybe it's the birth of the nuclear family; pollution on Earth and man's over-use of resources.... It could be seen and read in all sorts of ways and that's part of its strength. It is amusing though, because in truth the film was a case of people wanting to make a horror film on the cheap with a semi-original idea and lots of passion. What started off as a small concept with a small budget, grew into something massive and ground-breaking - something ahead of its time by a long way and something that changed horror and entertainment forever.\nI loved NOTLD the first time I saw it, and it is something that I do not get tired of. I watch all the spin-off's, unofficial sequels, homages, and parodies (etc), and none of them ever get close to the original. This film has a great cast bringing great performances. Even the actors who are untrained do a brilliant job, because they believe in what they are doing, and they are having fun. By today's standards the violence and gore are mild. Undoubtedly the best example of how a low budget film can be a success with the right ingredients added to it, this iconic masterpiece is owed so much from other films that followed it too. If it wasn't for this film we might not have film and TV shows like \"28 Days Later\" (2002), \"Shaun of the Dead\" (2004), \"The Walking Dead\" (2010 - ?), \"Cabin in the Woods\" (2011), \"Evil Dead\" (1981), \"The Thing\" (1982), \"Braindead\" (1992), \"Re-Animator\" (1985)... we might not even Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" (1982) video!! If something has modern zombies that are not controlled by voodoo or magic - we might not have had it without this. Even computer games owe this film credit - \"Call of Duty\" has a zombie mode, \"Left 4 Dead\", \"Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare\", \"Dying Light\", \"State of Decay\", \"Dead Island\", \"Resident Evil\"... the list goes on.\nFinally, another reason why I love this film... The 'good guys' lose.",

            "content": "Probably one of the most influential horror films ever made, George A. Romero's Night Of The Living Dead still has the power to scare the living daylights out of people. Perhaps more than any other horror film, Night Of The Living Dead capitalizes on the current events of its time, and uses them to good effect. Taking advantage of the anti-war sentiment, civil rights struggle, and cold war paranoia present at the time, Romero paints a portrait of an America as its own worst enemy. Seven people are holed-up in a farm house, trying to fend off a group of cannibalistic zombies. From the opening cemetery scene until the bitterly ironic ending, the film never releases its grip on the audience. One truly hair-raising sequence takes place in the cellar near the end. Filmed in the Pittsburgh area on an extremely low budget, Romero uses primarily amateur actors and acquaintances to film the movie. As a result, the acting is mostly poor and at times feels like a stage rehearsal, especially the house scenes with Judith O'Dea and Duane Jones. Jones is the only actor that comes close to resembling a performance; he's also notable as one of the first black actors, if not the first, to play a lead role in a horror film. The order in which the actors meet their fates also defies convention. Filmed in an era when there was a lot of experimentation with color film, the film is a grainy black & white, adding to its claustrophobic and pseudo-documentary feel. Although we've become desensitized to horror shocks these days, the film is still often thought of as one of the most stomach-churning horror films ever made, bar none. The film was re-edited slightly with a new opening scene for its 30th anniversary, but avoid it at all costs. It significantly lessens the opening scene's suspense from the original with extremely laughable acting. Three stars for entertainment and a 1/2 star for its significant influences. ***1/2 of 4 stars.",

            "content": "To speak of George Romero's debut is to speak of one of the most influential movies in the horror genre. This small low budget flick is the direct heir of the 50s sci-fi horror and of Hitchcock's thrillers, and it sets the tone for what the 70s would bring to the cinema.It is indeed, a product of its time, as it was made in a time of changes and revolutions. This landmark of independent film-making is a true jewel that should be the text book for every aspiring filmmaker, as well as a movie that every horror fan must have in their collection.The plot is amazing in simplicity, a couple of siblings visit the grave of their father when suddenly, a man attacks them and kills the older brother. Barbara (played by Judith O'Dea), his sister, runs away looking for help, only to find herself locked in a house as she notices that the killer was just one of the many living dead who are rising from the grave to eat people.It does seem like a simple story, but that is just because the zombies are only the plot device to gather inside the house a diverse group of people, and Romero goes on exploring the human relationships and the nature of good and evil. The movie is like the direct heir of Hitchcock's \"The Birds\", where a similar device is used to gather the characters and explore them.Besides the similitude with \"The Birds\", Romero goes boldly to new levels, trading the Hitchcocknian suspense for visceral horror, giving us the basis for gore in horror movies. The movie is very violent for its time, and sets the tone for the 70s explosion of horror movies.The acting is surprisingly good, considering that the actors had few or none acting experience. Duane Jones as Ben, gives a larger than life performance, and it is amazing the job he does with the role.The ending is still powerful and its social cometary (something that Romero always tries to put in his movies, with mixed results), is still valid today.Overall a classic, Romero would create his masterpiece a few years later with \"Dawn of the Dead\", my only complain is that it seems that he'll never top those achievements again. 9/10",

            "content": "In 1987 the Canadian film critic John Kobal conducted a survey amongst 80 other well-regarded critics to find out the critically-accepted `100 greatest movies'. With voting ranging from 22 different countries, only five horror works made the grade. `Das Kabinett Des Dr Caligari', `The Bride of Frankenstein' and `Freaks' all reached positions ahead of this George Romero work, yet it did succeed in pipping `Psycho' to 97th place. Conversely, at date of writing it fails to make the IMDb top 250, a factor which seems to prove that the general public do sometimes know best.Knowing it has such a high critical standing is an intimidating point, making the viewer feel that they must surely be missing something, or that they cannot correctly \"read\" a film if they don't enjoy this one.Certainly, the direction is above standard, but slanted camera angles with no psychological merit (which notably decrease as the film goes on) do not make it \"art\". There are some very well-mounted scenes, and I was amazed to discover a scene where a zombie (or \"Ghoul\" as they're called here) walks impassively forwards while being shotgun-blasted to the form of incidental music that is almost identical to that used in the Terminator movies. Okay, that was a pop culture reference, but many more are there to be found. The influence this film has IS admirable - I estimate that if you saw a hundred movies then ten of them would have shots that unconsciously imitated ones from Night of the Living Dead.Yet while it's influential, it is also INFLUENCED. Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens, the afore-mentioned Psycho and Polanski's Repulsion are all heavily drawn upon to craft this work. And direction is the only field in which this picture can stand up. Characterisation and acting are not strong points. Keith Wayne and Russell Streiner portray the square-jawed, straight-laced \"jocks\" so memorably lampooned by Barry Bostwick as Brad Majors in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. In fact it was this, along with the amount of clumsy exposition and dated melodrama that convinced me that Romero was joking when he made this movie. All it needs is a laughter track to make it a class-A comedy, except it isn't that funny either.Why doesn't the forest or the house catch fire when they throw petrol bombs everywhere? Why does Duane Jones begin the film as a proactive central figure then end it as a slightly-demeaning black stereotype? How is it possible to crash your car into a tree at five miles an hour? How can you kill something that's already dead? Why do some of the flesh-eating zombies visibly hesitate before devouring the contents of a butcher's shop? These are all questions that require answers but none are forthcoming.The ending is remarkable, and memorable, and the film overall is okay, worthy of a six. But the notion of taking what is an old-fashioned, good-time flesh-eating radiated zombie flick and saying it has socio-political undercurrents just doesn't hold water. Sure, the lead is black and that's commendable in the genre, but he still hits women and shows no remorse over murder. The concept of adding a subtext that really isn't there is what causes the overpraise of many a half-baked movie. One of the hundred greatest films ever made? They were joking, weren't they?",

            "content": "George A. Romero's 1968 cult classic 'Night of the Living Dead' could arguably be one of the most revolutionary horror films of its time. It may not have been the first zombie film ever made but it's the first one that actually made an impact on popular culture. On the surface, 'Night of the Living Dead' seems to be a run of the mill horror movie about a group of people hiding out in a farmhouse from these flesh eating beings that have been reanimated from the dead. What's so interesting about this film is its many satirical comments on American culture during the the late 1960's - criticizing society for its racism, its involvement in the Vietnam war, and a general attitude towards women.George A. Romero chose Duane Jones to play the African- American hero of the film, which up until then was rarely heard of, only to have him gunned down in the very end of the film just as he thinks he is finally saved and everything will return to normal. It's supposed to remind the viewer of all the powerful black males in history that have stood up to their oppressors and revolted against the norms of society only to be assassinated by those who did not agree with their views and beliefs.The zombies in the film are playing the same role the Vietnamese played in the Vietnam war. They seem to be everywhere and stop at nothing to take over everything in their path. The few humans that are left and trying to survive are the soldiers who were over in Vietnam during the war: they're trapped, they have little resources and have nowhere to run because the enemy they are running from are covering the entire area.The women in this film are treated as fragile and useless in the situation they are facing. Barbra, portrayed brilliantly by Judith O'Dea begins the film terrified and running from the zombies, only to continue throughout the film helping out in no way possible. She sits on the couch in shock and rarely responds or has any input to the storyline. The only time she ever gets up and takes action is at the end - at which point she is absolutely no help, getting herself taken away (and presumably eaten). Portraying Barbra as silent and unable to help because of her mental state of shock only pointed out how America at the time (and to an extent still does) treat its women as helpless and powerless.What is so appealing about this film is its ability to have all of these powerful, underlying themes while simultaneously coming off as a meaningless Friday night \"Let's go to the drive-in!\" B-horror movies of the 1960's. It has the ability to let you just sit down and enjoy it without having to think too heavily about its themes and context. It's a film that can be enjoyed and appreciated by both the brainless teenagers of America and the most analytical of film critics.",

            "content": "It was interesting to view in 2000 for the first time, the George A. Romero 1968 original black and white, \"Night of the Living Dead.\"  While not being a horror film fan per se, I was nonetheless impressed with the wide spectrum of quality footage in the production.  It ranged from awkward and mediocre to outstanding and brilliant. These varied bits could appear in a single scene, without warning. Further, the plot's devices could not all be held up to close scrutiny.Responses to this film will no doubt vary as widely, depending on how the proceedings \"grab\" one.  I can see New York Times critic Bosley Crowther's original points, being mostly \"turned off\" by the often amateurish \"ring\" to the presentation. Coming at a time when it did, who could have forseen this becoming a \"landmark, seminal\" production, \"re-defining\" the horror genre, and becoming a revered \"cult classic\" lasting into the 21st century?Yet for \"Night\" to claim these things, it has to really  have something going for it, and it does: some creepy effects, genuine jolts, suspenseful moments, and horror shocks. The leading actor, the late Duane Jones, had some talent, good looks, and a fairly natural way with lines. Since he's on-screen most of the time, it's up to him to provide stabiliy to the proceedings. Although he seems to lack a little acting experience (as does the rest of the cast) what he does do is to provide the \"glue\" to Romero's uneven structure, anchoring it pretty solidly.A genuine plus for the film is an excellent sound track, brilliantly conceived and executed: a superior blend of human, instrumental, and natural sound effects -- wrapped together with a fine score. Much of the editing is likewise on a high level, and the photography, while reportedly grainy in some prints, also has the reputation for high-tech fidelity in remastered versions.The film's conclusion is history-making for the genre in particular and drama in general.  Romero seems to be making more of a significant statement than might meet readily the eye. It's a work which can be deciphered many different ways, and its stark black and white photograhy assist in making this portrait a tabula rasa to which one can bring one's own horrific interpretation.Anyone for a stroll in the cemetary?",

By today's standards the film is not only anemic, its asleep.I look at the films a director makes in three terms: there is the film they make to get noticed (this, Alien, and Halloween), there is the film they make for money (Cape Fear, Batman, and Mission: Impossible), and then there is the film they make to reflect their soul.  Often times the first and last are meshed together, but sometimes there is distinct differences in construction (Schindler's List for example).Wow, who'd have thought you could mention Schindler's List in a review for Night of the Living Dead?  Nonetheless, 'Night's experimentation phase has passed in the wake of such work as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead, and Halloween.While it is grittier than its successors, George Romero is too concerned with making a horror movie that he skips on many possible avenues of difference.  The revolutionary effect this had on Hollywood is short-sighted.  Romero got stuck in the whole 'Dead' trilogy that is now in the process of being remade one movie at a time and he is forgotten. Perhaps Stephen King should give him a lift again.So, by comparison to such work as Carrie, Romero failed in his plans, but he should be complemented for creating an inverted movie.  This movie, like Die Hard and Jaws, shaped the way we viewed a genre.  While inherently negative in the result (how many bad zombie movies have been made since this?), I can't help complementing Romero for having a brief, momentary vision that he subsequently lost in the subsequent films.Overall, by now this is for devotees only on the same rating scale as Planet of the Apes.  '68 started changing our world, no doubt.  2.5 out of 5.",

This though slipped through the net. Watching it 50 plus years later does have its benefits. For starters the appreciation of something shot well in 4:3 Black and White. I say shot well, there's a fair bit of loose hand held stuff, but it adds to the lofi eerie tone. I'm going to be honest. I know this is a cult classic and responsible for probably it's fair share of tropes rather than relying on them, but it does mean I'm a little desensitised to much of the scares. It hangs on to its score far too much too. Fun as it is, it telegraphs too much. Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and Ben (Duane Jones) find themselves trapped in a remote country house, surrounded by woodland and zombies.... space radiation fuelled zombie no less. High concept stuff it's not, but give it time. I guess for the 60s it was quite frightening, shocking, exhilarating and it does have a good amount of gore. For me though it's the pacing and the story arc that Romero creates with a very small cast and limited location. It's also refreshing to see a black man lead an American film in this era, even in this belittled genre. Jones is a great screen presence. Confident, resourceful and fearless. Taking charge and protecting O'Dea's shellshocked Barbara, as they barricade A-Team style in the house. It's a zombie epidemic, spelled out to us on radio and rather brilliant TV news bulletins, but Ben and Barbara aren't alone. There's more folks hiding in the basement. Before long they're faced with a battle of social tension inside the house and flesh eating monsters outside. I'll admit I was unsure in the first act, a bit flat, hackneyed, simple, but this builds superbly. A diverse rich cast really flex's and flesh's things out. The zombies are almost incidental.

The acting could've been better, but that's what you get when you're on a tight budget.The news broadcasts are quite good and authentic looking. George A. Romero created a cult masterpiece with such a simple idea. Just have the dead walk and go around eating people. People are stuck in farmhouse, zombies try to kill them.

            "content": "Ben (Duane Jones) is the kind of guy you'd like to have around when all hell breaks out and you are very, very afraid.When an epidemic of cannibalistic murder erupts, Ben doesn't waste time panicking or wringing his hands. He gets busy boarding up the windows and doors, and voices full faith that he and his barricaded peers will escape or be rescued.Director George Romero effectively conjures a gothic tone in this black-and-white classic by setting his story in the Pennsylvania hills, complete with a thunderstorm, cemetery, desolate farmhouse, and offhand attitude toward religion.Post-modern horror touches arise with the population's cluelessness about the cause of the siege (i.e., there is speculation that the dead have been reactivated by radiation) and a lack of closure that exists with the demise of the story's hero. An atmosphere of moral disintegration reigns, as desperate people take desperate action they'd view as immoral under normal conditions.This movie employed an unknown cast and the acting often seems wooden, but that adds to the somewhat campy tone. Judith O'Dea is fair as shell-shocked Barbra, whose brother is the first human we observe to fall to the ghouls. I liked the performance of a dysfunctional family holed up in the cellar of the farmstead (i.e., shades of \"Psycho\" arise in the little girl's eerie reanimation).However, the highest kudos go to Jones, who deftly juggles the challenges of unexpected leadership in his role. I was sorry to read on Wikipedia that this gifted actor died of a heart attack at age 51.",

            "content": "Granddaddy of the slash-and-burn style horror flick, it gave birth to Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream and other landmark films in the genre, not to mention zombie flicks like Evil Dead and 28 Days Later. Romero began the no nonsense approach to horror: he uses shadows and shaky camerawork to build psychological suspense, along with the emotional breakdown of the main female character and the isolated, closed-in setting; but unlike suspense thrillers, or in the recent Kill Bill, the suspense is not followed by a cop out, like a sword fight that is over in one blow. There are living dead in this film. At some point, in fact, at many points - they will attack. Their hands will claw through boards at the humans. And they will eat the flesh of their victims. There will be no cop-outs here!A scene towards the end of this involving a child is surely one of the most frightening scenes ever filmed, in my opinion. There also appears to be a sub-text involving white america's fear of black people. The main character is black - but we don't meet him from the beginning. We meet a typical happy-go-lucky white American brother and sister. Romero leads us to believe these two will be the main characters, the main good guys who have to save the world from the living dead. But he throws this on its head after ten minutes, when the man is killed, and the woman spends the rest of the film in shock, incapable of protecting herself or others from the advancing dead. She flees the scene where a strange creature killed her brother, and comes across a farm, where she meets a black man. She suspects, and we are supposed to suspect, that he is one of the dead - ie, an enemy - but he is not, significantly. He becomes the hero of the film, taking charge, making plans and getting everyone else in order, when they can't really cope themselves. The chilling ending of the film is where the main comment from the subtext comes, but i can't say any more about it, because i don't want to spoil it for you.",

The black and white photography help the makeup effects and the sparse sound effects and music, restrained by the non-existent budget, add to a general sense of emptiness and dread while the lack of star power gives the movie an odd documentary feel. Also, The little moments work: Barbara seeing the dead woman at the top of the stairs with her face eaten off, the sight of zombies surrounding the house, the stories of how everyone got there, the little girl killing and eating her mother, and the final shot of a white hunter killing the sole survivor, a black man. All chilling sequences that add to the whole, but what makes this horror movie great is the social dynamics that are explored. The destruction of the group from within, the boundaries the can't be escaped even in the most dire of situations. The flaw, if any, is that Duane Jones' character is the central character. It is his story that we should have been following from the beginning.

But Night of the Living Dead very much impressed me. A simple premise somehow able to terrify us. Barbara Blair (Judith O'Dea), and her brother Johnny Blair (Russell Streiner) are visiting their father's grave when they are attacked by a strange man (S William Heinzman). Johnny is killed but Barbara makes her way to an abandoned farm house. There she meets Ben (Duane Jones) and later the two of them meet Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife Helen Cooper (Marilyn Eastman), and a young couple Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley). As the people are revealed to be zombies and the terror continues, it puts the people in the house in a worse and worse state. In particular Ben and Cooper have been put on opposite sides of leadership. The film is scary not only for the creepy zombie effects, but for the realistic animosity inside the house, perfectly showing one of humanity's greatest flaws. The way that we see the rivalry between Ben and Cooper play out throughout the film, is very reminiscent of William Golding's Lord of the Flies. Even though it's cheap looking, they don't show it as a monster movie, they show it as a real disaster.",

A young woman named Barbara is visiting her dead father's grave with her brother Johnny when...This film has so much of a great reputation amongst horror fans and cinema scholars alike. Does it live up to this?In a word- YES. Not only does it feel real (it's based in the America it was made in and looks almost like a documentary) but you get the impression that the events that take place in the course of the film could actually happen. We are witnessing the fabric of society unravelling magnificently due to the disaster which has occurred. Life (and death) will never be the same again after this literally Earth-changing event.Hitchcock may have ripped up the horror rulebook by disposing of Janet Leigh's character Marion Crane early on in Psycho when the audience wrongly thought of her as the main female character who would make it to the end of the film. But George A Romero goes one better in Night. Barbara is still in the majority of the film but is so traumatised by her ordeal that she is rendered catatonic for the rest of her tenure. And what a great performance it is- a mental breakdown captured on celluloid, a brilliant portrayal of a response to trauma. Watch the scene where Barbara comes across the music box. It's one of the most unsettling scenes I've ever seen.Romero also holds a mirror up to societal tensions and conflicts throughout the film. Duane Jones as Ben is the lead of the movie but is also African American- unheard of except when depicted by Sidney Poitier in mainstream Hollywood films that felt groundbreaking and progressive but also marginalised. These films squarely tackled race (and rightly so). But Jones just happens to be black and this is never mentioned in Night. His race isn't an explicit issue in the film- but maybe directs the actions of other characters (check out the conclusion to Night. There are MANY different readings and interpretations of this. It's the most shocking ending I have ever seen in a film and just as relevant today as it was back then. I actually get a shiver down my spine just thinking about it and what we see during the end credits of this film).But there are other societal echoes within Night. Notice how Ben gives his monologue regarding the backstory as to how he ended up at the farmhouse. Jones is truly astonishing especially here. But then watch how he reacts when Barbara tells her story- her account is no less serious or devastating as she's just seen her brother being knocked unconscious after being attacked by a member of the undead during an event that should have been humdrum and routine. She is termed hysterical by Ben who tells her to calm down. Different oppressed sectors of society with equally disturbing back stories to tell but instead of each being given their time to share their experiences, a member of one group tells the other to effectively shut up. 50 years on, this film is still relevant.This film also has a lot to say about the family of that time. The traditional family is under attack from the zombies (as Robin Wood expressed using his theory of 'Return of the Repressed'). The notion of Mom, Dad and 2.4 children (possibly with an apple pie on the table) is no more. The new family in the farmhouse consists of disparate members of society who are forced together to survive against what has gone wrong in the outside world. In fact, in one scene we see Ben actually taking apart the notion of the family and the household from within as he starts taking apart furniture like the kitchen table to barricade the doors and windows with. The scene where the mother is stabbed to death by her daughter who has been bitten by a zombie represents the death of the outdated notion of the family in it's purest form. The new killing and replacing what and who has gone before.The first time I saw this film it had actually been colorised but still worked. The thinking behind this colorisation was probably the video company thinking that all horror films made within a certain timeframe were 'kitsch', camp and unworthy of serious analysis or enjoyment. I believe the term is 'so bad it's good' (vomit). I remember an advert for a screening of the film on the UK's Channel 4 that billed the film as a typical 60's drive-in B movie- cue emphasis on bad acting, rubbish make-up and all round tack. Wrong on EVERY count.It was a revelation when I first saw the film as it was intended to be seen in black and white. It's actually a beautiful film with every frame resembling the work of the Nouvelle Vague rather than some Grindhouse fodder made on the cheap to be shown to the stoned.I saw this film yesterday on the big screen. It was the Criterion 4K restoration and it looked and sounded amazing.If punk is seen as Year Zero for music then this is Year Zero for horror and one of a whole slew of films that represented a turning point for American film in general.Fun fact- this is the film on in the background when Harold is having a sandwich made in Halloween 2 (1981).",

            "content": "Night of the Living Dead(1968) is an incredible movie experience that began one of the most successful periods for the horror genre.  It was filmed in 1964 but didn't get released on the big screen until four years later. The makers of this succeeded in making a film that had a budget lower than Psycho(1960).  The make up effects are ahead of its time for the year of 1968.\nThe feature is about people who come back from the grave to launch an attack on the living including people who are trapped in a farmhouse.  The editing of Night of the Living Dead(1968) is brilliant for a low budget cinema piece.  This pic would give George A. Romero a great moment to begin his career on.  The use of Pittsburgh is to the film's advantages because of its gothic feel.\nThe opening scene in Night of the Living Dead is legendary for its macabre style beginning.  What I love about the beginning is how things go from calm and quiet to suddenly hysterical when the first zombie appears. \"They're coming to get you Barbra\" is a line that earns its place among the annuls of horror pictures.  This one scene has plenty of heart beating buildup and fearful dread.\nNOTLD went on to be one of the most important Independant movie besides Easy Rider to arrive in theatres during the last part of the 1960s.  Changed the people looked about how to make a horror feature.  Introduced the audiences with violence in a manner that was groundbreaking.  After this, more and more horror flicks became more violent.\nOne of the fascinating parts of the film is the division between the people in the farmhouse who are fighting off the zombies.  What's revealed is that people who are divided are easily vulnerable to being destroyed during a crisis as oppose to those who work together.  Its symbolic of the division among Americans when the protests about Vietnam were happening.  The people in the farmhouse are responsible for the fate that falls on them because of the division between them.\nThe photography of NOTLD is one of the pic's major assists.  The black and white photography gives a moody and noirish atmosphere.  Black and white photography was used because there wasn't enough money to use color.  The photography heightens the tension of the film.\nBefore NOTLD, zombies dealt mostly with the supernatural.  One of the best examples of this is the motion picture, The Plague of the Zombies(1968). NOTLD created a new zombie mythology that's based on science.  The only film since NOTLD was released to deal with voodoo in the traditional sense was Lucio Fulci's Zombie(1979).\nThe ending is very tragic and twisted.  Its also ironic because its a person who's not a zombie that is shot in the head.  It symbolises the mindset of people in some parts of the countries. The end proved that many people during that time were driven to murder anyone who was of a different color.\nIt was bigger in Europe then in America when the film was first released. One person that the movie impressed was Dario Argento.  It would be one of the major things that led him and George Romero to work together on NOTLD's sequel Dawn of the Dawn(1978).  Duane Jones is outstanding as the film's main hero, Ben.\nGeorge Romero did an excellent job in the role of the cinematographer, director, editior, and writer.  The director was inspired by the Richard Mathison novel, I Am Legend.  One great NOTLD spinoff that came from this was the fab Let Sleeping Corpse Lie(1974).  NOTLD is the highest peak of the horror mountain that other horror features since 1968 had aspire to reach.",

It was the 60s, the production had been dead not even a decade, and films like \"Psycho\" were just lying the groundwork for a new breed of horror. In 1968, here came George Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\", and boy does it please.Firstly, of course, the gore is a real treat. It may be the first of its kind, but it doesn't hold back in the least. The make-up effects are very impressive and the combination of low-key lighting and the use of black-and-white cinematography create an aura of hopelessness for the film. The constant newscasts give it a very real feel to it all, almost equivalent to a documentary of sorts. And the character storyline is really quite awesome, creating splendid amounts of tension when the zombies aren't even on-screen. Duane Jones was a perfect, as well as tragic protagonist, and I really want to thank all the actor and actresses within the film. Most were at the time stage actors, and with genuine talent they helped excel this movie into film legend. One main reason in itself to adore this movie, and why I think it's an unbeatable classic, is that it represents a time when young film makers could gather together and make a suspense filled masterpiece without the limitations of large distributors trying to hinder the process to their liking. The movie builds terror thru dialogue and without sacrificing atmosphere, its greatest feat. One cannot call themselves a true horror fan if you have not witnessed this landmark.",

            "review_title": "Only Time the Living Dead were Actually Scary",
            "content": "In 1968 George A. Romero took the world by storm with an incredibly violent, low-budget, horror film that introduced what would grow to be the modern day interpretation of the living dead (referred to as zombies by most modern day moviegoers). These creatures are the reanimated corpses of the recently deceased, they shuffle, moan and eat the flesh of the living, and the only ways to kill them being incineration and a fatal blow to the head.How do these pitiful excuses for monsters bring in the scares within this low-budget exploitation film? I'd have to place my bet on the claustrophobic atmosphere Romero creates within the farmhouse, where ninety-five percent of the film takes place. In films such as Dawn, and Day of the Dead the characters had a lot more maneuverability. They could run, they could hide, and easily out maneuver these slow, clumsy creatures. Here, there is no room to move about, and you can feel that there truly is no way out, and no place to hide.The film starts as a brother and sister drive to apply the annual decoration to their father's grave. The two individuals are Barbra and Johnny, and as the two leave they are assaulted by a man. Barbra flees to a nearby farmhouse, and the story begins. Soon after she arrives she encounters a strong willed man by the name of Ben, who quickly establishes that Barbra is hysterical and must be taken care of. Taking responsibility for both their survival Ben soon boards up the doors and windows, preparing to sit the infestation out until help arrives.During the stay they discover some more survivors living in the house's cellar. There's the eager to help young man by the name of Tom, and his loyal girlfriend Judy, and then the paranoid Harry Cooper, his wife Helen, and their ill daughter Karen. Mister Cooper instantly protests against the command of Ben, saying that they all should retreat to the cellar, because there's only one way in and out of the cellar, as opposed to the house with its many doors and windows. Ben denies this, not wanting to be enclosed in a death trap without any means of escape if things were to go badly (which you know they will). In the end it seems only ironic as to how each character meets his or her fate.This film has rightfully earned its reputation as one of the best horror movies to date, and still beats out all of today's zombie films by a mile. Here the zombies really are scary, without resorting to being anything more than slow moving, clumsy beings (unlike the remake of Dawn of the Dead where they felt inclined to super power the creatures). Also, the setting is so normal it further increases the scare factor. How many people haven't been in houses like the one in this film? Imagine being trapped in one of these houses, surrounded by vicious flesh-eaters in the late hours of the night. This is where Night of the Living Dead succeeds where others of the genre have miserably fallen. If it wasn't for the original Night of the Living Dead, and Dawn of the Dead (both of which have been remade with a less positive response from critics and audiences alike) zombies would be some of the worst movie monsters ever conceived. This film innovated and created the concept of the living dead which have been embraced by mainstream audiences, and it is fitting that it is perhaps the ONLY film involving the creatures that has legitimately frightened me. Maybe it was watching it at night with the lights turned off, but I can say that few films have actually scared me when I watched it. With this film I was constantly holding my breath, and looking about the room nervously.The reason I was frightened (and surprised) by this film was due to its incredibly fast pacing, which is very similar to the way films are made today. This film just never has its dull moments (not to say I like all action, I was just surprised how quick it was). The plot is extraordinarily simple, and could have easily been covered in thirty minutes, but Romero was careful to grab the audience in the first attack scene, and keep their attention through means of suspense and violence.Now that brings us to the violence, and there is nothing that the undead are more associated with then excessive amounts of blood and gore. For the 1960s this film is incredibly violent, especially when it shows the undead feeding on the flesh of their victims. Being low-budget the victims are not seen being torn apart like they are in the sequels, but you still are given some disgusting shots of flesh from the bones, or fighting over intestines, which in some perverse way reminded me of people fighting over a chicken wing at a local KFC buffet. The images are just truly grotesque, maybe not to the avid, modern day gore lover, but to the common moviegoer it still holds up as being disturbing.This is the best film of the living dead sub-genre, followed closely by its sequel, Dawn of the Dead, and certainly holds up in all regards to the modern, brainless horror film. The film goes out to scare, and manages to pull it off, even to this day. With their decline as an actual icon of terror, at least we can still return to the gut wrenching human struggle, and terror of George A. Romero's definitive horror picture.5/5 stars; a classic that has endured the test of time with more strength, emotionally, and in the form of pure terror, than many films of the same era which possessed a larger budgets, certainly being on par with some of Hitchcock's greats.",

            "content": "\"Night of the living dead\" is the first chapter in George Romero`s legendary \"Dead-trilogy\"(the second movie is called \"Dawn of the dead\" and the third is called \"Day of the dead\"). \"Night of the living dead\" is an old-fashioned horror-movie from 1968, and it is even today an excellent movie. The movie is quite simple, but yet unique, and the movie inspired the \"Resident Evil-series\" for the Sony Playstation. The film is full of scary moments, cheesy moments, B-actors, simple effects and great camera-angles. Therefore the movie manages to keep your attention until it is over, and then you`d want to check out \"Dawn of the dead\", which is even better!Verdict: 9/10",

            "content": "I like Romero and I like his Dead films; I respect them for exploiting the zombie sub-genre, and the concepts the would inspire in future horror films. I like Night of the Living Dead, but I don't think it's a great film.   \nI do greatly admire Romero's ability to overcome his microscopic budget, his resourcefulness and ingenuity, and I really wish blockbuster directors now would look back and take notes.  Films are seldom worth their price tags anymore, especially now in light of over-inflated budgets and public boasting of how much money a production can waste (sorry, `spend') in so short a time.I like Romero's cold cruelty in his films - the bleak and hopelessness of their subject matter, and how he pulls no punches for the sake of appeasing fans that drool for universal Hollywood formulas.  These methods are the few that genuinely take you by surprise because anything can happen.Alas, his visual style does nothing more than recite the story in a dry monotone from beginning to end.  Films combine three different arts \u0096 narrative, sound and visuals, and while Romero does have some intriguing concepts, scenarios, and commentaries, he lacks that same amazing flair in the other two aspects of film.  This is especially evident in Night of the Living Dead.  His material conveys the idea and it does work, so by no means is Night (or Romero) a failure . . . but to call it a masterpiece and him a master is a far cry from the truth.  Art does more than `just convey' an idea.  Given Night's budget and it being Romero's first film, I can forgive those shortcomings.  Night is a very strong film to come onto the scene with. However, Romero had plenty of room to grow and improve his skills; alas, he's not come very far.  So I like Romero and Night, but I don't love either.",

            "content": "Saw the original and the 30th Anniversary editions. The latter adds nothing to the film and its cheesiness detracts from the original.The film is a B/C grade horror about the \"newly dead\" coming back to life and eating the living and...making their victims zombies too. As the audio commentary in the 30th anniversary edition points out, subsequent 'exploitation' zombie movies forget about only the newly dead turning into zombies. I can't say whether this film set the rules for zombie movies, though, amusingly, the audio commentary has the makers poking fun of one of their own for claiming to have 'invented' the zombie movie genre, as well as inventing doilies!There is some half-baked hint at what caused the creation of zombies-something about a NASA mission gone bad-can't work out what all that was about-something about a satellite in outer space affecting the dead here? Or what? ...ANYWAY...The black dude is impressive in the lead, and the guy in the cellar is suitably annoying as the guy with a different view to the black guy on how to respond to the zombie thingo.The film does have a scene of cannibalism, which, personally, I didn't find too odious.Lastly, I found the ending of the original film interesting-snap-shots of police officers with corpses. Made me wonder if there was a connection to the old Southern practice of going out and killing blacks, KKK style, and taking 'happy snaps' of their 'trophies'-not unlike that which also happened recently at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Any inside info from Americans on this?",

            "content": "I think George A. Romero's brain was about 20-30 years in the future when he made this.I mean think about it: pretty gory for the time, black protagonist, in one location, which is all the rage with indie films for the last few decades, maybe even some political commentary in this dumb black and white 60's horror film, and of course, it pioneered a particular genre of people not being total dumbasses in horror films.Oh, and zombies too, I guess.And when I say people not being total dumbasses, I make an exception for Barbara, who I can only assume Romero realised he made a terrible mistake casting when they shot the first few scenes, and then just made her catatonic as soon as she no longer served the plot.But it's a very small complaint, especially when this film has aged nearly perfectly, and, if you watch it with the knowledge that it's thanks to this that we ever got films like 28 Days Later, Shaun Of The Dead, games like Left 4 Dead and Dead Rising, and god knows how many more things ingrained in the public consciousness, it's still very enjoyable today even though it has been mimicked and copied hundreds of times.The performances (sans Barbara) are all great, it's really, REALLY impressively shot and edited for having such a tiny budget, there's some pretty great music on offer, and while the story may feel cliche nowadays, this is just one of those films where it doesn't matter to me, cause it was the first, and still it manages to be one of the best.I may hesitantly suggest that the pacing drags a bit in the middle, and that the ending feels anticlimactic to me, but I can appreciate the political commentary that is (maybe) there, it just feels kind of like they didn't really know how to end it until the budget ran out and they had to come up with something.But if Dawn Of The Dead is as good as people say, it probably isn't because Romero lost his braaaaaaaaiiiiiiins just yet.",

I don't remember what the second film was, but I remember seeing this movie. I also remember getting so scared that I didn't sleep well for almost a month.Years later, I still creep out when watching this film (Although I had seen worse over the years). The first scare is always the best, they say.A fallen satellite that leaked radiation causes the dead to come to live and wreck havoc on everyone. However, the core of the film centers on an isolated farmhouse in which a group of people (included a young girl that was bitten by a creature)are trying desperately to survive the attack. Barbara (Judith O'Dea)is practically catatonic, having watched one of the creatures kill her brother;Ben (Duane Jones)seems to be the one in charge and with a level head, despite the constant antagonism against Harry (Karl Hardman), who is insistent on staying in the cellar rather than staying upstairs; Tom and Judy (Keith Wayne and Judith Ridley)are the typical young couple in love and Helen (Marilyn Eastman), Harry's wife, is more concerned about her daughter Karen (Kyra Schon), than her jerk of a husband.Never mind about this little character drama. Let's talk about the zombies.There's nothing creepier than watching zombies. Their only goal is to EAT. They're not picky (You see one eating a bug). And they are insistent. They want the occupants of the house for a midnight snack, and nothing will stop them (Except fire and a blow to the brain).George Romero's cult classic film still hold up to this day (Forget about the remake of this film). The ending will bum you out (To this day, I just can't watch the ending). However, if you're a newbie and have avoided this film, then you gotta watch it.",

I admire Romero's balls by casting a black male, Duane Jones, as the hero and voice of reason. The arguing and bickering between the characters really illustrates the lack of hope people may face in life threatening situations.

Now I am older I don't get scared anymore I grew out of it the last Horror Film that really scared the hell out of me was Lucio Fulci's \"The Gates Of Hell\" (1980) A.K.A. City Of The Living Dead. I saw that in 2004 or 2005. Night scared me it was a great film. I still really appreciate it now even though it doesn't scare me anymore. It is one of the genre that broke the gore barrier it is pretty gory even to today's standards. I think it's good that Duane Jones was the best at the part of the character Ben originally someone else was supposed to play Ben a white guy. Can't recall his name. I heard about it on The Audio Commentary of The Millennium Edition the second Audio Commentary with Russ Streiner & the rest. Duane is great in this. I just hate the ending. Why they shoot him it sucks. He should of yelled out to the Sheriff & the rest of the crew & they wouldn't have shot him. The movie is full of thrills & keeps u in suspense from beginning to end Harry Cooper played by Karl Hardman who also had a lot to do with the making of the film. His character was an idiot he got what he deserved when Ben fights him punching him in the face. Also when he eventually shoots him. I am all the way for Ben he was the best Character in the film. Bill Hinzman was the best Zombie too. The first scene in the cemetery was actually shot last & if u notice Bill's hair is long but then near the end when he gets into the house with the other zombies he has a crew cut. Something for fans to notice cool little thing. Anyway Monsterbash 2007 is coming up & Chilly Billy Cardille will be there also Bill Hinzman & Kyra Schon. I will be getting them to autograph my Night Of The Living Dead (1968) Millenniun Edition DVD Insert. 7 out of 10 this is a Classic!",

            "content": "George A. Romero\u00b4s story tells the total overrun of living dead all over the world, subdivided into three parts: at the beginning there is the immortal classic \"Night of the living Dead\", followed by the sensational \"Dawn of the Dead\", and finally, the very underrated \"Day of the Dead\". Every one of these three movies has got the same basic principle: a little group of humans is under siege by an army of zombies. Inside of the farmhouse/the bunker are growing conflicts between the different parties, because they are not able to find an agreement (between the races in \"Night...\", between military and scientists in \"Day...). Instead of finding a solution they always kill themselves at the end. It seems to be a sign of destiny that only those survive who can keep their own individuality. The end in \"Night of the living Dead\" is pretty bitter: Duane, the only surviver in the farmhouse,  gets killed by a group of vigilantes, because they think that he\u00b4s one of the zombies. The final photographs show, how Duane gets burned together with all the other executed corpses. Romero shows this in expressionist pictures, a style, that runs through the whole film: there is a subtle play between light and shadow, brightness and darkness that gives this film his inimitable touch (one of the most remarkable scenes is, when the dead girls attacks her own mother). You can find a copy of \"Night of the living Dead\" nowadays in the museum of modern art in New York, although this film got a lot of bad critics when it came out: perhaps because George A. Romero did a cynical comment on the Vietnam war with this, perhaps the little group inside the house reflected the state of the whole American society from the late 60s... At the beginning of the 90s Tom Savini made a remake, that is may suspense-packed but it has got nothing of the social criticism that Romero wanted to tell. \"Night of the living Dead\" has influenced many other films of a similar kind like John Carpenter\u00b4s \"Assault on Precinct 13\", but it takes it main importance from the fact that the modern horror film would be an other without it.

What starts as a joke soon turns out in a nightmare as the dead are awake and yes they kill...

Add some guts here and there, an unimaginable amount of claustrophobic suppression and break the taboos of the time (eg. matricide and cannibalism, which were considered unacceptable at the time), and voil\u00e0, here we have \"Night of the Living Dead\".I understand that most critics were not exactly infatuated by the graphic special effects back in the day, but the real horror of the film lies deep between the lines. The surviving people, as in all Romero's movies, have trouble getting along with each other in a critical situation, once again proving that man's worst enemy is man himself.Although the movie was made in black-and-white due to the tight budget, it is actually a benefit, as it adds to the atmosphere even more. The music score is also very thrilling. The top advantages of the movie is the continuous feel of being trapped in a narrowing space and the growing tension between the characters, which sets the film apart from many of its contemporaries.All in all, a very touching horror film, not only due to its then-unmatched gore, but because of the criticism of society and human nature in it.

This franchise is based on the concept of a virus infecting lab workers attempting to cultivate it for biological weaponry. Once infection begins in this small area, it spreads and seems never-ending.Well, it is pretty well known that this series is based on the very concepts which originated in Romero's superb Night of the Living Dead.This 1968 zombie horror introduced the idea of something causing the dead to live again, but with only one objective - kill and eat people.The story begins with Barbra and Jonny, 2 siblings visiting the grave of their father. However, when they are attacked by a man who seems to be in some kind of trance, and Jonny is knocked unconscious, Barbra flees for the sanctuary of a nearby house. However, the man who attacked her has been joined by similarly tranced buddies, and they remain camped outside the house waiting for her. She is soon joined by Ben who is also escaping the onslaught, and he proceeds to to attempt to protect the 2 of them. Some more people emerge from the house cellar, and together the group of them try to to formulate a plan to escape this nightmare with their lives.Night of the Living Dead was the baby of debutant director and sreen-writer George Romero, who's now gained a place in the hearts of horror fans with his nightmare vision of the house under siege from flesh-eating zombies.There is no question the scenes of the zombies feasting on human remains are hard-hitting, and even now they still smart, probably more effectively because the movie is in black and white. This gave it a truly creepy charm which led us to use our imagination a little.The performances are hardly important, but as cheesy as they are, they serve a purpose and the actors do a decent job of acting scared.One particularly nice touch is the use of the medias, such as radio and TV. They genuinely make the story seem altogether more real despite the subject matter, with the characters frequently tuning into broadcasts which are reporting the latest developments along with their very own 'on-location' reporters. There is, also, an extremely effective air of hopelessness portrayed throughout. You never for a moment think it's going to be an entirely happy ending, so it is by no means spoiling anything to say the despair throughout has a reason.Furthermore, the entire story essentially takes place in the house they're trapped in, so it has a great claustrophobic feel to it, and yet the lack of variety never causes boredom for a second.There are even signs of the inspiration the Resident Evil series took from this, with actual moments in the movie later incorporated into the games.Overall this is a remarkable movie which still remains in the upper echelon of movie-making.",

Soon the zombies claim their first victims and thus the horrific plaque begins to spread.Through some series of events the main characters Ben (Duane Jones) and Barbra (Judith O'Dea) end up into a semi-big wooden house with Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley), where they try to survive from the hands of the zombie hordes.For being a black-and-white, low budget film, Night is surprisingly well filmed and full of horror feeling. Lack of colors has been replaced with awesome use of light and shadows. The use of the camera is as professional as in an average Hollywood film at that time.The music of the film is rather simple yet very effective.

            "content": "George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead is one of the greatest horror films of all time that along with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho gave birth to the modern Horror film. Made on a shoe string budget(114,000$),NOTLD is one of the most terrifying and scariest horror films ever made and set the standard for other zombie films that followed. It's not only one of my favorite horror films it's one of my favorite films period.Night Of the Living Dead tells the story of sister and brother Barbara(Judith O'Dea)and Johnny(Russell Streineryard) who arrive at a grave yard to visit their father's grave. While there, Barbara is attacked by a man and when Johnny tries to save Barbara Johnny is killed by the attacker.It turns out the attacker isn't a human,but a zombie back from the dead. Scared and frightened, Barbara runs off,but stops and runs into a farmhouse where other people including a man named Ben(Duane Jones) have occupied the house. Now, Ben,Barbara,and the other survivors must find a way to fend off the zombies and survive the Night of the Living Dead.Night of the Living Dead is not only a great horror film,but, a great film that came out at the right place at the right time in 1968. Violence was in the air and NOTLD portrays that well on the screen with a bleak outlook. In 1968 the Vietnam war was happening and was splitting America apart,racial violence and tensions were at an all-time high,and Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were both assassinated. NOTLD while a horror film was also statement about what was going on at the time in America,showing us the viewers that America was at war with no only the rest of the world,but themselves as well. One of the other things I love about NOTLD is the bleakness and hopelessness of the film where you feel that no character in the film is safe no matter what whether your a hero or villain. It doesn't matter who you are or where you are a zombie will come and kill you and eat you and it's a disturbing concept. The shy's away from film clich\u00e9s and offers no salvation or safety or hope. I also love the fact that the film was shot in black and white and shot almost like a documentary adding to the film's dark and gritty tone. The scary documentary feel of the film gives you the feeling of realism where it feels like your in the film with the characters and going through what they're going through and you can relate to the characters and their bad situation. The characters aren't Horror film stereotypes,but real people that are not one note and when things start to go hell you feel bad for them. This film was at the forefront of cynical 70s Horror cinema or cinema in general that was getting away from film where characters lived happily ever after. This was a very revolutionary at the time and still is. NOTLD paved the way for low budget Horror cinema in the 70s and 80s otherwise without this film there would be no landmark Horror classics such as Halloween,The Evil Dead,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Re-Animator just to name a few and also influenced and inspired filmmakers such as John Carpenter(The Thing,Halloween),Wes Craven(A Nightmare On Elm Street,The Last House On The Left),Sam Raimi(The Evil Dead)and Tobe Hooper(The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,Poltergeist)and will continue to influence and inspire filmmakers for years and generations to come. The violence and gore in the film is disturbing and for it's time was something wasn't seen before The film and pretty along with Psycho reinvented violence in Horror film. George A. Romero would push the gore and violence even further with Dawn Of The Dead and Day Of The Dead. NOTLD is also great because of how it portrays zombies. You will be looking over your shoulder. Before NOTLD zombies in horror films were more associated with mostly voodoo and the supernatural,but in this film the zombies are regular people people that are your family members,friends or neighbors. There's nothing scarier than the people you love becoming zombies and wanting to eat you and kill you. I also loved the fact that George Romero cast an African-American in the role as the hero in the film was a bold move to do and whether the casting was intentional or not. The ending of the NOTLD is amazing and one of the most shocking and powerful endings in film history and it's a finale that adds to the greatness of NOTLD and is an ending that will stay with you after you watch the film. A brilliant conclusion. The acting and cast are great here. Duane Jones is excellent as the hero Ben one of the few African-American hero's in a horror film. Jones brings a dignity and take charge attitude to the role and it's a great performance. Judith O'Dea does a wonderful job as Barbara bringing a believable performance to the role. Karl Hardman is great as the villain Harry Cooper a character that we don't always like,but does have a couple of points about living and being safe. Marylin Eastman does a fine job as Helen Cooper,Harry's wife. Keith Wayne and Judith Ridley do good jobs as Tom and Judy the young couple. George Kosana(Sheriff McClelland),Bill 'Chilly Billy' Cardile(Field Reporter)and S. William Hinzman(Zombie In Graveyard)give good performances as well.George A. Romero's direction is excellent bringing a frightening and stark reality to the film with the tilted camera angles and black and white photography. Romero's direction gives the film an almost documentary feel to it and a gritty realism. Great job by Romero.In final word,If you love Horror films,Cult films,or films in general I highly suggest you see Night Of The Living Dead,a landmark Horror classic that will stand the test of time is a film that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

            "content": "One of the first independent films ever-made. As soon as they finished cutting it in Pittsburgh, they chucked the movie in the back of a truck and drove up to New York to sell it. Also recently released in 2013 was a documentary about it I've been meaning to watch. There's such a wonderful history behind this movie. It was the first to feature \"intense scenes of gore\", inspirations arose from Director George A. Romero's love of the industry's \"thirst of bizarre\" at the time, as well as Richard Matheson's classic novel \"I AM LEGEND\". The house contained no running water so people would clean off in the lake nearby, and what started as a horror comedy the small film crew matured ideas as they went along. Soon wrapping up production, and alas the rest is history and the beginning of a cult phenomena.One of the first movies to break many society taboos, by casting a coloured man as a main character and hero no less. Five people are stuck in a house, where surrounding corpses have suddenly risen from the dead and began eating the living. Whilst little news can be heard from the outside world, the bodies are edging ever closer to the inside of the house and some of those still alive are not as mentally strong as others. Can these people set aside each others shortcomings, or will weakness be the downfall for all of them? It's a fantastic character study for the era, and in the final stages it just proves everyone is holding out for themselves. Everyone is diverse enough to challenge your perception of who was right, and ultimately who was wrong.From the opening credits with its eerie music and sirens already piercing your heart, the visual scenario is a normal day like any other. Obviously now thanks to the likes of Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining\" (1980), and Michael Haneke's \"Funny Games\" (1997) etc. Your average car driving down the open road scene could not be anymore sinister. To top it off in 10 minutes this idyllic countryside scenario descends into a hell so unique for its time, it has been debated whether or not the MPAA film rating system loomed large in the public eye soon after because of it. It redefined the word \"Zombie\", and no wonder it continues to remain an icon of pop culture. George shoots with no restrictions, and the foreboding atmosphere and stringed instrumentals build high tension that echo that of the classic universal monster features. All of which culminates in an ending still shocking and highly controversial.Final Verdict: An absolute classic that will continue to age extraordinarily. 9/10.",

            "content": "In the late 1960s, a 28-year old filmmaker with a small budget released a film that would alter the course of horror cinema. His name was George A. Romero, and his film was Night of the Living Dead. Perhaps the first zombie picture to enter mainstream consciousness, Romero's feature debut would become one of the most important horror films, influencing filmmakers worldwide from Lucio Falci (Zombie, 1979) to Danny Boyle (28 Days Later, 2002) to Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza (Rec, 2007). Such was its importance that the National Film Preservation Board (USA) decided to enter it into its registry.Night of the Living Dead has a simple premise \u2013 a group of people struggle to hide from bloodthirsty zombies in an isolated farmhouse. Except that these people are a group of misfits, strangers to each other. There is a resourceful and rational black man, a white woman in shock, a simple-minded man with his overly concerned lover, and a selfish family man (Mr. Cooper) with a wife and a wounded daughter. Conflicts occur mainly as a result of Mr. Cooper's comic stubbornness and refusal to listen to the black man, giving the film not only an additional \"villain\", but also a source of light-hearted relief in a dark film.For a horror film, Night of the Living Dead is substantially creepy, with the level of tension escalating as time passes. Romero's zombies are slow-walkers, afraid of fire, but never stop until they get what they want \u2013 to attack, kill, and devour live human beings. For a black-and-white film shot more than four decades ago, Night's portrayal of gore is surprisingly realistic; scenes of zombies eating an assortment of human remains e.g. limbs and organs, still retain their ability to shock in this day and age when extreme violence seems like the norm.Presented like a documentary of sorts, Romero's film is a startling and powerful commentary of the psychology of the American conscience in the 1960s. Themes include the fear of the mob, the white man's fear of the black man, the (emotional) weakness of women, and the fear of Armageddon are expressed through the characters whose actions and words are heavy with meaning. Romero also portrays the authorities (on television, no less) as distant folks who are unclear of the situation on the ground, and who think that relaying the magic phrase \"we are doing our best as fast as possible\" would allay the fears of a concerned citizenry.While the world has made great strides in dealing with racism, organized crime, gender inequality, and at the same time promoting diplomacy, Night of the Living Dead is still strangely relevant today as when it was first released. Perhaps our fears transcend time, rooted in memory and experience. In addition, Romero's film is also a strong rallying call for us to unite together to solve issues regardless of differences, petty or not. If there is such a thing as an \"educational\" horror film, that thing would be called Night of the Living Dead. It's not about zombies. It's about us.SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",

Everybody and their sexual fetish know that in horror, it's better to suggest than to show, and NOTLD builds and builds and builds on this, with moments that take the action to another different place, I am talking about the scenes in which the survivors are watching the news; it creeps you out even more, because, as said in one of the two other movies of the trilogy, 'It's everywhere.' The characters may seem stereotypical, but at a closer look, they develop, particularly Barbara in her last minutes, where she dives into danger to save Helen, if only for a few seconds, and then meeting an untimely, sad and shocking end (off-screen) at the hands of her own brother.Anyway, to anyone who boos this movie, I say, watch it once, and tell me if you don't feel like you ARE in it.",

            "content": "The 60s was a prime time for innovations in horror/thrillers. Right at the beginning, Hitchcock released PSYCHO. A few years later, he'd do it again with THE BIRDS. In 1966/67, CARNIVAL OF SOULS was released and proved that a low-budget horror film could be successful. In 68, Roman Polanski released ROSEMARY'S BABY. In between, there were countless others that pushed the envelope and shaped what would become the modern horror/thriller. But NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is the definitive one. Eschewing the need for stars, big-budget special effects, and color footage (not by choice, but due to budget constraints), Romero and his team set out to tell the most terrifying tale ever imagined. By now everyone knows the story, so here's the overview: Seven survivors wind up trapped inside a farmhouse as ravenous, undead hordes gather outside and attack them. In terms of on-screen violence, this movie was quite shocking for its time. We get blood dripping down walls, zombies eating body parts, half-rotting corpses, and excellent zombie make-up. The acting is good from all cast members. It's easy to identify and sympathize, but the filmmakers never make any one character out as a true villain or hero. Also, the terror doesn't always come from the zombies. In fact, Romero seems to take delight in showing us man's inhumanity to man, as one-by-one the survivors struggle against, argue with, and ultimately doom themselves. On the television and radio reports, they get assurance that help is on the way, but help might arrive too late. And ultimately, the supposed heroes/vigilantes are no better than the zombies. Taken from a socially relevant standpoint, the movie works at showing the fear, biases, and turmoils that plagued many Americans during the 60s. Vietnam was in full horrific swing, various movements and revolutions were occurring, crazed gunmen killed people from towers, and at times America was divided against itself. NOTLD works at showing all of that ugliness. Fear saturates every second of this film, and it works because true horror occurs where the tragic and terrifying meet. While nowhere near as graphic as films that would follow (including Romero's own sequels) none has quite the impact as this low-budget black & white film. Which is why, in my opinion, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is the best horror film ever made!!!",

No time is wasted on back story and little is ever known about the characters which I think works well and the tensions feel real.

However that is better done in Aliens, Predator, or The Thing. In terms of zombie films, Dawn of the Dead and Braindead are much better. Maybe it's because they use satire - can you make a serious horror film where the enemy is a group of slow-moving retarded undead people? NB. One comment says there is a sense of 'impending doom' in this film - there is no such thing! Dawn of the Dead is far more bleak, yet funny too.",

The radio and the TV were a nice use of intrinsic sounds. Additionally, they contributed to the narrative. I liked the close-ups on the faces of the zombies when they were eating flesh.

Too bad he had to star in Night of the Living Dead.Night of the Living Dead has some genuinely suspenseful parts, especially at the beginning, when Barbara is attacked by a zombie. The fact that we don't really know why the dead are rising from their graves is also frightening. Unfortunately, Romero decided to add unnecessary scenes of cannibalism, and a zombiefied child who stabs her own mother to death. We already know from the radio announcer that the zombies eat their victims, and the thought of it is disturbing enough, we don't have to see them play with intestines or sink their teeth into livers.Night of the Living Dead took a giant step forward by having a black lead character, but two giant steps backward with the unnecessary guts and gore. Suddenly, horror movies started to focus more on violent and disgusting scenes than meaningful stories. In a way, movies like NOTLD ruined the horror genre.

It is a comment on the failure of the prevailing socio-political order at the height of the tumult of the '60s, in 1968. It is a comment on race in that the black hero of the film (Duane Jones as Ben) fends off death, only to ultimately succumb to an ignorant mob of white men in a truly pointless death. Via the character of traditional Harry (Karl Hardman), we see the passive approach toward change-hide in the cellar and hope that one survives. This might be analogized to many in the United States at the time who resisted change and tried to ignore it and hoped that they might weather the storm as they were. This is in bold contrast to the character of Duane whose resourcefulness and hard work engages the zombies, come what may. This might be analogized as the youth, as minorities, as folks who wanted to see a new way of doing things and would push to secure it.The film itself is quite spare in its style, which to me makes it quite ripe for metaphor and interpretation. One can see, in the vivid, sharply-drawn characters, the outlines of prevailing schools of thought driving the coruscating changes of the '60s.The story of the film is that a group of people find themselves trapped in a home with zombies zeroing in on them. They are stuck in the house and are trying to survive the attack of the relentless flesh-eaters. The group is composed of a family- which lives there and whose daughter Karen (Kyra Schon) has already been bitten by the zombies. They, including the old-fashioned Harry and his wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman), with whom he is feuding, are in the cellar. A young man named Tom and his girlfriend Judy (Judith Ridley) who are a bit more forward-looking have also taken refuge in the house although they are a bit more willing to join Duane upstairs in taking on the zombies directly. The decisions they make about where they will take their stand will determine whether they will defeat the zombies or not.The film was heavily criticized when it was released for some of the imagery which was quite gruesome. In watching it now, it retains the ability to shock, and the matter-of-fact way in which the zombies continue to attack, not in a graphic way, but simply unrelentingly, gives the film the continued ability to scare. As noted, I found the film quite acidic in its commentary on Vietnam, on race riots, on changes in demographics and on a country in flux, but if you just want to watch it simply for a good scare, it would work that way also. Director George Romero has conjured up a compelling story onto which one can attach all sort of meaning and the cast, most especially lead actor Duane give great performances. There are some very scary moments in the film and its importance, as a pioneering horror film was recognized several years ago when the Library of Congress accorded it protection as a work of enduring value. It's not hard to see why.",

I was afraid these dead people would be outside the walls and perhaps if they didn't hear me they couldn't bother me. It was scary as hell.Now I am a grown man and I am a horror freak with a collection of movies that hit just a tad over the 5500 mark and about 3000 of those are horrors, if not more. I absolutely love horror and I prefer the slashers from the 80's but I like all types I have watched the silents all the way to the universal monsters of the 30s and 40s all the way through to the sci-fi fifties and the hammer 60's and they all hold dear places in my heart but I will have to say that to me George Romero took a bit from the classics and held true to the suspense but he did one thing that all those other movies couldn't \u0096 he straight up scared us.Many of the older films were creepy and scary in there own way, but N.O.T.L.D. was the first one that wanted to flat out show us something scary and scare us and not just leave us to use our imagination, but show us what these monsters will do to us. The creepy soundtrack, the great actors and blood guts and WOW!! Almost 40 years old and still stands alone as being perfect and just as scary today as it was then. It's spawned many sequels, a remake and a zillion copies and still nothing compares to it. I think real horror was born with this movie and I don't know how any one could not love this movie. If you get a chance watch it, watch the sequels, the remake and you will see a bunch of great movies\u0085 watch this in its original black and white presentation. The colorized version takes so much away and also the 30th anniversary version with the extra scenes should be avoided if you are watching it for the first time. If you have watched it about 50 times like I have then the extra scenes are cool to see.10 out of 10 stars",

            "content": "Since so many people have given such wonderful reviews before me, I won't even try to write a lengthy essay on the importance of \"Night of the Living Dead\". In short, it saved horror from becoming a joke (it wasn't doing too well around 1967 and 1968) and redefined how zombies were viewed by the general moviegoing public. I can't think of one horror fan who has not seen this film and if you are reading this and STILL haven't seen it, go out NOW and rent it, buy it, anything. You owe it to yourself to see this!While lots of fans find Judith O'Dea's character Barbara very annoying and catatonic, she is only a realistic portrayal of how an already unstable woman would react to the crises she is put through (attacked by a stranger, witnessing her brother's murder). True, Barbara does become an unimportant character about 25 minutes into the film, but she is still a commanding presence by the sympathy she evokes from the audience. Judith O'Dea is my favorite performer out of the whole film, even though Duane Jones, Karl Hardman, and Marilyn Eastman give better than average performances. Unfortunately, out of the entire cast, only Jones moved onto other movie work. The others slipped into obscurity and have turned up at horror film conventions to sell their wares. I have personally met Bill Hinzman (the cemetery zombie), John Russo (co-writer), Karl Hardman, Marilyn Eastman, and Kyra Schon (the zombie girl) and they are all very nice, down-to-earth people overflowing with information and memories about the shoot.George Romero is still working today and is one of only a few great horror masters still making actually effective genre films (along with Wes Craven, Dario Argento, Tom Savini, and a few others). The entire film is a compelling character study, a series of shockingly graphic zombie attacks, and unparalleled terror created by an isolated, claustrophobic, documentary-like filming style that Romero would later use to his advantage in other films like \"The Crazies\" and \"Martin\" (see those, too!). Once again, if you hear anyone speaking against this movie, truth is that they weren't in the right state of mind while watching it, are closed-minded, or just expected more gore effects. Instead, an intelligent movie was set before them and they couldn't handle it. I recommend this movie more than ANY other film in the horror genre, you WILL NOT or SHOULD NOT be disappointed!",

And the bickering and distrust between the trapped people in the farmhouse. The cheap budget of the film adds brilliantly to the effect it has, and just shows how you can make a truly great scary horror film with little financing.

As a mistake it makes an assumption that is not out of character for what they are going through, but could they have been less quick to respond? The remake is more inline with the development between the original and the Dawn, but it is also very different due to the small changes in some of the scenes. Overall, they kept to the original plot very well.\nAlthough, I certainly did not like the remake the first time I saw it, it has grown on me. It is a good remake with 2 great actors, Tony Todd and Patricia Tallman. Todd, followed the original very closely, while Tallman gave Barbara more strength. Although, I did not care for her acting at first, after Babylon 5 she makes it HOT. I wonder if today, she would go after a 61 yo fart?",

            "review_title": "\"Nothing is scarier than the neighbors.\" - George A. Romero",
            "content": "Right off the bat, I am going to tell you that Night of the Living Dead is a \"B movie\" which gained fame and infamy from being released through grindhouse cinemas in Pittsburgh. It was an ambitious effort project from new film maker, George A. Romero. The film had virtually no budget. The investors of the film are actually the extras and the main actors are all friends of Romero's. It's that low budget. There's also a few editing issues but keep in mind how old and cheap this movie is. It wasn't supposed to be Citizen Kane.All that said...This movie is a masterpiece! There's a reason it is still talked about today and has spawned sequels, ripoffs, spinoffs, reboots, TV series, video games and an entire mythology revolving around the undead (which the United States military has reportedly developed a plan for.)The quality of the film is part of its charm. The film is in black and white, is highly contrast (in more ways than one) and visually gritty. Romero used these low budget downfalls to his advantage, adding to the intensity and disturbing nature of the film. He also capitalized on the trend of movie violence and sensationalism at the time. It makes the movie creepy to this day.The acting is mostly good. There's some over acting and a few bits of mediocre dialogue but again, this wasn't supposed to be a good movie. It was supposed to be trash! It failed in being the garbage film to scare up a few bucks for the \"real movie's\" funding...because it was incredibly successful. In fact, it was one of the (if not the) most successful films until The Blair Witch Project came along 30 years later. By the way, that's \"Chilly Willy\" Cardilly as the news anchor interviewing the local sheriff. Cardilly was a regional \"late night thriller movie\" TV personality.The three things that sell this film are the cinematography, the message and the story. The story revolves around a group of people who seek refuge in a farm house from the dead who are coming back to life and attacking the living. No spoilers here, it gets to the point quickly. It succeeds in giving off a feeling of isolation and impending doom. The true intensity of the film doesn't come from the struggle to ward off the dead but from the power struggle that occurs within the house. The film succeeds in rising tension and keeping you riveted to the screen despite, again, being a throw away film. The interactions between characters may not be the best acted but you can relate to the characters and feel for them, seeing all viewpoints. It will genuinely hook you.The message of the film is simply just human nature. What will you do when death approaches you and everyone you know? Will you eat each other, step up and be a hero or shrink into a corner and cry? This film also makes a statement about humanity in the 1960's and in the end, it will make you feel uncomfortable...which is the point.The last great thing about this movie is the cinematography. Romero used Dutch camera angles and harsh lighting to create a creepy nightmarish visual that will probably make you uneasy today in the era of desensitization. All of these amazing aspects of this film make for a \"crappy\" movie that is exciting, grotesque, thought provoking and at the bare minimum entertaining.I watched this movie when I was home alone and in the dark on Halloween night at the age of 9 and yes, it scared me to death! It changed my world for various reasons. I bought it the next day, watched repeatedly and cut my childhood short in favor of watching more adult films. It may no longer scare you but you won't be able to look away. Night of the Living Dead is an accidental masterpiece of horror cinema. Watch it in the dark and remember...\"They're coming to get you Barbara.\"",

            "content": "In 1968 America found it's self-mired in the grip of social, political, and racial upheaval. The Vietnam War was exploding and the body count was broadcast every night into the dubious comforts of our households. Generations were clashing, seeing each other as the enemy. Battle lines were being drawn over the color of a person's skin, or the length of their hair. Heavy stuff huh? And your probably saying, \"BT! What does this have to do with the movie?\" well, you'll see as you read on. During these times, B movies rain supreme. Turning out of Hollywood faster than Japan can turn out Pokemon cards. One of those B movies in small, black and white venture from John Russo, and George Romero, would go on to become one of the most influential, and important horror films of all time. It would become legendary, as a film that not only started an entire sub-genre, but also accurately and without apology, mirrored all the strife that those times had to offer. That film was Night of the Living Dead.The movies plot is simple enough, a young woman named Barbara played by Judith O'Dea, and her brother, Johnnie played by Bill Moseley, visit their fathers grave at a cemetery in the rural backwoods Pennsylvania. The first hint of socio political commentary this film has to offer takes place in the first few minutes. As Barbara's brother mocks her beautiful prayer, scoffing at the notion of \"Church of God\". For 1968 this was pretty risqu\u00e9 stuff. Within minutes they are attacked by a zombie, which kills her brother. Soon several zombies, eager to consume her warm tasty flesh, pursue Barbara. She takes shelter in an old farmhouse and soon finds our heroine has company. The films hero Ben, played by Duane Jones, arrives on the scene also seeking refuge in the farmhouse. Ben was unlike anything ever seen in Hollywood at that point. He was African American, and standard convention advised against having an African American as your main hero. To compound things he wasn't a suburban African American. Nope, this brother was from the streets and he let the viewers know it.In their first twenty minutes with each other, Barbara is more scared of Ben then she is of the ghoulish army in camp outside the house. Again, Romero perfectly reflected the racial turmoil of the time. Soon five other refugees from the nightmare, including Harry Cooper, played by Karl Hardman, join them who typifies the average white, middle age, and xenophobic businessman of the era. His daughter Karen, played by Kyra Schon, and his wife Helen, played by Marilyn Eastman, who's beginning for the first time in her life to question her husband's judgments and motives. Again the movie speaks of deeper issues, touching on woman's liberation and the classic of all these problems, old money values.Later in the movie we deal with the issue of patricide. When the Cooper's daughter, Karen, who previously had been bitten by a zombie before they got to the farmhouse, dies. And then comes back as one of the walking dead, and kills, and eats, her mother and father. After barricading themselves in the house, cabin fever soon begins to pick up the groove, inflicting more damage than even the zombies can do, culminating in a desperate struggle against not only the cannibalistic hordes outside, but against each other as well.Perhaps the most memorable moment in Night of the Living Dead is the ending. Romero provides a conclusion, so shocking and so unexpected, that the critics of the era were unsure what to make of it. Audience reaction at the time was one of strong disbelief. Another interesting aspect of Romero's zombie methods is that no explanation of the dead rising and eating the living is ever given. In this film it is speculated that a recent space probe returned from Venus may have caused the change due to background radiation. It's important to remember that at the time, America was in the grip of a nuclear war fever, and the danger of radiation was on every bodies mind.Budgetary restraints and a lack of experience may have added some rough edges to Night but they don't really diminish the film; they actually add to its surreal atmosphere. For instance, the camera work is stationary, never changing position. Each shot is from the same, locked vantage point. Most of the shots are very tightly framed and from low and skewed angles. Sometimes you can see the ceiling. Sometimes the camera is unsteady and shaky. It all helps create the claustrophobia and unsteadiness that's so integral to the film's power and message. The walls are closing in; the wall of zombies outside, and the wall of mistrust and fear inside.The other rough edge I'll mention, if you can even call it that, is the acting. It ranges from quite good to \"I'm glad she didn't have more lines.\" Again, this only makes the proceedings of the film more odd and maybe a little more unsettling. If you can suspend your disbelief for the dead rising chances are some stilted acting won't bother you.Night of the Living Dead truly deserves the praise and acclaim that has been showered upon it in the last few decades. There have been many sequels and remakes of the movie, and most of them are good. However, the 1990 remake, which was done in color, I considered to be an abomination. Sorry Tom Savini. If ever a horror movie were a masterpiece, this one is it. An important milestone in cinematic history, and proof of what independent filmmakers can do. Night of the Living Dead is the seminal zombie movie.",

            "content": "*possible spoiler?*After more than thirty years, \"Night of the Living Dead\" stands as one of the most influential horror films ever made. Despite its low budget, it still holds up reasonably well. In fact, a more polished film might not have been as effective. The grainy, gritty black-and-white cinematography evokes the feeling of a documentary instead of a fictional construct. As events progress, there is an urgency and immediacy that no amount of money can buy. There is a feeling of mounting dread, as we feel trapped in a nightmare with the characters. The more we see, the less confident we are that anyone will make it out alive. The ending, which I would not dream of revealing, is a genuine shocker. It shows what true horror can do when not touched by corporate interests. For his entire career, Romero would make every effort to make quality films on the fringes. He has not always been successful, but rarely has he been accused of selling out.Duane Jones has been noticed as one of the first black leads in a horror film. This may or may not have been a deliberate attempt to make a social statement (availability surely played a role as well), but he turns in a credible performance as Ben. At first I was concerned about the effect Judith O'Dea would have on my enjoyment of the film. Her \"girl in distress\" character was shrill, but thankfully she goes comatose and allows the remainder of the movie to focus on more worthy supporting characters. Karl Hardman gives strong support as a fellow survivor who cannot get along with Ben, even putting his life in jeopardy. The film makes creative use of radio and television media to transcend its budget limitations, as we are barraged with reports of zombies taking over the entire east coast--and beyond. This is not an isolated incident. This is a major problem that is sure to have profound repercussions far and wide. The highest levels of government are in a panic over what to do about the problem. These portions make up some of the most compelling material in the NOTLD, and give a more epic scope to what might have otherwise been a more claustrophobic (and less compelling) film. The effect is chilling. Its sequel, \"Dawn of the Dead,\" would take the concept even further, becoming one of the few follow-ups to stand above the original.*** (out of ****)Released by the Walter Reade Organization",

            "content": "Few films can claim to be as influential and genre-defining as George A. Romero's 1968 horror classic Night Of The Living Dead. This is a superb film in every respect - it's beautifully filmed, expertly constructed and well acted. However, the film's most impressive achievement is that it still packs one hell of a punch almost 40 years later. Night Of The Living Dead remains essential viewing for any student of the horror genre.Romero's premise could not be simpler. Barbra is attacked by a man who appears to be in some kind of catatonic state and flees to an abandoned house. She soon finds herself surrounded by a group of similarly affected people and starts to question her sanity until help arrives in the form of Ben, surely one of cinema's first black action heroes. Ben boards up the house, only to discover that two couples and a child have been hiding in the cellar. The group learn that a murder epidemic has spread across the country and try to hatch an escape plan that will enable them to reach one of the camps that have been set up to protect survivors. The reason why Night Of The Living Dead endures as a \"scary\" movie, while many of its contemporaries have become quaint or camp with the passing of time, is its remarkable ability to tap into commonly held fears and phobias.For a film that was initially renowned for its blood and gore, Night Of The Living Dead's legacy is its psychological impact. Night Of The Living Dead was not the first film to use zombie-like creatures by any stretch of the imagination. However, it was the first film to present zombies in the form and with the mythology that modern audiences have come to associate with the term. The power of the \"zombie\" concept derives from the relentlessness and inevitably of attack that they represent. Coupling this idea with prospect of being pursued by mutilated, former friends and loved ones, is particularly cruel - and psychologically, very effective. The idea of betrayal permeates the entire film, from the \"zombie\" concept, to the actions of Harry and the fate awaiting Ben. There is also an aspect of paranoia, unintentional (as Romero has stated) or otherwise, which expertly reflects the social climate of the late 1960s and, indeed, of today. Romero expertly manipulates the viewer through a landscape of fear and uncertainty, constantly feeding the tension until the blood begins to flow.George A. Romero and John A. Russo's script is truly a thing of beauty. It is taunt, tight and terrifying. Unlike most horror films of the day, Night Of The Living Dead is grounded in reality. There is no supernatural aspect to the events, indeed, the in-fighting among the group repeatedly emphasises human weakness and moral decay. A ploy which, at the time, must have seemed ground breaking. Their decision not to explain the zombie epidemic is a great one. In fact, my only real complaint about the script is the minor subplot about the Venus probe. It is the only example of the film losing its grounding and falling foul of its bulletproof mythology. Romero and Russo keep their biggest shock for the conclusion and closing credits, which remain an unparalleled reality check for the viewer. Night Of The Living Dead broke the mold and then re-constructed it. The film's sense of realism is further heightened by the wonderful gore effects, Romero's no non-sense approach to direction, the eerie black and white photography and the riveting acting performances.The film's gore and make-up effects still hold up well. Back in the day they must have been absolutely breathtaking. Romero places great emphasis on realism and the scenes of zombies chewing on entrails and flesh are expertly handled. The black and white photography helps to mask the most dated effects and contributes to the film's documentary feel. Romero's direction is incredibly self-assured for a debut. His camera is like a fly on the wall, observing the action. The stillness of the scenes inside the house expertly balances the manic action that takes place outside it. Romero is aided by a fine cast, particularly Duane Jones, Judith O'Dea and Karl Hardman. Judith O'Dea's Barbara is somewhat useless as far as modern heroines are concerned but the sense of shock and hysteria conveyed is convincing, while Karl Hardman's Harry is superbly slimy. The acting standout is Duane Jones as Ben. Duane is simply exemplary. Today, this performance would have shot the actor into superstar territory.Night Of The Living Dead is one of the earliest examples of the modern horror film. It is a link between the more theatrical approach of early horror and the intensity of modern genre films. Night Of The Living Dead's influence can not be overstated - it has been used a blueprint for countless movies. However, very few of them come close to matching this masterpiece.",

Gradually as the characters are introduced within the farmhouse, the film becomes more of a tense thriller, as the zombies are seen less and referred to more. The theme is now the struggle experienced by a group of strangers against an unseen foe. Romero further builds his world by inserting scenes from television broadcasts amidst the character dialog. We know only as much as the television allows us to see, which is all the people in the house are permitted to see.By this point in the film it is feeling more like a stage-play with gripping performances from all the cast, with the drive-in, sci-fi movie feel no longer there. After an hour, the film has convinced us enough what is happening is real and this is when the living dead return into the equation.",

            "content": "This film is very impressive for a first time director on a shoestring budget with a cast this big. My first viewing and it isn't entirely what I was expecting, especially considering the classic status, but ultimately still a good movie.First of all, as my brother and anybody else who I've talked to in real life brings up, most of the performances are not really that good. Duane Jones gets the most screen time and that makes sense considering he is clearly the best actor in the film. Related to that, aside from Jones, the actors feel kind of awkward.Romero seems to have understood the limitations he had with the quality of actors as a good portion of the film has no dialogue, either because it is a fight sequence or just the cast doing tasks while not talking to each other. I personally think this works well enough as this group of strangers try to band together in their effort to survive the dilemma.The best part about this film is what it says about the world it was made in. Unlike many Hollywood films of the time you can feel the cultural climate in which this was made.Romero himself has said he drew his inspiration mostly from \"I am Legend\" (notable that he felt his \"ghouls\" were different enough from the Haitian \"zombies\" that he didn't even call them zombies) and wanted to explore what happens at the beginning of the collapse of civilization. That idea itself is really very interesting and obviously a reflection of the changing of American civilization in 1968. There was growing unrest due to the Vietnam War, Cold War, Civil Rights movement, etc. And imagining what it would look like to try and survive the turmoil and build anew seems like a natural reaction to the climate.The main thing the film wants to talk about is how well we could cope with a restructuring of society. It's pretty obvious Romero's and Russo's thoughts on that and it is no doubt painted by the handling of the attempts to restructure things in the 60's. Social cohesion and government response are clearly reflected as well.I hope to revisit this again eventually (maybe next October). For now I really enjoyed the experience of an independent 60s film.",

            "review_title": "THE Seminal Zombie Flick",
            "content": "It's black and white, and the special effects are primitive, but this is THE seminal zombie film. Like all good horror flicks of its era, it stays compelling through suspenseful storytelling and making its viewers think they saw more gore than they actually did\u0085although some of the cannibalism scenes were more gory than I would have expected for a film of its time.This movie, Romero's feature debut, was made in the true spirit of an independent film. The line between cast, crew, and producers was virtually non-existent, with actors serving as screenwriters, producers, stuntmen, makeup artists, electronic sound engineers, and still photographers. Romero manned the camera himself for some scenes, as well. According to IMDb, Romero borrowed the house in which most of the movie was filmed from an owner who was going to have it demolished anyway. However, the house did not have a true basement, so the basement scenes were filmed in the editing studio's cellar. Romero also borrowed the car featured in the film. To simulate blood, he used\u0085Bosco chocolate syrup.Romero was a Carnegie-Mellon Institute graduate, and, also according to IMDb, this was the first movie filmed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pittburgh police even provided personnel and equipment. The day that the final editing and voice-over dubbing was completed in Pittsburgh, Romero and Russo put the reels into the cans, threw them into the trunk of the car, and drove straight to New York City that night in hopes of having it screen at any willing theater. However, the film's world premiere ended up taking place at the Fulton Theatre in Pittsburgh on October 1, 1968 (At 8PM, admission by invitation only). The movie was met with a standing ovation.Per IMDb, this film became one of the most successful independent films ever made, one of the last big hits of the drive-in era, and one of the first movies added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. Nonetheless, Romero saw very little profit from the film since, thanks to his lack of knowledge regarding distribution deals, the distributors walked away with practically all of the profits. Since the film makers forgot to include a then-required copyright notice in the movie, it slipped into the public domain.This flick is also a great example for discussions concerning African Americans in film. Film historian Donald Bogle believes that most black people in 20th-century American films can be classified into one of five categories: Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies, and Bucks. However, according to IMDb, the character of Ben was originally supposed to be a crude-but-resourceful truck driver, with no specification to race. After Jones, in real-life a self-serious, erudite academic, auditioned for the part, Romero re-wrote the part to fit his performance.Furthermore, the character of Ben was originally written as an angry person, and, upon receiving the role, Jones expressed concern that the character be rewritten to remove some of the anger \u2013 such as the scene where Ben hits Barbara \u2013 afraid of how it would be widely perceived in the United States at the time to see a black man acting in this way. The nation was plagued with high racial tensions during the late sixties, and the film was released to theaters shortly after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Nonetheless, Romero and most of the rest of the predominantly white crew decided against it, thinking they were being \"hip\" by not changing it. Years later, Romero lamented that he had not taken Jones' concerns more into consideration, and thought that he was probably correct. Romero expressed that he wishes he could speak with the late Jones again, asking him how he felt about the film's legendary status, and believes Jones would just say \"Who knew?\" and laugh.For my part, it was pretty cool to see a black man in a 1960s film play such a confident leadership role amongst a white cast. It seemed to me that the part of Ben could have been played by an actor of any race, as long as he was good, and Jones performed very well.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out www.livemancave.com",

            "content": "When I first saw Night of the Living Dead, I was about 17 or 18, and 5 years on, and about 30-40 odd horror flicks later, if you ask me what the best horror movie I ever saw was, Night of the Living Dead is still right there, the only answer in my mind. Yes, Psycho is more artistically shot, yes, the Shining is more epic, but nothing matches the sheer raw atmosphere or impact of this giant among movies.As is often the case, it's much harder to write coherently what makes a movie great than explain a movie's minor flaws, but I'll try my best to explain why I think this is such a wonderful film. For a start, the movie's rough, untouched look was a stark contrast with the glossy look of films that were coming out of Hollywood at the time. Look across at The Italian Job, made around the same time, and the movies are like different worlds. Shot in grainy undoctored black and white, NotLD has a brutal, almost documentary feel that's rarely been improved upon, and makes the horror immediate and tangible.The way the movie looks counts for a part of its impact, but the movie's taut, knife-edge atmosphere, jarring shocks and brutal violence count for the rest. Simply put, Night of the Living Dead eats movies like the Ring whole and spits out their bones, even all these years on. From the first zombie attack right through to the chilling, unexpected climax, it has you by the throat and refuses to let go. Even by today's standards, this is a violent, chilling ride that you won't soon forget. Parts of this movie are still absolutely horrifying, and scenes like the zombie child turning on her mother are so intense and visceral that no studio nowadays would dream of allowing them. Basically, this movie is horrific, resonant and just downright nasty, and you won't be able to shake any of it from your mind, which is just how a horror movie should be.Personally, I can't think of a movie more worthy of the title of 'ultimate horror movie' and I know people will dispute that, and you're welcome to do so as this is just one man's opinion, but Night of the Living Dead will always be my choice. I don't think indie horror, or indeed film itself would have been the same without it, and I'm damned if it isn't still one of the scariest films I've ever seen.",

I don't know how it ends, who lives, if anyone, or if it has a 'happy' ending, ie; are the zombies dispatched back to the grave and the world made safe once again?This horror flick, and it IS truly horrifying, is the most frightening reel of celluloid ever made in my experience. I get about as far as the point where the girl and the black guy are trapped in the farm house with the zombies scratching and groaning at the doors and windows. I invariably and automatically hit 'stop' when the first one ends up IN the house with them. I just can't take it. It may have something to do with living alone and wondering what is thumping around in the dark downstairs at 3 am (it's usually the cat).I give this movie a 10 because it is the greatest of its genre, which is low-budget, acted by total amateurs from the local technical college or something and filmed in grainy black and white in absolutely real and recognizable places, like the old farm houses that dot the landscape in my neck of the woods and old cemeteries out in the middle of nowhere.It's a dreadful experience and highly recommended for those with perhaps less imagination and stronger stomachs.A crunch and chomp fest for the connoisseurs of gore amongst you.",

The movie is done with poor instructions and budgets, and this enlarge his qualities for the fact that is more incredible how Romero obtained certain effect and because this makes the atmosphere more anxious and obscure.One of the most interesting thing is the fact that Romero use the zombie world to talk about living beings: escaping from zombies became a sort of re-creation of society (where all human conventions are abandoned, for example the lack of trust in a black man, that also created a lot of polemics when the movie was published), in a home without comfort and with the necessity of a hierarchy or at least of an social order. People that are out of this order risk to be taken by the zombie.But the plot is not so optimistic and also the main character, that can resist until the end and defeat the zombie, is exchanged by a zombie by the policemen and killed. The point of arrival is the transportation of zombie system also in human beings still in live, and in them world made of violence and untrustworthy.",

Night of the Living Dead isn't just a horror film, it's a story about survival, about what men are capable of doing when they are in knife-edge situations. Romero does a great job with his movie, and he injects such power and relentless suspense to the flick that when you watch it, you fell like you are inside that house with those people, you fell every fright, every danger, every terror that those people on the film are facing.Another great point of the story is that you got believable, real characters, those people react at the situation the same way you or me would react. It's the same thing that John Boorman made with Deliverance, he putted ordinary people in extraordinary situations and simply showed what would happen to us on the same situation. The claustrophobic settings, the terrific performances (all of the main actors are great.

I think most everyone there realized they had seen something historic.They had.Growing up in the Sixties, I liked horror movies. Horror movies starred Vincent Price or Peter Cushing. They were set in castles. Girls in low-cut nightgowns fled down hallways. Outside, it was always thunderstorms. There was a secret passage.

Romero's birthday late, lol.It's truly a testament to how well made this was that it still is even sometimes effective to this day.This was released at the heat of a social movement in America in which black people were pushing for more freedom and rights so casting Duane Jones, a black man in the lead role was a huge deal once people saw the film;Being as this was actually a B-Movie at the time of its release and still technically is a B-Movie.First let me start with where it hasn't aged too well. Some of the acting isn't the greatest and Barbara is sometimes quite annoying in just how useless she is portrayed however that's the extent of where my issues lie with the film as the rest is quite good.The Black and White limitation that Romero had to work with I personally find works in its favour as the gore effects are more shocking and even disturbing at times with the absence of color.The film has the iconic Cemetery Scene with what is one of the greatest and most well known film quotes of all time, \"They're Coming to get you Barbara...\" which can still be spine tingling today under the right circumstances.Now it's the ending,which is the reason why this film was such a monumental success in spite of its low budget. The Ghouls (they weren't called zombies in the original film) break into the house and everyone starts getting picked off, the house collapses and Ben,played by Duane Jones is the only survivor of the incident. A rescue party consisting of white people, including some cops if I'm not mistaken find him and even though he wasn't bitten or anything, shoot him dead which acted as a statement on how black people were viewed.It's still a great film that holds up very well, especially considering it came out in the late sixties.Now, do I need to recommend this one?",

After Ben knocks the fourth zombie out the door, a truly horrifying reveal shot shows half a dozen more zombies coming ominously into the background.2. The ghastly stabbing sequence features what may be the most disturbing scream EVER.3. Zombies eating Tom and Judy's remains - definitely stomach-churning.4. Ben shooting the zombie again and again, and the creepy music that accompanies it.5. The incredibly cool still-photo credits sequence - an antidote for all those horror movies that end with a heavy metal song and/or the possibility of a sequel.",

            "content": "In 1968 George A. Romero released what is arguably the greatest horror film of all time, Night of the Living Dead.  This movie also involved Bill Hinzman in a small role as the \"cemetery zombie\" and Tom A. Russo as co-writer of the original screenplay.Go forward in time 30 years, Tom A. Russo and a now overweight Bill Hinzman for devise a terrible idea--augmenting a 30-year-old film with newly shot footage and enitrely redoing the original music score.  Enter the Anton LaVey wannabe Scott Vladimir Licina for the soundtrack, which sounds like it was composed on a Casio keyboard by a 13-year-old.  Licina also pollutes the movie with a the most pathetic excuse for acting I have ever seen. Also, when does your average 1960's Pennsylvanian minister look like the leader of the Church of Satan?  Hinzman is reprised in the movie in the role of the \"cemetery zombie\", however, his classic visage is ruined by age and weight, the burning eyes and hollow cheeks have vanished over the years.\nRusso and Hinzman justify tampering with the movie for the same reasons George Lucas gave for Star Wars--a lack of original resources and funding. However, no amount of money or personell can recreate a classic film to the level of its original.In summary, aside from the origninal footage (minus the new score), this film comes off like a high school video project.  Russo and Hinzman have done an injustice to NOTLD fans everywhere.  Avoid this at all costs, unless you're looking for chuckle from some horrible acting and music.",

            "content": "Zombies have always have an odd effect on me. Vampires, werewolves, and Frankenstein never scared me, but there is something about zombies that always sends me cringing in fear. Maybe it's the fact that they're everywhere...where ever you turn, there they are, ready to devour you, and after they eat you alive, you get up and become one of them. And maybe it's the fact that they're so slow...vampires you never see coming. Frankenstein (in the original book) was fast and cunning. But zombies are slow, and you watch them gather around you and there's nothing you can do about it. Or maybe it's the fact that they're still decaying, even though they're after you and they look at least a little alive.Regardless, zombies always make me shudder with fear. And this is the film that started it all. This was the film that showed zombies as what they are considered now: flesh-eating and unable to be killed unless shot in the head. In the history of horror films, there were four famous and classic zombie movies: this one, it's two sequels, \"Dawn of the Dead\" and \"Day of the Dead,\" and 1980's \"Zombie.\" However, of the other two, none of them were as influential as this one. Telling the story of seven diverse people trapped in a farmhouse as the dead gather around them outside, it soon presents what the viewer already knows: they're worst enemies are each other! One is African American, and there's a racist man against him. One has been bitten by a zombie and is slowly transforming. One is a vegetable....having seen her brother attacked by a zombie and freaked out. Then there's the strong-willed mother and the two, star-crossed lovers. All in all, they're a motely group, and each of them stand for something different in this film, whether it be ignorance, innocence, heroism, or immense evil.This film was ahead of its time, both socially and gore-wise. It lauched the popularity of B-movies...never has a low-budget film so successful. A strange, cult-gathering has arisen from this film, but that's hardly surprising. It is a classic, and maybe the greatest horror film of all time. With its nasty zombie makeup, the who-will-survive plot, and an especially twisted ending, it is not to be missed. Without a doubt, it is one of George Romero's finest!There was a remake in 1990 with a little more ideas introduced and a stronger cast (though the cast here is still good), though it wasn't nearly as good, which is odd because of its large budget and gross-out effects. Low budget and cheap just sometimes works better for certain films...giving it an especially creepy atmosphere (just another thing this film proved that later films tried to mimic).",

            "content": "I recall seeing Night of the Living Dead on Halloween Night, 1983 when MTV celebrated its fifteen year anniversary. For the first time, I was exposed to this cheesy, yet dark and bleak horror movie. Most people know the story. Barbara (Judith O'Dea) is visiting her mother's grave with her brother, Johnny. While there, they are attacked by a zombie. She escapes to a small farm house where she meets Ben (Duane Jones). Barabara has lost her faculties so it is up to Ben to board up the windows and doors as the flesh eating zombies multiply. They finally meet some other residents who have been holding up in the basement. This includes Tom (Keith Wayne) and his wife, and the nefarious Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman). At this point, Ben and Harry fight amongst themselves as well as the living dead. Yes, the dialog is cheesy, the acting is bearable (if that), and some of the scenes shot were high-school level. What made this work (I think) is the bleak and dark outlook. The black and white cinematography adds a frightening despair. This is especially evident in the last third of the film when all hell literally breaks loose. This is not really scary - as in zombies popping up around the corner or out of the shadows. Director George A. Romero rather goes for the claustrophobia and despair. His photography of zombies moving in and out of light and darkness renders humans as monsters. It literally shakes the audience on a thinking level that will carry on for a day, week or month. This makes the movie more frightening. I am glad Romero learned from his novice experience. His vision and work only got better from here.",

I quickly scan the back of the case and see that it's the re-released edition, but, hey, I figure, it's probably just digitally remastered.  So, I buy it, and I take it home, and as I am about to watch it, I see a little box of text on the back of the video that I hadn't bothered to read before.  And, of course, this text is talking about how Russo et al have gone back and, uh oh, filmed and added \"over 15 minutes of NEW footage?!\".  WITHOUT THE HELP OF GEORGE ROMERO!!!??  I think I must have read that piece of text about 12 times, hoping that I was misreading it and they had just gone back and added deleted scenes from the original filming, or at least FOR THE LOVE OF GOD had Romero help out.  My heart dropped through the floor, and lower still when I saw that they had changed the opening scene! THE OPENING SCENE!  HAVE these people no souls!  Or perhaps no brains.  I suffered through the boring and unnecessary new footage and decided to give this new version a chance.  But I just couldn't, what with the glaring anachronisms (the goateed preacher, the not really very sixties sounding dialogue, etc.) and the fact that the preacher character bore an uncanny resemblance to Weird Al Yankovic.

For the time period this movie came out, I can imagine the controversy and backlash it got. I can appreciate that the director and producers decided to break racial barriers and cast a black man as one of the lead roles. And the fact that it opened many doors in the horror cinematic universe. But, otherwise, it is very lackluster. Especially at the end when I thought that Ben would manage to get help. Only for the officers to shoot him right in the forehead. Very anticlimactic. It does not hold weight to the horror movies of today.

He (I believe it was a he, might have been a she) went to see what was expected to be another \"horror\" film in the family fare vein.  All was going well until the ressurected dead began, on camera, to chomp on the living.  He noted the whoops and shrieks of the audience in the scenes leading up to the flesh noshing; fun whoops, party shrieks.  But when the meat eating began, the audience, he noted, went dead silent.Silent.And that was the moment.  One of those moments when everything changes.  One of those moments when all that has come before reluctantly retreats from what is to come.  There is no going back.  The bar has been raised.  If this is fun, we have to redefine fun.  If this entertainment we have to redefine it as well.  If this is horror, it's off in a new and uncomfortable direction.The movie dates poorly and as much as I love it, I know it doesn't compete well in a modern list of horror films.

            "content": "Night of the Living Dead is a great film, I actually have very few actual critiques of it.Its opening scene is one of the best in horror.Its black and white color creates plenty of atmosphere.The nighttime setting also adds to the atmosphere as well.As well as the fact this is one of the first extremely violent mainstream movies.It's shot very well and all of this combined creates an intense film.The zombie effects look good as the black and white color of the film covers up most of the flaws.They look far better than most of Dawn Of the Deads blue zombies, I think that film would ultimately look better if it was made in black and white.The story is basically a trapped-in-a-house story.It's also a reversal of I am Legends story, it takes a lot of influence from it as well as The last man on Earth, its first film adaptation.The cause of the outbreak is actually meant to be ambiguous. Never really confirming any theory. When you die you become a zombie in this franchise so avoiding the unrealistic outbreak from bitten victims. Zombies eat their victims so ultimately only the people who get away become zombies, also small numbers of zombies are easily killed off without the risk of infecting yourself.Movie Zombies are basically a derivative of vampires. But in actual fact, they're not really zombies, they're ghouls. The film even calls them ghouls.It's basically I Am Legend but at the beginning of the Apocalypse instead of at the end. Switching out the biological vampires with ghouls.This is why the Living Dead trilogy is named night, Dawn, and day.These movies all have the same plot but often explore different themes.The reason I consider Night the best movie of the three is that it's the most original.The films are actually incredibly cynical and pessimistic, ultimately what causes the fall of the human race is an internal psychological conflict.Night and the other films show that when humans work together the zombies are easily defeated.Zombies are simply us without the internal conflicts that cause division, they ultimately work together so they succeed. Zombies only eat the living.In Night the fall of the group is completely internal. The internal conflict is mostly driven by who is right. Neither of these two characters wants to admit that they are wrong, which ultimately creates the internal conflict in the group that tears it apart.I'd argue that both are wrong and right at different times.Harry is right in the short term.The basement is the safest place in the house.That hiding there is actually the best strategy.The zombies are attracted to the house because of the light and sound.Ultimately the government is wrong about these safety zones because there will be so many people going to them, and it will be chaos. Your home is actually a lot safer. Dawn of the Dead even said so.Just because someone's a dick doesn't mean they're not right.He's wrong mostly in his approach and attitude, he wants to boss people around and tell people what to do. Ultimately he's a control freak, the problem with that is it doesn't get people to listen to you.Also, the fact that reinforcing the upstairs is probably a pretty good idea, the upstairs is your only source of information and food.Ben is wrong in the short term but in the long term is right.They're going to have to leave the house because they're going to run out of food.His plan would have worked if they all went down in the basement for a few days as very few zombies would have gathered around the house.Working together they could have reinforced the upstairs so the zombies couldn't get in.The problem is that he's the main character so ultimately we're biased toward his point of view even though he's wrong quite often. Which leads to many bad interpretations of this film. He's the far more likable one but that doesn't make him correct.I think Barbara is critiqued way too often ultimately because she's in shock and most people lock up like her. She just saw her brother get killed so it's pretty natural for her to act this way, not all male characters are Rambo so why do all female characters need to be?Tom is actually the most reasonable one, willing to compromise and accept the ideas of others. He is probably the best candidate for the leader.Helen actually tells you the themes of the film, saying something like this, you just have to be right.I'd argue that most of these characters are not extremely three-dimensional but ultimately they are perfectly acceptable.I'd say the characters in Dawn of the Dead are better as they're more likable.I also think it has the best tone of the three. Dawn is often too light and Day is way more depressing. It's dark but not so dark that it's depressing.The ending is great, when humans do work together most of the time they kill people or things they perceive as different and ultimately a threat to them just like the zombies.It's a solid 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "Yes, I know there are zombie movies that were created before Night of the Living Dead. But none of them defined the genre until this one. This remains the epitome of low budget, B movie horror flicks. The reason became obvious to me as I watched through it. Newer updates or clones may have better special effects, a stronger plot, or even better acting; but they lack the complex messages and themes that flow through the 1968 version of Night of the Living Dead.Things start when a typical woman, Barbra, visits a cemetery with her brother. An unstable, groaning man walks up and attacks them. Barbra flees and takes refuge in a nearby house, which soon becomes a gathering place for other frightened humans. Unfortunately, they become surrounded by a mob of zombies. From that point, practically the whole story takes place inside or close to the building. There are also a few television news segments that describe the mysterious circumstances on a national scale, which is very effective for building up suspense.Technically, the film is a B movie, and it shows. The plot has its share of inconsistencies and holes, but these are overshadowed by the interesting situations. The acting is not particularly good, although this might stem from the fact that none of the characters are likable (with the slight exception of Tom, who unfortunately plays a small role). I felt that, to a degree, it was necessary for the characters to be flawed. They are supposed to reflect the average population that we could compare to; as much as we would like to imagine all movie characters to be heroes, it just would not work. It is important for building the film's message about society.I have heard complaints that Night of the Living Dead is too dated to be effective anymore, but I did not find that to be the case. The atmosphere it created was chilling and disturbing. I do not recall laughing a single time after the first five minutes, which is rare for these older low budget films.I recommend Night of the Living Dead for anyone with even a minute interest in horror films. It seems like a movie that can satisfy both the general audience and the people searching for a more complex message. It has its share of unavoidable problems; but in the end, you are left remembering the good things.",

            "content": "\"Night of the Living Dead\" is the greatest horror film of all time, and probably the most important one of the last 50 years. Much of the time, groundbreaking films are not particularly remarkable artistically-- they simply get by on doing something that had never been done before. NotLD is a particularly glaring exception because it is so effortlessly and organically transgressive. A film like \"Last House on the Left\" seems to exist exclusively for the purpose of pushing the audience to the edge, but NotLD never announces that it is a new, darker sort of horror film. One gets the impression that Romero and Russo and all the others didn't even specifically intend to make a more graphic horror film when they started out. It appears almost normal, initially, but moves inexorably towards the horrific conclusion, at all points defying the expectations as to who ought to survive, or whether or not bravery or cowardice ought to be rewarded. It never feels self-conscious or scripted, and that's why it holds up so well even after it is no longer a particularly morbid or gruesome film. Despite the supernatural elements, NotLD is disturbingly authentic.Horror films tend not to be to big on plot, and \"Night of the Living Dead\" is no exception. It is your standard zombie apocalypse plot, though, of course, no such thing existed at the time. Most modern zombie films take the action-horror route along with an urban setting, but NotLD is pure horror, and takes place inside a desolate farmhouse out in the Pennsylvania countryside. As the film opens we are introduced to Barbara and Johnny, brother and sister. These are characters we've seen before: Barbara is snippety and uptight, and seems to be well on her way to becoming an old spinster. Johnny feels like the hero, and he'd probably feel at home in a 50's Sci-Fi or Horror flick, as he's whiny and jokey and teases his sister. Still, he seems to have a good, courageous heart, however, as he immediately comes to his sisters aid after she's assailed by a strange man in the graveyard. But Oops! Johnny gets his brains bashed in only a few minutes into the film. And though she's technically alive Barbara is more or less out for the count for the rest of the film, and mostly lounges about in a nearly catatonic stupor.Barbara flees to an apparently abandoned farm house, and we are shortly introduced to the films real hero, Ben, played by Duane Jones. The acting in the film isn't exactly terrific, but Jones is good as Ben, and helps create one of the most appealing protagonists in all film. He's smart and capable but certainly not a saint-- Notice how he decks the hysterical Barbara after she slaps him during her vain attempt to get them to search for the now very dead Johnny. Much has been made out of the fact that he's black. Romero will tell you that this means nothing, or nothing more than that Jones was the best actor they could find for the part, regardless of race. Again, the roots of NotLD's greatness are exposed-- They were neither conforming to nor defying tradition. They simply made it their way.The core of the film is not especially eventful: Ben works to barricade the house, and eventually argues with the unexpected tenants in the basement, two couples and one child. These scenes show that Romero really knew what he was doing from the very beginning, and that his experience in industrial films and commercials wasn't wasted. The film somehow maintains a slightly hypnotic intensity in the section as Ben seals of the house while the all to calm radio announcer drones on and on in a hopeless attempt to get a grip on the whole extraordinary situation. Romero keeps the camera moving and the editing sharp so that even after over 10 viewing my mind never wanders in this seemingly uneventful section of the film. (This is a good description of the visual style of the film in general, as it is far from flashy and very realistic, but still energetic enough that it never really feels flat.) And then there is, of course, Ben's dramatic monologue about his first encounter with the \"things\". This scene has been surpassed a few times in later films, like \"Jaws\" or \"28 Days Later\", but it still holds up very well.Eventually, the majority of the farmhouse's residents determine that it's best not to simply wait around for help, and plan a fairly reasonable escape. Suffice to say, things do not go well. I don't want to go into too many specific as it'll hurt the film, but this part is really quite brilliant. Their plan seems really quite reasonable on the face of it, but it proves disastrous. Fate and human error intervene, and we a treated to one of the earliest gore scenes you'll ever see outside of an H.G. Lewis film, as the ghouls feed on charred remains while ominous, amelodic electronic music drones on in the background. Again, this isn't remarkably gruesome by modern day standards, but it's probably the creepiest zombie-feast scene ever filmed.Shortly after this things spiral out of control between the survivors, and all hell break's loose, leading up to one of the greatest endings in all film. Again, I won't go into specifics, but it's just such a classic, senselessly tragic endings. It's been knocked off many times, but the ending here still has the sorta authenticity that you find in all the rest of the film. This isn't a morose, violent ending that a supposedly edgy director stuffed on to prove how far he'd push boundaries This is just they way it happened to turn out. Just a great film.",

Zombie based films and shows are very hit or miss for me. I knew that going into but still had my expectations low. But this blew me away. I loved the small setting. It really made the tension and danger of the film feel so much more intense. I think the characters are great (especially Ben who was played by Duane Jones). I think there is some social commentary there if the viewers chooses to see it. I know Romero says he did not mean it. But art is in the eye of the beholder.

The main character is also a big positive for the film and he's also very well acted by Duane Jones. But unfortionally, I couldn't care less about the other characters. And while I can respect all of the Zombie rules that were introduced in this movie, I'm not scared by them here.

I also missed some of the original music score, replaced in key scenes with a synthetic piece of ridiculous filler that even Albert Pyun would have scrapped on a bad day.

Nearly every zombie movie you have ever seen or will ever see is thanks to this. Night Of The Living Dead is not my favourite zombie movie, it's in black & white, it's not gory, the zombies don't look too much like zombies thanks to the black & white, the woman Barbra is annoying, the music is really bad and too loud in places BUT i like it. It has a story, it has a little suspense, it is a teeny weeny bit scary, good acting especially by Duane Jones who's character Ben is fantastic who is the exact opposite of the really irritating Barbra and makes the viewer feel safe watching this as he really is the kind of guy you would want to be around in such a crisis as this because this man knows how to take charge and keep his head in a very bad situation. I do actually prefer the 1990 remake and would love to hop over to the Night Of The Living Dead (1990) board and do a review there but i haven't seen that one in years and i want to do a really great review (which it deserves) while it's still fresh in my mind.

            "content": "1968's \"Night Of The Living Dead\" was harshly bashed by several film critics when it was released, but has over the years gained cult and classic status. The film was somewhat radical in its era of release with its gore, nudity (a naked female ghoul), and adult language. It was released in an era in which gore wasn't common in too many movies, nudity was mainly in nudie cutie films, and adult language was just starting to be spoken in mainstream films. This true horror movie has the recently dead becoming animate, and seeking the flesh of the living to feed on. Six people fight for their lives and fight among each other in an isolated farmhouse, which became their refuge from the flesh-eating ghouls. The characters must decide the best ways to prevent and survive attacks by the ghouls, and possible plans of escaping the farmhouse. The living dead become more aggressive as the night goes on, and an attack on the farmhouse seems imminent. \"Night Of The Living Dead\" has many grim and creepy moments from the beginning to the end of the film. The film is in black and white, which greatly helps create a dark and creepy mood. The black and white also greatly enhances the isolated mood of the countryside, cemetery, etc. The film does an excellent job creating an atmosphere of isolation, and many viewers have felt the film has a claustrophobic feel to it. The selected library music excellently helps with creating moods. The lighting helps cast shadows, and the sound effects of crickets make the film seem more realistic. \"Night Of The Living Dead\" contains many great sound effects, and the ghouls themselves make creepy vocal noises at times. The emergency broadcasts on radio and television give another realistic touch to the film. The photography contains interesting close-ups and angles, and the photograph ending is quite effective and unusual; especially when it switches from the photographs to a short scene of a bonfire. The acting is mostly realistic with Judith O'Dea, Duane Jones, and Marilyn Eastman turning in very good performances. Karl Hardman's character seems to have been written a bit off, and it is rare to see a non-villain this disagreeable in life or in a film. However, Karl plays his character well. Most of the dialogue seems to fit the film well. \"Night Of The Living Dead\" was released a bit before the MPAA's ratings went into effect, and would most likely receive the R rating for violence and gore. There are mild scenes of a nude female ghoul walking around the farmhouse with the other ghouls, and the adult language is also mild. It is a film that seems to have a balance of drama, terror, and exploitation. \"Night Of The Living Dead\" is not a perfect film, but I have found it to be a film worth repeat viewings. The film has effected me more with each viewing, and is full of memorable and haunting images.",

It's like, you expect the zombie to eat her or something and suddenly she comes slowly to stab her for several times.

Featuring a prophetic subplot about a raving preacher.The Review: The old adage: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Well, if it isn't broken, why do you add scenes that are just a waste of time? Russell Streiner, co-star and producer of the original helped produce these scenes that just don't add up. The score, however, is terrific by adding an even creepier vibe to the film. Unfortunately, the newly added scenes feel contrived and implicate that of a direct to video feel. One particular notice is a ridiculous subplot involving a ranting preacher whom you wish would end up getting devoured by the zombies. The scenes try to add a backstory to the illustrious first zombie that we see in the beginning, but it just doesn't seem to work. If you love the original, then don't see the 30th anniversary, because key scenes are eliminated from the film, and replaced by scenes that should've remained on the cutting room floor.The Original: A The 30th Anniversary Edition: D",

On his first few attempts he told the owners that it was a film about zomboids munching human flysh and flesh- understandably most were horrified by this plot and spat in his face. Romeo, being an intelligent, bearded gentleman knew that he would have to lie in order for his film to be shown. He began to tell people it was about a group of dancers called the Living Dead who were from 'the streets' and had to fight prejudice and poverty just so they could dance together. A heartwarming story, it featured the tag line 'They're coming to get down, Barbara!' The main character is a shy girl who learns what it is to live, love, and dance and ends up having the time of her life, like she's never felt before. The Living Dead recruit her by repeatedly dancing on her lawn and banging on her doors and windows- she tries to keep them out, but you can't stop the groove, baby!. The beats get more intense, the clothes get more lesser, and soon she succumbs to the ancient art of waving your arms and legs about. The group scrape together enough money to enter the (arm)Pittsburgh dance contest and finally get a stage on which they can showcase their talents. After rough treatment from rich rival dance troupe, Kobra Kyle, they find a wizened old trainer called Mr Umaga. Through him getting them to paint his house, wax his carts, clean his many chimbleys etc they learn valuable life lessons which will ensure they can form important social relationships and gain self confidence when they eventually start employment. Suffice to say, the film has a wonderfully tender ending as the group, just as it looks like they have thrown away the final dance, manage to pull off the mythic 5 metre Qwop twirl dance move and get a 10 from Brucie. Paralleled with the Vietnam war which was entertaining America at the time, Romeo's impressive social commentary manages to convey the joyous spirit of the time- before there was mistrust, before there was paranoia, and when everyone loved each other regardless of the colour of their skin, or the ugly of their face.Best Scene: The naked zomboid ass.",

I hadn't liked this film for a while because I thought it was some overrated midnight garbage that was good for one or two viewings.  In other words, I put it in the same category as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.  But I was wrong.  Still, I had to view it three or four times to REALLY view it. It's such an excellent film that it deserves its place along with other cult classics like DAWN OF THE DEAD and THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and that crowd.  From start to finish, we're taken on an eerie trip through the Pennsylvanian backwoods and into a horror that could only be imagined.  Why are they coming back to life?  Is it radiation poisoning?  What is it?  It's just a haunting trip that, though not nearly as entertaining as its sequel, is still very deserving of its 7.5/10 user rating.  NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was made on a shoestring budget, and it shows, but who REALLY cares? Distributed by hundreds of video companies because not one company had the license to distribute it, in other words, there was no copyright proprietor. And in 1986, Hal Roach Studios released a colorized version which I own but I'm scared of seeing because it probably looks like cr*p.  The 30th Anniversary released by Anchor Bay wasn't as bad as people say and it was also enjoyable.  ****out of****Bring this film to your Halloween Party this year, I guarantee you won't be disappointed!",

A full generation before THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, this film stunned audiences around the world with it's unrelenting horror and suspense. It was literally unlike anything made for it's time.The high-grain black and white film stock, the claustrophobic lighting, the half-cliched stock music and near-amateur acting all add to the film's quality. Yes, it was made on a budget better suited for a TV commercial, but it was made against the odds (and the established film system), becoming one of the most successful independent features ever!The plot revolves around a terrified group of people hiding out in a farmhouse in rural Pennsylvania as the countryside is over-run by flesh-eating zombies, re-animated by an exploding atomic-powered space probe. As the time progresses, the atmosphere becomes more and more intense, and the film's starkness of quality becomes it's strongest asset.\nOne of the first regionally produced feature films (all the production funds came from the Pittsburgh area), this has become the cornerstone upon which today's horror film industry has been built. It's the grand-daddy of them all (The Great-grandaddy being NOSFERATU)!WARNING: There has been a version of this film marketed as the \"30th Anniversary Edition\" that includes added sequences that were filmed MUCH later than this film.

            "content": "Screen Riot Score - 4.5/10Lost InnocenceWhen George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead arrived in theaters, it was shocking, to say the least. At that time horror films were laughable and a joy for all to watch, especially children. Little did we know that in less than two hours, the horror film genre's innocence would be forever lost.A month into its existence, the MPAA rating system was only getting started. Viewers relied on local committees to rate the movies they watched. Most of these groups passed movies if there was no nudity. So, unsuspecting moviegoers munched on Cracker Jacks and guzzled down sodas, unaware of the horror that lay before them.A Normal OpeningThe film welcomed audiences with a typical opening scene in a cemetery. Johnny (Russell Streiner) and Barbara (Judith O'Dea), siblings, are visiting their father's grave. A ghoul attacks the pair with typical ghoul-like movements, of the time. Protecting his sister, Johnny dies, allowing Barbara to escape to a nearby farmhouse.Joining her is Ben (Duane Jones), who begins barricading the windows and doors. Barbara, unable to help, stares on with fear. The pair are then surprised when a group emerges from the basement. Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judith (Judith Ridley) are a teen couple hiding there. With them are Harry (Karl Hardman) and Helen Cooper (Marilyn Eastman). The latter also have their unconscious daughter, Karen (Kyra Schon), in tow, who has a ghoul bite.Human BarbecueThe action picks up when a TV news broadcast convinces the group to leave the house and escape to safety. Tom and Judith, assisted by Ben and Harry, make it to Ben's truck and drive to the farm's gas pump. This turns out to be an ill-fated attempt. Ben keeps the ghouls at bay with his torch but lights the truck on fire by accident. The truck explodes, killing the teens. Slowly, the ghouls make their way to the human barbecue and begin eating their flesh. They gnaw on the freshly cooked couple like it's just another day.The real-life audience is no longer gorging themselves on snacks. They watch in silence, as Karen turns into a ghoul and kills her father. They turn away as she then takes a cement trowel to her mother's chest stabbing her mercilessly until she dies. Ben barricades himself in the basement and kills the girl and a reanimated Harry who has also turned into a ghoul.The next morning Ben hears the commotion of a rescue party and exits the basement. Unfortunately, the rescuers mistake him for a ghoul and kill him through an open window.Critical on the CriticsOur score of 4.5 considers the movie's place in history and its low-budget filmmaking. Just because a film had a low budget, it is not excused from its many issues. Bad acting, poor sound mixing, and a subpar script depreciate the quality of the movie. Many modern audiences won't watch films with this many problems.Duane Jones and Karl Hardman are the only decent actors. The rest of the cast needs significant improvement. The sound mix is awful. Throughout the movie, birds, crickets, and other ambient noises drowned out the dialog. This is not how to mix a film. No aspiring filmmaker should look at this mix for inspiration. The script would not survive in modern times. For the 1968 audience, it was fine but modern audiences expect more. We expect dialog to flow and mirror real life. This script does neither.Yet, we cannot ignore the film's place in horror movie history and cult status. Romero's script and creature development created our modern zombie lore. So ingrained is this that films that try to change the classic style rarely move on to more than one picture.Critics will always love Night of the Living Dead and are largely responsible for its cult following. We do not love it like the others. Over the last 50 plus years, this movie has been positively critiqued thousands of times, leaving no room for argument in most circles. But, as a fan of the show, you know you get an honest review from the guys at Screen Riot regardless of what others think.Enjoyed this Review?

            "content": "First off; this refers to the original 1968 theatrical version and not the bastardized (so-called) 30th anniversary edition. (On that edition, 15 minutes are cut; and 15 minutes of pointless 'newly filmed' material is added that is insulting to the whole 'DEAD' storyline that undermines the entire worldwide apocalyptic horror). For one of the few times in horror movie history; the phrase \"there's no where to run\" means...well; there's really no place to run. They're Everywhere!!!Second! The transfer! I was absolutely floored by the high quality THX transfer from Elite Entertainment's Millennium Edition. If you haven't seen this film on this particular DVD transfer, then (unfortunately) any comment on the poor black and white film quality is in error. The blacks and grays are rich, the lights have a sharp contrast; in short: it is the best quality version of this film I've ever seen. I don't recall the film looking this good even at the theater back when I sat quaking to it in the early 70's (70 or 71). And all this time I was suspicious that this was shot in 16mm. Thank You Public Domain for all the greedy distributors making the fast (unearned) buck and depriving the rest of the world who were ripped off from seeing this movie the way it was meant to be seen.Third! The Movie! It's still scary after all these years (aided by this DVD transfer) and arguably the scariest of the three ('Dawn' and 'Day of'). Its low budget is its asset (rare in a horror flick) and its approach to the mounting terror via radio and TV broadcasts that reveals the catastrophe on a global level is achieved with stark realism. A few shocks; then a slow buildup to its ripping climax; let's face it: today's directors don't have the guts (or intelligence) to tackle such an approach without feeling an obligation to standardize their story with \"blood and guts every 16 minutes\". This story feels real; the characters react realistically (even with spotty acting) and the audience is carried away to horror heaven.In hindsight and ironically; our hero Ben's well intentioned but short sighted plan is another tragedy. If only everyone believed and listened to poor misunderstood Harry, who had a true sense of what the 'house of seven' were up against. It is a symbol of the collapse, caused by human arrogance that is another staple that brings about the characters' downfall: a downfall that will continue to escalate in \"Dawn of the Dead\" and reach rock bottom in \"Day of the Dead\".The One That Started It All! Justifiably; and for good reason! And for once...I'm not sure I can recommend popcorn to munch on while watching. There'll be enough \"munching\" taking place on screen that could curdle anyone's butter coating.Bring on Romero's \"Land of the Dead\"!",

Russo's insertion of new footage has none of the visual style and editing sense of Romero's, and stands out in a most obvious manner, like scenes from the cheapest direct-to-video production. The re-scoring completely negates the 40s horror film feel the movie has always enjoyed, again making it seem like the recent DTV release that it's become. And the re-editing  of both scenes and audio is jarring and sloppy. Plus which, the DVD's sound is occasionally out of sinc! The added plot point concerning the preacher who survives getting bit was an interesting idea, if badly presented. And the new stereo sound effects are effective here and there. However, the notion that this version may one day replace the original in the view of the general public is by far the scariest thing about this release. I doubt it will, but look at what happened to Star Wars.",

The only nice thing I can say about the movie is that the decision to make it in black and white was the correct one. There are few scenes that would have been too gross in color. Also, grossness is not horror. If you watch a war picture for example and see a body get blown apart, that is not horror, that is just being gross.The ending was particularly bad.

The horrors of \"Night of the Living Dead\" may have lost some of their punch owing to nearly forty years worth of even more gruesome films, but they're still deeply unsettling\u0097for me, one of the creepiest scenes is the one in which the female zombie walks into a tree and starts gnawing on the bark as mechanically and relentlessly as a relentless great white shark chomping on whatever chance refuse comes in its path.The film also anticipates the essential pessimism of many of the more memorable seventies horror films such as \"Last House on the Left\" and \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\" In the fifties pictures, whatever havoc might have been caused by the mutant horrors there was always a clear return to normalcy, usually courtesy of a earnest, strong jawed hero. Heroics prove as futile as cowardice in \"The Night of the Living Dead\"\u0097Ben's attempts to barricade the house are admirable, but in the end, before the onset of hundreds of ghouls prove just as ineffective as the obnoxious Harry said they would. Perhaps the bleakest and most cynical feature of this film is the suggestion at the end that only the actions of a brutal, trigger-happy militia may possibly end the zombie threat.(As for the slow versus fast moving ghoul debate: I prefer the slow ones\u0097as the sheriff says, they're dead and messed up after all!)",

Yes, the plot is creepy, and NOTLD is a landmark in horror films, but still there are just moments when this movie is just plain boring. But I do have to comment on how good I thought the acting was. Every actor played their character great, except for Barbara's annoying brother Johnny. George Romero is a great director, but he was beaten by the director of \" The Return of the Living Dead \" if you ask me. I give NOTLD a 6/10",

He subsequently tries to probes Barbara for her story, but the stress and traumatic events of the day is starting to take there toll on the young women and when she lashes out at him in a fit of hysterics he inturn knocks her out.\nAs the night continues and an increasing number of strangers surround the house, Ben starts to barricade the doors and windows of the old farmhouse while listing to the increasingly alarming radio reports of violence perpetrated by people in a trancelike state all over America.\nBut just as things are claming down, a grope of survivors emerge from the cellar, to check out if the upstairs is safe, which inturn presents a whole new set of problems in the form of an escalating power struggle between Ben and the refugees supposed leader Harry Copper\nAs the night grows even darker so does the prospects of survival as difference of opinion and general latent hostility threatens to tear the group apart, more and more this place of sanctuary is ultimately starting to looks less like a safe haven and more like an tomb. As the remaining media outlet realise that these rabid attackers are in fact the living dead and militia groups consisting mostly of gun crazy rednecks, are forming all over the US to eradicate this unusual threat, self-preservation eventual consumes the group as the house's power supply shuts down triggers the zombie inevitable attack on the sheltering farmhouse.Night of the Living Dead was produced in a particular tumultuous time in American history. The Cold War, the Kennedy brothers' assassination, the comeback of Richard M. Nixon combined with the seemingly neverending war in South East Asia and escalating race riots all gave fuel to one of the most poignant slices of discouraging nihilistic cinema outputs ever, brilliantly masqueraded as crowd pleasing entertainment. On the surface a harmless fright flick about flesh munching zombies, upon closer inspection however, a heart rendering socio-political allegory with unlimited bite and brains. And furthermore one of the best films of the sixties...Hell, ever!Night of the Living dead is the patriarch of seminal horror films Sam Raimi, Tope Hooper and john Landis have all named the film as a primary influence on their subsequent works and its fair to say that this film created \"The Zombie\" (although that idiom is never utilized) as we have come to know and love it today, although Victor Halperin's White Zombie (1933) did get there first, and while it's an accomplished slave allegory and immensely important in its own right it is ultimately an entirely different beast altogether.\nThese Moderne day flesh munches are holistically the creation of George A. Romero and his insistence on incorporating social commentary while changing the rules of the game makes him stand out and worth commemorating .I remember my first encounter with the film vividly; it was during the summer vacation of 1993, the Danish television station TV-2 showed it late one night long past the witching hour and having waited all week to catch it I anxiously sat down to indulges on this horror classic... An hour and a half later I was a changed person.\nCompletely captivated by the stunning Back and white photography by Romero himself, the incredible effectiveness of an obvious minuscule budget and the overpowering sense of atmosphere that it projected, I was left breathless and in awe at the capability of \"low-budget\" filmmaking, so much so that I subsequently scattered the VHS marked to acquire the remaining parts of what I would eventually learn was an absolutely transcendent trilogy of films, namely the majestic and epic Dawn of The Dead (1978) and the utterly nihilistic Day of the Dead (1985).In the aftermath of the films initial release in 68 Night of the Living Dead gained notoriety for it's ne plus ultra depiction of gore and while it's still true that the graphic content is severe in its presentation and certainly very much ahead of its time, it's not very likely to churn stomach's in this day and age.\nWhat remains undiminished however is the films ability to chill an audience with its cold visuals and haunting score, weaving a tapestry, unblemished in its portrayal of hell on earth.\nIn a world compromised by demagogic values and the promise of completion obtained through material grains, this film stands as a radiant beacon in the candid hopelessness that is the 21th century' inevitable decline, in that it tests you and asks \"do you want to just sit idly by and let the sense of apathy consume you ? Or do you want to get in touch with your humanity, however utopian that might seem.You'd do well to bypass the 30th anniversary edition that include dismal added footage and just go for the original classic. It has more releases the Sahara has grains of sand so the options are plentiful just make sure it the original !Reviewed here is the beautiful 3 disc Japanese edition from DEX Entertainment which houses three keep cases in a sturdy box.\nDisc one house' the main feature presented in 4:3 remastered and completely scratch free. In the extras department you get two audio commentary tracks, the first one by George A. Romero, John Russo, Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman (the Latent Image Crew) and the second one by Bill Hinzman, Judith O' Dea, Keith Wayne Kyra Schon Russell Streiner and Vince Survinski (Actors/Latent Image folk) both are chuck filled with anecdotes concerning the low budget and the challenges it presents and deserves to be heard by all aspiring filmmakers and people interested in genre films, both. It's a wonderful listening experience.\nThe second disc presents an immense photo gallery from the production of the film, a radio interview with Duane Jones (Ben) a great interview of Judith Ridley (Judy) conducted by Marilyn Burns (Helen Cooper) a house of commercial produced by Latent Image (check out the endorsement for \"Duke Beer\" it's priceless!\nFurthermore there's scenes from Romero's abandoned project \"There's always vanilla\"\nThe third disc presents the film in colour, so I humble advice you be to skip that one entirely but if you are serious about Night of the Living Dead then this edition more then worth your while.",

            "review_title": "What a shocker - an intelligent horror!! (spoilers)",
            "content": "Night of the Living Dead has been referenced, copied and spoofed so often that watching it for the first time was a little disorientating.  As was the case when hearing the Great Escape theme in the actual movie, or seeing Psycho's shower scene in the context of the story, it was hard to escape the feeling that this was something big.  Unfortunately, as was also the case with those examples, it was over-familiar before the opening credits had rolled.  But it must be remembered that what is clich\u00e9 now was original then, and it deserves better than to be marked down for the predictability hindsight has given it.  Despite years of imitation and repetition, this is a king among a genre of plebs.The strengths of the film's story come in its simplicity: a handful of strangers are gathered in a house in rural Pennsylvania that's gradually being surrounded by a mounting army of flesh-eating zombies.  With the simplest of set-ups and the tiniest of budgets, George Romero and his co-writers relied on imagination and invention rather than flash and gore, and for the most part they succeed.The opening scenes are gentle, as a bickering but charming brother and sister visit their dad's grave, but the tone is darkened as Romero pulls a Psycho on us by killing one of them off.  Immediately, as was the case with Hitchcock's masterpiece, we know that no-one is safe.  This is really the most important rule of horror; there's nothing less interesting than seeing people killed in the order you'd predicted, while the three most prominent characters survive unscathed.From this promising beginning, the movie never loses its nerve or its black heart, and is all the better for it.  We are given a sense of the wider picture through news footage of the country-wide phenomenon, but we stay with just our small group to experience it on an intimate, emotional level. The acting is often so wooden that the cast could have boarded up the house with themselves, but the actual characters are surprisingly well developed. It's pleasing to have an African-American as the most positive character in a movie from this era, and his cohabitants mostly manage to avoid becoming the stereotypes they could easily have been.  As is rarely the case with horror, we at least care about whether or not these people make it through the night.  This investment in the characters pays off in the cruel, ironic and perfect finale.The film's realism  - undoubtedly one of its strengths - extends beyond its documentary-style filming into the story, so the questions the audience asks to itself are answered, or at least discussed, onscreen.  Arguments over whether to hide in the basement or in the boarded-up ground floor, whether to stay in the house or flee to a rescue station, to fight the zombies or wait for rescue, are all ones we would ask if we were in the situation ourselves, and their inclusion in the script brings an intelligence that elevates the film further from its B-movie origins.Night of the Living Dead, while flawed and undoubtedly over-rated, is a good movie that rates as one of the best in a generally poor genre. Claustrophobic, tense, involving, inventive, realistic and true to its characters and mythology, it slaughters the easy, infantile, glossy shocks found in the likes of the Scream franchise, which thinks having someone jump out from behind a tree is enough to call itself horror.",

            "content": "NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is the first chapter of George Romero's \"classic\" trilogy. Though I didn't like its two successors, this film sure was good.NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is about several people locked into an abandoned house near a cemetery, hiding away from the zombies that are now rising from their graves to feast on human flesh. With the zombies massing outside, the hideaways think they are doomed. There are a couple of ways they could escape the monsters, but every plan they come up with seems to come crashing down in flames. How will they survive?Ignoring what a classic it is and everything, NotLD is still a great film. I think the use of black-and-white film adds a lot to the movie, and seems to add to the creepy atmosphere the film perpetuates as it moves along. Perhaps that's what the next two films were missing. I also like the fact that all of the violence is implied. You never really see blood spilling out or any of the monsters taking a bite out of any of the living humans, though you do see them feasting in one brilliant shot. I think the creepiest part of the movie was when we're introduced to the little zombie girl (the one shown on the movie's box cover)--I believe she adds a lot of atmospheric elements to the movie.Most of the characters and character development is great, with one exception. Judith O'Dea, in her role as Barbra, seemed rather useless and annoying in that right. I suppose someone has to play the traumatized victim, but it still annoyed me. On the other hand, the script is pretty good, the direction is excellent, and the ending is absolutely brilliant--pessimistic, sad, and extremely clever, all at the same time.I have to say, this is the only chapter of the Dead trilogy that I really liked... but I think it was also the most worthy. Certainly a classic, as I'm sure it will remain for another forty years. 8/10.",

As the number of 'ghouls' grow and more of them appear around the house, the inhabitants decide something must be done to move their number to a safer location in the next town. This, of course, is where the trouble really starts.This low-budget horror/thriller is a fine example of how believable characters and buckets of suspense are much more effective than believable special effects and buckets of gore. A true landmark in horror film-making, many times emulated but rarely equalled, 'Night of the Living Dead' stands the test of time perfectly, remaining scarier and more chilling than most of whats on offer these days.

It's all very wordy and never feels like any of these characters are real, which completely breaks the suspension of belief (if there was any to be had in a zombie apocalypse.)

It feels more claustrophopic and doomier and it really gives a strong sense of death near every corner. While the setting in Dawn of the Dead gave a little bit more of a sense of security for the characters, in every waking moment in Night of the Dead, there is a feeling of danger and anxiety. The great thing about this movie is that every character is in danger right from the start of the film and it builds up throughout the movie until it finally crescendoes into chaos. What really amplifies this feeling of inevitable danger is the atmosphere in the whole movie. Some hard to please movie goers may complain about its low budget feel, but having the movie in black and white is all you really need to give the film an ugly feeling of 'death in the air.'

Since the movie was filmed in PA, that knowledge gives it, for me anyway, an even greater sense of creepiness, because in PA it's possible to go from urban sprawl to rural isolation-like the farm house in the movie-in a matter of minutes and on many occasions I've seen farm houses similar to the one in the movie. My only problem with the film is minor:The female corpse upstairs. It seems to me it should have returned from the dead with the rest of the recently deceased. Granted she was badly multilated, but if you listen carefully during scenes with the newscaster, you'll hear of torsos and other body parts coming back to life. But that is my only real problem with the film. Other than that, this is a masterpiece. See it without delay.",

            "content": "When Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and her brother Johnny (Russell Streiner) go to their father's grave in rural Pennsylvania to pay their respects, Barbra is attacked by a zombie. In the ensuing struggle, Johnny is killed (his head bashed against the corner of a tombstone) and Barbra is chased to a nearby farm house. There she takes refuge amongst other survivors: Ben (Duane Jones), Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife Hellen (Marilyn Eastman), their injured daughter Karen (Kyra Schon), Tom (Keith Wayne) and his girlfriend Judy (Judith Ridley). Deeply divided over the best course for survival, they must survive both the undead onslaught and their increasingly violent natures until a rescue party arrives.\"Night of the Living Dead\" is a classic much in the same vein as \"Casablanca\" (1942): so often quoted and parodied that the film may at first seem like the clich\u00e9 that its mimickers created. Romero completely revolutionized the horror genre with his radical re-imagining of the zombie. No longer the soulless victim-slave of a witch doctor (as in 1932's \"White Zombie\" or 1943's \"I Walked with a Zombie\"), they are undead ghouls who without proper cause (later films will challenge the theory that radiation from Venus is the cause of the phenomenon) begin killing and consuming the living. Any recently dead person will become reanimated with murderous intent toward the living, regardless of the fact that they were once a family member or friend. Their slow, unrelenting gate gives them a sense of inevitability: you might kill or outrun one or two of them, but their swelling numbers will outlast and eventually overwhelm you.The film portrays the bleak realities of race relations in the late 1960's. Ben's plans are met by Harry's violent resistance, implicitly because he's black. Later, when Ben, as the sole survivor, finds the notably all-white rescue party, they kill him and burn him with the rest of the slain undead. It may have been an innocent mistake, but the image of an armed posse of white men killing an unarmed black man is nonetheless seared into the memory of the viewer, reminiscent of the South's violent resistance to the Civil Rights Movement's peaceful protests.Likewise, \"Night of the Living Dead\" also portrays the strained gender relations of the time. I won't say that the film is sexist (because I don't believe that to be the case); it does, however, portray a staunchly patriarchal world-view. Barbra, after viewing the death of her brother, essentially becomes a zombie herself. Clearly suffering from intense shock, she becomes practically comatose, incapable of assisting anybody in the slightest (and, more often than not, getting in the way). Harry presents himself as the tyrannical head of his family. He keeps his wife in the dark concerning the latest life-altering events (literally, she's kept in the basement while the best course of action is debated by the men upstairs) and even attempts to stretch his influence to the other women. Notably, he treats Barbra like a child that needs looking after and Judy like she's Tom's to order around.Like \"Nosferatu\" (1922), \"Night of the Living Dead\" is more unsettling and chilling than it is frightening (at least to the contemporary viewer). There are no \"jump out at you\" shocks or outright scares, but a slowly intensifying suspense that very much resembles the undead themselves. The scene in which the zombies get a hold of the incinerated Tom and Judy, savoring the chunks of their ripped-apart flesh, is easily the most unnerving of the film (and, perhaps, of the genre). Like Jacques Tourneur, Romero wields his films' dark atmosphere as a weapon, one infinitely more effective than simple shock-and-awe scare tactics.The only detriment to this film is the character of Barbra. I can understand wanting to show a \"shell-shocked\" victim in what is a clear parallel to the Vietnam War (essentially bringing the horrors of the war home to the American public), the end result is an absolute mess. Her every line infuriatingly fails at anything even closely resembling a realistic character. While the 1990 remake committed just as bad a mistake with their gross over-correction of her character (turning her into a caricature of Sarah Connor), Barbra is still sad excuse for a traumatized woman.This film is a must see for any of horror, especially fans of the zombie sub-genre. Likewise, those interested in the changing racial and family dynamics of the 1960's will find this an intensely symbolic film rich with coded power dynamics.",

It's honestly shocking to think of all the amazing films that wouldn't exist without this initial spark, and what a bright spark it is.More than just an important milestone, 'NotLD' remains a stellar horror film to this day. With excellent writing, a perfect atmosphere and beautiful black and white cinematography. Even now, despite the over-saturation of zombie films we have, nothing has been made which is quite like the progenitor (aside the 1990's remake). Its hopeless and desperate situation, its brief timespan (as the title suggests, only one night), and its shocking ending all remain mostly unique to this single film 46 years after its release. The film does show its age, and low budget at times. However this is only 2-3% of the time, the other 97-98% you are stuck wondering how so much timeless brilliance can be squeezed into a single (relatively short) horror film. The tight location is used to its full and that simple cabin in the woods has become the parent to all others in the many decades to follow.Overall, it's 'NotLD'.

            "content": "Horror movies are sworn to three principles: 1.) Our character(s) are constantly surrounded by imminent threat. 2.) Almost all characters (if not everyone) must die 3.) Explicit death sequences. This is what separates Horror from Suspense/Thriller/Mystery movies. In 1968, George Romero, through the endangered yet provocative element of black and white film making, managed to combine these three attributes brilliantly setting the standard for any future horror movie to follow. I still get chills every time I watch the opening sequence, in the cemetery, when the director himself repeats the lines, \"They're coming to get you Barbara!\" \"Look! Here comes one of them now!\" followed by S. William Hinzman's bone chilling performance revealing the capacity of the living dead. From there the movie rarely stops for breath as the day transcends to night. Our heroine finds her only salvation in a lone country house where she soon befriends a select congregation of survivors. Surrounded by these merciless savages they must find a way out together, if they don't kill each other first.This movie crosses many lines in a year where crossing lines was the 'IN' thing to do. The exceptional amount of violence and defamation of the dead still to this day would not receive less than an 'R' rating. Another bold move was casting an African-American for the lead role, for which Duane Jones delivers a powerful leader persona. This is the other truly virtuous quality of NOTLD, the acting. This quintisential ingredient is often diminished if not forgotten in today's horror flicks. The true terror arises in the audience when they begin to identify and place themselves in the characters' shoes. The acting in this movie is far above par considering its low budget. Within the struggle for safety from what lies outside a new threat arises from within the house allowing no safe territory. (Obvious inspirations for the situations in '28 Days Later'). The movie sub-plots a social commentary on survival and what measures man will take to maintain such.Bottom Line: One of the top three horror movies of all times. Eerie scenes of ill-determined zombies, well acted plots of desperation, and of course gore. You may never want to walk through a cemetery again.",

The background behind the cemetary zombie adds some behind sight, but, most of it is extemporaneous. The tacked on new ending, supposedly to be shocking, as the DVD liner notebook says, is bland, and appears to be advertising a possible sequel. (Possibly \"Children Of The Living Dead?\")\n     Technically, the added footage is not as bad as I expected it to be. It does not blend in flawlessly, obviously.  You can quite tell where the new material is, but, from a mechanical standpoint, they did a pretty good job at trying to match the original material.  The only problem being the new material is not necessary.  \n     The soundtrack was altered in several places that were also useless. The new music track is the most obvious, as the original musical soundtrack is far better.  The radio reports from the original film were rescripted to add some more background information, and, while unnecessary, they were inserted fairly well, using the narrator from the first film.\n     The bright spot about the 30th edition is the digital remastering. Finally, a superb quality print.  I'd seen the film for 14 years before this version, and, I never noticed some of the details in the basement scene at the end, like Mr. Cooper missing an arm.  A visually perfect transfer, it's just too bad they didn't do this with the original, without added footage and new music.\n     You won't waste your money buying this, but, you won't gain much beyond the digital transfer either.

OF COURSE the wife of the nasty cowardly white guy is a characterless cipher. For me the movie lacked any sort of charisma or atmosphere. I think Romero's concern with social commentary blinded him to the potential of the rest of the characters and the movie's plot. This would be a brilliant film for those concerned with social justice, I suppose that just isn't my thing, I like horror to be creepy, psychological and underplayed, nothing like that in this film. I find it all a bit forced and didactic, for me, the sterile 'macho-ness' of the lead totally alienated me, and as a horror film, it wasn't at all frightening, just chumpy and flat footed.the zombies looked like middle class uni student extras. The young girl attacking her mother scene was not bad, but it was ultimately a film about racial issues, and while that was undoubtedly a horror story of the 60s, it gives the film a kind of shrill didacticism which completely dominated the atmosphere.

The film starts off with a young woman and her brother paying a visit to her father's grave at a lone cemetary in the Pennsylvania countryside. A virtually deserted area, Barbara and her brother pay respects, only to have her brother teasing her in a moment of immature fashion, particularly of a strange man roaming the graveyard in an odd daze. The woman proceeds to apologize to the man only to find herself attacked by something much more darker than she'd expect, and her brother immediately comes to her defense. He only finds himself at the wrong end of the fight, and the woman scampers off like a bat out of hell as the dazed man makes a walk for her. She takes residence in a large farmhouse, and finds herself one of the six survivors trying to defend themselves against a burgeoning army of the living dead. Romero's film is genuinely creepy because it's a throwback to the films of Doris Day and Jimmy Stewart. It's a no holds barred creepfest that becomes scarier by the moment. Depending on the tension inside the house, or the hordes of undead outside. With it's small budget, Romero sought the help of local actors, friends, and neighbors to play the zombies. George Hinzman, the first zombie in the film, was actually in makeup. This is a film to watch with the lights off and the sound up. It was listed as one of the films in AFI's 100 Thrills.",

Night of the Living Dead is without a doubt the first stereotypical zombie film which would influence so many films to come after it. Night of the Living Dead was an extremely controversial film that was put down by critics, but looked at very fondly as a cult classic, and a fantastic piece of violent social commentary. The social commentary in this film is very present, and can be looked at differently by different people.Night Of The Living Dead is actually a basic 50s science fiction movie in the style of The Last Man On Earth (1963) Starring Vincent Price. Many look past the fact that Night of the Living Dead is based on the same novel as The Last Man On Earth; \"I Am Legend\", which was recently adapted again into another movie of the same name. Night of the Living Dead balanced the 50s sci-fi theme along with modern (for the time) violence. The violence may look cheesy or tame compared to movies to come out half a decade later, but is still disturbing looking at the way this film is shot. Night of the Living Dead uses the Black and White format better than any other film I have ever seen. The black and white format adds a dark, grainy look to the film which adds a good, unsettling feeling. In my view, Night of the Living Dead may not be the goriest zombie film ever made, but is still the scariest. The dark atmosphere done by director George A. Romero is excellent, and beats anything else done in the genre. The cast is also outstanding. The movie provides some very good performances all around. The character chemistry is outstanding. A large part of the movie is simply character arguments, yet that is the fun of this film. The fun in this film comes from the great directing, which makes the viewer feel like they are in the arguments themselves. The realism of this film is almost frightening in itself. I seen this movie before having any knowledge that it was a classic, and boy was I impressed.Night of the Living Dead has done many things. It lit the match and set the fire for the zombie genre, it set plenty of interesting ground rules, established Romero as a great director, and started off one of the great trilogys of all time. Night of the Living Dead will impress any horror fan looking for a fright fest, rather than a gorefest. Night of the Living Dead may be violently tame compared to the sequels, but contains some very dark and disturbing atmospehre. The down beat ending is also unforgettable.",

I think this the first film everyone should see when watching their very first horror film. You'll see many other ones made later in color with lots more blood and gore and special effects but you know what? Most of them won't stick with you like this film does.",

The film wins in all aspects of film-making, including writing, pacing, and cinematography -- not to mention assembling a terrifyingly ferocious cast of the undead.The film's biggest strength is its bleak, desperate atmosphere, which is heightened by stark black and white photography, high-contrast lighting, and mono sound. It suspends many moments of unmitigated terror within the same feeling of morbid isolation one can find in Tobe Hooper's original Texas Chain Saw Massacre (but, of course, earns extra kudos for doing it first).Romero approaches the story with a steady hand and gives taut direction. The proceedings are supported by an engaging cast, especially leads Duane Jones and Judith O'Dea. Jones -- the first African-American lead in a horror film -- is wonderful as the handsome, assured, and no-nonsense hero, while O'Dea gives a pensive and uniquely off-kilter performance. Captivating from its riveting beginning to its downbeat conclusion, Night of the Living Dead stands as a pivotal entry in the zombie subgenre.",

Mr. Hinzman looks twice the man he was in '68 and his makeup was awful.  There were a few good points, the picture was excellent, the music was good, and some of the new zombie sequences were quite well done. \nI really thought that the new beginning and ending were really poor and did not look very authentic,  the Reverend was a dreadful character and added nothing whatsoever to the story or movie.

            "content": "A fairly progressive movie for the 1960s in which the lead is a black man - not even by design, but simply because he was the best actor for the job. It shows, because Duane Jones is great in this film, as are most of the other cast, although Judith O'Dea is understandably limited by the hysterical and useless character she's playing. The dialogue is also well-written and snappy, and feels like real people talking.The zombies are the most obvious aspect of the film, but really they themselves are the weakest part of it. It's more interesting to see people actually confused about what's going on (in a world yet to be saturated by zombies in media), and it's eerie to hear people on the radio and TV call the zombies \"ghouls\", describe them as murdering people, and speculate that they were mutated by radiation from a NASA probe. Ultimately, the drama and tension between the humans trapped in the house is the strongest aspect of the film, where people's differing reactions are both showcased and put to the test.The score isn't great, but it does the job of providing a fairly spooky (though sometimes kind of melodramatic) atmosphere. I like the often simplistic photography, and good use is made of claustrophobic angles and lighting during some scenes in the gothic house. It also looks very nice in colour.Something George Romero would carry forward from this movie was the theme of an old society with outdated norms being replaced by something terrifying and new - in this case, a new breed of people who eat the old breed. Even some of the talk about traditions surrounding death (Johnny complaining about being obligated to visit his father's grave, an expert on TV insisting that people quickly burn the deceased and not dwell on funeral rites) serves as a cynical jab at people's old ways. Like \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" (1974) after it, it uses radio and TV-style reports to lampoon contemporary media, wars and politics.Of course it's outdated in ways of its own, but \"Night of the Living Dead\" is way ahead of its time, both unknowingly (in the implications of its sudden, shocking ending) and knowingly.8/10.",

The soundtrack does not fit, they should have left the original soundtrack at least on the \"98 version\" that way we would just have the movie remastered, no tampering.The new scenes didn't belong in either.

But with the re-issue of a classic I would have believed they would at least get that right! That really detracted from the film. I feel sorry for those watching it for the first time.It seemed strange Romero wasn't involved in the film. If he was busy, couldn't they have waited until he was available?

            "content": "I'm no purist, so when John Russo talked to us about his intentions to re-vamp this film (at a Chiller tradeshow) and how George Romero gave him permission to have some fun with it , I really awaited for his \"original\" spin on this film . My feelings are that adjustments to a film can be exciting if the intent is to either, add to the meaning of the film, fit in old scenes that were cut because of time concerns or if there were original ideas that couldn't be \"fleshed\" out at the time, go ahead and play around with it. Russo and his old crew buddies made it sound like the film warranted the update. Listening to their backstage dialog, you'd think that they had created a better version. Despite their commentaries to the contrary, they obviously went at this with a rusty pickax. Sure, it's interesting to try to match film techniques to the original but none of the new scenes added anything important to the original. Since the beginning of the film industry, committees have made the same mistake, over and over. In their attempt to offer their \"art\" to the public, they have, once again, made the assumption that the audience is too stupid to be there. In this case, we do not need to know the origins of the cemetery ghoul. Okay, it was fun to learn that he was a murdering pedophile. But the original introduction leading us to the cemetery was much creepier. We do not need explanations as to why there are so many ghouls coming to the house (the audience understands that there's a cemetery nearby for god's sake). In fact, offering up that the ghouls came from Beekman's diner reduces the scare. It's much more effective to not know how many ghouls there were out there. It gives the audience the impression that the threat is much more rampant. And as to the \"edit\" of a scene in the cellar based on Russo's trouble with a shakey jumpcut in the original, they have made a \"deadly\" mistake. To eliminate the jumpcut, a very important dramatic sequence was eliminated which gave the audience a glimpse at the dissolving marriage of the Coopers. This edited scene also explained why Helen Cooper wanted to run upstairs. And this isn't the only sloppy and unnecessary cut. When blood from the woman upstairs drips onto Barbra's hand, a small scene is obliterated as she screams and runs into the living room. This shot is so badly cut, you can still hear a part of her scream as the camera jumpcuts to the ghouls breaking the headlights. In the original version, there are two shots of a naked female ghoul from behind. One is a close up and the other is long shot. In the new version, for no reason, these two shots are gone. In the 98'\"edit which is included with this dvd, the long shot still remains. Why are these tampered with? Is it because the filmaker's daughters are now in the re-cut? In their goofy commentaries on the film, we get to hear how painstakingly they tried to adhere to the original intent. Unfortunately, they achieved exactly what they didn't want to create: a unnecessary slash of the creepier original. It's also better to not even mention the lousy new soundtrack! It makes sense to me that HBO had a hand in this. It looks and feels and, due to an overblown soundtrack, sounds more like a \"Tales From The Crypt\" episode. The black/white film is way too contrasting.  It's scares are reduced considerably and having to watch the older scenes intercut into the new pieces only makes one pine more for the original. I genuinely wanted to see Russo's new ghoulfest but it's obvious to me that Filmakers should stop trying to be editors. This version comes off more like a showcase for the filmaker's daughters instead. I thought that we would, at least, find out why they decided to have dead daughter kill her mother with a weapon and not eat her flesh! Guess not!  And if they were so intent on recreating the feel of the first, why couldn't some \"body\" find a business suit for the reporter that wasn't from 1982! Oddly enough, this dvd features the cleanest copy of the film that I've ever seen. My last word is that this is more of a novelty than a keeper.",

            "content": "IMDb mark: 7In my opinion, 'Night of the Living Dead', directed by George A. Romero, only has to compete with F.W. Murnau's 'Nosferatu: eine symphonie des grauens' for the title of the best, or maybe just the scariest, black-and-white horror film ever. Of course, this one wins by a landslide. It even puts to shame many colour horror movies. Admittedly, this film does look a little outdated now, but imagine its impact in 1968, when all the public was seeing were those nice, feel-good monster flicks, like 'The Fly' and 'Return of the Fly'.-Gore: The thing here is that gore doesn't look as good in only two colours. But still, some scenes truly are awesome, like when one zombie is eating the hand of a victim; and quite a few more. Also, if you don't consider it a desecration of a classic, you can hunt for the colorized version made in 1987; I'm not sure how good the quality of the colour is in that version, though. 17/30-Suspense: The first time you see it, this movie will keep you in suspense until the end. And prepare to be shocked. When you see 'Night of the Living Dead' again, however, it's just not as frightening, because you won't be able to forget the scenes that easily. 13/15-Ending: Wow, the ending is unbelievable! It's extraordinary! But don't watch the ending with Scott Vladimir Licina in it, that's pure crap. The last 15 minutes of the true original version are of such an intensity, that can rarely be encountered in other movies. \"Okay, that's another one for the fire!\" 15/15-Death Scenes: Absolutely no complaints here. Check out Helen's death! It's the best black-and-white death scene I've ever watched and it kind of makes Hitchcock's scenes look like 'G'-rated stuff. 11/11-Atmosphere: While this film is incredibly creepy at times, it can become boring every once in a while. Those news bulletins the characters watch and hear aren't always helping the mood of the film, and the 30th Anniversary Edition is even worse, especially with the altered beginning ad ending, tossing God into the mix. 7/10-Nudity: One of the zombies is seen first nude from the back, then topless from the side. But this is removed from the 30th Anniversary Edition and some other versions. 1/10-Cast: They have all become famous for being in this movie: Duane Jones, Judith O'Dea, Bill Hinzman, and perhaps a few others, too. I haven't seen any of them in anything else yet, though. 1/5-Genre: This is a horror film. 4/4-->Overall: 69/100'Night of the Flesh Eaters' is famous for not being copyrighted. So, therefore, it is probably the film with the most different versions available. Even colorized versions have been created. But beware, because only few of all those various editions are truly worth the money. From Swordlord, 2 swords up!",

I suppose what most makes this movie work as well as it does is the nightmarish atmosphere which George Romero and company managed to create. The tension inside the farm house feels so real that we, the viewers, are sucked right in.

Just because this was the first of its kind, doesn't mean it is the best.  Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead were as bad if not worse in terms of tedium but were more fun because of the gore.  A film like The Evil Dead, however, is a far superior film even though it copies or parodies many ideas from Night.  Romero's films are too boring - in his middle sections he relies too heavily on the script which is usually not interesting enough to keep the audience's attention.If you've not seen this film before, then it is only of real interest for its many genre-defining scenes although the ending is nice and much better than the end of the two sequels.

            "content": "In 1968 George Romero and a group of his friends raised $115,000 dollars and made one of the most influential horror films of it's time. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD changed how horror film were to be made for ever after. For the first time, without the help of a major motion picture studio a group of people made a horror film, and in doing so showed the rest of the world that it could be done.THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and HALLOWEEN certainly could not have been made the same way had NOTLD not been made. Much has been written about the documentary feel of the film as well as the realism of the film in particular the fact that everybody dies at the end of the film. And it is all valid. This is one creepy feeling film. This is not a feel good film. It exposes the dark side of humanity with no holds barred. There are no real heroes in this film. Harry Cooper is always sited as a class A jerk. But Ben is only a little better. The constant arguing between the two is no little contribution to the demise of the whole group. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is must viewing for any serious horror movie fan. In it one can see the influence it had (and still has) horror films to follow. Next to PSYCHO in 1960 and HALLOWEEN in 1978 it is simply the most influential horror film in the last 49 years. Not bad for $115,000.The Elite DVD and Extreme DVD are by far the best to buy. 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "Night of the Living Dead is without a doubt a fantastically innovative film; creating the modern day interpretation of a zombie and forever changing the genre as we know it. There is a lot to like about this film, but unfortunately the limitations of its time hold it back, resulting in a somewhat boring viewing experience.For starters, the story was pretty good. I really enjoyed how the plot focused on a single group of survivors and their thought process as they attempt to deal with the horror and panic of the dead reanimating. There was a tremendous amount of lore delivered via telecommunication broadcasts that I thought added to the movie perfectly.The performances were uneven, some were quite stellar, particularly Duane Jones and Karl Hardman. But Judith O'Dea was quite bad. I'm not sure if it was her performance or the way her character was written but it was just bizarre to see her body language and gestures throughout the film. The beginning chase scene with her was fantastic, with some stellar cinematography. But after that, the way she portrayed shock was laughable.The action in this movie was bad, with punches being all too slow and clunky. I would imagine this movie was quite scary for the time, but with modern day horror constantly elevating, I hardly found myself unnerved. Overall, this movie is Time Capsule for horror and the genre has taken so much from this film throughout the years, but unfortunately it's legacy far outweighs the entertainment the film brings.Score: 53%\nVerdict: Average.",

Regardless of considerations of budget or effects, this is THE BEST horror movie ever made.I can't say for sure that it is the origin of the idea of a zombie apocalypse (it was released 5 years before I was born), but it is the bible of the genre for a good reason.The horror here is not in the level of gore, which is pretty ample but definitely tamed by being in black and white. Undoubtedly, Romeral was channeling his inner Sarte (i.e. hell is other people). This is as much a psychological horror movie as a zombie film, and it can serve as a basis for serious discussions about a number of social topics of serve as just great entertainment.

It's actually very rare that a horror movie creeps me out...until I saw Night of the Living Dead. Sure it's a low budget film that was made in 1968, but I think that it stands the test of time. The idea of a group of strangers forced to take shelter in a deserted farmhouse to protect themselves from flesh-eating zombies is pretty scary.  SPOILERS AHEAD:  The scariest part was when the woman's daughter, who had been really sick, turned into a zombie and killed her mother. That was scary! The film ends with the only survivor shot by a group of hunters, because they think he is a zombie...it picks up again in Dawn of the Dead, which was another great movie, but not as good as the original masterpiece: Night of the Living Dead!!!",

Many things are overlooked in this film because it has so much to offer. It was groundbreaking in many ways one of which it allowed a black man to be viewed as the hero and play the lead role. This was very cuting edge and rare back in the 60s. But there's a irony in the role he plays, at first glance he seems to be the hero but in reality , it is because of him that everyone dies in the house because he convinced everyone else that it was safer to stay out of the basement. Some of the camera-work and lighting in this film is nothing short of genius and it proves that often when a producer has a low budget, their originality and though process of filming a movie goes into overdrive. Night of the Living Dead and Curse of Frankenstein will always be my top 2 horror films of all time because they are : scary, intelligent, thought provoking and have meaningful dialog, conflict and characters that the viewer will either despise or love. I have found with both of the fore-mentioned films, they only get better with repeated viewings and the viewer learns more and more with those viewings as long as they play close attention and look for other aspects of the film which may be hidden on the 1st viewing.",

As I recall, it was the third movie in a triple bill. I had no idea of what I had gotten myself into! There I was alone in my car and, ten minutes into the movie, scared sh--less! I had never seen a horror movie like this one before, and I had seen hundreds. Forty years later, \"Night of the Living Dead\" has not lost its power to chill.The plot by now is too familiar to need retelling. But for those who have been living on another planet, I'll briefly explain. A group of people are holed up in a farmhouse, with a growing army of the undead outside and trying to get in. Instead of joining together to fight the zombies, they fight among themselves about strategy. The obnoxious white guy wants everyone to go down into the cellar. The black guy who is the main protagonist (a rarity in those days) says that would be suicide and wants everyone to remain upstairs. \"United we stand, divided we fall\" as the saying goes. And partly because of the bickering, the zombies end up invading the house.Ironically, the obnoxious white guy turns out to have been right all along. Because the sole survivor, the black guy who wanted everyone to remain upstairs, ends up saving himself by locking himself in the cellar. The rescuers arrive the next day, mistake the survivor for a zombie, shoot him, and throw his body on the fire along with all the others.This is the movie that put George Romero on the map and set the standard by which all future zombie movies must be measured. Its influence on the genre cannot be overstated. Romero would go on to make a sequel, \"Dawn of the Dead\" that in my opinion is even better than the original, as well as several others not quite up to the caliber of the first two.This is one helluva scary movie and a must-see for any horror-movie fan.",

            "content": "*-Catch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy it Used/On Sale ****-Buy it New/Top Dollar *****-Worthy of a Blind BuyGeorge A. Romero is a name synonomous with zombie-horror. He created the immensely popular \"Dead Trilogy\" and after hearing how great his films are I finally got around to seeing the original \"Night of the Living Dead.\" The film paints the picture of a world facing an epidemic of cannibalistic zombies. It focuses on a group of people who are holed up in a farmhouse trying to fight off the zombies over the course of a night. The characters, as they fight for their lives, deal with their own conflicting ideas of how to survive. I was disappointed in this film. While it is a classic of the horror genre and the pioneer of the zombie subgenre, I was not impressed. It's outdatedness and virtual lack of a budget proved to be too great of a distraction for me. I will never write off an entire movie because it lacked an adequate monetary resource in it's production. I know that great things can be done in film with little money and I understand that many people see greatness in \"Night of the Living Dead,\" however I did not see it.\nThe slow moving zombies of the film were meant to creat a creepy atmosphere but I almost found the zombies comedic. After having seen so many horror movie cliches recently it was interesting to see them back when they were not cliches yet. Situations where the victim falls while being pursued or can't get a car started are now only used for comedic effect and in \"Night of the Living Dead\" it was hard to see them as \"terror-inducing.\"\nThe acting talent was overall mediocre. I thought Judith O'Dea's performance was just annoying and a little too much. While she was terrified at the beginning of the film she almost seemed to be holding her breath to create the feeling. She tried too hard and came up as unbelievable. The rest of the cast was fine, with special mention towards to Karl Hardman as the hot headed know-it-all. The film's saving grace was Duane Jones. From the minute he appears onscreen he takes charge, becoming the leader of the group. His performance was the only thing that held my interest. The ending of the film would have been incredible had I not seen a certain movie recently that stole it's own ending from \"Night of the Living Dead.\" Unfortunately for Romero, I hated the movie that took his ending. Overall I would rate this movie at **. I am happy I saw it because it is such a classic and so respected but I will not buy it because it comes off as too cheesy for my tastes.",

Why a religious angle?  Where did this come from?  Sounds to me like the producers felt they needed to address religion specifically and rather than coming up with something original, say another movie, they felt they should just take something easily marketable(I don't think any fan of the series and genre wasn't excited about new scenes) and insert their \"point\" there.  It's hard to totally destroy this film, so I could never say it's awful, but the new ending and angle just cheapen the whole experience.

So I never saw the film, even as I got older and worked my way through many horror classics.  However, in the last few years I've become more jaded and inured to gore.  A few months ago I was fortunate enough to see Peter Jackson's hilarious \"Braindead\", and nothing could be gorier than THAT! So I finally saw \"Night of the Living Dead.\"  And it scared me half to death. Yes, I know it was made for a $1.95, the editing is choppy, at times they shoot night scenes during the day--but that doesn't MATTER.  It is obviously the touchstone for many modern (and far less frightening) films.  The scenes where the zombies were eating the burnt bodies of the couple in the truck was truly disgusting and scary.

I don't know why I haven't read yet a review or an article on this movie where somebody talk about the three units of the tragedy by Aristotele, since they are well respected. The same, actually, can be said about THE EVIL DEAD and some others, since every low- budget genre movie revolves about the same place and time. I think this is a consideration that they can do only with totally respected auteur as Kubrick: no matter if SHINING is also a horror movie or that NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is a work of art (yes: art). Romero's first movie, in some people's opinion, is still a dirty drive-in low budget flick which has become a classic only for dumbs. Instead is a great horror movie and even contains a germ (since Romero was young at that time) of social commentary and satire, which is not bad for a so - called drive-in flick. I don't actually need a social metaphor or similar to enjoy and love a movie, but if this element is present, I must mention it among the virtues of the flick.

            "content": "SPOILERSNight of the Living Dead is a terrifying, landmark horror film.  It is about seven people who take refuge in an abandoned house in the countryside from the zombies roaming outside.  It seems the newly deceased are being revived and turned into flesh-eating monsters.  Unfortunately, those aren't the only monsters they have to contend with, there's each other too.George A. Romero directs in gritty black & white (by choice not necessity). This is very effective as it adds to the claustrophobic mood of the film. It almost looks like a documentary, bringing to mind the look and feel of the Vietnam era during which the film was made (look at the final scenes in particular).It took me a while to realize it, but the title of this film does NOT refer to the zombies.  It refers to the living people who are in a dead state of mind.Example: Harry and Ben waste no time in taking an intense dislike of each other. They proceed to fight over who should have the gun, whether to go for help, and most of all, whether to stay upstairs or barricade themselves in the cellar.  Guess who's right?  Then there's the bickering between Harry and Helen.  Harry tries to bully her, while Helen whines away, driving him crazy.  Harry and Helen's daughter Karen is fast slipping away from being bitten by one of the zombies.  Barbara, already in shock from her first encounter with the ghouls, wisely decides to withdraw from the proceedings by becoming catatonic.  All the characters are already \"dead\" in their own way.It's ironic that while battling monsters, the characters should all turn into them.  I guess there's nothing quite like an outbreak of flesh eating zombies to bring out your selfish, cowardly instincts to the surface.",

The story itself is fairly light, but remains the creepiest of the lot. Given, it's actors are mostly horrible, Ben being the noticeable exception, and one of the reasons the movie is so watchable... Also, due to it having such an ambiguous premise, many still wonder how and why the dead came to rise and feast upon the living - it poses many questions... Answers few.Indeed, every time I watch it, I come to a different conclusion as to what caused it...This movie ages very well, and holds its own to today's low budget horror movies. Sure, as the budgets have increased, and the technology has, it's been easier to create better movies... BUT, more than thirty years on, and this movie is still standing head and shoulders above most. I put it down to Johnny (\"They're coming to get you Barbara!\") and the zombie from the cemetery - that guy is particularly creepy.I'm showing this to my kids on their fifth birthday. It's a good movie to use to keep them in line until they're ready to be kicked out of home - just threaten them with it - if they decide to wander the streets at night or disobey you, zombies might eat them or turn their car over and chase them for miles...10 out of 10. A classic. Get it, watch it, love it. If you don't, too bad. *** NOTE *** Don't watch the 25th anniversary edition, however, as it ruins the musical score and adds unnecessary and stupid scenes, and a dumb ending that ruins the movie. If it were watched with that version, I'd change the score to about 2/10. It really cheapens it, tries plot development and fails, and should be avoided like the plague. CHEERS!",

            "content": "George Romero made his directorial debut with this film, a low-budget B-movie that would go on to become a classic, hailed by all connaisseurs of horror.  Although famous for its gore and ruthlessness, this is far more accessible than Romero's later films of the seventies such as Martin and Dawn of the Dead.  That said, the rapid editing and early gore effects are combined to give a claustrophobic and unrelenting portrait of seven survivor's attempts to escape the clutches of seemingly endless crowds of the undead. Romero's greatest film (closely followed by the masterpiece Martin) and highly influencial, partlicularly amoungst cult horror, Romero's work was to influence many other horror directors including Italian directors and other cult icons such as John Carpenter. For what is essentially an independant film, the acting is not too bad and the script is superb - both believable and endlessly quotable.  Scenes to look out for include a scene where a zombie is set on fire (done without protection of course), and a scene where dozens of zombie hands break through a window and grab out at our heros.  Actually, the entire end sequence is utterly terrifying. For the first time, a horror movie was set in reality (relatively speaking). Utterly unrelenting and totally compelling, this cult masterpiece is an absolute must-see for all horror-buffs, even if you don't like the later work of the great Romero.",

            "content": "Normal people remember their first kiss, first girlfriend, first job, first car... I remember my first horror movie.I was 6 years old and, most people over 30 in Pittsburgh where I live owned a copy of Night of the Living Dead on VHS. So naturally, my step father did as well. I watched it, and being so young that I wasn't able to appreciate things like story and direction, I didn't take it very seriously and laughed at the perceived \"lack of horror\" for most of the movie. I mean, the 80s were still fresh in everyone's minds, so the cornucopia of over the top horror flicks had become the gold standard of what to expect. And although I hadn't seen any at all, I knew in a general sense what comprised one. How? I don't know... I just knew the makeup of one in a general sense. And this definitely wasn't Jason slamming a camper in a sleeping bag into a tree, or Captain Rhodes getting disemboweled and ripped in half by a gaggle of ghouls.But that night, I had the most terrifying dreams ever, even to this day. And to this day, I remember them so vividly, like they'd been burned into my memory for all time. From that moment on, I was addicted to both the horror genre and this movie in particular.To me, this is THE most perfect horror film... not just MOVIE, a FILM... ever created. It has atmosphere, constant tension, totally new and unique camera work, characters with actual depth, an utterly terrifying and original premise and antagonist, and most importantly, an actual STORY (for all you millennials, movies back then, even horror movies, had what they called STORIES). And I really believe that Russo and Romero's bare-bones budget did them a huge favor... #1) the film is so much more effective in black and white. It adds a whole other dimension to the terror. And #2) the absence of fancy makeup and prosthetics did the audience such a massive favor, because THE GHOULS LOOKED JUST LIKE US. THAT is what made them so terrifying... they weren't blue like in Dawn and they weren't all skeletal with faces sunken in like in Day... they looked like actual people, except with blood here and there, and maybe some torn clothing. They're much more believable as the recently deceased returning to \"life\".I can never say enough about the absolute PERFECTION of this film. It was something so new and original and HORRIFYING. I mean, really think about it... it's 1968, when people hadn't yet become totally desensitized to movie horror and violence, and here comes this horror movie with the bodies of the recently deceased getting up and attacking the living. And not just attacking... halfway thru the movie, for the first time ever, you see these corpses EATING the people. Romero and Russo said when writing the movie, they were trying to think of the most terrifying and appalling act that these things could do... and in my opinion, devouring the living, us, is definitely terrifying and appalling, not to mention probably the worst and most painful way to die. But more than anything else, the scariest part of it all (and really driven home thanks to the lack of makeup effects and prosthetics), is that they really truly ARE, and LOOK like, US.100,000,000/10 stars. Perfection. Most original, creative, well written, perfectly shot, and most of all, SCARIEST horror FILM ever created. Thank you from the bottom of my heart John Russo and George Romero... you are geniuses among men. Rest In Peace.",

You see the world through the eyes of the victims and those of the lifeless killers at the exact same time.  You sit back and watch as sanity unfolds into insanity, as seemingly normal people are faced with the reality of a horrible nightmare come to life.  Each death is very graphic yet classy.  The black and white visual very much adds to the over all bleakness of the film.  And it is quite obvious that George threw in quite a bit about the dreadful situation in which African Americans were treated during that time in the South, as one of the main performers of the film is African American.  We also witness a certain brand of humanity in the lifeless zombies, almost as if they are attempting to teach the living a moral lesson.  The film also goes into great detail as to how people can be truly numb and uncaring to those around them, especially when thrown into extreme situations, as are carefully shown in this brilliant and surreal Horror epic.",

            "content": "Those are the two celebrities that Harry and Helen Cooper remind me of.Specifically, an older, middle-aged, declining Julia Roberts, as she will perhaps be in ten to twenty years, as she's already described herself in the 1999 film \"Notting Hill\". I am being subjective in this review, because I think my subjective reactions to, and memories of, this film, are the most unique thing I have to offer about it.I remember being scared by ads for this film on the radio in November 1968. I think WMCA 570 Khz AM in NYC (home of \"The Good Guys\") played these ads. They contained horrible, jagged, five note (or chord) piano music, between the spoken words \"Night\" and \"of the Living Dead\". The radio ad also contained screams, and the tag line, \"The living ... whose bodies are the only food for these ungodly creatures !\"I remember looking at a TV Guide cover while hearing these ads. The cover showed Robert Morse and E.J. Peaker, stars and co-hosts of the ABC variety show, \"That's Life\" ! The fear I felt from the radio ad made E.J. Peaker's smiling, big-toothed face, surmounted by a blond bangs and pony-tailed hairdo, look horrible and menacing, like that of a vampire. Date that TV Guide cover, and you've dated those radio ads.I didn't see the film in a theater. Still haven't, to this day. I remember a Reader's Digest article about in, I think, their May 1969 issue. It summarized the film, described how children had been scared by it, urged more caution on the part of parents, and suggested that the then-new G M R X rating system may have been of some help, except that the Walter Reade Organization, the film's distributor, refused to subscribe to this system.I first saw the film on ABC TV on a Friday night in mid-March 1973. I found it moderately scary, mostly because I saw it at night. I remember listening to the radio after the film was over, and thinking that the discordant vocalizing in War's single \"The Cisco Kid\", reminded me of the moans of the attacking ghouls in the film. A caller to a radio talk show said he'd just seen the film on TV, and had been sexually aroused by it, urging his fellow listeners to get off in one great orgasm of disgust. The talk show host told him he was sick. A week later, when I attended college orientation, I saw that the newspaper of my college-to-be, had a brief humorous article about the film, with a photo of the face of the half-eaten \"lady upstairs\".To quote Stephen King, in the film, Romero plays many taboos like a virtuoso, to the hilt. Not only of course cannibalism, being burned alive, necrophilia, matricide, patricide, fratricide, and sister-cide, but : a white woman at first apparently alone in a house at night with a black man, and a blond white woman, at that. When Ben puts the unconscious Barbara on a couch, then unbuttons and unbelts her overcoat to help her breathe more easily, does the racist in us ask : is he going to fondle, molest, rape her ? No, he's a man of honor, and too focused on barricading himself into the house to protect himself and Barbara against the marauding ghouls.The film has a great economy of effect. Romero scares us, not only with the ghouls, but by making the \"good guys\" look grotesque also. There's Barbara's bulging forehead, high hairline, and weak chin. The black smudge on Harry Cooper's bald pate, that suggests a bullet hole. The sudden successive view of animal heads mounted on a den wall is reminiscent of a later scene, in a museum, in the \"Escape Route\" segment of the \"Night Gallery\" pilot TV movie.In her review of \"The Exorcist\" for The New Yorker, Pauline Kael commented on the novel it was based on, remarking that, what Blatty did not have his characters do, he had them talk about, thereby providing flip-page torture, cannibalism, sadism, and lycanthropy. Romero does something similar in NOTLD, with the voices of the radio and, later, TV, announcers, speaking of victims showing signs of having been partially devoured (thereby confirming our worst fears concerning the half-eaten face of the lady upstairs, with its exposed eyeball, teeth, and gums, reminiscent of Bert I. Gordon's \"The Cyclops\") and of the corpse in the morgue from which the limbs had been amputated, which, nonetheless, opened its eyes, and tried to move its trunk.There is also Ben's story of what happened to him at Beekman's Diner, all the more horrific, because we know its sole audience is the in-shock, and, at best, half-comprehending, Barbara. It also foreshadows Tom and Judy's fate in the ill-fated truck later on.Speaking of \"The Exorcist\", junior ghoul Karen Cooper's trowel attack on her mother both prefigures and surpasses Regan MacNeil's attack on her mother in \"The Exorcist\", albeit without self-mutilation with a crucifix, followed by an invitation to cunnilingus and mother-daughter oral incest. One can't have everything, but, as a bonus and an aside, note the taboos that Blatty played like a virtuoso in HIS novel and film. Humor ? Sure. Mostly the sheriff, and his numbnuts posse : \"Get a club or a torch, beat 'em or burn 'em.\" \"Kill the brain, and you kill the ghoul !\" \"These ghouls are slow-moving ?\" \"Yeah, they're dead, they're ... all messed up !\"Unanswered questions : who was the half-eaten lady upstairs, and how did she get there ? Where did all the ghouls that laid siege to the farmhouse come from, and why was there an ever-increasing number of them ? Did they come from the cemetery where Barbara's father was buried ? Did they unearth themselves ? They would have had a long walk ... er, lurch ... from the nearest hospital, morgue, or funeral home, to the abandoned farm house, and would have sought closer victims in adjacent towns and cities first.",

One of the most powerful,shocking,disturbing,well made,& black humored tales of the turbulent 60's,compared this to such tame,wimpy,mainstream garbage like Scream to see what I mean.Romero pulls no punches & really delivers the goods.The beginning has to be the best part,Romero has us set up to believe Johnny will be the hero of the piece,only to have the tables turn on him,and considering what happens to Johnny,his return towards the end is shocking & surprising,an image of terror that is surely one of horror cinema's best.Plus what happens to Barbara is even more surprising,we except her to get over her brother's death in a matter of minutes & do everthing she can to kill the ghouls & get out of the house(a mistake that was unwisely made in the worthless remake)She however does not,instead she withdraws into a catonic state,believing Johnny is alive even though she witnessed his demise,and at one point,even attempting to run out of the safety of the farmhouse!!!You have to give credit to Romero for making the brave & wise decision of having the lead hero being black,which was unheard of back then,unfortunately since then,it seems every time we see a black person in a horror movie,they are always the first to get killed off. The ending still packs a punch,turning the tables on all those cliche endings of the 50's & 60's.Your best bet is to seek out the out of print Elite DVD,it was made from the original negative & is THX approved.Also available in two different colorized versions,one from the now defunct Hal Roach Studios,the other a more recent release from CST.If you must watch the color version,go with CST/Best.

            "content": "I just purchased Russo's 30th anniversary Night on VHS as well as Romero's original (also on VHS). I was very impressed with Anchor Bay's remastering of the video quality on both versions. I liked the way they started showing Romero's version non-remastered, then stopped and re-started with the higher quality video for comparison. It was _well_ worth my 6.99, and I am quite impressed with the difference between it and the crappy EP-recorded tape I got about 5 years ago.Now on to Russo's \"updated\" pile. Although it was interesting to see that Bill Hinzman looks almost the same now as he did in '68 (he probably needs less make-up now LOL), the new introductory footage was useless, and detracted from the surprise beginning of the original Night. This is one instance where Hitchcock's definition of suspense is outweighed by the initial shock of our first encounter with one of the walking dead. The idea of a priest/minister in 1968 who looks like a 1999 gang-banger is a little too farfetched even for my overactive imagination, and Scott Licina's limited musical skills were at least better than his acting.This segues into the new musical soundtrack. I didn't think Licina's new music was horrible, but I did think that the poor engineering that was used to replace the old music helped to even further ruin what was once a wonderful, scary film. The stock music of Romero's original helped add to the eerie atmosphere, and it was obvious that the original soundtrack was not easy to change, and that the separate dialogue, effects, and music tracks of the original were not available. There are very audible level changes when the original soundtrack levels were reduced to mask the original music. You can also hear the difference in the sound effects at these same points. This is because the new audio editor (Russo himself?) could not separate the old music from the dialogue and effects.I don't think it was a waste of my time to view Mr. Russo's attempt at what he thought was making a great film even better, but I will not recommend that anyone else sit through it, especially not someone who has not seen the original masterpiece.Remember, the opinions are mine, although anyone else can see (and hear) the factual observations I have made.Dave / Splatter",

All I will say is if you haven't seen this film yet or it's sequels, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead, rent or buy all three and watch them in order as a triple feature.And keep your fingers crossed for the fourth in the series (either to be titled Dead Reckoning or the MUCH BETTER and more in tradition of the series title TWILIGHT OF THE DEAD).",

I had seen it a number of years back, and recall not being to interested.I must have been tired when I saw it last.  This is a very good movie.  Yes, the acting leaves something to be desired, but the overall effect and impact of the film is excellent. I was grossed out, shocked, analytical and impressed all about.  I could not wait to discover what would happen next, in an almost Hitchcockian fashion, and engrossed once the action got going.I usually expect influential films to be somewhat passe, with the themes, shots and ambience stolen by other directors.  I had thought this would be such a film, that I might look at and say \"Okay, this was used by so-and-so and that was done by this guy way better in '87\". Not so.  I can't think of a more interesting gore film ever done.  Better horror, perhaps, but gore? No way.  This is definitive.",

            "content": "The zombie genera is something that has invaded human consciousness. It has gone from Romero's Living Dead franchise, to the likes of The Walking Dead and Zombeavers. There have been few constants between the films as the zombie films evolved; the clueless blonde who lacks the basic concept of human preservation. It's a common trope of the blonde dying first. It was introduced with Barbra in Night of the Living Dead. She went into shock, and almost stopped caring what happened to her. She ignored everything else going on, because she saw her brother. She willingly walked into the arms of the largest threat of the film. She lacked any sense of self preservation.Overall, it was a watchable film. It leaves you curious if they will be able to survive the zombie apocalypse. It is a good jumping off point for the genera. It has things that became classics. Zombies are afraid of fire. The dead rise again. It's things that have become mainstays of zombie films.",

I saw it with a group of about 300 other GI's under the stars one clear night.  About half way through the film (having gotten to the good part ...) the film broke. Since it couldn't be fixed, it was about 15 years before I saw the film in its entirety to its inevitable conclusion.Basic Plot:  In the near future a \"plague\" comes to the world. It is the story of several couples and how they come to realize what is happening, how to deal with and overcome the effects the plague, and what befalls each of them.What makes this film so entertaining is that [like El Mariachi (1992)] it is a low-budget film from someone with a story to tell in which the acting isn't as nearly important as the story-line (Plot, plot, plot).It is the story of some one's apocalyptic millennium-nightmare come true. Remember the old saying, \"Be careful what you wish for, it may surely come true.\"  So the next time you see this film kiddies, sleep tight and don't let the bed bugs bite!Rating:  10 out of 10 stars",

The score was fantastic, as was the Atmosphere. The Setting of the Old Farmhouse in the middle of nowhere was fantastic - And looked real creepy at night. This movie also featured the first Black Actor in a leading role in a Horror movie, and the man did a fantastic job giving the best performance out of ANY of the characters in any of the Dead movies. Anyway, in conclusion, this is must see for anyone who wants to consider themselves a REAL fan of Horror movies. Pass on the sequels though as they drag on with pointless Dialogue and provide no scares whatsoever.",

            "review_title": "Night of the Living Dead is a true classic!",
            "content": "George A George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead! This movie is what could be considered the bridge between the classic horror movies and the more blood soaked modern movies; for the reasons that it's in black and white and still keeps the classic tone but at the same time adds more violence, a focus on the humans and of course the horror craze that is: The Zombie. Yes that's right for those of you that don't know, Night of the Living Dead is considered to have created the modern zombie. This movie completely shocked audiences at the time, its was unlike anything they've ever seen! Now for the review, the movie starts in a graveyard, one of the main staples of horror films, your given very little set up and then BAM! Zombies attack. Its great because it catches you off guard much like the characters in the film. Then really quickly your projected into a lone house on the plains, this is were the movie turns from good to downright masterpiece. This is when more and more characters start to be revealed, the writing of these characters is just great, sounds very much like real people talking/arguing. The movie is also a good character study showing how people's true selves are shown in a time of complete chaos. My favorite of the characters being Ben mainly because he's the only person who looks at reason. The zombies (although never called zombies) are the monsters of this movie, now compared to today's zombie they're very very different, this also goes back to the movies violence at the time it was just unrelentingly gory, now though it's very tame. Many of the scenes in this movie are iconic, from zombies just moping around to \"They're coming to get you Barbra\". Two more things I'm going to talk about, first being the ending. Night of the Living Dead's ending is one of the greatest movie shockers of all time, I'm not going to spoil it but it's a brilliant twist. And the final thing I'll talk about is : the movie's impact. The movie was incredibly influential again with the violence but also that it dealt with a big issue at the time, Civil Rights. The main character of this movie was a black man back in 1968 that was unheard of, but George A. Romero went ahead and made it happen. In the end Night of the Living Dead is as of now the best movie I have reviewed for The Movie Guy's Halloween Horror Movie Spectacular 2013 with it being a excellent movie with great witting, good horror and shocks, Night of the Living Dead gets a 9.6 out of 10. Pretty good for a cheap little public domain movie, and actually because its public domain you can watch it right now for free legally. Here's the link to watch it if you have an hour and a half to kill: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeFRPBW07SA",

Special effects aren't all there is to a good movie, after all. There are many great things about this movie, and many of the underlying concepts are great, and the movie came at an interesting point in history for these to be given to the public, in my opinion. Even if you don't like horror films, zombies, or any of the other things you'd expect to see in a movie like this, you should see it just for its more or less classic elements, such as the aforementioned underlying concepts.I can't wait to see the 90's remake.",

It's kind of the grand-daddy of the modern flesh eating zombie types. Some of the zombie movies that came after this one became a bit corny or comedic. This movie takes things very seriously. There are some obvious things that make this movie work so well for me. It's well acted, excellently paced, and scary. However it's the less obvious things that make this movie classic material. First, Night Of The Living Dead is about rampaging zombies but, it is also about human nature, human interaction, and ultimately human failing. The troubles that the main human characters get into is as much the result of there own failings as people as it is the fault of the zombies. The movie is disturbing to me because I have a almost constant feeling of hopelessness and dread. It's not a happy movie but, it's a great movie and very effective!! If anyone has not seen this film, please give it a watch. It really does deserve the title of Classic!!  8 out of 10",

While things are made much harder by the constant bickering between the two oldest men in the house. The overall outlook & feel of the film is grim & cynical, & that's definitely what Romero was going for.

            "content": "I am almost embarrassed to admit that it has taken me this long to watch George A. Romero's directorial debut, often attributed with revolutionising horror and reinventing zombies in film. Better late than never, they say.If only the film's characters were afforded precious time. Ben, the struggling leader of seven survivors are thrown into the refuge of a farm house surrounded by a growing pack of zombies. Although the characters are completely flat and lack any development, the mix of stereotypes and qualities provides an entertaining mix.The viewer cannot help but pity the poor, helpless survivors. Frequent broadcasts reveal an ongoing national resistance, with the help of doctors, NASA and the police force. Conversely, our survivors are isolated with nothing more than a shotgun, a few slugs and an array of very hate-able useless individuals who slow down the overall progress of the group.Another welcomed theme throughout the movie was the gradual reclusion of Ben. Venturing from the country, he seeks refuge in the farm house and is eventually driven to a dim basement shared with a monster child. By this stage, sheer desperation is the only thing left to cling to.Entering this film, I knew that the previous viewing of countless zombie films would provide prejudice. Half of the fear of living dead in film has always been, at least for me, their visual awe. A man chasing another man is generally nothing special, but it is when he only has half a face. With that said, I was amazed at the genuine terror invoked through the almost cosmetic- free walkers in Night of the Living Dead. Accompanying great strides and power in numbers was a score that provided real shock-value.Put down your 28s and Walkin Dead discs and pull out the godfather of zombie films. It won't create nightmares and it can be safely watched at night on your own, but it is a decent film nonetheless. Considering the era and available technologies, Romero should be regarded as a genius.Read more of my reviews at http://silvertonguereviews.wordpress.com/",

The commentary by Mike Nelson of Mystery Science Theater 3000 is well worth the price of the DVD but the restored black and white version and creatively colorized version (both on the same disk) makes this a must have release. The special Mike Nelson autographed version is available while supplies last but the special version can only be ordered on the Legend Films web site.Rosemary Horvath, Creative Director of Legend Films and Barry Sandrew, President of Legend Films were the color designers of the film. The attempt was to create an uneasy feel to the overall film with moonlight filling most dark rooms and greenish yellow zombies. The fire scenes look photo realistic and add to the film's tension.This film was originally shot in black and white for budgetary reasons and there is little in the way of cinematographic strategy that precludes a colorized version. The viewer has a choice on this Legend Films DVD release to view Night Of The Living Dead in restored black and white or in the new colorized version. The Legend Films colorization process used on this cult classic is the most sophisticated ever produced and has been used on such films as Scorcese's \"The Aviator\", Mark of Zorro, \"Heidi\" \"Miracle on 34th Street\", \"Reefer Madness\" \"House on Haunted Hill\", \"Carnival of Souls\" and many other classics.",

Its lost some of its power to shock, but has still stood the test of time perfectly.We start out with Johnny and his sister Barbara at a cemetery to place a wreath on their father's grave. This is just where the story starts but is one of the best scenes in film history. What follows is an adventure that's more than just a popcorn horror fare. It speaks to the audience, people, about our reactions to crisis scenarios. Its scary to this day, I myself prefer the slow moving zombies who lurch forward at an inch per hour.Of course the film centers around 7 people in the farmhouse, wading off the zombies hoping simply to get out and survive. They all have the same goals, but we can see the chaotic ways they set out to accomplish them. It was a perfect movie for the time it was released, even speaking on some levels about the racism in everyday situations in America. The effects may look cheesy but they are just a subplot, as are the zombies themselves. The zombies still are effective in how they are shown and portrayed, and the end is both disturbing and realistic, a harrowing touch of 60's reality to an otherwise 'fantasy' element type film.In summary its the perfect zombie film to start off a generation of zombie films. It speaks on a grand scale to audiences and still is just as good today as it always has been. See it at all costs even if you're not a fan of this type of stuff. One final word of advice, never see the ridiculous 30th Anniversary Edition. Just hope you can find an original copy of the original film.",

A 4-mile walk, at 1130 PM and passing the classic local grave yard. Good Grief, I had no idea how two ten year boys could possibly survive the battle that was certainly coming at that grave yard. We were holding sticks to battle the dead. Dreadful (ya know, we may have been both killed that night).For the next five to six years, I would check behind doors as I entered rooms - silly, but true. Of course I had never seen a movie like this, and I don't think anybody else in the movie house had either. I enjoyed it, because it scared the hell out me and I think it may have been the best and longest lasting results for 50 cents I ever received. I was not effected by a movie in this manner again, until I saw \"The Shining\". Brilliant!",

But you know, it's like wanting to watch a film for the special effects, and choose \"the classic\" from the 30's or something. The problem is indeed that this film isn't scary or anything at all. The dead people looks like alive humans, really, and it isn't scary, maybe only in the beginning. I would recommend someone that is into zombies to watch this, but don't expect to feel involved. I didn't feel for the characters and didn't get into the mood, like I easily do in many films. The only positive thing I can think of is that one of the characters is black, that's good for a film this old. Other than that, Zombiefilms have absolutely gotten much better with time. Especially for someone like me who loves the splattering of blood and scary-looking dead people. \"Night of the Living Dead\" definitely don't give us that. No blood at all, as I recall, actually.",

But up until recently, I had thought that George Romero and John Russo were the originators of what some here have described as a Classic influential movie, but is it really? I think not! Prior to Night Of The Living Dead, William Leicester and Richard Matheson wrote The Last Man on Earth that in 1964 was turned into a movie, and directed by Ubaldo Ragona. This was the classic that influenced Night Of The Living Dead. It stars Vincent Price who is subjected to the very same terror as Duane Jones suffers as Ben in Night Of The Living Dead. The script for The Last Man On Earth was far superior and there is much more substance to that movie. I still rate Night Of The living Dead a Ten, but a classic it is not other than the dead come up from out of the ground and coffins, but Dracula had also done that!",

            "content": "Zombies have never been more popular than they are now and we have Night Of The Living Dead to thank for that. While not the first zombie movie, it is the first that defined zombies as living dead flesh eaters. Previous movies depicted zombies as people under voodoo spells.What I like about the story is that it's never revealed what causes the zombies to rise up. Sure, they mention a theory involving a space probe returning from Venus being deliberately exploded in the Earth's atmosphere when radiation was detected. However, they never reveal whether that is true or not. I think it's scarier not knowing the actual cause.One of the most charming aspects about this film is that it looks older than it actually happens to be. To put it in perspective, Night Of The Living Dead was released in 1968 - the same year as 2001: A Space Odyssey. If one were to view those films side-by-side, you would probably think they weren't made in the same decade; let alone the same year.It's not exactly a technical masterpiece in terms of editing. Often there are scenes that are supposed to take place at night but were clearly shot during daytime and vice versa. There's also a very noticeable jump cut during a conversation between Harry and Helen in the basement.The makeup effects are very subtle. Part of this is likely due to having a low budget, but also because they establish that these are the recently deceased. These are not rotting corpses that climbed out of their grave. Tom Savini had originally signed on to do the makeup effects, but had to pull out when he was called to duty by the US Army to serve as a combat photographer in Vietnam. On one hand, I can't help but wonder how Savini would have done the zombie makeup. On the other hand, perhaps being a witness to real horrors of The Vietnam War helped him become such an amazing horror makeup effects artist.Many people think there is a commentary about racism hidden in this movie. While I can see where people get that impression, it's my understanding that George A. Romero didn't intend that. When he and John A. Russo were writing the story, they didn't plan on making the character black. They simply hired the best actor for the part of Ben. Duane Jones (Ben) thought that the movie should promote that fact that it was one of the first movies with a black lead actor, but Romero thought it was better that they didn't (a decision he's apparently had some second thoughts about).One of the most beautiful things about this film is that it's in the public domain, so it's very easy to find and watch for free. This is due to a copyright error. Originally, the film was supposed to be called Night Of Anubis (the Egyptian god associated with the afterlife), but it was decided to change the title because not many people understood what it was referencing. The title was then changed to Night Of The Flesh Eaters. When it was discovered that there was already a film with \"Flesh Eaters\" in the title, the filmmakers decided to change the title again to avoid being confused with that movie. The title was finally changed to Night Of The Living Dead. However, when they made the new title frames for Night Of The Dead, the film distributor forgot to put the copyright notice on it.I don't want to spoil anything, but if you're looking for a film where the heroes walk off into the sunset after vanquishing the living dead, this is not the film for you. The tone of Night Of The Living Dead is very somber from the beginning to the very end. I saw this when I was younger and was upset with the way it ended. Now that I've watched it a few more times, I can appreciate just how gutsy the writers were.Without question, this is a classic. It has been selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry. It's a film that should be appreciated not only by horror fans, but film fans in general. It's a perfect demonstration that you don't need a large budget to make a great film - just some creativity and originality. It will continue to live on through new fans who will discover it's infectious storytelling...much like a zombie.",

The story, the acting, the pacing, and the effects are all spot-on.To me, \"Night of the Living Dead\" feels like an extended version of a Twilight Zone episode. It has the same black and white, long-shot cinematography, and the setting is the same conservative 50-60s America. As in \"The Twilight Zone,\" there is an unexplained phenomenon, a small group of people who react to it, and a twist/shocking ending. I am actually surprised that Rod Serling had nothing to do with it.George Romero did his best work here. Although I am a fan of the whole series, I personally believe that the quality of his films has gradually gone down. Every film of the Dead series is fun in its own way, but each one is a little inferior to the one that preceded it.\"Night of the Living Dead\" is a breakthrough, standard-setting film. It is best watched late at night with the lights turned down low. You will not be disappointed, unless you are one of those CGI-spoiled, every-scene-has-to-be-constant-frenetic-action kind of persons. Don't get me wrong, this film delivers the thrills, but it also has an actual story that makes you think. In other words, Michael Bay didn't direct it.Romero intends for his films not only to entertain, but also to cause us to think more deeply about the world we live in and the human kind that inhabits it.",

Of course, those who prefer the original soundtrack will not be satisfied by this and should avoid this DVD at all costs.Both Editions have (per the booklet) the same soundtrack. This appears to be literally the case, and may be the primary reason why the 30th AE has so much footage missing -- so much that, if you do not know the original, you probably will not be able to follow the story!

            "content": "OK, so one day in 1968, George Romero makes what can only be described as the best horror film ever made. 30 years later, the crew who succeeded in getting nowhere try to remake a few tit bits in the vain hope that they can pull in a bit more cash off Romero's back. In the process they manage to totally betray and ruin Romero's apocalyptic vision, and totally take away the dry satire of a world gone mad. NOTLD was never about zombies to me, it was always about the ineptitude of the human race and their inability to deal with a common enemy, instead using each other as scapgoats. Well this version is about zombies. The tacked on scenes stick out like \"well i don't know what\" (to quote one of the less moronic statements from the new characters) and the acting is simply atrocious. The directing of the new scenes not only gets undermimed by the original film, but totally shown up by it. You would have thought that 30 years down the line they would have learnt how to string a few infantile shots together and at the same time be able to deliver a line without sounding like they are improvising. But no! While Romero himself went off to create the most amazingly intelligent films, these people, obviously stuck in the past, run back to their old franchise just to be embarrassed by Romero's footage in spectacular fashion. The new music has, to me, turned the film into a 90's slasher flick, not making it eerie, but rather cheesy and sad. The seemingly silent cinema story telling of the original has been insulted with a bizarre arse-fest of cheap keyboard effects. Even more insulting, was the supposed \"long awaited sequel\" that Russo financed off the back of this film, completely ignoring Romero's Dead trilogy and trying to claim it as his own! If I was Romero, I'd slap him down like the girl he is.",

He did it and it became one of my favorite horror movies. With such a low budget this could've been a laughable cheesy comedy. The movie begins with Barbara and tom they are brother and sister. They came up to visit the graves and got there late because tom didn't wake up early enough. He messes with her saying they're coming to get you and points at a clumsy confused wanderer approaching them slowly. Barbara walks up to the man to apologize for toms immature behavior. He grabs her and cries for toms help. He fights the wanderer but tom is knocked out by hitting his head on a gravestone on the ground. Barbara runs away as fast as she can. She takes the car but couldn't find the keys and then realizes that they're in toms coat pocket. The wanderer pursues her nd Barbara hits the car into neutral rolling down a hill while steering. She crashes into a tree and runs to a house locking everything up still in fright of zombie and her brother. She meets Ben a black fellow who is very resourceful and boards up the house. He makes plans and discovers two couples and a child in the basement. One man wants to stay in the cellar with hid injured daughter and wife while the other couple choose to stay upstairs. Ben and the bald man have made many disputes about plans and stuff. The news tell people to stay indoors and the zombies will die from a gunshot to a head or fire. The zombies come from a radiated spacecraft that crashed into earth releasing radiation to bring the dead to life to feed of human flesh. The other man who looks like Matt Leblanc goes outside with Ben with his wife chasing along to fuel the car outside and get help for the others. The gas leaked onto the car and Ben's torch to avoid the zombies lights up the car with the man and wife in. They try to escape but the car explodes before they killing them. Ben retreats indoors wear the bald headed man locked behind him. The bald man stands at the cellar door staring at the door as Ben is begging to come in. Ben smashes open the door staring at the bald man in the eye and beats him up. The number of zombies increase by the hundreds. The lights go out and the zombies start to break down the barriers and Barbara and the bald mans wife to block the door while the bald man and Ben take the windows. The bald man takes the gun but aims at Ben because he feels Ben is dooming them all. The barricade at the door broke and the first zombie Barbara sees is tom and cries and stands still and dies. Ben sees the gun pointed and fights of the man and shoots him. He stumbles downstairs to his daughter and dies. The wife runs downstairs in fright to see her daughter eating her father's corpse. She cries and lets her daughter stab her to death. Ben is the only one left. The girl goes upstairs and Ben tosses her aside and travels to the cellar. He blocks the doors and is afraid. Just before the door js knocked down, daybreak hit and the zombies left. The mother zombie and father zombie were killed by Ben immediately. Ben wakes up and looks out the window and gets shot in the head mistakenly took for a zombie. The govern,ent assigned men on the streets with guns to go out and kill all the zombies they could find that was setup through the night. The end. The writing was superb and was very intense and I loved it. Watch it",

Even if the scenes of ghouls feasting on human flesh (shocking by 1968 movie standards but tame by todays)had been eliminated and simply implied, this would still be a frightening little gem. Like I said, this movie is fueled by 100% atmosphere. Everything Romero does in this movies direction adds to its sense of dread, be it the black and white filming , the gloomy rural Pennsylvania location or the stock music, all ad to the movies power. From start to finish the tension never lets up and there is nothing in the movie that allow for release. There is no romantic interlude no comic relief. NOTHING. The viewer is left feeling as hopeless as the doomed, trapped occupants of the farmhouse. Had Romero been a Hollywood director, working for a big studio, this film would have never seen the light of day in its current form. It just didn't fit the accepted formula for horror films at that time. This all the more makes the low budget and independent nature of the film so important. Had this been a Hollywood release, it would probably have been just another lame horror movie with a nice formulaic and comfortable ending. One of the few weak points in the script that should have been left out is the explanation for the undead phenomena. In fact Romero never tread that ground again in any of his follow up \"dead\" movies. The whole Venus probe thing just seemed too simplistic and easy an explanation. No explanation would be scarier. In all this is probably the greatest horror movie of all time. A timeless classic.",

We are given some new scenes in the classic horror film which are directed by John Russo, a stellar screenwriter, but an only semi-competent director.The prologue is fun for fans who have already seen the original film. Establishing an origin for the cemetary zombie is really really cool. However, for new viewers of the film, it ruins the first terrifying aspect of the original film.  The fact that Johnny says to Barbara \"They're coming to get you, Barbara\" and then the Hinzman zombie really is one of \"them\" is lost in this version, which is a shame.  That sequence was terrifying in the original NOTLD.The new scenes at Beakman's diner are the best new sequences in the film. They fit with the original and are a fun addition.  It is great to trace the path of a bunch of zombies from the diner that Ben encountered them in to the house in the woods.By far the worst and most blasphemous addition to the film is the epilogue. We are treated to a scene that is supposed to be \"1 year after\" NOTLD.  A terrifying aspect of the original version is that the authorities do not have this horrific plague under control, and that this night we have witnessed is the first night of the end of the world.  By setting this scene a year later, we feel cheated, and the entire murky resolution of the original film is cheapened and ruined.  Are horror fans also to belive that Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead, which should fit in after this movie's chronology, didn't happen?  I'm not ready to do that myself.As for the score, it is allright but would fit better if all of the other pieces of music were removed from the film.  Having some of the library music remain in the movie is too much of a contrast with the synthesizer heavy new score.On the whole some aspects of the new movie are fun, but Russo and co. could have done better.",

He wasn't trying to change the world.  He just wanted to make the best movie he could for the money available.  He went out and hired local actors for the film (including Tom Savini, who had to drop out when he was called to service in Vietnam.  Boy, would this experience pay off when he came back to the States and create his trademark effects!).The group of people in the farmhouse Romero created was eclectic; a common-sense hero, a hysterical young woman, a no-nonsense middle-aged man and his sympathetic wife along with their daughter, and a young couple experiencing puppy love.  The hero, played by Duane Jones, is not portrayed as black or white.  He just happens to be a man brought to the house by happenstance.  He has no political agenda, no idealistic dreams.  Just a man running from a diner that was taken over by ghouls.  As he describes what happened at the diner to a comatose Barbara, you imagine the horror those unfortunate people went through as they were being torn apart and eaten alive.  The fuel truck being overturned.  The driver being dragged out of the cab and being mangled and chewed on by things that look human but are not.  It makes you feel that you were actually there witnessing the carnage. This is a very descriptive scene that implies the horror that not only the ordeal others had but the fate that lies ahead for the others.The indoor scenes are dramatic and powerful.  Conflicts upon conflicts are piled on as decisions are made and then changed as to protect themselves from the ghouls.  Should they try to stand and fight the onslaught?  Should they try to flee to the next town deemed safe by TV anchors?  Or should they hide and barricade themselves in the cellar.  All three options are tried to some extent.  For those who haven't seen the film, I will give no details.The stark b & w footage only adds the to atmosphere of film, as when the ghouls are seen walking through the woods at night are scenes from your nightmares.  The close-ups of the ghouls eating the flesh of the living is vivid and mindnumbing.  There are some amateurish shots also, as when Ben is bent over the body of a ghoul he just killed.  You can see Romero's hand waving Jones to move on and out of the scene.  This is the only glaring mistake I can see through the film.You can tell that Romero was influenced by old horror comic books like `Tales from the Crypt', which had several stories of the walking dead.  The idea of taking this concept and turning the ghouls into flesh eaters was a stroke of genius.  He wanted to create a sense of doom and he succeeded.The only complaint I have with the film is the casting of Barbara.  Her cantonic and amateurish acting is the only guff I have to an otherwise excellent film.  If you are looking for some serious social commentary, watch the higher budgeted but just as entertaining `Dawn of the Dead' and `Day of the Dead', which drags at the beginning but concludes with a slam bang finish.",

For example I think it's strange that it becomes night within minutes, or that Ben arrives in his truck while Barbara and we the audience are getting blinded, after that Ben jumps out of nowhere and the camera holds onto his face causing a kind of awkward scene. Another thing that annoys me is how annoying Barbara is. Now that I've said what I don't like about the movie I should say what I liked more in the og then in the remake.The movie comes straight to the point,in the og they immediately nail the doors and windows shut and look up the stairs, in the remake it took them more than a while to do both, another thing that I liked more is how we've been shown more of the other survivors that we see trough out the movie in the television.My conclusion is that the original \"Night of the living dead\" is a good movie, I can understand why it is a classic and why people prefer this one over the remake, but sometimes you have to watch movies at least twice to really make an opinion for yourself about it, therefore my opinion about the og might change in the future.",

            "content": "Night of the Living Dead was released in 1968 and is George A Romero's first feature film and kind of the first 'proper' zombie film in a way. It certainly was the first to establish the tried and tested 'zombie rules' (shoot them in the head/ destroy the brain to kill them, zombies eat human flesh, if you're bitten by a zombie you become one, etc, etc). Looking at the film today with our modern eye balls, it may not seem that impressive or scary and I can imagine teenagers today shunning it out of the room with their I-pads (or whatever) because it's black and white and it's not that gory. The fact is though that this film oozes atmosphere (and other stuff) and is one of the truly great horror films of all time! As in all three of Romero's original (good) 'of-the-dead' trilogy, the characters are believable and the acting and dialogue is of a very high standard. Characters act heroically, freak out and even (in the case of Mr. Cooper) try to screw each other over during the course of the film. The story is brilliantly simple; the dead are returning to life and attacking the living. Nobody is quite sure why and it's never flat out explained what is causing this to happen (although it is hinted at in on-screen ongoing news reports). The film starts off with Barbara and her Brother Johnny driving to a grave yard in Pennsylvania to visit their father's grave to pay their respects. They spot a man staggering about and Johnny starts teasing his sister as she grows more afraid of the suspicious character. After taunting her continuously (\"They're coming to get you Barbara!\") the staggering stranger staggers over and attacks them killing Johnny in the struggle\u0085which is staggering! Barbara runs, drives and runs again from the particularly persistent perished person until she reaches the relative safety of an abandoned farmhouse. By this point she's basically 'lost it' and can't really look after herself. Luckily, Ben (the 'hero' of the film) drives up to the house in a pick up truck and saves her from some straggling zombie menace! They come across a few extra survivors already, um\u0085surviving in the house and they eventually decide to work together (after much shouting) and start to board up the windows and barricade the doors. Things seem to be going well when, of course, the inevitable happens and everything goes to hell! Ben and Tom (one of the other survivors) try to refuel the pick up truck, spill some petrol and the whole thing blows up, killing Tom! Cooper's infected daughter goes all 'zombie' and kills him and his wife stabbing them with a garden trowel (which is a little un-zombie like). Barbara -who has completely lost it by now- sees her now zombified brother in the attacking undead crowd and is distracted and confused enough to be swept away in the zombie tide and presumably munched to little black and white bits. Ben manages to flee down into the cellar, finish off the zombie Cooper family and lock himself safely inside. He emerges in the morning and (not wanting to spoil the famously bleak ending \u2013 but doing so anyway) is mistaken for a zombie by some redneck hunters and shot in the head! To sum up then\u0085this is a classic, important horror/ zombie movie which bravely broke certain horror traditions, like having an ending that was a bit of a downer, what with all of the main characters being killed and all. Another important aspect of this film is that the main protagonist is a black man. This might not seem like such a big deal these days, but at the time it was a positive, important step in racial equality\u0085well\u0085racial equality in films anyway, and I think it is to be genuinely applauded. Basically, I think everyone knows of or has seen this film (several times probably) but if for some reason you haven't\u0085or\u0085haven't\u0085you definitely, um should\u0085\u0085\u0085.so there!",

            "content": "Armed with about $100,000 and a cheap camera, George A. Romero set out to make a movie that would redefine the horror genre. The plot is rather simple; due to a satellite crash from Venus spreading radiation, the dead rise and feast of the flesh of the living. A group of survivors hold up in a farmhouse and try to survive the night. As the movie goes on, people learn the rules: 1. Anyone who dies (with a brain still intact) will rise again. 2. If a zombie bites someone, they will die from the infection and then rise again. 3. A zombie can only be destroyed by brain damage, be it a gun shot or a tire iron. The acting and dialogue leave much to be desired, but hey, it's Romero's first and low budget. What's important about this movie is the effect it had on movies after it. Instead of the cheesy predictability of earlier horror movies, Night of the Living Dead brought in new ideas, broke all the old \"rules\" of horror. Instead of an easy to spot antagonist, this movie has everyone as the monster. Each and every person, regardless of merit, has a chance to become a zombie. Even those still alive pose some threat. Instead of the monster being destroyed at the end, they become stronger. The hero's story ends with a shock (no, it's not racist). Everything that has been established before this movie is shot down. Alright, I admit it, some parts do get boring. Many of the dialogue scenes inside the farmhouse and long and drawn-out, but this I attribute to the budget and actors. Every other part of the movie is relentless in pace, however. You can watch it for the importance or you can watch it for the entertainment, both ways work.",

            "content": "I must say, I was expecting to be disappointed. I am by no means a fan of Zombie movies, Plus as much as this movie was hyped, how could it live up to expectations? Surprisingly, it has held up over time. The Ghouls as they are called (According to a recent interview Romero doesn't consider, Zombie to be an applicable term) are surprisingly creepy.The general plot is that for unknown reasons, The dead are walking and behaving like animals. While the movie puts forth the theory that the epidemic is being caused by an alien radiation, The actual cause of this horrific invasion are never determined. In the end, The dead are walking, Who cares why? What's most poignant about this movie is how the Ghouls compare to today's overly saturated zombie market. These Ghouls demonstrate basic problem solving skills, no emotion whatsoever, and, unprecedented for a Zombie movie, a sense of self preservation.This coupled with the notion that any and all dead will rise and attack the living, makes the Ghoulish hoard a credible threat for an unprepared populace.The weakest part is probably the human characters. While this movie is noteworthy for having a black man as the lead actor, The characters do little more than bicker over where to hide. It's the sort of problem that even for stressed people, should have been easy to fix as both points were valid. But hey, it gives us our controversy, however trivial.The ending is the part I really took issue with. And while I won't spoil it if you haven't seen it, It's one of those pointless and easily avoidable bad endings that not only does nothing for the drama, but trivializes the whole movie.Still, it's worth checking out this classic, and discovering what made the Zombie Genre what it is today.",

The photography is great so the fact that it is in black and white doesn't matter at all. It gets slow in the middle of it, when the movie is showing character traits.

Nowadays acclaimed cult-director George A. Romero directed this masterpiece with only $114.000 available to him and made it into a black & white movie in stead of the upcoming color movies available with the new color TV...The story about a band of people being trapped in a farmhouse fencing off a horde of bloodthirsty zombies is in itself simple enough. Where the movie stands out is in it's dark atmosphere and mood set by the use of black and white footage and eerie music Romero got from an audio library! The element of the small group of people against what it seems the forces of nature (actually a UFO radiation accident!) has the viewer enthusiastically rally on the side of the group. Also, the interaction between the people themselves (from the start dividing them into 2 camps) is in itself a nice portrait of human society.Some of the stars of the movie (including Mr. Cooper) were investors providing Romero with his budget...this also donates to the overall feel of the movie...Night of the Living Dead is a true classic in its genre...watch it with lights out and the sound up....!!!",

            "content": "Night of the Living Dead, as has been said a million times by a million people, is a classic horror film, perhaps the definitive film of it's particular genre, and a milestone in independent filmaking.Night of the Living Dead is the first in what has come be known as the 'Dead Trilogy'..consisting of Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and Day of the Dead. Each film was made in a different era, each with a different message, and each reflecting a different theme and different mood. What makes Night of the Living Dead the best of the series, in my opinion, is that theme, and that mood that it envokes. Perhaps more than most or any horror film before it, NOTLD really evokes a claustrophobic, paranoia inducing, carnal fear. It goes beyond the clich\u00e9d scary moments of horror films, in taps in deeper, to the psyche and into the human response.Night of the Living Dead is quintessential zombie movie. The film revolves around the events that surround a group of strangers fighting for survival in a small rural home in western Pennsylvania. The are fighitng for their survival, against hordes of the living dead, who have arisen from their graves to feed upon the living, brought to life by unknown means.I'll keep the films plot and summary short as to not get too into any spoilers for those who actually may have not seen this film.Night of the Living Dead does a great job of inducing fear and horror through imagery and atmosphere...as opposed to gore blatant violence. Perhaps one of the films biggest strong points is the casting. Each character is portrayed perfectly in their respective sense, and perhaps none are portrayed better than the undead. They truly seem like nothing more than lifeless vessels wandering aimlessly, in pursuit of human flesh.Many people have often since discounted and to some extent removed themselves from their appreciation from this film, as many feel it doesn't hold up as well as many of the in color, splatter fest horror films of today and recent years. I however, feel the films two tone look gives it a great visceral feel, the black and white makes the shadows and darkness of night seem all the more terrifying, with many of the undead seemingly stumbling from the night itself. Also, the film has a great score, which harkens back to b movies and sci fi films of the 50's.All in all, I feel Night of the Living Dead, is the best film to ever center upon the undead. While it may not pack the social impact of it's sequels, or many of the films that it has since it inspires, it does evoke a fear, atmosphere, and lasting memory that is not easily passed.",

Take my advice, simply see the original restored version which looks great...this movie doesn't need the extra stuff. The REAL threat in this movie plot comes not from zombies but from the constant conflict and inability to decide and compromise between the main individuals; being right and in charge becomes more important than escape, the supposed threat- zombies or vampires or earthquakes or whatever- is actually secondary. the true horror comes from the realization that humans do, in fact, behave selfishly when they should be working together. But shame on the creators for the extra and useless footage; it doesn't really detract from the film, but it's annoying to think they did it.

The recent dead are mysteriously resurrecting and attacking the living. They eat their victims. The film's opening sequence is so chilling that it sets the tone for the rest of the picture. The plot involves eight people, who take shelter, in an abandoned farmhouse, from the flesh-eating ghouls. They sit in horror as they listen to the news that most of the nation is under siege from them. The film is relentless in pace throughout, thanks to a well-written narrative, cinema verite' style camera work, and good editing tequnique. The film also has a sense of humor, though not intentional (some of the newscasts will make you chuckle). This comic relief is temporary as the film leads to its tragic and ironic conclusion. George Romero is a truly gifted man. If you've never seen this film, I urge you to do so. I you have...see it again!",

The very smallness of the budget,crew and location makes it seem like a personal experience. When an unexpected disaster happens, we are pretty much on our own. Help may come later, but right now we are thrown back on our own courage, skill, resourcefulness, and judgment. The bigger the emergency, the longer we will remain on our own. Even on the TV broadcasts from the large city of Pittsburgh the newscasters seem nervous, stressed and unsure (for once!) They give the impression that even the city and state are overwhelmed and that everyone is \"making do\" as well. We can expect little help but information and advice from that quarter. On subsequent viewings I remember thinking \"I wonder how much of the budget the helicopter took?\" When they put a big dent in Johnny's Pontiac Lemans, I wonder if it's a rental and they let the insurance pay. I also got out my atlas and checked on all the towns that had relief stations (Including Latrobe, where they make Rolling Rock Beer) just so that I could sorta tell \"where I was.\" (BTW \"Willard\" is NOT a real town.)

            "content": "George A. Romero in this, created a horror masterpiece. This film couldn't possibly be topped in the category of influence. Also this is a message to all the directors out there today. How could you not respect this man, and revere him as one of the best? He did everything in this film! He wrote it, directed it, did the cinematography, and edited it. You'd think with all of that work on your hands you'd have a piece that lacked quality, well think again. Barbra travels to the countryside with her brother to visit her mothers grave and pay their respects. Within a few minutes Barbra is fleeing into an abandoned farmhouse, being chased by zombies that killed her brother, and now want her! Barbra once in the farmhouse realizes that the house had already been cleaned out by the dead. Ben comes in to make the save, and with no vehicle, and a multitude of zombies approaching the house. They have no choice but to settle in and try to survive and hope to escape out of this predicament with their lives. As the movie advances we are introduced to more survivors that need shelter in the house, which sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Romero's ability to capture this feeling of utter and total despair and a loss of hope is breath taking. His cinematography captures eeriness, and throughout the entire film will creep you out. The complete anguish of dark, and even by the time the movie is over, will make you terrified of the light! All this with the guinness book of world records title of smallest budget for a film! Never in a film will you feel the total loss of hope that this film portrays as it progresses. Almost to a point where you feel like if this film were longer, you might fall into a depression! The ability this film has, to make the viewer(s) feel, what the film directs you to feel is outstanding, and is what all directors in the horror/suspense categories now try to duplicate. This film to me, is what every person that creates a film tries to duplicate, the ability to capture everyones emotion and MAKE them feel the film. Romero is a legend. Do yourself a favor if you're a fan of horror films or are inspiring to be a director. Watch this film, and learn from a legend! 9/10",

The dead are \"living\", or at least roaming about devouring any human (that isn't dead) that they come in to contact with.  We see this story through a group of random people gathered together in an empty farm house fighting for their lives.The opening scene of this movie is CLASSIC.  One of my favorite scene in the history of film.  You have a brother and sister visiting their fathers (I think) grave site.  The brother continually teases his sister who is obviously disturbed by this.  \"They're coming to get you Babara.  Look There is one now.\"  He says this pointing to an elderly man walking in their direction.  Some of the last words he will ever speak.  The elderly man approaching them (of course they don't know he is a zombie) attacks the Barbara.  Her brother tries to fight him off, but is killed in the struggle. And so begins one of the greatest horror films ever made.The tension is gradually raised through out the film as peoples personalities, and ideas on how to combat the gathering mob of living dead outside of their temporary hideaway, begin to conflict with one another. The acting is not top notch I will admit.  There are so many other pluses that this matters little if at all, in fact it may add something for some viewers.  The story is original in it's telling, and one of the earliest movies of this type before ten low budget copies came out every year.This is not a gore fest, if you want that check out Dawn Of The Dead, instead more of a psychological thriller.  This is one of the smartest horror films I have ever seen, and reccomend that you see it as well. \nThis, along with films like Psycho, Rose Mary's Baby, and The Omen, changed the way horror movies are made, and viewed.  Though horror films are generally looked down upon, films like these allow us to not feel guilty for admiring the genre",

Some call it the best zombie movie ever made, some call it the best horror movie ever made. There is nothing wrong with that, because Dawn is indeed a great movie. But I am definitely in another club. I beg to differ. In my opinion, Night of The Living Dead is the superior movie.Above all others, of course because of its influence of basically reinventing the whole zombie sub-genre. But it is also the fact that it was made with budget so little, Hollywood producers would probably have laughed at it. But most of all, it's because the movie achieved what so many horror movie actually did: being frightening.The making of great horror does not need millions of dollars or special effects or CGI, no. The quintessence of horror is to scare you with something you cannot see or have never seen before. That was what Romero achieved with this movie. He managed to put something \"unknown\" to many that terrorize your mind long after you see it or after you have seen it many many times.And since everyone & their mother probably know about the story of this movie, I won't even bother writing it down here. I just want to praise Romero for presenting a REAL feeling of isolation all throughout. This movie is Horror 101, a textbook of making a great horror with the effective scare (not the special effects).And among many of the zombie movies I've ever seen in my life, this one I take a great delight of watching over and over again.

(excluding admittedly, its Savini-helmed remake of the first installment and Fulci's first attempt)And why, with so much potential to make such an exceptional homage to the original by simply remastering it and perhaps spending some money on a real orchestra to augment the already stellar performances and tension, are we left with Cable Access Channel actors and keyboard demo music? Perhaps a small snip and tuck here and there would be livable but instead we're stuck with this hideous 30th edition which repulses far more than any of the zombie dinner scenes in the sequels.I confess, the director did an adequate job of integrating the new footage into the old footage but that's where it ends. These new pieces add nothing and in many places, take away from the brilliant and original. A bookend bit of crap with a priest in the cemetery of the film alters the entire ending of the film (one year later!?) and makes the sequels (Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead, not those insipid Return flicks) impossible. If anything, it makes the Return films seem like the logical conclusion. In fact, it feels like an extension of the Return films creeping into the original.Zombies surround a car crash in an extended and obvious fake of the original's radio broadcast which drones on overtop. These zombies menace some bloody dummies sitting in the car. All of this is sandwiched into the scene where Ben searches the house for supplies. It adds nothing to the film (other than some shoddy gore effects and a lady with her arm obviously tucked into the back of her shirt to make way for the dripping fake stump) but it's there all the same.Even worse: whenever Zombies appear on screen, cheesy moans and groans are heard. They don't even try and fit in with the sound of the original, giving you the impression they were recorded some 30 years later in a sound studio and added in via editing (hmmmm...).My advice: avoid this one and all other rip-offs.John Russo...you should be ashamed of yourself.

Night of the Living Dead, plain and simple, is a movie that is worth seeing. Even though the effects, sound and picture quality and dialogue is outdated (by today's standards); this movie is still one of the best ever made. I first saw Night of the Living Dead at a local theater, around Halloween. I actually live in Butler, which is mentioned multiple times throughout the movie. That viewing was my introduction horror films and I've been a big fan ever since. Recently I purchased a colorized version of the film from Legend Studios/Off Color Films and 20th Century FOX. Seeing it in color is a different experience, but makes it just as creepy.\"You gonna let them get her too, huh?\"The storyline of Night of the Living Dead is pretty simple: A woman and her brother are attacked by a zombie (even though they are never called zombies in the movie) the zombie attacks her brother and she runs to a nearby farmhouse for protection, leaving her brother behind to fight Mr. Zombie. (Oh, don't worry she'll see her brother again!). At the farmhouse the woman meets a group of people who are also seeking protection there as well. The rest of the movie tells the story of their attempt to keep their lives from being taken by their cannibalistic attackers. \"Are they slow-moving, chief?\" \"Yeah, they're dead. They're all messed up.\"Since its initial release in 1968, Night of the Living Dead has been referenced and spoofed in countless films and has become a landmark in film making history. It has spawned the creation of three sequels (so far) and its own remake in 3-D. The special effects aren't exactly top notch, but even by today's standards would probably be a close call between PG-13 and an R rating. Compared to the other movies in Romero's \"Living Dead\" series, it is the perfect microcosm of evolution (especially in violence)in the movie industry. Night of the Living Dead was a low-budget movie with a rookie director, surprisingly almost forty years later it can still hold its own.",

My mother had been reluctant to let me see it but it had been one of my father's favorite movies when he was a teenager so I was allowed to rent. And I was in luck! My local video rental store had a brand spanking new copy of the 30th anniversary edition DVD. I rented it out, rushed home, sent my younger sibling packing and popped the DVD into the player. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. After more than thirty years, two sequels, and so many other zombie films this remains the scariest. The only rival it has in my opinion is Peter Jackson's great low budget splatter comedy 'Braindead'. This film scared me witless. It may be in B&W but sitting there in pristine DVD quality with a remastered soundtrack it blows everything else out of the water. George Romero's wonderful handling of his talented actors as well as his masterful ability to create tension make this one of the scariest horror films ever. I had to rent it out twice just to get through it. Time hasn't dulled the edge on this beauty one bit. If you are a fan of horror films I highly recommend you rent this now. But not the remake. Or the one with flourescent green zombies.",

She didn't even try to kick her or anything! The explanation for the zombies was ludicirous B-movie crap from the 60's. The dialogue came off as extremely stilted and forced and didn't flow whatsover, the poor acting only made it more obvious.

            "content": "I've viewed this film many times over the years and I must say that it IS a horror masterpiece that deserves and has earned it's right to be regarded as such. George A. Romero and John Russo penned a script that was, in 1968, startlingly original and shocking. Then utilizing the efforts of a cast and crew drawn from the Pittsburgh area commercial television industry, translated the script on a shoestring budget into a film experience which created an entirely new and unique genre. Shot in stark black and white due to a limited budget at a time when most films were already being shot in color, the Image Ten Film Group splashed theatre screens with nightmarish imagery that no one at that time was prepared for. The black and white presentation of the film actually enhances the eerie and dark atmosphere of the storyline and many people over the years speculated that avoiding the use of color stock was by choice instead of necessity. This film created several new standards within the horror genre, the zombie flesh eating theme and it's graphic depiction thereof being the most obvious. Another standard set by \"Night\" was the redefinition of the horror film heroine with the character of Barbara, wonderfully played by Judith O'Dea. For years female characters within the horror genre were simply Fay Wray type screamers, awaiting the rescue of the male lead. Barbara provided us with the first depiction of the \"scream queens\" as we know them still today. She was terrified indeed, but she was self reliant and assertive as well. The character of Barbara took charge of her own self-preservation. The casting of the late Duane Jones in 1968 as the male lead with no references to his ethnicity in the script's dialogue should be applauded. These weren't people divided by color within that farmhouse(as sadly parts of the country really were back in 1968), these were simply ordinary people attempting to achieve survival within an extraordinary situation. The murder of Marilyn Eastman's character by the \"zombie daughter\" in a scene that attacks the viewer's senses on numerous levels is to this day one of the most unsettling ever depicted on film. All of these elements and more contributed to this film's continued theatrical runs throughout the next decade. These same elements have earned the film it's cult status following and it still packs it's punch on video. Sadly, there are several edited, re-cut, or poor quality versions on the market due to the fact that the film became part of the public domain and anyone with a print could then release it. Seek out the original uncut version, digitally remastered on DVD and the experience the film provides will be well worth the purchase price if you're a fan of horror. After viewing, think of the films that pre-dated this classic and those that followed. Then realize that all of the graphic chills, scream queen's battlings of antagonists, and so many other elements of horror cinema today are the result of the impact this low budget shocker had on an entire genre.",

            "content": "Firstly, Night of the Living Dead needs to be understood as a period piece, as it was made as a social commentary about 1960's America, so many of its qualities which modern viewers may view as campy are not merely appropriate, but also entirely necessary. Any modern retelling of this story would entirely miss the point, especially with \"better\" acting, since it wouldn't represent the mainstream culture of the time. The \"living dead\" is a metaphor for the mindless masses who complacently contribute to violence against minorities just by going with the flow, doing what everyone else is doing. One person corrupts others, who corrupts others, who corrupt others. It's aggression against the outgroup, often coercing them into joining, which is why the characters are all endangered not so much by the ghouls as they are by themselves and by each other. The final death of the movie isn't even a metaphor, nor does it involve the living dead. It's just a white law enforcer murdering am unarmed black man who he ostensibly mistook for the enemy.If you want a modern counterpart with \"good\" acting, then I recommend Shaun of the Dead, which is more about early 21st century England, and also tells some funny jokes!",

One of the beauties of his story is that the living dead do not march into film in some awesome display of unlocked evil; no, it is far more subtle. This understated tone towards the rising monsters creates an uncertain reality for the viewer, perhaps (one begins to wonder) this isn't as far-fetched as it appears. The undead linger constantly either in foreground or background of this film, even when they do not appear on screen we know they are silently waiting, watching from the outside. The viewer can't help but picture themselves in such a situation, trapped and abandoned with only limited tools to hand. After all...what could you do? As there actions play out Romero plays upon this selection of possible scenarios, would you lock yourself away in the easy-to-defend cellar? But what about escape? Could you take some chance of flight but sacrifice the chance to easily defend yourself? It is difficult not to admire the way we are pulled into this interesting play between characters, in a situation that when we step back is obviously absurd. But will this stop you going and planning your own 'zombie escape plan' for your own home? I doubt it...",

The remake was OK because the character of Barbra actually did something other than sit there like a comatose victim. And the ending was such a downer... (the all die, even the survivor of the night) I mean how can one feel for a character if they never even get to the end credits without getting a shot to the head.The reason this is getting a five is because as bad as this was...

The new footage is atrocious and does not blend in with the old footage. The acting is beyond bad. I'll admit that NOTLD does not contain Oscar-caliber performances, but they are heads and shoulders above the dreck in the new footage.Further, the stock soundtrack is replaced with new music which frankly isn't very good. It takes away from the creepiness of the film. When the new music is playing, all the other sounds in the movie sound like they are coming out of a cardboard box. The original soundtrack was far far superior. There just seems to be a problem with the clarity of sounds in this version, and one of the characters looks like his voice doesn't exactly match his mouth (bad dubbing). I'll admit that I never noticed whether this occurred in the original, but this version fouled up so many things I can only imagine that it is a new problem.The other thing that hacks me off is that some of the original movie was edited out. Now I have seen the original film countless times, and I couldn't help notice little gaps in the action. I am not sure why they felt it necessary to edit little pieces of the film out, but some characters seem to jump towards actions with little or no explanation. Plus, some of the original zombie footage is edited out for the sake of the new and improved footage which rots.Bottom line, the new footage is poorly-acted, poorly written and merely interrupts the flow of the original plot. Probably the only positive thing I can say is that the remastered footage looks great. I can finally make out some of the detail that was difficult to see in the original version.

I read a Readers Digest article warning parents not to let their young children watch \"Night of the Living Dead\". I agree. The movie ratings system had not been developed yet, and there was no way to warn parents about how intense this movie was. I know adults who will not watch the movie either! By todays standards, NOTLD was filmed on a shoe-string budget, but was way ahead of its time breaking all the taboos and depicting graphic violence (graphic for 1968, but not now).George Romero had a very limited budget, and some of the actors in the film also helped in the production of the movie. Karl Hardman (Harry Cooper) pieced together the music soundtrack. His wife, Marilyn Eastman (Helen Cooper) supervised makeup. She also played a dual role. That's her portraying the zombie in the ragged nightie, eating a bug on a tree, then later reaching into the burned truck where the bodies of Judy and Tom were being devoured. Keith Wayne, who played Tom died at his own hands several years later.In 1960 Alfred Hitchcock broke a few Hollywood taboos with his movie masterpiece, \"Psycho\". A flushing toilet never appeared on film before, let alone the heroine of the movie being stabbed to death in a shower. (They used Shasta chocolate syrup for the blood, which broke another taboo in its graphic abundance.)\"Night of the Living Dead\" set new standards in the horror genre. For the first time, the hero of the movie dies at the end, and he is black in an otherwise all Caucasian film. The first scene of the movie takes place in a graveyard, and the chills begin within the first ten minutes into the picture.I can't imagine anybody who enjoys horror films who has not seen this movie. It's approaching it's 50th. anniversary, has been on television for years and you can probably find a copy in the bargain bin wherever CDs and video cassettes are sold.The movie still packs a whallop, which proves you do not need gratuitous blood and guts and gore to make a movie scary. Sometimes, the most terrifying aspect of a horror film is what is implied and left to the imagination. \"Night of the Living Dead\", with all its \"goofs\", mistakes, and dated technology still rates four stars with this humble movie goer.

The girl Barbara who is one of the lead characters looks dead before she died as well. Her acting is annoyingly bad and the way she shows us how women react in scary situations is a disgrace to her gender. The only plus i see in this movie is the Hero being a black guy which was a pleasant surprise as at the time i was watching this flick i still thought it was nearly one hundred years old.",

Characters are thrust into a terrible situation and must deal with it and each other.  It's interesting to see what happens to people forced into close contact with each other and into stressful situations involving shotguns.In short, Night of the Living Dead is a classic movie in American History, one of the best.  Rent it.  Watch it with a bunch of friends.  Turn out the lights, and prepare for a great time.",

            "content": "Don't waste your time with the 30th Anniversary version of this movie.  I ordered a copy of the Limited Edition of this movie, and today I got it.  It just isn't the same as the old NOTLD we all know and love.Let me list the reasons why you should avoid this like the plague:1.  They have filmed about 20-25 minutes of new footage that just doesn't fit in.  It adds a _little_ to the story, but mostly it just looks out of place.  For instance, one scene near the end has a teenage girl zombie that has a 90's haircut!  Also, they _removed_ some scenes to replace them with the new scenes!!2.  The part of Reverend Hicks, played by the guy who rescored the music was just totally lame.  That added absolutely _nothing_ to the film, and only made me regret buying this DVD.  Also, the music this guy scored isn't all that great.  It is just basic synthesizer music like you would find in any 80's movie.  The original music matched the look and feel of this movie _much_ better than the new score.3.  The sound in the new footage is just horrible.  The audio track is about a half second off from the video track. Seems to me, that if a couple guys on a small budget in 1968 can match words to lips, then it can also be done in 1998.4.  As far as I know, George Romero didn't have anything to do with this project. Maybe they should have left it for him to do.There were some good things about this version, though. Not many, but some.  They elaborate on Bill Hinzman's graveyard zombie character a little more.  And his real-life daughter, Heidi, is in the movie now too, playing a waitress zombie named Rosie.  The DVD version has a behind-the-scenes featurette that shows Bill and his daughter without makeup.  She is a cutie. :) Bill Hinzman was also the director of photography.  He did a really good job.  The new scenes he filmed _look_ good, although someone else screwed up on the scripting of them. Also, there is a new scene showing a car that has hit a tree, turning its occupants into more zombies.  A board has gone through the windshield, hitting the driver in the head. The driver is not real, but even shown up close in the BTS featurette, it looks pretty realistic.  That was definitely a good job.Final word:  Thank God I have the original release of NOTLD on DVD.  This 30th Anniversary version murders it.  Avoid this at all costs.",

These are not huge actors at all. Its like Romero just grabbed random people of the street to make them act in the film. It makes it very realistic.The black and white gives the film a chilling look and adds to the horror. I recommend this film to everyone over the age of 13. It is not as violent as your typical horror film. It looks like a classic 30's film!

It is not \"terrifying\", like \"The Exorcist\", but it had a few chilling moments. Such as, when the zombie-girl kills her own mother with a garden trowel. This film, launched three sequels (Dawn of the Dead, Land of the Dead), remakes (Night of the Living Dead (1990), Dawn of the Dead (2004), and Day of the Dead (2007), and a whole array of Zombie films, that are to many to count.

As being a fan of zombie films I was so excited that I bought the movie and was looking forward to seeing it on that night. I remember watching it on my own with the lights watched off. An I couldn't believe how scary it was. Even though it is just over 40 years old almost. The story was simple, a few people trapped in a house while a zombie outbreak occurs. The music was slow but fitted the picture and slow suspense at that time. Not a lot of gore but for being 1968 you would expect that for a horror film. Without doubt even today with all the CGI affects and improved way of filming. Night of the living dead has to be the best if not one the best horror films ever made.

Some people today claim that the movie is dated and less than great. I strongly disagree for two reasons. The first is that -in my opinion- it was the first zombie film that was intelligent and fun to watch. The second is that the death of the hero Ben was then and is now unexpected.

It might be that the plot seems a bit thin, compared to other horror movies, but this is after all a gore movie and not a thriller, and the context of the story fits well into the universe of George A. Romero's Living Dead Trilogy. This is a great capture of how people will react to an uncommon situation; a frustrating situation never before experienced: People screaming, not knowing what to do and therefore hiding in desert areas. And of course we have to complement IL' George for his constantly depressing the viewers, simply using the panic that erupts from the lack of experience. We must say that George A.

Besides all the things the somber and horrifying environment is very well achieved. If we keep in mind the negligible budget of this movie, the truth is that itself could be consider a masterpiece. Was not a coincidence that \"Night of the Living Dead\" has been added to the United States National Film Registry in 1999.

Being a huge NOTLD fan, I was very open to liking this new version.  Unfortunately John Russo has taken the brilliant original and cheapened it by adding a cheesy, overbearing musical score, and several BADLY acted additional scenes.  In the lining notes, John Russo said how the edits were seamless, and that you wouldn't be able to tell which were new scenes, and which were filmed 30 years ago.  This is not the case .  It is noticeable that Mr. Romero's name isn't associated with the re-release.  My advice to anyone wanting to see NOTLD...see the original.  Don't waste your time on this version.",

Certainly, the notion of the threat against society coming from within a community rather than from outside is something Hitchcock helped pioneer.I think the reason I feel this movie is so good is because it's dated yet still manages to scare you.  I figure any movie that has had as much impact as this one, any film that has been so crucial do the development of a genre, yet remains scary and effective after 30 years deserves some credit.When I first saw the 'Dead' trilogy I thought they were just graphic horror movies.  Since then, I have delved into film theory and genre criticism and discovered layer upon layer of self-reflexivity and meaning.  Often I think films just possess these characteristics due to social influences, but in the case of the 'Dead' trilogy it seems Romero was deliberately playing on the fears and concerns of a nation - the US.",

            "content": "Before I continue, I had better start by saying - this is the first and only version of the film I have ever seen. I bought it on DVD not really realising what it was...Once I'd realised that this was a re-released version of the film with extra scenes recorded nearly 30 years after the original, I thought.... damn! However, the DVD lets you watch the original without the new scenes - though it does force you to have the newly written score, which is actually pretty good. I do think that they may have left in some of the original score as well, and at times the new music sticks out as being too 'recent' sounding. There should have been the option to keep the old soundtrack.Nevertheless, this film really is as good as everyone says. I actually saw Dawn of the Dead first on UK TV, which is arguably the best in the series. I chose to initially watch this film in it's original incarnation (with the new score) and loved it... I won't go into why, because this is pretty well documented by everyone else. Then I chose to watch the newly shot scenes immediately after....(possible spoilers follow!)They really stink. Firstly, they add a new scene at the beginning featuring the first zombie you see in the film (which ruins the surprise later on) - they even got the same guy in to play him and yes, he looks 30 years older. In fact you might not even realise it is meant to be the same zombie. This scene is only made worse by the supremely hammy acting of \"Reverend Hicks\" and two slack-jawed rednecks. Considering the quality of the acting of the original, this is unforgivable. The next few added scenes are just extra views of zombies wandering about, eating dead humans and moaning. Hardly essential stuff, and they're hardly gory since they're filmed in B&W anyway. Finally there is another scene at the end featuring the Reverend again, having been bitten by a zombie yet apparently unaffected by the 'disease'. He claims that it's the love of god or something, but does so in his extremely overacted, ultra-hammy way. It also ruins the otherwise-excellent end. The justification for these scenes is that Romero had them in his original script - but he cut them for a reason, and I don't believe it was just financial. They are crap!If you're going to get this film, buy another version - there must be a better one. The original is one of the best (and the earliest) horror films ever created.",

I love to be scared and no movie, to this day, has such an effect on me as NOTLD.  As I read other comments about this movie, I agree that there is a big issue with being in a claustrophobic situation; out in the middle of nowhere practically, near a cemetary, and one of my biggest fears: being chased! The movie is great in that something so black and white, so cheaply made and so simple in it's message, can be so GOOD!  George Romero outdid himself. To this day, I will pop the video into my VCR, turn out all the lights, and watch it.  I still get scared!  The only thing I will disagree with (but I guess it's all in personal taste) is that this movie shouldn't be watched in a large crowd.  Too many times what YOU may think of as scary is funny to another (as I witnessed when I saw \"The Exorcist\" at the movie theatre on it's re-release recently and had to contend with a group of idiots laughing behind me).  I think it should be watched by just yourself.  I appreciate it more this way.  I can (and have) watch it a thousand times over and still see something new in it every time: the look of pure \"ghoul glee\" on the face of one \"ghoul\" as he peers through the wood slats barely holding them back towards the end is great.  I LOVE when the reporter is talking to Chief McClellan, asking him about what people should do if they are attacked by any zombies and the reporter says at the end of the discussion with the Chief, \"are they slow moving, Chief?\"  And he answers: \"Yeah, they're dead, they're....all messed up.\"  Love it!  But I have a question: I cannot find out the name of the actor who played Johnny, Barbra's brother!  Does anyone know what his name is??",

            "content": "When I first heard they were shooting new scenes for Night Of The Living Dead I got excited, because I'm such a big fan of the movie I thought it would be great to see newly inserted footage. Well then I saw it, and it was undoubtedly the most ridiculous thing I'd ever seen. In fact, when I show friends the original cut, I then ask them if they want to see something funny, and I show them the new footage. It gets a laugh every time. The only good thing I can say about this heaping pile of poo, is that the man Romero had nothing to do w/any of it. Cheers to George! Why is it bad? Let me count the ways: First off, if you listen to the commentary on the DVD by Russo and his accomplices (Hinzman, Streiner, and Michelucci) they go on and on about how seamless the new footage goes w/the old footage. Uh, okay. What movie are they watching in the recording booth? Because in the one I saw, the new footage stuck out like a...well, like new footage from this movie. The idea of putting a mask on Hinzman to make him look they way he did thirty years ago was indeed a good one...in Bizarro World (sorry). He couldn't have looked any less like his younger self if they'd given him a pair of glasses w/a big fake plastic nose attached. You go from 'fat-head' Hinzman, to 'little-head' Hinzman. Is that the same guy? It has to be, they look exactly alike! I think they were trying some type of subliminal hypnotic suggestive thing. Hoping people would watch their commentary, and then walk away saying 'yes-the-new-footage-was-seamless-I-could-not-tell-a-difference'. Second: The preacher. If you've seen this then I don't really need to elaborate. There are so many things about this guy that are lame, but my favorite is the fact he seems to never have actually read the bible. I quote: \"Like the floods in Noah's time!\" Yeah, that was in Genesis, it's right up front if you'll look. Third: Speaking of the preacher, the guy (whose name I don't feel like looking up) was also the composer of the new score. Listening to someone hit random keys on the piano is fun! What? A whole CD of this is included! Rule! Fourthly (a word?): Is it just me, or does the radio we hear while Ben fortifies the house repeat itself? I'm confused. One more point: It's right at the beginning, and it's one of those things that when you hear it, you know you're in for a rough ride. When the two bone-heads are carrying Hinzman's coffin (that's 'fat-head' Hinzman), and one of these fine actors says: \"This thing is as heavy...as well, I don't know what.\" Man, that is heavy. Russo may have let this guy improvise here, because I'd hate to think some one actually wrote that line on paper and then kept it there. The saddest thing is I paid a lot of money for the collector's edition DVD, and now I'm stuck w/it because it ain't selling for jack on ebay.",

Everything is up for grabs and burns.Night Of The Living DeadAmong many filmmakers achieving their own various milestones in their first project, this one could be the ideal example, the milestone of that sub genre list- if there is any! The co-writer and director, George A. Romero has a poetic speech. Even rhyming, I would persist.

It is better if you understand the intentional poem behind all the scenarios in order to truly enjoy this could-arguably-be called popcorn flick. But there is much more than entertainment. Yes, you will get the occasional scare, the hair pulling annoyance to not be able to control and a classic game of pitting one chip against another. But this is one page poem. Written with a mirroring symmetry. It has a start and a finish. Something you won't be able to differentiate. And all the elements in the script is brimming with this ingredient. The dialogues, the intentions, the faulty logistics, worn out philosophises and now even the political incorrectness, some might point out. If someone doesn't get along they would start their equation through that very formula. And even end on it. Their salvation relies upon each other's theories and so does damnation, but then there is arrogance in the air. This eye-for-actually-nothing world hungrily feeds on upright abusive nature. The drapes are off and the humility, sociality comes off shamelessly. The living is scarier than dead ever will be.

Every piece of popular zombie fiction, from movies to TV shows and comics and video games, owes there existence to this film. George Romero's innovative and groundbreaking vision laid the framework for countless years of undead entertainment. Every trope, idea, rule, and moral conundrum you'll see in all of the zombie content that has come out over the years and has yet to can be found here. It's amazing to watch this, think of when it came out, and still see how all zombie fiction is using the exact same ideas. So next time you  are watching an episode of The Walking Dead or playing some Zombies Mode in Call of Duty, just know that they wouldn't exist were it not for \"Night of the Living Dead.\"Of course it wouldn't matter that Romero did it first if he hadn't done it well. Night of the Living Dead holds up remarkably well after all these years. If anything, with the exception of (maybe) the low budget and some inexperienced acting, time might have actually improved this movie. It's black and white visuals, retro soundtrack, and to the basics approach add a tone and atmosphere to this that the refinements of the modern age can't always capture. I will admit that there is a lot of what I guess you could call empty space in the movie. The majority of the time is just watching the characters (mostly just Ben) board up the house they are trying to survive in. It isn't until the cast expands that the action really starts to get going. Like most zombie movies, the struggle survivors find between each other as the result of differing backgrounds and personality is just as large and dangerous to them as that of the undead hoards gathering just outside their defenses. One of the many examples I could cite to show you just how influential this movie was to the countless others of it's ilk that followed in suit.While the low budget, independent nature of the film is something of a two-edged sword, it's clear that one edge is much sharper than the other. Fortunately, it's the one the swordsman doesn't have to worry about cutting (or worse, impaling) himself on. Without a great deal of special effects to rely on, we actually get to see the cast really use tools like fire and such to survive. It's pretty amazing to see our lead use a legitimate torch indoors, smoke and all, on his was outside. It makes the situation more believable. Yes, he's not actually going out there to ward off zombies, but he is risking some burns with that flame. The movie might actually be even creepier due to this smaller scale as well. I particularly enjoyed how the zombies were portrayed without much makeup, making them look more like, well, people. It's their behavior that sets them apart. I also think the way Romero envisioned them is also neat. They are much smarter then what we normally see nowadays, as they have the gumption to do things use tools in basic ways. It's also worth noting how incredibly bleak things are. With it's unforgettable ending and disturbing basement scenes, this is a movie that will stick with you long after you've made it to the final screen. Unlike other zombie fiction, this one even gives us an idea as to what caused the dead to return to feast on the living. Night of the Living Dead is a piece of cinema history. A real game changer that is still influencing the world today. Even though the zombie craze has slowed down a bit as of recently, the undead are still dominating our world. Well, ladies and gentlemen this is where the outbreak started. The late, great George Romero has gone down in history for a reason. You really should check out this starting movie in a series that has still has the ability to enchant and chill even today. Zombie fan or not, horror fan or not, movie buff or not, if you consider yourself a fan of fine cinema then this a must watch. Not only is it historic, but it's also fantastic as well. One of the most important, influential, and just darn enjoyable horror movies ever created.",
