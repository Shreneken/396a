            "content": "What a good movie. It's hard to believe that the audience was considered so sensitive in 1947 that the original title, \"Ace in the Hole,\" had to be dropped and replaced with this less ironic one. Viewers were thought unprepared for a film in which a reporter misbehaved, with lethal results.\"The Big Carnival\" is one of the reasons the director, Billy Wilder, earned a reputation as a cynic. It was probably deserved. He had a keen sense of humor as well (Wilder: \"I laugh at everything. I laugh at Hamlet.\") but it's not much on display here. Instead we have a naive veteran pinned underground and an ambitious reporter (Kirk Douglas) who deliberately delays the rescue in order to squeeze the most out of the story. Instead of extracting the victim from the heart of the mountain the quick and easy way, Douglas talks the corrupt sheriff and engineer into doing it the long, slow, and ultimately lethal way. The tubby engineer caught in the middle is the unhappy Frank Jaquet. He mops his brow and imitates digging with none of the icononoclastic pizazz of William \"Strata\" Smith. Just a schlubb. Except for the victim, I felt sorrier for the engineer Smollett than for anyone else. Poor Louie Minosa. He catches pneumonia and dies after being given extreme unction. Douglas dies too, as the code of the time required.Wilder's direction is fine. Douglas acquires a young acolyte and when they last speak together, the light is behind Douglas so that Douglas's sharp shadow blacks out almost all of the kid's face. In the last shot, from floor level, Douglas collapses and his dead face flops almost into the camera lens although the face is too dark to make out, his features, like his soul, in deep shadow. In another scene, Douglas is busily reading his mail and concocting additional material for the Big Story. Douglas again is in deep shadow. Beside him is the bright figure of Louie Minosa's wife, the trashy, blond Jan Sterling. She's a tough and narcissistic cookie out of Baltimore and, impressed by Douglas's power and his ability to bring in the bucks, she comes on to him with a wide and seductive smile. Douglas looks at her over his shoulder and says, \"You're the grief-stricken wife, so stop smiling.\" \"Make me,\" she replies, and he slaps her twice, hard, across the face. It's a shocking moment and, despite Douglas's earlier casual chatter about his ambitions, the viewer suddenly realizes that this guy will stop at nothing. That is, he not only claims to be ruthless, he really MEANS it. \"That's the expression I want to see,\" Douglas tells her smoothly. \"Don't wipe those tears away.\" Everyone gives performances that are at least decent. Porter Hall, whom you will recognize, does a comic/dramatic turn as the stuffy and conservative editor of an Albuquerque newspaper. One of the few chuckles the viewer is allowed is when Douglas first asks Porter for a job and analyzes Porter as a small-time fellow because he wears both belt AND suspenders, compared to Douglas's flashy suit. A year goes by and we see Douglas too wearing both belt and suspenders. (He shucks the suspenders when he gets a job offer from New York.)This is a finely made movie about two parallel scoops: an attempt to dig Louie Minosa out of his underground prison and Douglas's attempt to turn the story into a heady drama.",

            "content": "The cynical, unethical and unscrupulous journalist Charles 'Chuck' Tatum (Kirk Douglas) arrives in a small New Mexico newspaper asking for a chance. He was fired from famous newspapers because of drinking problem, lying and even for having an affair with the wife of one of his bosses. His real intention is to use the small newspaper as a \"swimming board\" to a bigger one. After one year without a bang news and totally bored, Chuck travels with a younger reporter to make the coverage of a matter about rattlesnakes. When they arrive in an isolated gas station, he is informed that a man called Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) is trapped alive in an old Indian mine in a nearby place called Mountain of the Seven Vultures. Chuck manipulates the local corrupt sheriff, the engineer responsible for the rescue operation and Leo's wife Lorraine Minosa (Jan Sterling), and a rescue that could be made using a simple and common process in twelve hours, lasts six days using a sophisticated drilling system and creating a circus in the previously desert place. Everybody profits with the accident except the victim. Movies about manipulation of people are usually excellent. I remember Costa-Gravas' \"Mad City (1997), Barry Levinson's \"Wag the Dog (1997)\", Howard Hawks' \"His Girl Friday (1940)\", and even the recent real case of the chemical weapons. Yesterday I saw \"Ace in the Hole\" for the first time and I really was impressed how this film is amazingly real and updated. There are elements present in every modern society, such as: the powerful sheriff very corrupt, like most of the worldwide members of the governments; the press, interested in selling news only; the victim used for other interests greater than rescuing him; and the people, completely manipulated and with very short memory. Kirk Douglas is amazing in the role of a nasty reporter. I do not understand why this movie is not in the IMDb Top 250. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"A Montanha dos Sete Abutres\" (\"The Mountain of the Seven Vultures\")",

            "content": "A powerful toasting of the media of the day. Imagine what this would have been like in the age of television. Kirk Douglas plays a self-centered heel, and does so very well. I also liked Jan Sterling as Lorraine. It's true that there is no really sympathetic character in this film, except maybe Leo, the man trapped in the cave. Someone wrote that he too, wasn't a sympathetic character, because he was trapped while collecting Indian artifacts for sale, but I don't think that would have bothered anyone in 1951. The tone of the film throughout was one of total cynicism, that seems a bit out of place for the times. Maybe that's why this movie was not a commercial success. It fits much better now, though, since everyone has seen the media behaving in such disgraceful fashion. However, that may rob it of some of its (probably intended) shock value. Grade: A",

            "content": "Perhaps Billy Wilder would feel vindicated today after putting this film down as one of his lesser achievements. His own background as a reporter in Vienna and Berlin most likely influenced this story of a cynical newspaper reporter who insinuates himself into his byline to influence events instead of merely reporting them. See, and I thought this was only a modern day inconvenient truth.I didn't expect \"Ace in the Hole\" to be the gripping movie it turned out to be. Kirk Douglas is masterful in presenting a character so out of touch with basic human decency that he never considers that sometimes the law of unintended consequences can intrude on one's best laid plans. Down and out reporter Chuck Tatum (Douglas) happens upon a story in the making in the middle of a New Mexico desert, and his overblown ego takes command of the situation. A master manipulator, Tatum convinces a local corrupt sheriff (Ray Teal) to milk an underground rescue attempt to pile up votes for the next election, and together they bully a contractor (Frank Jaquet) to use a rescue method that will take six days instead of eighteen hours. Tatum also latches on to a local legend, the 'Mountain of the Seven Vultures' to add a tense note of mystery and foreboding to his copy, all in an effort to secure a prized position back at his former New York City newspaper.It's hard not to become angry watching this picture because one instinctively knows that this type of stuff occurs on a daily basis in newsrooms across the country. It's gotten to the point where one can't really trust what appears in print or on the TV screen half the time today, a sorry state of affairs if one relies on accuracy in reporting for any reason at all. The carnival atmosphere that develops around the Leo Mimosa story must have seemed oddly unbelievable, even impossible back when the picture was made, but today it seems about par for the course.One can figure out where this story is going after a certain point; all that's left is for the finger pointing to start. Admirably, for a creepy character like Tatum, he decides to blow the whistle on his own complicity in causing a man's death, but it's too little too late. The gawkers pack up and leave and those who profited from the spectacle are left to their own seamy existence, including the wife of the trapped miner (Jan Sterling), revealed as callous and hypocritical as the sheriff. In a nod to both true noir sensibility and demands of the Production Code, Chuck Tatum goes down for the final count as the picture closes, knowing just before he drops that the circus is finally over.",

            "content": "Kirk Douglas has often expressed his theory of acting: find the good in the bad and the bad in the good. In no role of his career do we see this at work more than his performance as Chuck Tatum in Billy Wilder's classic \"Ace in the Hole\". Tatum is a relentlessly ambitious and overtly cynical reporter exploiting a man's misfortune in being trapped in a cave for his own ends. But if that's all he was, he'd be driving away with a smile on his face at the end. But that's not all he is.He's not the worst character in this gallery of rogues. Jan Sterling's non-suffering wife of the victim is a very cold fish and Ray Teal's sheriff is more of a cold-blooded reptile, like his pet snake. They don't give a damn if Leo lives or dies. It might be better if he's out of the way. But Tatum, even if he's the instigator of the drama, can't go that far. He's merely a rat, dangerous but warm-blooded. And that destroys him. Sterling and Teal move on, better off than they were. Tatum falls dead into the camera. You can have him for nothing.Tatum's problem is that he isn't quite as bad as he wants to be. He's been treated ruthlessly by life some time in the past and he's in a competitive profession where compassion seems a weakness and the victor gets the spoils- and all the excitement. He put himself on overdrive to compete and show the world he can be as tough on it as it is on him. But he's not quite bad enough to not care about what he's doing to Leo. He's disgusted when he looks at the wife and sheriff and thinks that he's put himself on their level. He punches the sheriff and almost strangles the wife, but finds that doesn't liberate him form his own actions. Those actions have deprived him of the respect of anyone with any goodness left in them, including himself. You can have him for nothing because there's nothing left.",

            "content": "Billy Wilder's first commercial failure, but one of his best films, almost up there with \"Sunset Blvd.\"  Ambitious reporter Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas) finds out a man is trapped in a collapsed mine.  By spewing out bogus engineering, he manages the rescue of the poor man to become more complicated, and time consuming then needed.  Meanwhile, it becomes an amazing news item, something that makes Tatum the best known reporter in the country.  However, everybody's luck runs out at the end. Perhaps the cause of failure of this film is that there are no sympathetic characters here.  Douglas plays a total creep, the trapped man's wife is a floozy \"I'm not going to pray for him!  Praying ruins my nylons!\" in the film.  Even the trapped man is somebody who was poking around Indian graves.  The screenplay, and the lead performances are top class.  The extensive location photography, and somewhat documentary look of the film makes the film feel more modern than most 1951 films.  Billy Wilder calls this film \"the runt of his litter\"  Don't be so harsh, Billy, it's an excellent picture!",

            "content": "The movie very closely parallels the real events of January 30 to February 16, 1925 in terms of the general story line. There are some significant differences concerning the actions of the characters.Floyd Collins, a cave explorer working alone (not a real good idea), was trapped in Sand Cave KY, near Mammoth Cave. He was not looking for treasure, but for a new cave suitable for commercializing to produce income in an economically depressed region...and this was before the Depression occurred.He became trapped on the way out of the cave by a 27 lb. rock which rolled onto his leg in a narrow crawlway. The configuration was such that it could not be moved enough to get his foot past.When he failed to return home, the family went searching and quickly found him only 150' inside the cave.A huge rescue effort was mounted and a cub reporter, Skeets Miller, from Louisville KY showed up to cover the story. It became one of the three most widely broadcast events of the time. Besides the extensive newspaper coverage, the relatively new medium of commercial radio riveted listeners with hourly accounts. It quickly became the first media circus ever seen.Because of the print and radio coverage people began flocking to the site. A carnival atmosphere did indeed spring up around the cave. The state police and National Guard were called out by the governor to control the chaos and the more than 20,000 onlookers. The similarity between the real event and the movie on this account are likely nearly identical.As in the movie, a decision was made to drill a shaft and, also as in the movie, the rock was fairly unstable and prone to collapse from the pounding of the cable tool drilling rig. The longer the effort went on, the more unstable the cave passage became.Unlike Kirk Douglas' character in the movie, Skeets Miller served a most honorable role. Due to his small build he became one of very few persons able, and eventually the only one willing, to enter in an attempt to deliver food and water to Collins. He received a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting. Also unlike the movie, there was no manipulation of the event to delay the rescue, but there was considerable disagreement over how to best do it. Area coal miners made the initial attempts and the event concluded with the above-mentioned shaft.Collins was presumed to have died 3 days before rescuers reached him. Because the conditions were so unstable, the body was left in the cave. The family was able to remove him about 80 days afterward for a proper burial. Later, his glass-topped casket was returned to the now-commercial cave as a tourist attraction. It was removed once again, and finally, in 1989.In 1982, a definitive account of the event was published in the book 'Trapped!'. A most informative read.In a take-off of the 'Free Tibet' bumper stickers, vehicles are occasionally seen with a 'Free Floyd Collins' sticker.",

            "review_title": "A Hard Hitting Tale Of Man's Inhumanity To Man",
            "content": "\"Ace In The Hole\" provides a brilliant and blistering account of how a media circus is cynically created, extended and manipulated purely to capitalise on the public's seemingly insatiable appetite for human interest stories. The main characters are motivated by greed and ambition and ruthlessly exploit the gross misfortune of another human being for their own dubious ends. Billy Wilder who produced, directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Walter Newman and Lesser Samuels, paints a grim picture of human nature in this story which is both fast moving and uncompromising.Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas) is a newspaper reporter who finds himself out of luck and out of money when he arrives in Albuquerque, New Mexico with a broken down car and no job. He's a man who'd previously worked for a number of prestigious newspapers where his employment had been cut short due to a variety of problems including alcoholism, adultery and libel but his undoubted talent and his ability to sell himself, quickly gain him a job at the \"Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin\".A year later, Tatum is assigned to cover a rattlesnake hunt but on his way he stops at a desert trading post where he discovers that the proprietor, Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) has become trapped in a cave where he'd been searching for Indian artifacts. Tatum quickly recognises the story's potential and wastes no time in getting into the cave where he sees Minosa trapped under some timber beams. He talks to him, photographs him and assures him that he'll be rescued as soon as possible.Tatum promptly calls his editor Jacob C Boot (Porter Hall) to tell him about the story which is a real scoop. To serve the purposes of the story, Tatum wants Minosa's wife Lorraine (Jan Sterling) to appear to be a devoted spouse who's distressed about Leo's predicament. She's completely uncaring, however, and wants to use the opportunity to leave Leo and their isolated home without delay. Tatum tries to make her feel guilty about her intentions and persuades her to change her mind.Tatum makes a deal with corrupt local sheriff Gus Kretzer (Ray Teal) to ensure that he's the only reporter who's allowed access to Minosa and then the two men pressurise engineer Sam Smollett (Frank Jacquet) into carrying out the rescue operation by drilling a shaft through the rock rather than by simply shoring up the walls of the cave. The drilling operation is favoured because it would take about a week to complete and this would allow the story to be fully exploited. The shoring up option, by contrast, would result in the rescue being completed in less than a day.Vast numbers of people soon arrive at the trading post and the grounds adjacent to the cave quickly fill up with tourists, reporters, hot dog stands and even a Ferris wheel. Lorraine makes spectacular profits, the sheriff receives flattering publicity to help his re-election campaign and Tatum uses his control of the whole event to be handsomely paid by a New York newspaper for them to be given the exclusive story. Later developments, however, derail Tatum's plans and the carnival atmosphere is soon brought to an end.Kirk Douglas gives an incredibly powerful performance as the unscrupulous Chuck Tatum and Jan Sterling is very believable as the cold, callous and coarse Lorraine who is totally devoid of any redeeming qualities.Commercially, \"Ace In The Hole\" was a spectacular failure and this was probably down to the fact that most of the people featured in the story are unsympathetic characters. Tatum, Kretzer and Lorraine are all despicable, unethical and opportunistic and don't have an ounce of sympathy between them for the unfortunate Minosa. The people who gather at the scene of the accident and turn it into a carnival are voyeuristic and grossly insensitive and the various business people on site simply regard Minosa's plight as an opportunity to make a quick profit. It's encouraging that in the years since its initial release, the merits of this movie have become more clearly recognised and it's appreciated as being even more relevant today than it was when it was made.",

It wasn't very successful and its cynicism shocked people.Along comes Andy Warhol almost two decades later with his notion of \"fifteen minutes of fame\" and everyone buys that concept. It's not quite the same as the concept of this. Nor is that of the very popular \"Network,\" which came even later. But the premise here is that reporter Kirk Douglas will literally jeopardize a man's life in order to get a series of big newspaper stories. And does anyone today doubt that such things happen? Wilder was often cynical, though here it is to the most meaningful end. \"the Fortune Cookie\" and \"Kiss Me, Stupid\" are cynical also and they are both fun but this one makes a very trenchant point and they do not.The acting is superb. Kirk Douglas gave many brilliant performances. This is one of them. The trailer included in the DVD I just saw crows that with this Jan Sterling will be immediately elevated to the top rank of female stars. That never happened but she is excellent here, as generally elsewhere.The interviews of Wilder by Cameron Crowe tell a funny story about the genesis of one of her lines. I'd better not quote it; so get that book. It's very entertaining, informative, and touching.Wilder was one of =this country's great directors.

            "content": "One of Billy Wilder's great movies, with a superb acting job by Kirk Douglas as the cynical, glory-seeking and even desperate reporter whose only goal is get back in the limelight by regaining his former big-city news desk job. The idea of such a newspaper reporter manipulating events to stretch out a story at the expense of and disregard for the victim still seems nearly inhuman, but Douglas' performance makes it instantly believable. The story scenario in which locals, then passers-by and finally distant tourists gravitate to and then make a festival or circus out of the event (the film was also released under the title \"The Big Carnival\") is supported by the real events on which the story was most likely based: the West VA mine disaster in 1925 that trapped miner Floyd Collins and was reported for 17 days, much as in the film, by local newspaperman Skeets Miller, who crawled into the mineshaft for face-to-face interviews with the trapped and doomed Collins.This movie fits nicely into the Film Noir genre, although it takes place largely under the hot, harsh glare of the Arizona sun, highlighting the sweat and grime visible on the characters' skin and creating a visual metaphor for the sorry state of their souls. I wonder if Henri-Georges Clouzot saw this film before he began filming \"The Wages of Fear,\" because the visually pervasive atmosphere of sweat and filth and opportunism are equally present in both.",

'Why?' one might ask 'would a sombre movie like this made over 50 years ago remain so memorable, when so many others have vanished. Was it the surreal inhumanity of the plot, the repugnant newsman devoid of ethics, the exploitation  of the trapped victim, the purposeful prolonging of the victim's entrapment to create a media frenzy, the ultimate commercial creation of an 'event' style attraction complete with a circus like atmosphere surrounding the cave while the victim remained entrapped and close to death.'Supposedly based on a real incident, it's a tough movie to watch and more so if one is prepared to accept the premise that such inhumanity displayed in the movie has an element of truth.I echo the desires of others to have the availability of this movie on VHS or DVD.

He is a defeated man who has failed miserably because of his hard drinking, among other things. But his luck is about to change. After being sent to report on a rattle snake contest, he stumbles on a tragic situation where a miner has been trapped in an abandoned silver mine. Tatum recognizes the value of the situation as a news item that will, not only sell papers, but will, perhaps, give him the chance to make it big in the field he knows well. He risks his own life in going into the mine to interview Leo Minosa.In order to do that, he joins forces with the corrupt local sheriff Kretzer, who is game for what the deal will mean to his status in the community. In exchange for his efforts, he wants to be the exclusive rights to the situation. Tatum meets the miner's wife, a one time saloon girl, Lorraine, who Leo rescued from an uncertain life and brought her to the family's restaurant in the dusty desert area. Lorraine sees an opportunity to flee the scene, something that she has done before, but Chuck Tatum wants her as part of the scheme he has plotted in his mind.When the human story hits the airwaves, it finds a captive audience. Soon, all curiosity seekers descend on the area next to the mine to witness whatever happens. Instead of using conventional methods, Chuck decides to \"milk\" the situation by not doing what reason dictates must be done. He decides to direct the drilling from the top, a process that will delay the rescue operation, but will give Tatum a chance to gain the notoriety he seeks, at the expense of the man pinned down in the mine.This film, directed by the great Billy Wilder, is one of his finest efforts in Hollywood. Yet, the film didn't find an audience, unlike the one attracted within the film. Written in collaboration by Mr. Wilder, Lesser Samuels and Walter Newman, the screenplay is one of the most ambitious in the director's distinguished career. He knew exactly where he wanted to know, using as a theme the manipulation of the news by people that only want to show sensationalism, at the expense of a human suffering. Kirk Douglas had one of his finest moments in the movies with his Chuck Tatum. He knew exactly what the public wanted and he gives it to them. In a way, he was a great impresario, setting the scene for the curious to come to the show to be on the front row to witness the suffering and pain Leo Minosa was experiencing. Jan Sterling, who plays Lorraine, matches Mr. Douglas all the way. She could see inside the man who didn't care about a husband that she was going to abandon, anyway. The rest of the cast does a fine job.Charles Lang's cinematography captures in vivid detail the carnival atmosphere that is at the center of the film. His camera angles enhance the film tremendously. Hugo Friedhofer provided the musical score that blended perfectly with the action. Arthur Schmidt editing works well. Ultimately this was a Billy Wilder film that will stay in the viewer's memory for quite a long time.",

            "content": "This hard-to-see film finally came to TCM recently so I was anxious to check it out. (To my knowledge it has never been issued on VHS or DVD).I found the fist hour to be riveting with crisp dialog, interesting characters, and some nice camera shots by director Billy Wilder and photographer Charles Lang. Kirk Douglas was intense as \"Chuck Tatum\" and Jan Sterling (\"Lorraine Minosa\") was pure film-noir platinum blonde with attitude.Then, the next 40-45 minutes disappointed me, to be frank. Tatum slowly softens to the point where the film loses its edge, going from an adventure story-film noir to more of a melodrama. Sterling's character almost disappears from the screen, which doesn't help. However, with 10 minutes left in the film, a shocking scene with her jolted me back to full attention.Going back to Sterling for a minute, if you are a film noir fan and rank Marie Windsor high on your list of actresses, you'll love Jan in here. It just wish she had a bigger part. My other \"wish\" was that this script would have been a little tighter. I drags too much in the second half. About 10-15 minutes cut out of here would have made this easier to watch and keep the suspense tighter.The story is not an unusual one. I've seen it on film a number of times, the from the classic era to now: an overzealous newspaperman going past the bounds of good taste and ethics to get (or \"keep\" in this case) a good story going, just for the welfare of himself or his paper. Yet, this \"yellow journalism\" or \"tabloid mentality\" story has some different twists to it, such as being set in a mountainous desert, not in a big city.The acting is superb, not just with the two leads but with all the supporting actors, led by Porter Hall, who played the newspaper editor \"Jacob Boot.\" I also appreciated the sarcastic comedy in here as Wilder and the screenwriters parody the \"carnival\" atmosphere which develops when a tragedy occurs and people make a financial profit out of it. As the days linger on and the man in this story clings to his life trapped deep in a mine, the circus atmosphere grows. Hence, the second title of this film: \"The Big Carnival.\"That latter title was used when the film bombed at the box office in America the first time it was shown. Later, it was reissued under that second title. It still bombed. However, today it seems to be getting cult status, I would believe a DVD of this will be forthcoming because my guess is that it would sell.",

Perhaps Kirk Douglas's Charles Tatem would find employment as a writer at UBS for Howard Beale's mad prophet of the air or at Fox News or if your tastes run the other way, scripting one of Michael Moore's documentaries.Kirk Douglas is a veteran reporter who's been fired off a whole lot of newspapers and arrives in Albuquerque looking for a job. Editor Porter Hall after an interesting job interview hires him. Two months later, a bored Douglas and cub reporter Robert Arthur are sent on some nothing story and on the way learn of a man, Richard Benedict, trapped in an old cave with a broken leg. Remembering the real Floyd Collins story from the Twenties about a Kentucky man trapped in a cave for 18 days while America followed every move of the rescue attempt, Douglas smells a return to the big time. With the aid of a corrupt sheriff, Ray Teal, Douglas starts controlling the story and indirectly making the story. Of course things get out of hand.Kirk Douglas has never been afraid of being seen as unlikeable on screen and in Charles Tatem he's at his most unlikeable. In fact until he did There Was A Crooked Man in 1971, I'm not sure he's ever been this big of a canine descendant. He's matched every step of the way by Jan Sterling who plays Benedict's tramp of a wife who wants her cut of the proceedings and takes it out of Douglas literally.Ace in the Hole was made when newspapers still were a major source of news. Televisions were still scarce and I don't think it's an accident that Billy Wilder chose a sparsely populated state like New Mexico as the setting. Television sets in the Rocky Mountain states in 1951 were scarcer than the people.I think Ace in the Hole could be remade today, maybe with Michael Douglas taking over an internet news blog to bring it up to the times. Still Billy Wilder's magical cynical touch would be missing.",

Although it is definitely a good film and ahead of its time, it does not quite live up to the hype.The film, in short, is a condemnation of media circuses and the exploitation of tragedy by reporters. It focuses on the efforts of Kirk Douglas's character, who uses unscrupulous methods to generate a media circus around a man trapped in a collapsed cave. A corrupt sheriff, the trapped man's discontented wife, and a gullible public aid his efforts.The film's main problem is Kirk Douglas's performance. Even though he is a good actor, his over-the-top approach detracts from the believability of his character.

Kirk Douglas plays the reporter with nasty, snarling machismo; he's so well-attuned to his lines that when he spits the words out, they really do sound like his own. The supporting players are interesting but uneven, ranging from peculiar (Jan Sterling, as the trapped man's soulless wife, who acts like a gangster's moll right out of a film noir), to very good (Richard Benedict as Leo and Ray Teal as the sheriff), to downright awful (Richard Gaines as the New York Daily News editor, whose ranting and raving over the telephone would be funny if it weren't so pitiful). The movie makes no promises to finish up smelling like a rose, and director/co-screenwriter Billy Wilder seems to relish this opportunity to make American tourists look like hucksters and scavengers, but Douglas' pontificating near the climax is a drag, with the irony of the situation substituted by melodrama. A failure for Wilder in '51 (probably due to that dreadful title, which was quickly changed to \"The Big Carnival\"), it is now considered a cult classic. *** from ****",

            "content": "It's a vicious look at the sausage making of sensational journalism, and it spares no one. The journalist who orchestrates it all is one of the worst human beings in film. The wife of the victim is a close second. The local law are so easily bribed that it's not even a challenge. The contractors so easily coerced by bad logic. The people who gather so easily led that they're effectively sheep. And, at the center of the big circus that erupts, a man and his father.Inspired by a similar event in Kentucky 25 years earlier (so similar in fact, that the man involved in the real thing got a settlement from the studio for stealing his life story), it tells of a newspaper man in the latest of a long string of jobs, each one smaller than the last, that he's had to leave for different reasons, none too flattering for him. This reporter, Chuck Tatum, is so desperate to get the right story to take him back to the top of the newspaper world in New York that he'll find any story, and if there isn't one, he'll bite a dog. Biting a dog is just what he does, metaphorically, of course.A year into his stint at the small Albuquerque newspaper he's found himself in, Tatum goes several hours out of town at the orders of his editor to cover a rattlesnake hunt. Along the way, they stumble across news of a man trapped in an old series of shafts in a mountain. Knowing a situation he can turn to his advantage when he sees one, Tatum blows off the rattlesnake hunt and zeroes in on the trapped man. It has all the trappings of a great human interest story, and Tatum knows exactly how to manipulate everyone into giving it the kind of legs that would give him huge exposure and star status himself, as the man who broke the story.He bribes local officials including the sheriff. He convinces the sheriff to force the contractors to attempt the rescue a longer, and far more dramatic, way that will take six days instead of sixteen hours. The sudden explosion in interest in the sleepy, out of the way, trading post even convinces the trapped man's wife to stick around long enough to make some money, even though she was going to use her husband's state to run away again.What makes this really fascinating is that Tatum is putting on a mask to everyone he interacts with, and just about everyone sees right through it. They chose to accept the mask instead of falling for it. The sheriff knows he's being bribed, and he's okay with it. The contractor knows he's being forced into a bad decision, but he's not the final say so he's okay with it. The wife is going to make a lot of money from her husband's misfortune, and she's okay with it. It's when Tatum first arrives, gets apprised of the situation, and calls back to his newspaper that the wife sees Tatum for exactly who he is.At the center of all this duplicity is Leo Minosa, the man in the mine. He doesn't see through Tatum. He only sees Tatum as a kind hearted man there to help him, and Leo is tragic for that misjudging of character. He places all of his trust in an awful person, out only for his own advancement. Late in the film, when it becomes obvious that Leo is going to die before the roundabout rescue will get to Leo, Tatum becomes emotional for the first time in the story, but it's not because Leo is going to die. It's because Tatum's chance for saving himself from Albuquerque are going to die with Leo.Kirk Douglas gives a fantastic performance as Tatum, a man with almost no redeeming qualities who is eminently watchable from the moment he rides up to the Albuquerque newspaper in his towed car to the moment he collapses on the floor of the newspaper office, bleeding to death. The circus that pops up around Leo's unfortunate fate is the exact kind of awful portrait of easily led newspaper consumers that makes audience's squirm. This movie is so wonderfully constructed, written, and executed, and it's one of Billy Wilder's best films.",

It's simultaneously a very accurate foretelling of sensationalism and disaster porn. Kirk Douglas plays Chuck Tatum, a reporter who's been fired from previous jobs at big city newspapers. Hired by an Albuquerque newspaper, Chuck sees his big chance after he comes across a man trapped in a cave. Chuck gets the sheriff to deliberately prolong the rescue so that he can exploit the incident. Before too long, people from all over are gathering around the cave to watch the events unfolding: it practically turns into Disneyland. Chuck even convinces the man's emotionally distant wife to play the part of the heartbroken spouse.Without a doubt, the movie now looks horrifically prescient, given how many reporters have tried to use tragedy to further their own interests, and how the public eats it right up. By now, the movie almost looks like a documentary. Definitely one that I recommend. Also starring Jan Sterling, Bob Arthur and Porter Hall.",

For the life of me, I can't see how An American in Paris beat this masterpiece out of a golden statue.Kirk Douglas plays a hotshot journalist who, due to his somewhat difficult personality, isn't working for a big newspaper anymore. The only job he can get is in the small town of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Kirk is desperate for a big story, and when Richard Benedict, a local townsman, gets trapped in an old coal mine, he decides to turn the accident to his advantage. Before long, other news outlets are jumping on the story and tourists are putting Albuquerque on the map.Did you see All About Steve? Remember the second half of the film where Sandra Bullock gets trapped in the abandoned mine and all the newspeople exploit her situation for their own benefit? If you thought the social commentary aspect of that quirky comedy was interesting, you'll love Ace in the Hole. Granted, this movie is a heavy drama, so it's very different, but the story is one gigantic diatribe about people's selfish nature. Sometimes social commentary movies are tough to take because either the humor is distorted or the metaphors are too obvious, but Ace in the Hole nails it. This movie is fantastic, even though you'll probably feel like you need a shower afterwards.Kirk Douglas gives a fantastic, multi-layered performance that's one of the best in his career. In my humble opinion-and this comes from decades of crushing on bad boys-no one makes anger look as good as Kirk Douglas. The sexual tension between him and Jan Sterling scorches off the screen. If you didn't think Kirk was a total hunk before, you absolutely will after watching this movie.But enough about the eye candy.

            "content": "Not to be confused with the 1942 Woody Woodpecker short of the same name. Director/co-writer Billy Wilder's 1951 uncompromising harsh film noir is indeed a hard watch. After all, it portray human beings at its worst. It targets not only the shady newsworthy world, but also the general public's fierce appetite for tragedy and despair. So it was no surprised, when this movie came out in 1951, critics hated the film for its extreme cynicism. Without consulting Wilder, Paramount Pictures executive Y. Frank Freeman changed the title to 'The Big Carnival' just prior to its release, in order to make the film seem fun to watch. It didn't work, as audience avoided to go see it. Unfortunately, it got worst for Billy Wilder, as he was sued by screenwriter Victor Desny, who claimed Wilder's stole his propose script based on the 1929 story of W Floyd Collins and 1949 case of Kathy Fiscus. Wilder's attorneys responded that not only did a verbal plot summary not constitute a formal story submission, but the Collins case was of a historical nature and as such was not protected by copyright laws. In the end, the Judge ruled in favor of Wilder and Paramount. Despite that victory, the film became lost and for many years, the film prints lay nearly unwatched. Nevertheless, it did gain a wider audience, years later, when the movie aired on Turner Classic Movies. It's just funny that the movie aired on the network own by a billionaire, best known for starting the 24-hour cable news channel (CNN). Anyways, while on basic cable, it also did receive more praise from critics, because of its strong commentary on the power of 'sensationalizing' of the news and how the general public can be easily be manipulated. The story spoke, to many of them, since they work in journalism field. Modern critics even allow the black and white film to go to the Criterion Collection. Unfortunately, the film is still hard to watch for the general audience. The story of a loud-mouthed, self-obsessed, unscrupulous big-city newspaper reporter, Charles 'Chuck' Tatum (Kirk Douglas) trying to create a media-frenzied story out of a rescue mission of a good-hearted trading post owner named Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) who is trapped in a cave, while scheming with Leo's jaded unhappy wife, Lorraine (Jan Sterling) is just too dark for some. For me, it was watchable, but I did get turn off, by some of harsher moments of this film like the physical abuse, Chuck put on to Leo's self-center wife. All of those scenes, really did shock me. If not for film censorship at the time, this early 1950's film could have been made even darker and more realistic. Thank God, it didn't. I don't think, I would be able to watch it, without being upset. In my opinion, the film had enough good moments to out-weight the unpleasant ones, and enough realism, not to make it seem too over the top fluff film. This film is absolutely stunning in its clever shots. While, unrealistic, the sight of Leo's forlorn Papa Minosa (John Berkes) looking at the \"Rescue Fund\" sign after everyone's departure within a few minutes, with litter blowing in the wind was very haunting. Also, the final low-angled shot of bleeding and defeated journalist collapsing at the feet of his editor Mr. Boot (Porter Hall) was very powerful. I also love how all were mostly beautifully shot on location in New Mexico. The sets was also amazing. The made up cave that they made to look like the Indian Cliff Palace at Mesa Verde National Park seem so historical real. Even, the music by composer, Hugo Friedhofer and songs like 'We're Coming, Leo' by songwriters, Jay Livingston and Ray Evansnote was striking to listen to. All pretty catchy. The dialogue that Wilder wrote, was also brilliant. It had enough wit to make it, highly quotable. Kirk Douglas is an absolute powerhouse, because of it. He's really does want you to hate his commanding, cocky, repellant character. However, he does get a little too hammy and macho in certain scenes. In the other hand, the stunning Jan Sterling is also just as good on getting on, your nerves. It's just sad, that her character doesn't seem as female fatale as she should be. Nowhere as memorable as Barbara Stanwyck in 1944's 'Double Indemnity', in which this movie has a callback or mention in. Still, I just love Wilder's direction that he puts into all of his films. I like how he laid out, who Tatum is, in the first couple of minutes, with the job pitch. It really serve, as a great way of foreshadowing. Even the way, the movie ends, make you think. Did Chuck really change for the better, due to the events, or was he just looking for one last great hurrah? You'll never know. It's that ambiguous. It will make you think, even after the film. I also love the hidden metaphors that Wilder puts into this film such as Tatum's typewriter sounding like a rattlesnake in the box, ready to strike and the fact that Tatum undress his suspenders from his shirt as if to show that he's been lying the whole time, makes this film, worth rewatching multiply times. After all, this movie help inspire others great dark news films such as 1976's 'Network' & 2014's 'Nightcrawler'. Overall: While, 'Ace in the Hole' might be a little too hard-hitting for some. For me, I found the movie to be, very entertaining and relevant for the society, we now, live in. I highly recommended seeing it, at least once.",

            "content": "I first saw \"Ace in the Hole\" as \"The Big Carnival\" over 20 years ago, and it made a powerful impression on me. Seeing it again, the effect it has is even more powerful especially in light of today's media frenzies over everything from Britney, Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton, Lady Diana's life and death - 10 years after the accident that killed her - and speculation about the paternity of one of her children - frenzy over everything, that is, except mundane things like Iraq and the oil crisis.Kirk Douglas is Chuck Tatum, an ambitious, unethical, egotistical reporter fired from many of the big papers who takes a job in Albuquerque and stumbles upon a story that he believes will regenerate his career. Learning that a man, Leo Minosa, while searching for Indian artifacts to sell in his store/restaurant is trapped in a cave, Chuck makes himself crucial to the situation, befriending the man (Richard Benedict) and talking to him through a hole in the cave. There, the man, Chuck's ace in the hole, is trapped and unable to move. Chuck manipulates the situation in various ways to make the story last longer - and as he does, the dead town becomes alive with tourists, and the locals start making money. Eventually the site becomes a circus - with the circus and a ferris wheel actually moving in, as well as musicians, campers, and every other thing imaginable. Chuck aligns himself with a corrupt man running for mayor, and the two plan to emerge as heroes, with Chuck going back to New York to work in the big-time again. He beds Leo's wife (Jan Sterling) and ignores Leo's grieving parents. Along the way, everyone has forgotten about Leo, whose situation becomes a symbol of greed, lust for power, isolation, and finally guilt.This is a magnificent Wilder script that accompanies his crisp direction. Kirk Douglas is excellent as the flamboyant reporter who fights the last shred of decency he possesses, and Jan Sterling is great as Leo's wife (responsible for the line in the subject box - one of my favorite lines of all time) who only cares about getting a lot of money out of the tourists through the restaurant she and Leo own and then blowing town. Surprisingly timely and unfortunately realistic, \"Ace in the Hole\" is a must-see for its hard look at the media - and us.",

They are actually companion pieces but here Wilder was seen to have taken the cruelty and misanthropy too far in his uncompromising depiction of media manipulation. Outraged hacks went on the offensive and the public was repelled by the mirror image of human idiocy and gullability. The passage of time however has proved it to be disturbingly prescient.The film represents a turning point in the career of Mr. Wilder and marks a series of 'firsts'. He is now credited as Producer as well as Director and although they had done him proud he has chosen to dispense with the services of his regular collaborators, writer Charles Brackett and cinematographer John F. Seitz and would not go back to either again whilst he is here utilising the services of Charles Lang behind the camera for the first time. The film is also his first flop.Mr. Wilder has no doubt drawn upon his experience as a reporter in Vienna and Berlin and the story here is inspired by a notorious incident in America from the 1920's. He has wisely retained the services of editor Arthur Schmidt which means there is never a wasted shot. All of the characters, whether they be con men or dupes, predators or victims, are wonderfully drawn.As Chuck Tatum, an unscrupulous reporter with an eye on the Pulitzer Prize, Kirk Douglas is simply stupendous in his savagery and plays his role with Mephistophelian relish. Jan Sterling excels as a wife whose husband is trapped in a mountain cave and slowly dying while she cashes in on his misfortune and enjoys a bit of rough with Tatum and Porter Hall impresses as an idealistic newsman whose character happens to share his surname of Boot with that of the naive reporter in Evelyn Waugh's 'Scoop', another scathing satire on the Fourth Estate.This is not an easy film to like but it is not necessary to like a film in order to appreciate its merits. Faced with its critical drubbing and commercial failure Mr. Wilder pulled in his horns somewhat and by the end of the decade he was to observe immutable human nature through the medium of comedy.As inhuman interest story this is up there with the best and for anyone at all interested in Mr. Wilder's work this film cannot and must not be missed.",

Why it never has caught on with the public is beyond me--perhaps it was just too cynical and people wanted to believe it couldn't be based on truth.Kirk Douglas plays a newspaper man who happens to be out in the middle of nowhere. It just so happens that there is a cave-in nearby and Douglas decides this is exactly the sort of story he can bleed dry AND establish himself. So, this minor little story is soon blown totally out of proportion and the area becomes a huge media circus. The only problem is that soon Douglas finds out that the man trapped inside is already dead, so he struggles with his conscience and his instincts that this STILL can be a top story. Amazingly, when the dead man's widow finds out the truth, she isn't particularly concerned about him--just how she, too, can profit from the media attention! This is a very rich and insightful film--one that is as applicable now as it was then. In an age where minor stories are prostituted by the press (such as when there is ANY car chase in L.A. or when a pretty White woman either disappears or commits a crime), this movie manages to still be very timely and brilliant.

He's been recently fired from a big city newspaper, and so is desperate to get his career back on track.After months of living in a rut, Chuck finally stumbles upon the perfect story. Deep within some old Indian ruins, a treasure hunter has gotten himself stuck in a cave-in. Guy in a well. That'll sell papers, right? What follows is genius, as Tatum engineers the story to be far bigger than it really is. We watch as he manipulates the rescue engineers, the local sheriff, the victim's wife, all with the intent of prolonging the incident and keeping the victim underground as long as possible. This gives Tatum time to write more stories, profit off sensationalism, become a major celebrity in his own right, and land piles of cash.Whilst Wilder's crafted an original screenplay, his film slowly slides into obviousness. We know Tatum is going to lose his \"soul\", the only question is how soon and how badly. Thankfully Wilder pushes his story into suitably depressing territory. Just as the media circus has reached its most frenzied point, Wilder has Tatum's story literally die. Everyone's shocked and Tatum begins to feel pangs of guilt. And why shouldn't he? He's exploited and commodified suffering! Of course most news reporting is like this nowadays, but back in the 50's this was pretty dark stuff, Wilder chastising, not only the media circus, but the family members of victims and audience members who readily lap up drivel.8/10 - Worth two viewings.

A year later, on his way to a nothing assignment, accompanied by wide-eyed news business newcomer Herbie Cook (Robert Arthur), he gets wind of a potentially explosive story. Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) is a man from a small town called Escudero, who's gotten trapped in an Indian ruin while prospecting for artifacts. The out-of-favour journalist then milks the situation for everything that it's worth, all in the name of putting a spark back into his career.This now-70-years-old picture may not have gotten very favourable reviews (or done a lot of business) back in 1951, but it's a VERY prescient film that gets so much right about the darker aspects of journalism. Cynical in tone overall, it tells a compelling story, co-written by director Billy Wilder, that is inspired by a 1925 incident that Douglas actually references in his dialogue (the reporter in that case went on to win a Pulitzer). It's ahead of the curve in the way that it portrays a \"media circus\", with thousands of people gathered outside the caves, with rides and vendors and entertainers and everything, all supposedly in the name of raising money for the rescue effort. It's all too easy to be wary of people in the news business who exploit stories to the fullest, in order to get readers or ratings or whatever, and this is so well embodied in the films' general portrayal of the media.Douglas' performance is one of his absolute fiercest, but he's supported by equally fine actors such as Jan Sterling (she plays the weary wife whose first instinct is to leave her husband to his maker), Porter Hall, Frank Cady, Ray Teal, John Berkes, Gene Evans, Frank Jaquet, Harry Harvey, and Richard Gaines. Ultimately, we begin seeing something of a change in Chuck as he realizes what he's started, and how it's eclipsed the whole human interest aspect to the story.Wilders' film may have been out of the step with the times in 1951, but in this day and age, it resonates stronger than ever.10 out of 10.",

It stars Kirk Douglas, Jan Sterling, Bob Arthur, Porter Hall and Richard Benedict. Music is by Hugo Friedhofer and cinematography by Charles Lang Jr.Chuck Tatum (Douglas) is a one time big-city journalist who is now stuck working for an out of the way Albuquerque newspaper. When on his way to another mundane reporting job he happens upon the chance to exploit a story about a man trapped in a cave to rekindle his career and put him back in the big league. However, the situation quickly escalates into an out-of-control media circus...Inspired by the real life Floyd Collins disaster in 1925, Ace in the Hole finds Wilder on supreme acerbic and cynical form. Flopping upon release, nobody was quite ready for Wilder to paint an uncompromising portrait of the human spirit stinking to high heaven. It now holds up as one of the finest exponents of media machinations and the human fallibility that encompasses a thirst for tragedy.Douglas leads the way with one of his finest and intensified performances, filling Chuck Tatum with a reprehensible attitude to media ladder climbing. When one witnesses the harrowing sequences as Tatum talks to the trapped Leo Minosa (Benedict tugs the heart strings), telling him it's going to be alright, we feel complicit in knowing just exactly what is going on up top. Leo adores his wife Lorraine (Sterling a splendidly subtle shallow perf hiding hollow turmoil), but she has wanted out for some time, but under Chatum's prompting she sticks around to make money on her husbands trapped suffering.Pretty soon this one store tin-pot town is booming, tills are ringing and the papers are selling big time, the coupling of Tatum and Lorraine is a match made in hell. Dialogue is in true noir fashion often sharp and biting, even with some of Wilder's customary humour deftly tucked away. As the exploitation of the situation reaches fever pitch, and the hypocrisy of the human condition is laid bare, \"Ace in the Hole\" proves itself to be a pitiless story that is a compelling journey for the viewers invested in the darker shades of what Wilder was fronting. A big flip-flop for a main character's behaviour at film's end seems a little out of place, given what has preceded it, but the ending is straight out of noirville and ensures the pic is a near masterpiece from a true master of his craft. 9/10",

This is like a fable with deep significance, which must cause much after-thought. Kirk Douglas is brilliant as the ruthless opportunistic journalist whio accepts no resistance and won't listen to anyone but himself but just keeps blundering on committing mistakes all the way - but finally realizing them and paying for them. At the same time it's a very moral tale but terrible in its merciless exposure of the almost universal fallacy of opportunism, a temptation which almost no one can refuse and most get caught in, and there are no escapes here, except perhaps for the pious mother, who stands apart from the beginning. It's an impressing looming drama as a monument to human weakness prone to get caught in any trap of vanity, and for once Billy Wilder has ciosen the right music for his film. He never repeated himself, but this film is perhaps the one that stands most apart as his most singular and virtuous production.",

Ace in the Hole was a flop upon release in 1951; and has had trouble being released since, and thus it has not been seen by as many people as Wilder's other films. However, many more people will know the story featured here - it's the one featured in the episode of The Simpsons where Bart Simpson finds himself stuck down a well; only here the story is spun courtesy of two of the most cynical leads you'll ever find in any film; and while Ace in the Hole is undoubtedly an out and out masterpiece and one of the finest films Billy Wilder ever directed; it's actually not all that hard to see why the film has not sold well to all audiences. The plot focuses on Charles Tatum; a former big time reporter who arrives in a small town in New Mexico. He lands himself a job on a small newspaper and makes no secret of the fact that he's hoping it will lead him back onto bigger and more lucrative pastures. Nothing is happening in the local area; until one day when Tatum gets his big break. A man has got himself stuck in a cave supposedly inhabited by the ghosts of dead Indians and our anti-hero soon spots himself a chance for a story; and quickly he finds a way to delay the rescue operation and turn the area into a media circus.Kirk Douglas is probably best known for his role in Spartacus; but for me there is no doubt that he gives his career best performance in this film. Douglas is absolutely superb as the amoral antagonist and thoroughly convinces that he is the character he is playing. Jan Sterling stars opposite Douglas as the equally cold wife of the trapped man who sees the tragedy as a way to get out of her marriage. She gives a performance that is arguably even colder than Douglas'. The fact that both lead characters are utterly callous means that the film will be hard to get on with for some people; but for me the film is more than just a sum of the lead characters anyway. The film is an expose of what unadulterated selfish greed can lead to (mixed in with a parody on the importance of the media) and this is more than enough to keep its audience interested. However, Wilder does not appear to condemn the actions of the central characters and indeed the film just lets the story play out for what it is; leaving the audience to make all judgements on the characters, and in return the film is much more powerful than it would have been had the director tried to force the audience to think in a certain way. The film could even be considered a test of every audience member's cynicism; as the views of the characters and the situation are likely to vary with every person that sees this film. Overall, Ace in the Hole is an intelligent and poignant masterpiece that really needs to start getting the attention it deserves. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest films I've ever seen in my life and I would warmly recommend to anyone that considers themselves a fan of cinema.",

            "content": "The main character of this film is Chuck Tatum, once a well-known reporter with several major East Coast newspapers, whose career has gone into decline after he has been sacked from several jobs for various reasons, connected with either his disregard for journalistic ethics or his hard-drinking, womanising lifestyle. He washes up in New Mexico where he finds a job with a minor local paper, the Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin. He still hopes, however, that he can revive his career if he can land a major scoop.Tatum gets his opportunity when he learns that an amateur archaeologist named Leo Minosa has become trapped in a cave while excavating for ancient Indian artefacts. He cynically exploits the situation, reaching a deal with Kretzer, the corrupt local sheriff for exclusive access to the cave in exchange for favourable publicity which should guarantee Kretzer's re-election. Worse still, he and Kretzer persuade the contractors hired to rescue Leo to adopt a slower method, which means that it will take then a week rather than 24 hours to reach him. They claim that the new method is safer, but Tatum's real motivation is that he hopes to keep the story front-page news for a week, long enough for the national press to become interested.His hopes are fully realised, and the affair becomes a media sensation. Not only do reporters from all over the country turn up at the remote site, so do members of the public, anxious to see a place where great events are supposedly taking place, even if they cannot see into the cave where Leo is trapped. A \"carnival\" (in the American sense of \"funfair\") is organised to entertain them, hence the film's alternative title \"The Big Carnival\". (The original title is a metaphor derived from poker, where a player's \"card in the hole\" is one which is not disclosed to his opponents. Leo is \"in a hole\" in several senses- in the literal one, in the metaphorical one of being in trouble or danger and in the sense that he is Tatum's hidden card).Kirk Douglas rarely played a straightforward villain. Some of his most memorable characters such as Midge Kelly in \"Champion\", Jim McLeod in \"Detective Story\", Rick Martin in \"Young Man with a Horn\", even Van Gogh in \"Lust for Life\" are flawed individuals, but never to such an extent that they altogether forfeit our sympathy. Even Jonathan Shields in \"The Bad and the Beautiful\" is not entirely bad. Chuck Tatum is perhaps the nearest thing to a despicable rat that he ever played, at least in those of his films which I have seen. He is hard, cynical selfish and materialistic, a man who never gives a thought to anyone other than himself except to think about he can make use of them. Even a sudden and unexpected change of heart near the end of the film does not entirely redeem Tatum in our eyes, if only because it comes too late to undo the damage which he has already done. It was a rare opportunity for Douglas to play a character like this, and he makes the most of it, giving one of his best performances.Another good contribution comes from Jan Sterling as Leo's attractive young wife Lorraine. The marriage is an unhappy one and she is not really concerned by her husband's plight, although of course she poses as grief-stricken for the press. She begins an affair with Tatum, motivated less by love for him than by the thought that he offers her a way out of the dull life she leads in a small New Mexico village.The film is sometimes described as \"film noir\", and it does have one typical noir characteristic, that of moral ambiguity, although its visual look is very different from that of classic noirs like \"Double Indemnity\". Whereas those films typically took place in the dark, grimy, often rainy mean streets of America's big cities, most of the action in \"Ace in the Hole\" takes place under the harsh, glaring sunlight of the New Mexico desert. It is, in fact, a difficult film to classify. It is really too bleak to regard as a comedy; it is really a serious drama, but one which makes use of satirical black comedy techniques to make its points.When the film it came out in 1951 it was not popular with either the public or the critics, who were perhaps disconcerted by the way it blurs the boundaries between established genres. It was also seen as unduly cynical in its attitude towards that cherished American institution, the Press. There was a tradition in Hollywood of making heroes out of fearless, campaigning reporters and editors who spoke truth to power and exposed wrongdoing in high places. Americans did not like being told that the Press had some dark secrets of its own in the way it tried to manipulate public opinion and regarded getting a big scoop as more important than any human considerations. The Hays Office also disliked the portrayal of Kretzer. Corrupt lawmen were acceptable in Westerns set several decades in the past, less so in contemporary dramas.Today, of course, we have got used to film-makers lampooning our cherished institutions; indeed, we expect them to do so. A film which told us that journalists can be self-serving and law officers corrupt would raise no eyebrows in 2021. \"Ace in the Hole\", which in 1951 was Billy Wilder's first critical and commercial failure as director, is now regularly voted onto lists of \"The Greatest Movies of All Time\", along with other Wilder classics such as \"Double Indemnity\", \"The Lost Weekend\", \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"Sabrina\" and \"Some Like It Hot\". A film whose time has come. 9/10.",

The characters, in particular Chuck Tatum, one of Kirk Douglas\u00b4 greatest roles, are highly developed and interesting; there are no heroes here, and no evildoers either, just a bunch of working men who happen to have the easiest opportunity of their lives to gain a fortune over a fatal tragedy. The analysis of journalism contained in the movie is simple and clear; newspapers are meant to wrap up fish. Whats the matter if you can make some money in the process? It is the murder of the truth, if there is any. A brilliant film, one of Wilder\u00b4s best. See it.",

            "content": "As if to rub viewers noses in his versatility Billy Wilder shot Sunset Boulevard and this one back to back with Sunset being released one year earlier in 1950. Not surprisingly a failure on its release this movie is as good a definition of Wilder as any in his vast and impressive repertoire indeed the words cynic, cynicism and cynical might have been invented to describe the typical Wilder film. As always he had no time for 'fancy' shots and angles - in Wilder everything is couched in 'traditional' Long, Medium, Close and the standard variations, Medium-Close, etc, but he does shoot a couple of low angles sparingly here and uses Chuck Tatum's body walking toward and blocking the camera and then walking away again to illustrate a time-lapse, the twelve months that Tatum has been cooling his heels in New Mexico. The exposition is equally brilliant with Tatum (Kirk Dougles) flaunting his journalistic CV and explaining to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 that one story is all it takes to make it back to the big time and how, when such a story appears, a smart reporter will milk it to the full and then, of course, he proceeds to do just that when Leo Mimosa gets trapped in a cave and Tatum works the angles to keep him there. For those caring to look for them there are parallels with Sunset Boulevard - the audience who flock to see a Norma Desmond and/or a Leo Mimosa and then, once the novelty has worn off, turns away from them and in both cases it was skillful PR work and/or intrepid reporters who brought them to the attention of the audience in the first place. Wilder liked to use actors more than once and both Porter Hall and Richard Gaines appeared in both Double Indemnity and this one. Religious overtones abound both overtly in Leo's conviction that the 'Gods' are angry with him because he 'steals' their artifacts and a tad less overtly in Jan Sterling - as Leo's floozy wife Lorraine -taking a bite out of an apple whilst trying crudely to tempt Tatum, and Sheriff Ray Teal's pet rattler. Just as Bill Holden's Joe Gillis thought he'd landed on the gravy train only to wind up on the wrong end of a bullet so Chuck Tatum in Wilder's very next film winds up on the wrong end of a pair of scissors; like Crime, Cynicism Does Not Pay.

There's a lot to admire about this film but I still found a few problems, which I comment on first. I think the film makes the mistake of making the carnival a tad bit too big. I think the point is well received but the screenplay goes a bit too far in beating the viewer over the head with its message about telling the truth. I think we get beaten over the head a tad bit too much that it becomes rather obvious what's going to happen in the end. With that said, this is still a very impressive film that certainly has a lot going for it. The direction by Wilder is excellent throughout and he really sells the comedy hidden within the darkness of the story and characters. He also comes up with some very beautiful shots including the terrific stuff inside the mine where we see the trapped miner looking up through a small hole to communicate with Douglas. As for Douglas, he turns in another terrific performance and I think I say that after each new film I watch of his. That crazed intensity he brings to his characters is something that no other actor could do and I think that's what makes him so great. The supporting cast is equally impressive with Jan Sterling being a standout as the miner's wife. Richard Benedict also really stands out as the trapped miner and his role and performance gives what little heart the film has in it.",

            "content": "Certainly, the exploitation press has been in business for many decades, and this classic film noir has received a cult following since its inauspicious debut in the cynical early 1950's post-war Hollywood. Following up his 1950 masterpiece, \"Sunset Boulevard\", director Billy Wilder went from slamming his own industry to slamming journalism and the public's obsession with certain type of public interest news stories that goes on from basic human compassion to an all-out sickness in regards to exploiting human tragedy. By mentioning the famous Floyd Collins case, this doesn't attempt to be a retread of that story, but shows how a news item can turn a human interest story into a zoo where humanity loses its grip on really caring about a potentially tragic personal event.Here, the fictional account of a man trapped inside a mountain cave-in looks like the perfect opportunity for down-on-his-luck ace reporter Kirk Douglas to rebuild his reputation by taking the last job that he wants, on a small town newspaper and hoping for the big story that will to return him to the good graces of the publishers who have fired him. sense to the middle of nowhere to cover a rattlesnake hunt, Kirk comes across a time-bomb of a story with the trapped man (Richard Benedict) barely able to breathe and unable to move his legs. when is initial story is reported, word spreads and curiosity Seekers begin to show up, and even the man's wife (Jan Sterling) seems more interested in the circus surrounding the event rather than her own husband's safety. in spite of his cynicism, Douglas begins to have a fight with his own conscience and begins to die internally as Benedict begins to face death through the inability of rescuers to drill through the mountaintop.An absolutely superb screenplay, brilliant performances and excellence photography makes this film, a disappointment at the time, a dark and grimm look into a weakness in humanity that still plagues the world today. Douglas reaches deep into his book of acting tricks and really makes you see every aspect of this cynical characters nature. He is not likeable at all, but definitely begins to gain sympathy as the true tragedy of the story and the carnival like nature building around the man's rescue begins to disgust him. Sterling is riveting in a very showy performance, a tough girl trapped in a loveless marriage who sees her husband's predicament as a way to get out of a marriage she wants no part of. Porter Hall and Robert Arthur are excellent as Douglas's boss and the young photographer assisting Douglas. Frank Cady of \"Green Acres\" is instantly recognizable as the first looky loo arrival on the scene.This is one of those films that probably was not a hit at the time because it made the public uneasy in its view of how disgusting humanity could be when a story became less about the subject and more about circulation and money making schemes. The idea of selling ice cream and cotton candy to the waiting public and putting in carnival rides really shows on immorality that the public didn't want to admit about themselves. But sometimes, being uncomfortable with a subject matter is what begins to change things, and unfortunately, this film did not accomplish that mission. If it has achieved anything over the past 65 years, it opens up conversation to the responsibility of the press and the limits it should take when reporting certain types of stories.",

He has come west to New Mexico from New York City, along the way being fired from eleven newspapers for slander, adultery and heavy drinking, among other charges. Now that his car has broken down and Tatum is broke, he talks his way into a reporting job for the Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin, a paper of little consequence.Tatum is definitely a character, living with the truism that \"Bad news sells best. Cause good news is no news.\" Unfortunately for some of those around him, Tatum thinks that it is perfectly acceptable to make news if none exists. Why save a man in one day if you can drag the story out a week? (Compare this to the 1974 \"phantom kangaroo\" of Chicago. That stories went on for weeks or months, and maybe was not even real.) Tatum also is not afraid to make cracks at everyone, even the victim's wife. \"When they bleached your hair, they must have bleached your brain, too.\" The movie references and plays off the Floyd Collins case of 1925. Newspaper reporter William Burke \"Skeets\" Miller participated in and reported on the rescue efforts from the scene. Miller also talked with and interviewed Collins in the cave, for which he received a Pulitzer Prize. His reports were widely distributed by telegraph and printed by newspapers around the country, and in some foreign countries, and the rescue attempts were followed by regular news bulletins on the brand-new medium of broadcast radio. Shortly after the media arrived, the publicity drew crowds of tourists to the site, at one point numbering in the tens of thousands. Vendors set up to sell food and souvenirs, contributing to a circus-like atmosphere. If you watch \"Ace in the Hole\", this will sound familiar.There is really not much to say by way of review. Billy Wilder has proved he can tell a good story with \"Double Indemnity\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\". He proves it again here. And Kirk Douglas made a career of playing \"son of a gun\" characters. This is one of his earliest, but by no means is he a light-hearted fellow. If you have enjoyed Wilder and/or Douglas in other films, this is one to check out. Panned in its day, now we see that Wilder was ahead of his time.Wilder has said he went into directing in order to protect the integrity of his scripts. Indeed, the strength of many of his films (including this one) remains the story and dialogue. Though he should not sell himself short on the visuals. While that may not be his intention, he does just fine in portraying his characters in a strong light.The Criterion commentary helps point out allusions that we may miss, and may or may not be intentional. Multiple early moments are compared to, of all films, Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rope\". He also raises the issue of misogyny in Billy Wilder's films, something which may not occur to the average viewer.",

            "content": "I have recently embarked on a chronological retrospective of the works of Billy Wilder that is proving to be a wayward journey through some pretty uneven territory. He hit the jackpot early on with \"Double Idemnity\" a film noir with a script that is simply light years away in quality from most others of the genre. Then came a really duff period with \"The Lost Weekend\", worthy in many respects, not least for Ray Milland's superb performance as an alcoholic, but drowned in a plethora of hysterical visuals and a Miklos Rozsa score to beat them all in over-intrusiveness; the daft Austrian never-never-land of \"The Emperor Waltz\"; the equally daft mission by the unbelievable Congresswoman Frost to investigate what the military rank and file were getting up to in the postwar Berlin of \"A Foreign Affair\" and, to cap it all, that lurid melodrama \"Sunset Boulevard\" which leaves me completely out of step with its many admirers. The cocktail that includes a dead monkey, a German \"heavy\" manservant playing an organ, a has-been ex-actress and her toyboy who delivers the interior monologue when he becomes a corpse in a swimming pool is just too over the top for me. \"Ace in the Hole\" that followed is an altogether different matter. I have to admit it was the one I was not looking forward to as I had glowing memories of it as a youth. The pedestal of adolescent worship has on more that one occasion easily toppled. Imagine my delight when I discovered that time has in no way reduced the intensity of this savage attack on the power of a newspaperman to exploit human suffering to further his ambition. Politicians, construction overseers, the general public - their ghoulish instincts played upon - all are corrupted in Wilder's cynical attack on the basest impulses of mankind. It is a film where only the weak, the man trapped in the cave, his parents and the editor of a conservative local newspaper, show any sign of virtue. And yet, in the sense of dignity with which Wilder depicts them, they are the real winners, whereas the corrupt journalist, brilliantly played by Kirk Douglas, ends up by losing everything including that gift of life he has so cruelly deprived of the trapped man. In \"Ace in the Hole\" Wilder gave us a beautifully balanced moral drama, his only work to stand beside the best of Elia Kazan in its sense of social conscience. I know there are quite a few more excellent thing to come in his oeuvre but at this point I cannot imagine anything finer.",

It's something that is rarely seen in 50's movies. Kirk Douglas on the other hand played this role more often than not as it forces you to give 100% and he always did. An actor 30 years ahead of his time and constantly carries these older movies that otherwise are full of silliness and mediocre acting as you'd expect. Here the movie remains fairly serious. It never really dives into the typical 50's silliness, weird dialogue, silly plot, and flat acting where nothing makes logical sense. It's a serious story with an overly serious grim ending.Jan Sterling looks glorious here with a very peculiar blonde look. And she and the other smaller roles are very fine here as they don't have to do too much. Kirk Douglas is in every scene here and carries it all.Now, the story overall is good. We have Kirk Douglas the journalist make sure that the rescue team that is supposed to save a man stuck in a cave goes the long way in by drilling from the top. It takes days instead of a single day. Meanwhile he writes the story and gets popular and rich as it drags on for days. Jan Sterling wants to divorce the guy stuck in at the mine and date Douglas instead. Basically 2 big city outsiders are egotistical and want everything right now. They want money and big city life and hate being nobodies. The small town folk are overall good, but very gullible and are easily tricked by bad guys. The 50's setting is what makes the movie. The cars, technology, clotches, jobs. The setting makes the movie as the story is overly simple.I'm not a fan of the ending. The caver just dies at the very end as they don't get to him in time. His wife then runs away to New York as she would have done anyhow. The parents are sad. Douglas dies as he doesn't tend to a stomach wound the wife gave him. I get that bad guys need to die if they do something bad. The old Hollywood code made sure you could always predict all endings. There is nothing deep to the story. I expected the ending and as I got it I felt like it belonged in a short film. I watched a long movie for an ending I already knew would come about if the operation failed - we know Douglas will die too then. I feel let down for sure. There is not much to figure out, no deeper or complicated moral values, no happy ending to tie it all together. It just stops all of a sudden. I liked the movie otherwise, but it's like it didn't dare to go anywhere interesting. We don't even see the cave digger die. So I was constantly wondering if Douglas just lied to people or if it happened. But as the ending continues for another few minutes you sorta get that this is it. Just this lazy outcome. He just died off screen!I really wanted Douglas to grow from the experience. To get somewhere interesting and curious. It's not even clear how he convinced a whole digging crew to NOT rescue the man fast. Just a stupid outsider using the sheriff to force a professional crew to dig the long way. Makes no sense. Obviously they all belong in prison as they got a man killed. The professional crew listened to a fool. These small things make it unrealistic enough so that it doesn't really hit you hard emotionally. If you want a man to live then you can do this silly stuff and have viewers largely forget about it. If you want to kill him off you need to make it realistic not just force it. But it's a fun little flick that's above the usual 50's stuff. Everything besides the ending is fun enough. Maybe a remake is in order?There are other cave rescue movies and they are all a bit low quality as they never try to follow real rescue missions, but just reimagine everything. This is such a movie too, but it's one of the stronger ones. The fact that it is old makes you want to look past some of the weaker stuff in it.",

Charles \"Chuck\" Tatum (Kirk Douglas) was one such man.Chuck was a newspaper man who was between jobs and stranded in Albuquerque, New Mexico with a broken down vehicle. Being ever the salesman, he fast-talked the editor, Mr. Boot (Porter Hall) of the Albuquerque Sun--Bulletin, into giving him a job as a reporter. You knew all you needed to know about Chuck when he said he'd been fired from eleven papers and that \"if there's no news he'd go out and bite a dog.\" Chuck's sole goal was to become a reporter there, repair his tarnished image, and move on to bigger and better places.Chuck got the job, but he found himself languishing in New Mexico a lot longer than he'd expected. After a year there he was going stir crazy and saw no path out until he was gifted a once in a lifetime human interest piece. A man by the name of Leo Minosa (Michael Benedict) was trapped in a mine in the Mountain of Seven Vultures. Leo being trapped was a Godsend. If Chuck could figure out a way to extend Leo's entrapment, he could milk the story for all it was worth and have the big market media boys eating out of the palm of his hand.Chuck did what so many people have done before, and that's look for their fifteen minutes of fame and stretch it to sixteen. Chuck differed from most because there was a man's life at stake, and the longer he was in peril the longer Chuck would be riding high. It was a horrible situation for Leo and a magnificent one for Chuck.It's funny that the movie \"Ace in the Hole\" used a human interest story to point out human greed. In this case Chuck's greed was for fame and name recognition. Such stories have always been done and in various ways. \"Ace in the Hole\" had its own way of showing human greed and it worked.Free on Pluto TV.",

It takes an entire year for a juicy story to fall into his lap - A stricken miner becomes trapped after a cave-in - and Tatum wrings it for all its worth. His headline grabbing flair and salesmanship brings in droves of curious onlookers, glory hunters and of course the men required to save the stricken miner. The latter of course choose the most logical course, bolster the fallen ceiling enough to reach the stricken man. However Tatum decides to drag things out, so that he can play the story for as much tension and drama as he can, driving newspaper sales and his own bank account and inflated ego all the while. He enlists and thus corrupts the rescue foreman and local sheriff to make this happen. These are simple folk and are easily bamboozled by the slick and cunning Tatum. This of course has tragic consequences for the stricken minor whose cheery demeanor belies a much worse condition. ** The next paragraph will spoil this movie so stop now if that's a problem for you. **Movies in this time period had to show that \"crime doesn't pay\" so the ending is a downer, but logical given Tatum's hubris and all the tragic consequences it brings. It's ending poses a similar question to the one in the classic western Shane (1953); does the hero die at the end? Some argue Tatum just collapses in exhaustion, while others say he dies. The way another character just lets himself go toward his demise, gives an insight to that possibility. The one flaw in that death is that Tatum could have just given him ear plugs! Despite that plot hole, Ace In The Hole (1951) is a near perfect film that gives insight into the muckraking art of the con artist and how that relates to mass media. Anyone interested in media, politics and propaganda should watch this film. Its right up there with Network (1976).",

            "content": "ACE IN THE HOLE is Billy Wilder's gritty censure of a collusion between an egocentric reporter Chuck Tatum (Douglas) and the corrupt local Sheriff Gus Kretzer (Teal), who immorally manipulate the entire action of rescuing a man trapped in a cave-in, to their own self-serving purposes, during the process, Tatum's moral conscience has been interminably tested until the worst-case scenario inevitably occurs and pushes him to a futile redemptive effort which will send him to his doom. Tatum, once a big-city journalist in New York, now has been stuck in Albuquerque, New Mexico for over a year, his sole resolution is to seize a sensational story as the springboard to get his old job back, or it turns out, he can also create one, he is astute enough to sense the opportunity and unscrupulous enough to capitalise on it even if it is a man's life at stake. Flaunting with his smart-ass elitism, Tatum is bluntly unlikeable from the start to the mid-stream where he and Gus, who appears to be a more stereotyped scum, exploit and intervene the rescue schedule to serve their personal interest, this is not pure evil, it is human frailty, which is so common and widely rooted in every corner of the world, that is why such deeds can be rudimentarily harmful to our society and the movie should be enshrined for its boldness alone which can cultivate generations of audience about the integrity of a reporter and more far-reachingly vital, advice us, billions of onlookers, how to take a lucid stand when facing sensationalism on a daily basis. Then, when he finally accepts the aftermath, his transformation brings about a captivating crescendo with sublime poignancy until the film's final scene. Under Wilder's firm hands, and the screenplay is glistening with sharp witticism - bad news sells fast, good news is no news - subconsciously we all know that, but what if this intrinsic response to our curiosity and imagination, could be very handily engineered to lead us astray under the flag of \"truth disclosure\"? How can we be wise enough to discern it and outsmart it? In a perfect world, the movie should be introduced in every high school classroom. Kirk Douglas, who is still with us today and one-year short of his centenary, the oldest living star from the Golden Era, is utterly fitting in this role, harsh, masculine, misogynous, only belatedly let his remorse and desperation surface when the comeuppance cannot be redeemed. Also, Jan Sterling stuns in a top-notch performance as Lorraine Minosa, the wife of the trapped man Leo (Benedict), who takes the accident not just as a windfall to earn some quick-money, but as a getaway from her dead-end marriage and the bleak land. Her conducts are contemptible thanks to Wilder's effort to make Leo look like a devoted husband, and she is an accomplice in the game, but unlike Tatum, the astonishing part is her relentless pitilessness to his husband, she is also craving for someone better, some place better, a better life, another penetrating portrayal of human frailty and Sterling's acting is overwhelmingly accurate, especially during the slapping scene, her reaction is so genuine and totally believable. It is high time to justify this film's classic esteem since ACE IN THE HOLE was a critical failure in Wilder's output when it came out, it was even renamed as THE BIG CARNIVAL out of despair to lure audience into a revealing cautionary tale, while unfortunately, it was too realistic to those who are looking for escapism in the theatre, critics are strident too, maybe the fiasco did alter Wilder's orbit, since then, his works, as masterful as they are, are ultimately less pertinent and trenchant to social realism, and a comedic overtone would supersede the bleakness, that's another reason why this film is so exceptional and still relevant till this day.",

Here he has both, and he's in his element with Billy Wilder's direction making the most of a cynical story of a reporter exploiting human drama for his own benefit.JAN STERLING, as the trapped man's wife, matches Douglas for toughness every step of the way. \"I met a lot of hard-boiled eggs in my time,\" she tells Douglas, whom she sees through with his scheme of profiteering from the accident. \"But you're twenty minutes.\" A few more cynical remarks and he's smacking her across the face twice.No one looks any good, as far as the characters go. The gawkers are shown to be the sort that stare at accidents and are soon turning Sterling's tacky establishment into a gold mine. The cynical screenplay catches all of the nuances of the exploited situation and Douglas comes up with remarks like, \"Tomorrow that will be yesterday's news and they'll wrap a fish in it.\" As the arrogant man who delays the rescue to milk the situation for the most he can get out of it, KIRK DOUGLAS gives a riveting performance as a louse. He never tries to soften the part, nor does director Wilder ever shy away from exposing the hypocrisy at work.Still a very timely story and expose of hypocrisy on several levels by the press and public. RICHARD BENEDICT as the trapped man and ROBERT ARTHUR as a naive young reporter are both excellent in strong supporting roles.Summing up: Brilliant film deserves much more attention than it gets.",

The storyline revolves around less than big city newspaper and Kirk's rather new undertaking as somewhat jaded journalist who has trouble dealing with authority and anyone incapable of seeing things his way.Therefore getting the boot from many a newspaper due to intranisigence and lack of good manners.Which makes for really good drama about his new plight and overall character flaws and strenghts.

Basically Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas) is a cynical, unethical, unscrupulous, fiercely ambitious, self-centred, wisecracking and down-on-his-luck journalist who comes from New York, hoping to be given a chance with a small newspaper in New Mexico. He was previously fired for his drinking, lying and an affair with the wife of one of his bosses, his real intention is to use the small newspaper as a platform to get back into a bigger one, but a year passes with no sensational news story, and he is totally bored. One day Chuck travels with a younger reporter to cover a story about rattlesnakes, arriving at an isolated gas station Chuck is informed a man named Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) is trapped following a collapse in an old Indian mine, near to a place called the Mountain of the Seven Vultures. Chuck finds and meets the man still alive inside the mine, he convinces him he is a friend trying to help him get out, however he is manipulating the local corrupt Sheriff Gus Kretzer (Ray Teal) to stop other journalists getting their hands on the story or others getting close to the man himself. Chuck is also manipulating the engineer responsible for the rescue operation into using the sophisticated drilling system from above, rather than through existing passages, this would have taken hours, but it takes days, but it is to prolong Leo's stay and make the front pages of nationwide newspapers. Chuck is also getting too close to Leo's wife Lorraine (Jan Sterling), she in fact was planning to leave her husband, thanks to Chuck's publicity she experiences a financial windfall, particularly from thousands of tourists coming to witness the rescue, this in fact becomes a media circus, even a carnival with rides, entertainment and songs about Leo. Chuck, who has started drinking again, is trying to keep Leo's spirits up whilst he is still trapped, he talks about being with his wife again and things he will do when he gets out, but Chuck becomes aware that his health is declining, and he cannot drill the quicker way, for fear of th faster alternative route making the press, and it is now dangerous as the walls would cave in. After five days of drilling the party atmosphere is abruptly stopped when Chuck announces to the crowd that Leo has died, his mistreatment of Leo's wife also comes to a head when they get into an argument and she stabs him in the back with a pair of scissors, he barely reaches his old office in Albuquerque, he is about to announce that he helped cause the death of Leo, but he collapses on the floor, it is unknown whether he is dead or not. Also starring Robert 'Bob' Arthur as Herbie Cook, Porter Hall as Jacob Q. Boot, Frank Cady as Al Federber, Lewis Martin as McCardle, John Berkes as Papa Minosa, Frances Dominguez as Mama Minosa, Frank Jaquet as Sam Smollett, Harry Harvey as Dr. Hilton, Bob Bumpas as Radio Announcer, Geraldine Hall as Nellie Federber and Gene Evans as Deputy Sheriff. Douglas is fantastic playing the manipulative and intense journalist he goes to extremes, i.e. prolonging a man's agony, to keep what he calls his story, this really displays director Wilder's witty talent, it really shows the darker side of the media industry, it is odd to think that this flopped at the cinema, but it is fantastically scripted and performed masterpiece, a must see and brilliant satirical drama.

But when he learns about a man stuck in a cave, he quickly uses this opportunity to re-jumpstart his career by exploiting the trapped man's situation, bribing the officials to prolong the rescue operation & eventually creating a national media sensation that soon goes out-of-control, leading to terrible consequences.Brilliantly directed from start to finish, it's quite shocking to discover that this quality feature film was a critical & commercial failure when it released but its reception has improved with time as the disgusting portrait of press media it paints has only become more relevant over the years. Deftly written, crisply photographed in black n white & seamlessly put together by its narrow editing, its major strength comes from Kirk Douglas' biting performance as the disgraced reporter who stops at nothing to regain his tarnished reputation.On an overall scale, Ace in the Hole is one highly underrated gem in Billy Wilder's impressive filmography that truly deserves a much broader audience. It may not have the seamless blend of humour with tragic events unlike most films by Wilder, is pretty straight-forward with its content and is quite direct in its attack on the cruel side of free press & government corruption but it hits all the right buttons over the course of its runtime and offers an observation that's absolutely worth your time & money.

            "review_title": "a cynical and absorbing look at the relevance of a hard-boiled journalism and humanity",
            "content": "Ace in the Hole's main character, Chuck Tatum (a classic turn from Kirk Douglas), creates all his own problems for a glory that, as for any addict, is practically unattainable. This is because for all of his pontificating about the greatness of 'human interest' stories, if it'll suit him the story can go on for much longer than it needs to for the people in it. There's a very strong current throughout the picture about what the value of life is, not just for Tatum but for everyone involved, from the practical journalists on both sides (the honest Albaquerque press-man who hates what Tatum is doing in delaying it, to the other press people who hate that Tatum is trying to take all the credit), to the hordes of bystanders who turn the outside of the cave where trapped Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) is on his last breath into an amusement park, to even his own conflicted wife (Sterling), who isn'ty sure if she even loves him anymore. By the end, it becomes a desperate twist of fate for Tatum, and it ends up all boiling down to something that is very (and frighteningly) relevant for today.Billy Wilder makes this such an unflinching tale of greed and the now given \"media circus\", and he does an excellent job in not making Tatum much at all sympathetic. This is important because it allows Douglas the room to make his interpretation so full-bodied and red-blooded that he almost resembles the doomed lead in an Aesop fable. He's a 2nd-level writer who's been kicked out of one major newspaper after another, landing in a little blip on the map like Albaquerque, driving along with his young co-reporter to a Rattlesnake convention or other. Then he comes upon poor Minosa, stuck in a mine with little air and no supplies. He jumps on the chance to make it not only a big news story, but *his* news story. Douglas takes Tatum on for all he's worth, in a performance that marks him as something quite different from the character he would play in Paths of Glory- self-interested and with so much pride and confidence-edging-and-over-arrogance, and even makes him true to form as he goes back and forth on trying to do the right thing (bring the man a priest, why not), and to save his own hide. Probably one of Wilder's best chances to take was Douglas in the role- a role that is established in a perfect opening shot of Tatum in the driver side of his car, being towed right up to the newspaper office. But it's not the only bright spot for Wilder. He's got a strong sense of how to capture all of the scenes, particularly the claustrophobic mine scenes with Minosa- sometimes with the trapped man huffing away as the most honest character in the film- and the shots showing the expansiveness of the 'circus', with the small rest-stop loaded with people all into the hype and riding the ferris wheel. Wilder isn't necessarily doing a full-on film-noir like Double Indemnity or Sunset Boulevard (also very dark and bleak in view of humanity at large and small scopes), but it has that feeling in many scenes, of an atmosphere of mounting dread, corruptible law (the Sheriff, played by Ray Teal, is a personification of the truly despicable and dumbest officer) and without much of a happy ending. It's even been considered to be Wilder's bleakest and least commercial film, and it's not an unfair consideration. But it's also drama of the highest caliber, where a lesson that's made isn't crammed down the viewer's head but is surrounded by characters that could just as easily be around in today's media environment. It's almost prophetic in detailing the tediousness and lack of real human connectivity in such \"human interest\" stories, particularly those lacking a happy ending. One of the best, and most underrated of all, films of 1951.",

This movie never enjoyed much success, considering Sunset Boulevard was the more famous film at the time. Kirk Douglas plays Chuck Tatum, who has just been hired for a local newspaper in a small, dull town. He clashes with the editor and anxious for a good bit of news, somethin wild and shocking, discovers that a man has been traped under a big cave mine (Richard Benedict). He keeps him down there long enough to entice the media who make a carnival to donate money for his rescue. He has his story but it has cost him his humanity. His wife (Jan Sterling) desires Chuck but he refuses her advances. The people, from the sheriff to the people in the small New Mexico town, are corrupt. Much of the story is dark and tinged with sarcasm and satirical humor. This was a film which, in 1951, was a product of its time, the cynical post-World War II film noir film. The ending, in which Chuck discovers how his \"story\" cost a man's life and eventually casues him to have a stroke and die, is melodramatic and biting in its cynical theme. This is an enjoyable movie and has its own merits but it lacks the warmth and more inviting humor in Sunset Boulevard.",

It's no wonder it's only beginning to click to an audience in the last years, compared to other Wilder films that were popular in their day.Kirk Douglas is Chuck Tatum, a hardnosed, cynic, ruthless journalist down-and-out and looking to get back into business. Hoping for the big headline that will send him back to New York, he joins a small Albuquerque newspaper and bides his time. A year later, the headline falls down on him. A man digging for Indian artifacts trapped under tons of rock in a cave. But it's not quite a great story and Chuck Tatum takes it upon himself to make it one.Curiously for a filmmaker who directed 14 different actors in Oscar-nominated performances, he really missed the mark with Kirk Douglas. Douglas chews the scenery from start to finish with such seething furiousness, hammering down every line and hissing out every word with malicious, bitter irony, that sometimes it feels as there's no movie at all around him, as though he chewed it all away. Add to that an assortment of immoral characters Tatum infects in his own ruthless pursuit for 'the story' and you've got yourself a pretty tough deal to sit through.Wilder's direction is simple and mostly invisible which is an asset to a movie with a central performance screaming for the viewer's undivided attention. Sure, the symbolic qualities he imbues his visuals with are as overstated and unsubtle as the script's main ideas, delivered in that hardboiled film noir way and so on-the-nose you could jot down verbatim a couple of lines of dialogue and have the entire summation of the movie's themes, subtext be damned, but he knows when to get out of Douglas' way when he starts hamming it up. \"I don't make things happen, I just write about them\" is a great moment and so is the final shot, but as much as the movie lacks subtlety, it's still compelling and gripping in its own demented way.",

Coming as it did so soon after his masterpiece \"Sunset Boulevard\" where he managed to puncture egos in the movie industry, he outdid himself in cynicism and savage wit with this assault on the yellow press which almost tops its illustrious predecessor in quality but easily surpasses it in hard hitting cynicism.The story of a ruthlessly ambitious newspaper reporter who deliberately postpones the rescue of a trapped miner so as to revive his flagging career, the film undoubtedly exaggerates not only the greed of the reporter and of local traders but also ghoulishness of the public.However as with all good satire there was more than a grain of truth in points made and with a scriptwriter of Wilder's calibre it has many hard-hitting lines: the miner's calculating wife when admitting to Douglas not only that she's not the religious type but also that her appearance is what matters most to her: \"I don't go to church; kneeling bags my nylons\".Above all Wilder's trump card was undoubtedly the casting of Douglas. As Cary Grant was flawless in portraying the suave debonair gent, so Douglas was peerless in portraying the ambitious amoral heel, particularly in his late 40's to mid-50's classics and he gave arguably his best performance here. The matching of Wilder and Douglas was truly a Marriage made in Hell.One of my all time favourites.But don't watch it when you're feeling depressed.

            "content": "Billy Wilder's Ace in the Hole, a story about stories, and how spinning a tale will cloud the truth, is a stunning indictment of lousy ethics, unchecked ambition and the movie biz itself.Kirk Douglas is Chuck Tatum, a two-hundred-and-fifty-a-week newspaper man who you can have for fifty. He has fallen from his prestigious New York job and landed in the dingy, dustbowl of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Anxious to the point of obsessive, Tatum will go to any lengths to catch his next break. He's like a rat in a cage, as he paces around the claustrophobic cell of a small time newspaper shop that takes a chance on him, one that he can't wait to escape from. Ironically, the key to his freedom, is presented to him in the form of Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict), a treasure hunter who, is himself, literally trapped in a cave. Minosa is Tatum's \"ace in the hole.\"Tatum can sniff the story right from the jump. You see, it's all about \"human interest.\" Nobody cares about fifty or even two-hundred people trapped in a cave, but Tatum understands that one, unfortunate soul is a story; and a good one at that. Just how good of a story it turns out to be surprises even Tatum himself, and his tactics to keep it going become progressively more nefarious.Wilder's script is one of his best (which is saying a lot). He fills his morality tale with plenty of pertinent sub-plots, including a perverse love story, a corrupt sherif who uses the debacle as a way to rally votes, and a general public who will do anything to exploit this tragedy and turn it into a literal circus.On one hand, the film plays as an allegory for the art of filmmaking itself, as Tatum's ability to lie and control the narrative is not unlike the job of a writer/director. More compelling, however, is the way the script becomes a warning against fascism. This is evident in the way Tatum controls the press so that the narrative becomes one sided and lucrative for the side spewing it. The masses that flock to the site are, at best, amused bystander's who allow for the chaos to continue, and at worst, opportunists who set themselves up as venders in attempt to turn a profit.Douglas is characteristically superb with his dimpled chin stamped into the center of his dynamic jaw; a jaw that snarls out Wilder's impeccable lines like the rattle of a snakes tale. The descent into the depths of his poisoned soul is likened to the darkness and decay of the cave that entombs Minosa. The conclusion to this descent is something which prints itself into the front pages of your mind's eye and stays there.",

            "content": "Billy Wilder's \"Ace in the Hole\" is a gorgeously photographed film that at first seems hopelessly cynical, at times veers into dangerously sentimental areas, and emerges finally as a vindication of real human nature tempered with the idea that for some of us moral awareness might come too late in life to make a difference. Kirk Douglas gives one of the best performances of his career; I've always found him most convincing when he's playing a bit of a \"heel.\" In this one he's a rogue newspaperman, putting his last chips on the table as he works for a small paper in Albuqurque looking for his last shot at the big time. He manages to manufacture a national hysteria over the fate of a trapped cave explorer (Richard Benedict) and controls coverage of the event through his relationship to the family of the man and his solicitation of the local police. The explorer, Leo Minosa, has a wife (Jan Sterling) who's ready to leave him but who stays around for the media circus because she's selling so many hamburgers. All the time poor Leo thinks that Tatum (Douglas) is his friend and that his wife is anxiously waiting for his return.The most difficult move this film has to make is to convince us that Tatum does eventually become remorseful. It has to show him as an utterly ruthless and cynical person (the dialog is great when he explains why one trapped person is a better story than 50 trapped people, for example) and at the same time make us believe in some kind of moral transformation. I thought the film accomplished to a great degree, largely because of our own sympathy for Leo. It's about how Tatum begins to have contempt for himself. Wilder's scathing camera does not spare the American public either -- they're just as much in for the ride, literally eating cotton candy and riding Ferris Wheels while ostensibly worrying over Leo. When the wife of the first arriver sheds tears for Leo at the end, it's a good example of the double edged nature of Wilder's storytelling because we're actually surprised by her grief, and yet it's perfectly believable and not \"corny\" at all.Just as in \"Sunset Boulevard\" Wilder managed to criticize Hollywood at the same time as composing a love letter to it, in this film there's a deconstruction of journalism and at the same time the character of publisher Jacob Boot (Porter Hall) retains a kind of purity much as Cecil DeMille does in \"Boulevard.\" The idea is still there, there is a valid purpose to journalism which the Douglas character in his self-serving nature has lost sight of or never previously had a consciousness of. In this way Wilder takes types (the honest publisher, the wholesome director) and attempts to make what would at first appear naive to be actually the most sophisticated viewpoint in the film.",

            "content": "In a powerful early performance by Kirk Douglas, playing one of the first truly unapologetically characterized anti-heroes of the movies, an aggressively determined, egotistical, quick-witted reporter unhumbled by the shameful slump he is in, having worked his way west from the fast big-city life to the middle of nowhere, along the way being fired from countless newspapers for countless immoral charges, has been writing for an insignificant small-town paper.Bored by his laughable assignment to cover a snake hunt, he learns about a local everyman trapped in a cave collapse. Perfectly aware of a one-shot break, Douglas calculatedly stage- manages the rescue effort, influencing the corruptible sheriff to insist that the engineer use a much more time-consuming method for a eloquent and insincere reason, of course really so that Douglas can draw out the story on the front pages of nationwide.Jan Sterling coldly plays the victim's cheap wife. Wilder, always a wise and sensitive director and once a journalist himself, surprises us with how unfeeling the focal townspeople are behind the scenes and nonetheless steered by the very journalist inspiring the country with an oh-so-heroic story. Wilder's expose very cynically perceives people involved in a media circus are propelled by the almighty dollar. However, he is not too scornful but in fact poignant. His unsympathetic, utterly contemptible portrait of Kirk Douglas's rogue unravels not as someone with a far-fetched lack of any feeling at all but as someone caught up in his own prestige and grandeur, the sort of control felt by a master con man, that when real disaster hits, his delusions dissolve in a harrowing manner. Douglas and Sterling's affair opens out Double Indemnity's bitter two-step.There Will Be Blood is merely one of the works that get a lot out of this farsighted blister. There are also shades that can be found in the explosive Man Bites Dog. The monster ultimately plunges before the camera in a shot saluted sidelong in Fassbinder's Fox and His Friends. Wilder's powerful film swelters under the scorching, overwhelming contempt of the barren region sun, belligerently emphasizing the sweat, soot and dust saturating the characters and generating a visualization of the sterile shape of their hearts.",

            "content": "Meet Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas). With a low growl and a sizeable assortment of personal affectations, he turns the tow truck driver into his personal chauffeur, he lights a match on the sliding typewriter, mocks everyone he charms and vice versa. With pride and self-contempt, he manages to sell himself to a newspaper by convincing the editor-in-chief that he is indispensable--even though he's been fired from eleven papers for good reasons. \"I can handle big news and little news,\" he declares, \"and if there's no news I'll go out and bite dog.\" He is machismo and self-hatred, and he will do anything for a buck. In other words, he is a typical Wilder anti-hero. A year later, Tatum has taken up his boss's habit of wearing belt and suspenders. To stave off boredom, he pesters his affectionate co-workers. His promised big break comes a year later: when covering the story of a rattlesnake hunt he hears of a treasure-seeker, Leo Minosa, trapped in a coal mine. Enter Mrs. Minosa (Jan Sterling). The sneering bottle blonde would be as iconic as Norma Desmond and Phyllis Dietrichson had ACE IN THE HOLE been popular at the time of its release. Like Cora in THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE, she is trapped in a marriage with a man she doesn't love in a remote diner that doesn't generate any cash. Along comes the attractive but amoral man who offers both cash and sex. Most importantly cash. Cash is the name of the game for all characters in ACE IN THE HOLE. Leo gets trapped in pursuit of ancient Indian artifacts to sell, the implication being that the pursuit of wealth is imprisoning and that nothing is sacred. When Tatum successfully feeds off the sympathies of the masses, the S&M Entertainment Company trucks roll in to erect a lucrative circus. Folk singers, carnies, and thousands of people more interested on appearing on television than worrying about Leo amass. Everyone profits but the victim. When Leo's wife, after having drained the cash register of its last $11, retorts that \"Honey, you like those rocks just as much as I do,\" she is not speaking just to Tatum but to the masses.****MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW****Never has a film noir more explicitly dealt with the theme of entrapment. Leo Minosa becomes a physical manifestation of the claustrophobia surrounding all the characters: Tatum's desperation to make a big story, Mrs. Minosa's desperation to transcend her dull existence, even the sheriff's desperation to be re-elected. In the mine shaft, dust streams down ceaselessly to pool on his face and body. Leo is being slowly buried alive while the drill makes a ceaseless, solemn pound. As it gets closer and closer it feels like the drums of death approaching, tormenting Leo. Grit gathers like fur on Leo's face, and the lighting becomes even more striking, casting ghastly shadows over his face. Here comes what might be Kirk Douglas' finest acting moment: The priest administers last rites for Leo and the camera cuts to Tatum's face during the words \"bless me father for I have sinned. *I'm sorry*.\" Everything is there: profound guilt, shame, grief, a self-loathing that goes deeper than that ever-pounding drill. The consequences of his pathological ambition have finally crept up with him, and he too is being buried alive. The motif of suffocation comes full circle when Tatum wraps Mrs. Minosa's anniversary present--a fur that resembles a \"skinned couple-a hungry rats\"--around her neck and keeps pulling tighter. \"I can't breath!\" she gasps. He snarls back, \"He can't breathe either.\" This film is dismissed as cynical by people who don't want to acknowledge how close to reality it is. Acerbic? Absolutely. Sleazy? You bet. But there has never been a film--much less an old film--that so perfectly captured the bloodlust for the sensationalized human interest story. To write it off as cynical is to ignore the existence of yellow journalists who litter flashbulbs on their subjects, who ask them to confide their deepest anxieties before splashing them on the front page news, who alter and rewrite reality to make a better story. There have been other films such as NETWORK and A FACE IN THE CROWD that are praised for being crystal balls into the future of American media, but neither of which were nearly as condemning. There are traces of irony in ACE IN THE HOLE that can only be attributed to the fact that a story so excessive and absurd was actually based on *fact.* 57 years from its release and it hasn't aged a day. The only thing that separates the film from the world of today are the radio and newspaper journalists in lieu of television. There is a basic meanness, a violence, a grit that makes today's edgiest dramas look like white-washed fluff. Even Mrs. Minosa's wardrobe (a factor that ages the timeliest films) looks perfectly modern with its men's plaid shirts and rolled-up jeans. Billy Wilder has made half a dozen great films that could each be argued to be his masterpiece, but it is my opinion that ACE IN THE HOLE has and always will be Wilder's finest.",

            "review_title": "Hey Fans! Billy Wilder Dares to \"Tell the Truth\"!",
            "content": "This is a great, mind boggling, unforgettable film. It passes the test of time because it is, unfortunately, more truthful and relevant now than it was in 1951. Billy Wilder makes many caustic and sardonic comments on how people dwell on and exploit human tragedy. But on top of the content, we have a film that is well crafted in all ways-- well written, acted, directed, photographed and scored.I first saw it on TV in the 70s, and then it disappeared (small wonder since it totally skewers the media). I'm sure it was (and still is) a required part of college journalism, media and sociology classes --- as a friend of mine in college at that time said he had seen it in a class at San Francisco State College. It is a textbook on how the media manipulates (now we say 'spins') and exploits human tragedy for profit. How cynical it is, and what a sad commentary on the culture we have surrounding us today! Of course, 'Wag the Dog' (1997) is great, but it is pretty much after the fact. 'Ace in the Hole', on the other hand, is too horrifyingly prescient.Charlie Tatum (Kirk Douglas), a former New York newspaper reporter now trapped in his own hole, a dead-end job at a New Mexico newspaper, sees his way out by covering the story of a man trapped inside a mine. He sees this as his way back to the big time, to a Pulitzer Prize, and also as revenge on other journalists. When Tatum's first story appears, crowds begin arriving at the mine site to watch the unfolding rescue. Although the man, Leo Minosa, can be rescued in about a day, Tatutm 'convinces' (forces) the local sheriff (Roy Teal in his nastiest role) and the mining engineer to prolong the rescue by using a drilling process that will take about a week, thus ensuring that Tatum can continue to exploit the situation much longer.This film is a dark allegory and amazingly a daylight film noir.Drawn into Tatum's web of exploitation and greed are the miner's wife, Lorraine (Jan Sterling in her best performance), who when she realizes what is happening tries to profit as much as she can from it herself; Sheriff Kretzer, who sees it as a guarantee for re-election; and the innocent young newspaper photographer, Herbie, who becomes swept up in Tatum's visions of success and money. But this is not all: businesses arrive en masse (food and goods vendors, special railroad trains, musicians and carnival road shows) to 'serve' the curious. Lorraine's trading post and gas station become jammed with eager tourists seeking to follow the unfolding rescue. It all becomes, literally, a feeding frenzy and a media circus.When Tatum enters the newspaper office, he notices the embroidered sign on the wall: \"Tell the Truth.\" Although Wilder is hinting at how Tatum will embroider the truth to suit his own selfish purposes, Billy himself is telling us the truth about the media-- and us!-- in this movie: 1) \"Bad news sells best,\" says Tatum; 2) \"Good news is not news,\" he says, and then, 3) \"Human interest\" is not about how hundreds are being hurt or killed but it is about one person with a name. 4) And then, most damningly of all, Wilder shows us that we, the public, will eat up as much as we can of the 'news' of human tragedy! 5) So, therefore, what ultimately follows, as he shows us, in extremis, is a 'media circus' designed to feed not only our curiosity, but also our presence (ego). Remember that William Holden, when he was making 'Sunset Boulevard,' (1950) said that \"Billy Wilder has a mind full of razor blades.\"No wonder this film was a bomb (but not in Europe!) in the USA of 1951. Without his prior screen writers, Billy Wilder was now free to work without inhibition. The result was what we now call an 'independent' film, an 'autuer' film, a complete product of Billy Wilder.How great is Kirk Douglas! Give him a retro Oscar! Billy guides him perfectly in every shot and action. When Lorraine realizes what Tatum is up to, in a great shot outside the door, she smiles and bites into an apple-- Eve has fallen, and catastrophe will follow. So many other great composed shots! The amazing 'drive in' overhead shots of the cars and the desert. So many great tiny bits of business (from slamming the typewriter to the rattlesnake in the box) that Billy added! The score, a thump, thump, pounding nothing, perfectly fits the environment and the theme.Thankfully, the Criterion Collection has now (2007) released the movie on DVD! Spike Lee in his afterword on it goes totally euphoric in his admiration for the film, even revealing how he stole the final shot to use in his 'Malcom X' (1992).An amazing, fantastic film to watch even if it is so horrible in its devastating expression of the extreme 'Tatum' world of media that we are exposed to now every day! I give it a 10.",

            "content": "Billy Wilder leaves no one standing as he eviscerates early 50's America with the blisteringly cynical Ace in the Hole, a story about a man trapped in a New Mexico cave and the reaction of the public at large in response to it.The film opens with down on his luck New York reporter Chuck Tatum being towed in to Albuquerque behind the wheel of his car. He arrogantly pushes his way into the local newspaper and offers the services of a big city reporter at a cut rate price. His blustery confidence belies begging and the editor takes him on. A year later things are working out for Tatum but he is bored stiff since he still itches to get back to Gotham, Yogi Berra and hot pastrami. Dispatched to cover a rattlesnake contest, he and his photographer stumble upon a mine cave in trapping one Leo Minosa. Tatum goes into high gear and in no time has the law, the media and the rescuers doing his bidding. In the meantime folks from across the country are flocking by car and train to the sight. Leo's wife Lorraine who was on the verge of leaving begins to cash in as well. Free entrance to the cave sight goes up to a dollar, a carnival sets up on the grounds, a song about his rescue is recorded and the sheet music is selling like hotcakes for two bits. Tatum has everything under control except the rescue itself. To keep the story going he the sheriff and the contractor stall.Few characters in film history have been as exploited as the trapped Leo Minosa. His suffering if all goes well will make his wife wealthy, get the Sheriff re-elected and get the revenge minded Tatum his job back in New York. Minosa isn't the only one trapped in this film. Tatum and Lorraine are looking to be rescued as well and they have little qualm with crawling over Leo to save themselves.Writer, director Wilder's indictment of society en masse offers no let up as he pours cynicism like syrup over the entire proceedings. The literal carnival atmosphere at the cave in has a surreal effect with cars lining up as if at a drive in while a train in the distance (the Leo Minosa Special) unloads passengers by the hundreds, rushing to take part in the voyeuristic orgy. His script burns with character callousness and his visuals, particularly the aerials, are unlike any other he has ever done.As Tatum, Kirk Douglas has never been better or more convincing, throwing his weight around and spitting venom as he capitalizes on the tragedy. Tatum knows he is a bastard but it is this self awareness that allows him to manipulate those around him who are just as bad. He accepts and recognizes the ugly truths about greed and self interest inherent in human nature and this allows him to stage direct this \"reality TV show\". Tatum truly understands his audience. Jan Sterling as Lorraine is just as dark and gives Tatum a run for his money in the cold and callous department. Sterling displays an icy tawdriness and delivers some of the film's best lines (\"I don't go to church, kneeling bags my nylons\").Ace failed at the box office in a huge way when it was first released. People and the media did not take kindly to being insulted with the truth. They preferred the DeMille Greatest Show on Earth circus atmosphere to this kind of carnival with its mean spirited clowns. There were claims that it was un-American (not a good period to be so) but I believe Wilder's allegorical intent was an indictment of all human nature, not just this country.Time and the reality that cable TV news today relentlessly pursue similar stories in the same fashion, garnering the attention of the same morbidly interested audience not only exonerates Ace in the Hole but elevates it to the same pedestal Wilder's two other masterpieces Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard are on. Ace in the Hole is as fresh as today's headlines.",

At the beginning of the film journalist Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas) says in a job interview \" If there's no news, I'll go out and bite a dog.\". In other words, if there's no news, I make it myself.The big difference with J. J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster) from \"Sweet smell od success\" is that Hunsucker writes about celebrities. He needs them for stories and they need him for publicity, so in effect the celebrities are a kind of \"indirect object\". Tatum on the other hand is writing about a rescue operation and is dragging on this operation longer than necessary to sustain the story. In so doing he risks the life of the victim. This victim is therefor a \"direct object\".In \"Sweet smell of success\" the audience of the stories stayed out of the picture. In \"Ace in the hole\" they are an important part of the film. With the European release the film was even re-named \"The big carnival\". Without demand there will be no supply, so the implicit message of the movie is that the sensationalism of the public is indirectly responsible for the suffering of the victim.\"Ace in the hole\" was the film Billy Wilder made after the hugely successful \"Sunse boulevard\" (1950). \"Ace in the hole\" didn't match this success. I don't think this was due to a lesser quality of the film. Maybe (potential) spectators had the idea that the thrill-seeking audience from the film was holding up a mirror to them.",

The story line is simple enough: a tough guy alcoholic reporter stuck in Albuquerque delays a trapped miners rescue all to make big headlines. The story went over the deep end for me when he summarily dismissed the authority of the sheriff directing the rescue and took over the effort seemingly based solely on his loud mouth. In fact, throughout the film all characters are unaccountably putty in his hands. It seems society is just waiting for some arrogant tough with a kielbasa sausage in his zoot suit pants to assume command. The trapped man is pathetic and incidentally unaware his wife is a floozy, getting it on of course with you-know-who. Nothing original there.Continually driving home the infantile message about the crassness of society is a brass band loudly grinding out the trite Leo Minosa rescue song every time the camera goes outside the cave. With autos full of sightseers streaming in continually, there is now also a Ferris Wheel and merry-go-round, along with innumerable concessions. You might even go so far as to say that it has become a 'media circus'. Despite the comic book level of subtlety in hammering home this 'message', certain aspects of the film are okay. The role of Minosa's wife is played pretty well. She looks particularly convincing just the way she wears the late 40's clothing.The newsroom set and the New Mexico location provide interest, but what a waste.It would be easy to say my criticism of this flick is really a general criticism of the sophistication of films of that time, but I could cite too many films which would be above that criticism and I doubt many are below this one.

With age, Mr. Wilder has mellowed and he may have made this remark because he knew how merciless this 1951 film is. In any event, this overlooked gem is just about perfect. It is still powerful, (very powerful) and the acting is superb. So is the dialogue, so is the premise. Based on the Floyd Collins case in 1920s Kentucky, Wilder re-shoots that real event in New Mexico, with reporter Douglas milking a tragedy for everything it's worth. That the film flopped surprises me not at all; it was and still is an atypical Hollywood film. No \"sympathetic\" characters, no one to \"care about.\" That, I believe, was and is the point. Remember that Wilder was a reporter in 1920s Berlin, so he knew the print medium inside out, and when Kirk Douglas spews the barb \"Bad news sells best. Because good news is no news,\" it is as accurate now as it was half a century ago. Every character in this film is corrupt to some degree, which almost makes this a noir shot in desert light. Don't see this one on a date, don't see it if you're depressed, but do see it if you'd care to witness the best excoriation of journalism's mean side that ever has been filmed. A ten!",

Billy Wilder's classic film is the perfect story to give and example of the American media's insanity. Kirk Douglas gives an incredible performance as Chuck Tatum, a former big-wig newspaper man who has been reduced to working for the Albuquerque paper after being fired in New York, Chicago, Washington, and other places for his immoral behavior. Here, he hopes to catch a story that will springboard him back to stardom. After a year, he finds it when a man searching for Indian pottery in an ancient cave is trapped and half-buried alive. Thus begins the circus. After a few phone calls and a couple of days, there are hundreds of cars, animals, and of course people at the site to watch the \"heroic\" rescue of this man. However, thanks to Tatum, the rescuing that could take twelve hours ends up being six days. Overall, this is a remarkable film with great acting, solid directing, and like all Wilder films, a marvelous script balanced with touches of humor, sadness, drama, and dark outlooks on life. What makes this a classic is how well it holds up today. Wilder isn't exaggerating too much here; the media is like this. See for yourself, then turn on the TV and watch Entertainment Tonight. It's shows like that that make this film prophetic.",

            "content": "An exiled big city reporter exploits a New Mexico tunnel cave-in for selfish purposes, turning it into a human tragedy.Of Billy Wilder's classic works, I expect this one is the least known, and for understandable reasons. First and foremost, it's about as cynical as any film of the decade, with little relief from the parade of human vices that surround one man's desperate plight. Then too, the year 1951 was not a year the American public was inclined toward introspection. What with the war in Korea and the hyper-patriotism surrounding the McCarthy hearings, people were not inclined to entertain what might be wrong with the leader of the free world. No wonder the film was greeted with a dull thud, eventually sinking into Late Show obscurity.Nonetheless, the film was definitely ahead of its time, with an appreciative following that has gathered over the years. What the movie does so effectively is to show how one man's (Tatum) unscrupulous use of the media can work to exploit the weaknesses of others. Exiled reporter Tatum (Douglas) hopes to get back to big time journalism by capitalizing on the plight of an unfortunate man (Benedict) trapped in the dusty ruins of New Mexico. But to do that, Tatum has got to get the cooperation of others so that the story can be delayed long enough to reach the desired national audience. And that means putting the story potential ahead of the trapped man's rescue. Thus, the desperate Minosa's life is put at risk for the sake of a big human interest story and one reporter's blind ambition.Now none of Tatum's various successes would be nearly so convincing without Kirk Douglas' absolutely bravura performance. His Tatum is so aggressively cock-sure, that his scheming is made to seem the natural order of things. And this scheming is based on what appears a glib understanding of human weakness. Thus, Tatum enlists Minosa's blowzy wife (Sterling) with prospects of a bulging cash register; the hick sheriff (Teal) with prospects of a bigger political career; the wobbly engineer with prospects of a permanent job; and the curious multitude with prospects of an entertaining spectacle. In short, Tatum has taken a human tragedy in a remote tourist stop and single-handedly turned it into a money-making enterprise.The whole production is given eye-catching cachet by on site filming in Gallup, New Mexico, where the squat mesas and dusty plains look nothing like standard Hollywood. And catch those crowds that stretch for at least a mile outside the digging site. Everyone from the surrounding area must have turned out for the filming. And I like the way Wilder builds the spectacle slowly, without fanfare, such that we only gradually become aware of how Minosa's plight is being submerged within the carnival-like merry-making. Thus, what starts out as one man's selfish drive has come to infect an entire region. No wonder the movie tanked in that Cold War year of 1951.Of course, no review would be complete without mentioning Jan Sterling's wonderfully tacky turn as Minosa's mercenary wife. The scenes between her and Tatum are like two circling sharks sizing up one another. Comedy or drama, Sterling remains a movie treasure from that long ago era.I do, however, have a major reservation with the movie as a whole. And that's with the ending. I detect the dead hand of Hollywood's Production Code behind Tatum's sudden redemptive turnaround and anguished period of suffering. Wilder handles the development about as well as possible given what's gone before. Nevertheless, the compromised ending remains. Of course, by Hollywood rules, Tatum's collusion in what turns out to be a form of murder cannot go unpunished. So, instead of a follow through on the story's basic theme, we get the last minute redemption that strikes me as not very plausible given what we've seen of Tatum's previous behavior. Seems to me, the headstrong Tatum would have found a way to rationalize Minosa's fate and then moved on. I think a more plausibly positive outcome would have the kid (Arthur) reject his mentor following Minosa's death, because he now sees where Tatum's brand of unscrupulous journalism leads.Be that as it may, the movie remains a gutsy look at how one man's corruption can spread like a virus. And given the power of today's greatly expanded media, it's a lesson worth noting.",

            "content": "\"Don't worry, Leo. I'm your pal.\" That's Chuck Tatum speaking. He's a hot-shot big city reporter who has been fired from every top paper he's ever worked for. Now he's hit bottom. He works for the Albuquerque Sun=Bulletin, a small town daily which puts yard sales on its front page. Tatum needs the job, but he's determined to find that one big ticket story that'll put him back in New York. The man he's talking to is going to be that big ticket. His name is Leo Mimosa, owner of the desolate, dusty Mimosa's Indian Curios (\"Gas and Oil, Drinks on Ice\") in Escudero, in New Mexico's high desert. Leo is currently 300 feet underground, trapped in a cave-in while looking for ancient Indian pots he can sell for a few hundred dollars. In the next 111 minutes, covering five or so days, we're going to experience so much corruption of the soul, misplaced trust and consuming ambition...leavened by so little humanity...that we'll want to take a bath afterwards. This is one of director Billy Wilder's greatest pictures. For me, it's permeated not by Wilder's famously sardonic outlook toward humanity but by the inevitability of commonplace tragedy. That there are only one or two people we might think well of isn't so much a limitation as an element that sharpens the fascination with great story-telling combined with vivid acting. While Tatum controls his big story, and while Leo becomes increasingly desperate, to the point of believing Tatum is his only friend, we encounter a cast of characters who are either stupid and venal or sly and venal. Top of the list is Tatum, himself. Kirk Douglas gives an utterly believable portrait of a man, excellent at his job, who can taste the big-time again and is determined to do whatever it takes to achieve it. \"I'm on my way back to the top,\" he says, \"and if it takes a deal with a crooked sheriff, that's alright with me! And if I have to fancy it up with an Indian curse and a broken hearted wife for Leo, then that's alright too!\" Close behind is Jan Sterling as Leo Mimosa's wife. Lorraine Mimosa wants out...out of Escudero, out of New Mexico and out of her marriage with Leo. She's a pouty bleached blonde, callous and discontented. Gus Kretzer, the local sheriff, is corrupt and more than willing to work with Tatum to insure he gets the kind of news coverage he needs for his re- election. And there are all those visitors to the cave where Leo is trapped...gawkers, thrill seekers, whole families out to set up camp and see what happens. Food booths and a carnival keep them contented while a drill pounds away at the rock to reach Leo. It's the slow way which Tatum has maneuvered to insure his exclusive coverage of Leo's predicament can play out over the next few days. Leo literally is Tatum's ace in the hole. The conclusion is as depressing as Wilder's depiction of human character. The movie's whole set-up, in fact, is designed to make us feel uncomfortable at what we're seeing. If we've ever slowed down to get a better view of a traffic accident, if we've ever watched with fascinated revulsion as a snake swallows down a live mouse or a mantis gnaws at a struggling lizard, we have to recognize that in spirit we're also part of the crowd eager to see what happens. What makes the movie stand apart from so much of Wilder's skilled cynicism in some of his other films, I think, are two elements. First, Wilder plays this story straight. There's no sardonic comedy or witty, misogynistic lines. He serves us up a serious, well-acted drama and then compels us to take it seriously while he makes us squirm a little. Second, he includes two characters that give us some relief from Tatum's ambition and our own unease. First is Herbie Cook, played by Robert Arthur, the young photographer from the newspaper. Herbie is a graduate of a journalism school, a little naive and so innocent-looking you want to protect him from Tatum's manipulations. Second, and most important, is Jacob Boot, played by that fine character actor, Porter Hall. Boot is in some ways our conscience, the serious, realistic publisher and owner of the Sun=Bulletin who has the quaint idea that telling the truth is important. Boot is able, although not by much, to show us that people come in all flavors, and that venality is only one of them, no more or less than trying to do the right thing also is. In Ace in the Hole, however, nothing good happens in time. As Tatum said earlier, \"It's a good story today. Tomorrow, they'll wrap a fish in it.\" Same with people.",

Then he stumbles across the plight of a man trapped in a cave, and he turns it into something big, and ongoing...Great drama on the manipulative power of the media. Chuck Tatum personifies all that is wrong with the media - the lies, the over- dramatization, the influencing of the story when they should just be observers, the lack of ethics. Also shows how easily lead and herded the average person is, and how people are happy to treat life-threatening danger to others as something for their amusement.Wonderfully written and directed by Billy Wilder, with some great detail that lesser directors would not have thought of (the escalating prices of admission to the park always made me laugh!). While Tatum's actions are reprehensible, his Machiavellian manipulations are so brilliant that you admire him, in a way, and this is due to Wilder's script and direction.Great performance by Kirk Douglas in the lead role. He imbues Tatum with a bravura and conniving charm that is difficult to resist. Not a perfect movie though. Was headed for it at one stage but loses focus a touch towards the end. A few things feel contrived and the final scene is quite tame. If Wilder hadn't changed tack with Tatum's character it would have made for an incredibly powerful conclusion.",

Robert Penn Warren wrote The Cave based on a fictionalized Floyd Collins. Ace in The Hole captures current day news frenzies. Even though this takes place in 1951 it is the OJ Simpson circus. Wilder was a reporter in Nazi Europe so he knew first hand that people love bad news. Bad news sells.

The town sheriff Ray Teal backs Tatum, because he wants his help being reelected. By the time the drill is 10 feet from Minosa the crowd is huge with a ferris wheel and other fair amusements.

It's satire that cuts so close to the bone, it's scary. One could call it prescient because it resembles recent news items, but those recent news items resembled less recent news items which resembled even less recent new items, as the media repeats itself. 'Ace in the Hole' will always be timely, because it will always apply. The media is now as it was then and things aren't changing any day soon.

I can understand why it failed as it holds a mirror up to its audience and exposes it to universal character flaws like morbid curiosity, profiteering, dubious morality as well as those old bedfellows, selfishness and greed. All these traits are fanned to a red-hot flame by unscrupulously ambitious former big-city-reporter turned small-town hack Kirk Douglas, looking for his meal-ticket back to the big time. When he lucks into a real-life human interest story about a hobbying excavator who falls down a mine shaft he quickly comes to exploit the situation by dragging out the rescue time, with the connivance of the corrupt local sheriff just coming up for re-election and his contractor digger, to benefit themselves at the expense at the poor victim just waiting to be rescued,The way Wilder builds up the mood is masterful, both at an individual and mass-crowd level. An example of the former is the depiction of fhe victim's jaded, past-caring wife, just on the verge of quitting the one-horse-town she's signed up to when she changes her mind in the hope of basking in the profits of her general store when the crowds roll in to see the potential disaster scene. Then there's also the turning of the idealistic young photographer out on assignment with Douglas who likewise changes his nature with the grave new world that his misplaced hero opens up for him. Wilder's management of the crowd scenes as hordes of the morbidly curious flock to the scene is superb but is exceeded when they leave town at the end, their \"fun\" over. The only contrary voice against the mass clamour of the rubbernecking crowd and the vulture-like national reporters is that of the wise old local newspaper editor whose dictum is \"Tell the truth\" and who attempts to turn Douglas back to the straight and narrow but knows he never will.The drive of the story-line and earthy verve of the dialogue are wonderful to see and hear in the hands of the maestro director plus he gets a fantastic lead performance by Douglas. He dominates the movie, is in the first and last scenes and most of those in between too. He's dynamite, stretching his lucky break right up until it breaks, breaking himself in the process.I can't speak highly enough of Wilder's direction either. Superbly shot, where you feel the heat of the desert, claustrophobia of the trapped man and clamour of the gathering crowd to name just three examples plus the final shot is as good and dramatic as an you'll ever see on the big screen.I've been very spare with my 10 out of 10 ratings but here's one that's more than justified.

The story, cracking dialogue and direction are almost as good as Double Indemnity and certainly better than Sunset Boulevard. The version I saw is titled The Big Carnival and thats a pretty apt title.The story is pretty well known and I'm sure remade several times - Kirk plays Charles Tatum a scruple-less down-on-his-luck journalist who has to settle for a small-town newspaper job because none of the big newspapers wants to work with him on account of his loose morals and drinking habits. One year into his new job, he finds an opportunity to create a front-page story and manage the ensuing carnival for his self-promotion. His angle is ensuring exclusive coverage and prolonging the ordeal for poor Leo Minosa for as many days as he can. He certainly succeeds in turning the event into a carnival.The first twenty minutes of the movie, I felt Kirk was acting a little over the top. But, as the momentum starting building up, I realised that was part of his personality. Witness the scene early on when one year has gone by and he is ranting and raving about it. The way his arms keep swinging like he's trying to throw off some shackles. Thats not over-acting. The script called for it.The dialogue is excellent. The hard-boiled comment is famous but not the best. There are plenty of other memorable quotes.While the premise is over-the-top, it is handled intelligently and the build-up is not rushed.

            "content": "At times, we need lethargic and nonchalance to cope with life, Billy Wilder delivers that with this masterpiece.Throwing caution to the wind and making a movie devoid of embellishments of humor, romance, music but just with drama is an intrepid attempt. This I believe was the reason for the initial failure of this movie called Ace In The Hole. It was deprived of many formulaic things that are a part of any movie, be it Wilder's too. Yet, this one had only a line that was made into characters, they form scenes and these scenes of enormity give us a grand picture. This is about a man trapped in a hole, whose story is being manifested by a selfish, ambitious journalist Chuck Tatum played flawlessly by Kirk Douglas. This tiny story, surpasses many things and makes the little known place into a tourist spot. A fair is setup, sales are picked up at the store. And what more, the wife of that poor struck guy is enticing the macho journalist who has the knack of convincing people by his charm. I loved Kirk Douglas in \"Bad and the Beautiful\" and \"Paths of Glory\" my love for him grew with this film and the way he played Chuck Tatum, the enigmatic journalist who has a humane side, Alas! it came a bit too late in the film. Well, the variation of emotion or modulation of voice, he seems to be doing many things on screen all at once and that too without any effort. More than anything, he made Chuck to be a next door journalist and indeed an affable one. Yet, he is rigid on terms and work with his own mindset and his own ambition. Coming to other actors, they have ably supported Kirk in his endeavor to rescue that poor guy who was struck in the hole. All have done their job exceedingly well, be it the silent mother who prays or this big media tycoons who are willing to pay any money to Chuck to buy the story. As a story, it's utterly cynical of how media sensationalizes any petty issue and makes it headlines to attract readers. It's not news anymore, it's business. That's how we are governed now by media. I am more than happy to have seen such a satire, the other media satire I fondly remember is \"Peepli Live\". The technical departments, for this movie have done their job well, and Billy at the helm has handled direction superbly. With each film, my love for Billy Wilder grows, and he is one of my favorite directors. With simple story lines, he made huge masterpieces that are etched in the memory forever. I loved this film, this is what you call master storytelling and Billy precisely did that, it's 4/5 and I thank myself for making time to watch this cinema.",

            "content": "It's interesting how many reviewers are prepared to shower this seriously sub-standard Billy Wilder melodrama with 9 and 10 ratings. I guess Wilder got one thing right: people are REALLY cynical about the media. As a former journalist, I'm probably more cynical than anyone. I've seen deeply unethical reporters at work. I've seen newspapers manipulate stories and milk tragedies. And I've encountered all the ghouls and gawpers. So, yes, there's a ring of truth to the tale Wilder spins. That said, Ace in the Hole is wildly unconvincing from start to finish. As many have noted, Kirk Douglas gives a scenery chewing performance that is entirely lacking in nuance and subtlety. But that's hardly surprising, given the script he has to work with. There's nothing subtle about Chuck Tatum, which leaves you constantly wondering why absolutely everyone falls for his manipulations and duplicity. Indeed, at the very start of the film his pitch to the local newspaper editor is so odious that you really can't imagine anyone with half a brain giving him a job. He subsequently manages to orchestrate almost every aspect of a cave rescue operation. Nobody else gets a look-in - not the local sherif, not the engineers who bring actual expertise to the operation, nobody. And as other reporters flock to the story, none of them manages to find a different narrative or challenge any aspect of the operation Tatum has engineered. They all fall into line, rather than find their own angle, which is what any reporter (even the most cynical) would do. I'm all for a scathing, scabrous satire, but the cynicism Wilder attempts to pass off here is just fanciful and preposterous. He just doesn't make it fly. And as the deeds become more and more dastardly and the film goes from dark to pitch black, I really don't see how any thinking viewer can continue to suspend disbelief. Yet clearly many have. But while those reviewers may be prepared to proclaim Ace in the Hole \"an overlooked masterpiece\", I'm a bit more inclined to agree with Wilder's own assessment of the film's place in his filmography. He called it \"the runt of the litter\".",

That's not to say that I don't see him as a talented director. It's just that he focuses on the negative.This film is no exception. But I have to give him credit...it's a memorable film. And by that I mean that the first time I saw it was on one of the network movie nights, certainly back in the 1960s...and I never forgot it.You're not supposed to like Kirk Douglas here (for all the reasons mentioned above)...and you don't. In fact, you don't from the first 3 minutes he's in the film. When he walks in the newspaper office and says \"How\" to the American Indian working there, you know Douglas' characters is something very close to the title of the film. But not liking the character is not the same as not liking the actor, and this is a superb performance by Douglas. I would say that it would rival whatever his best performance is.The other actor here that you're not supposed to like is Jan Sterling. And you won't. I've never been impressed with her as an actress (although perhaps I need to relook at \"The High And The Mighty\"), but she is perfect in this role.Robert Arthur as the young photographer is very good...plays it all somewhat innocently. He had the face for it, and it worked well for him here. Porter Hall as the Albuquerque newspaper editor was down-home honest and good...good performance. Nice to see Frank Cady in something other than \"Petticoat Junction\". Richard Benedict is good as the victim of the cave-in. And, Ray Teal -- always a favorite of mine -- does well here as the crooked sheriff.The plot is gripping. You're never quite sure how it's going to end, although you will probably have a hunch the victim dies. But there are twists and turns that maintain the excitement throughout the film. As much as I dislike the premise of the film, it's a superb effort by all concerned. Ray Teal as Sheriff Kretzer",

            "content": "Billy Wilder - the American director whose body of work sailed as closely to perfection as one can get - reportedly referred to Ace in the Hole, a rare flop for Wilder, as \"the runt of my cinematic litter.\" Dismissed by critics upon release for its cynical depiction of the tabloids and law enforcement, it has since been re-discovered and lavished with praise for foreshadowing a world in which we are bombarded with sensationalised news stories that are now never more than a thumb-swipe away. Kirk Douglas plays Chuck Tatum, a hard- drinking, troublemaking reporter exiled from New York to New Mexico, where he plans to recoup at a low-circulation local paper until he lands a story that will have his big-city former pals clawing at each other for his services.After over a year without the big break he was counting on, Tatum bitterly takes to the road to cover a rattlesnake hunt. On route, he stumbles across a weeping woman while filling his car with gas and, when a police car whizzes by, quickly sniffs the air for something big. It turns that a local man called Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) has become trapped in a cave while looking for local Indian artifacts. Remembering W. Floyd Collins, who had the nation gripped while in a similar situation, Tatum seizes his chance and quickly sets up shop, convincing Minosa's unhappy wife Lorraine (Jan Sterling) to stay and play the weeping damsel for the cameras and microphones, and strikes a deal with corrupt local sheriff Kretzer (Ray Teal) to support his re-election bidA more recent film to cover similar ground was Nighcrawler (2014), starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a more outwardly slimy reporter, manipulating events to his own benefit. The difference with Ace in the Hole is that Tatum does, by the end, discover a shred of humanity without losing his ferocity, as Leo's situation starts to look increasingly dire. Before his moral epiphany though, he shapes events with a Machiavellian wickedness, delaying the rescue and therefore allowing the story to garner national coverage, and using the strong-armed sheriff to shoo away any rival newspapers. It turns into a media circus, literally. Tatum stands on a mountain admiring what he has created while people flock to the scene in their hundreds and carnival rides are set up. A band even performs a song about Leo to the crowd and sells the recordings.Partly down to Douglas's astonishingly acid-tongued and energetic performance and partly Lesser Samuels, Walter Newman and Wilder's ferocious script, Ace in the Hole rests easily on par with the likes of The Lost Weekend (1945) and Some Like it Hot (1959), although it falls short of Double Indemnity (1944) and Sunset Blvd. (1950). He didn't get much wrong in his career, but Wilder's evaluation of the film is certainly dumbfounding. Unrelenting in its foreboding of where journalism was in danger of heading, Ace in the Hole is gripping storytelling. Douglas stampedes through the scenery like a branded bull, and his characters increasingly desperate actions remain shocking even now, 65 years later.",

            "content": "Ace in the Hole is not your typical 'detective' kind of film noir set in urban landscapes with generally a lot of low key lighting, yet it does consist of the immoral characters and femme fatale that film noirs are famous for. However, Ace in the Hole generally relies on sweeping outdoor shots of actual landscapes and is able to show us the rotten world that is displayed without needing much help from low key lighting.Perhaps Wilder's greatest film, Ace in the Hole is a brutally honest piece of art that displays man's inhumanity and doesn't shy away from making all its characters immoral who seem to care for nothing other than themselves and their pockets. Chuck Tatum ( Kirk Douglas ) is the perfect example of this. He pretends to be Leo's ( Richard Benedict ) friend ( The guy who is stuck in the cave with his legs under the rubble ), but in reality all that Chuck is interested in is a chance to get away from his small time journalism job back to New York where he once was. His indifference and plain immorality to the condition of Leo is tragic to see yet it reminds us that humanity is not perfect, and Wilder was never really afraid to show us things how they really were in his movies.Even Leo's wife Lorraine ( Jan Sterling ) seems indifferent to her husbands situation, while Leo believes she is probably worried sick about him. A media circus is built around the cave dwelling where he is stuck, and Tatum made sure to tell the drilling team to take the long route towards Leo which takes about a week instead of a single day, and bribes the corrupt sherrif to make sure it truly happens. The shots of the people having fun at the carnival are an extremely cynical look on dancing on the near-grave of a dying man buried inside the rubble. It shows not just the media is to blame, but also the people who are gullible enough to be manipulated by it, resulting in thousands of people actively taking part in a disgusting exploitation of the suffering of a human being.Kirk Douglas is perfect as Chuck Tatum. His character is as selfish and uncaring as he could be, and Douglas captures his arrogance and his fakeness like no other with his confident and energetic acting. Jan Sterling is also very good as the 'Femme Fatale' of this noir, and is very succesful at making her character unlikeable and inhuman. None of the characters are truly likeable ( Except maybe Leo ) but when a media circus and human exploitation is shown in such an honest and brutal way it still manages to reach the audience's inner subconscious since it shows us in a perfect way that not everything is perfect, and that media and media manipulation often tread above human consideration.All in all Ace in the Hole is a disturbing ( Due to the fact that everyone is partying on the costs of a man dying ) but honest film that dares point out our flaws as human beings by showing us this exploitation of a man that is dying in a cave while unknowingly the people brainwashed by the media are basically stamping him further into the ground while having the time of their lives.",

            "content": "This is an incredibly cynical film. Subtlety was largely unknown to Billy Wilder, who co-wrote and directed this. The lead role is played by Kirk Douglas, but he overacts to an outrageous extent and appears never to have been reined in by Wilder, who always liked everything done with broad strokes of the brush, and all harsh lines to be shouted. Just the tiniest bit of restraint would have done wonders to make this film more effective. The female lead is played by Jan Sterling, and she too is encouraged to overact. That tends to be the case however only in the scenes where she is scared, in which she opens her eyes wide and I can imagine Wilder yelling off camera: ''Wider! Wider!' Sometimes you can see her opening them wider, as if remembering to do so, or as if she has been shouted at. This is just about as 'in your face' as such a film can get. There are some very amusing lines given to Jan Sterling, and she delivers them with an excellent sense of cool. Exasperated with Douglas, she says to him: 'I've seen hard-boiled eggs before, but you, you're 20 minutes.' On another occasion when he tells her he wants her to go to church, look holy, and kneel down, she replies: 'I don't kneel. It puckers my nylons.' Unfortunately, there aren't enough of such wisecracks to lighten the load. The story is meant to be a savage expose of the corruption and exploitative nature of the news media. Douglas plays a ruthless journalist who will do anything for a story, and then will squeeze that story dry, and then some. He wants to get ahead, and he uses anyone and anything to further his ambitions. He shouts, he bullies, he throws things, he insults people, and is so horrible that the scenes in the office of the Albuquerque, New Mexico Sun Journal where he works are totally unbelievable, since his despicable behaviour there would never have been tamely tolerated by his colleagues, as portrayed in the film. He finally gets hold of a 'big story' of a man trapped deep in a cave behind a Pueblo India ruin, on a mountain sacred to the Native Americans and called The Mountain of the Seven Vultures. He crawls in and tells the man he will see to it that he is rescued. He then delays the rescue for several days in order to squeeze more juice out if the story, thus risking the man's life. The man's wife is played by Jan Sterling. She has been longing for an opportunity to leave her boring husband but only has eleven dollars, so can't run away. Douglas organises a huge publicity circus, where thousands of people gather outside the cave to wait to see whether the man will be rescued. Meanwhile Jan cleans up by selling hamburgers to them all, thus getting enough cash to dash. The film is meant to have a moral message. It is meant to tell us how awful we all are, how horribly humans behave, and how monstrous the media are. There is only one good person in the whole film, the long-suffering owner and editor of the Albuquerque newspaper. Everybody else is a nightmarish parody of a person. The film is so extreme it its depiction of everybody as greedy, corrupt, dishonest, and ruthless, that there seems little point in watching it, since we know enough about all that sort of thing already without having to see it in a very out-of-control film rant. I should point out that eight years later, Robert Penn Warren published his novel The Cave, about a man stuck in a cave near Tracy City, Tennessee, which is a tiny place near Monteagle on Sewanee Mountain. That novel may well have been inspired by this film, since it largely concerns all the things which go on outside the cave, and also deals with 'the nature of humanity' as everyone flutters around the man who is stuck, all with their own agendas. I read it way back in those days. It is very easy to get stuck in a cave in Tennessee. I was stuck in one myself once, but only for about nine hours, with a boy named Neil Trichell, who came from Louisiana. Nobody rescued us, but we made our escape eventually with the greatest possible struggle and difficulty. That was in Salt Peter Cave in Tennessee, which had been used as a salt peter mine by the Confederate troops during the American Civil War, as gunpowder could not be made without that ingredient. If you have never been stuck in a cave shaft, you should try it sometime. It did not give me claustrophobia, but it made me more careful in the future. When I saw that man in the film lying there unable to get out, I could not but remember my own brief flirting with such a dilemma. Robert Penn Warren, by the way, wrote the famous novel ALL THE KING'S MEN (1946), which won the Pulitzer Prize and was made into the famous film of that title in 1949. His other major contribution to the cinema was the novel BAND OF ANGELS, made into a well known film in 1957. THE CAVE was never filmed, but got a lot of attention at the time because of the author's reputation. And the fact that many people remembered this film may have helped as well. People who are trapped have always been popular for film stories, perhaps because so many people feel trapped in their own lives. The hope of escape lives on, and is one of things that keeps everyone going. Let us remember that it is not only the man in the cave who is trapped in this film, but his wife as well, in her marriage, and in fact, that is really by far the more interesting part of the film.",

As well-made as it is hard to stomach, Wilder's film sticks it to journalism, middle-class tourism, rubbernecking, and unfaithful women with equal aplomb to illuminate the moral desensitization of American society in an age of trivial entertainments. (Possibly the most misanthropic shot I've ever seen: a locomotive bearing the name of the dying man bringing in hundreds of paying guests, the camera panning to catch them all running towards the carnival setup as a country-western band sings the victim's ballad.) The main character, Chuck Tatum, is observed in the opening shot riding in his car while being towed to the Albuquerque newspaper, his latest job opportunity in a career of burned bridges. The newsroom is presided over by a scrupulous editor whose motto \"Tell The Truth\" is embroidered in a deliberately quaint, relic of a portrait. After talking the editor into giving him a job, Douglas walks toward the camera, and in a brilliant touch his figure creates a momentary black screen that gives way to his re-emerging into frame exactly a year later, wearing the same unfashionable belt-suspenders combo for which he teased his boss\u0097an inventive jump-cut not only for its artistic skill, but also for defining a professional nadir that impels Tatum to exploit the cave-in for personal notoriety. The way that Tatum's careful scheme comes crashing down around his ears is akin to Walter Neff reaching for ill-gotten gains and being doubly rebuffed for his efforts. However, Tatum's pathetic end is more demonstrative than resigned: in his fall from prestige, he conjures up one of cinema's unforgettable closing lines. This is a devastating satire, blunt and unsparing.",

            "content": "Ace in the Hole is about a brash, self-centered news reporter, Charles Tatum, who shamelessly exploits a tragedy to satisfy his own personal needs. He doesn't care about other people; he just cares about himself and abuses his responsibilities as a journalist to create havoc. Kirk Douglas delivers a powerful performance as Charles Tatum. Douglas succeeds in capturing Tatum's depravity. Jan Sterling also delivers a strong performance as Lorraine, the cynical yet emotionally vulnerable wife of the man trapped in the cave. Lorraine is on to Tatum. She knows that he's a con man doing a con job. Yet, this movie is not about Lorraine, it is about Tatum. Tatum drives this story. Charles Tatum is not a tragic figure. He has no redeeming qualities. He is a womanizer, a bully, a drunk and a trouble maker. Tatum is too crass, too deceitful and too violent to warrant any sympathy. He cruelly exploits the plight of a suffering man and beats up on a woman, not once, but twice. His conduct is beyond mitigation. He is not a Walter Neff, who was just doing his job, gets caught up in something and then gets manipulated into making questionable decisions. Tatum knew the rules of conduct and by his own volition deliberately violated them. He knew he was doing wrong and did it anyway. He has only himself to blame. Yet, the story is tragic, not for what it says about Tatum, who by the end of the story is revealed to be what he is, a broken down, discredited nobody, but for what it says about a society that would give credence to a creep like Tatum in the first place. Had a society that produced heroes like Sergeant York and Lou Gehrig and solemnly prayed for the safety and success of its brave soldiers on Omaha Beach become so decadent and depraved that it could gloat and laugh over the plight of a suffering man stuck in a cave? Or tolerate the idea of man viciously hitting and terrorizing a woman? Or permit a drunkard to masquerade as a savior? Or produce people willing to sell out in order to gain cheap political advantage? In this respect, this movie is a form of social commentary and by watching it, a consciousness raising experience. For those reasons alone, it qualifies as a work of art.On second thought, Charles Tatum, the principal character in Ace in the Hole, is a tragic figure. Although he is thoroughly despicable, by his own admission he is a murderer, his pomposity and pretentiousness calls attention to our own weaknesses and imperfections as human beings. Tatum was not born being bad. At some point in his life he was innocent, spiritually pure, and happy. Then something happened to distort his personality and corrupt him. The movie does not allude to that event but it can be inferred that some trauma must have occurred to cause him to become warped. He harbors resentment against the paper in New York that fired him, but even if the firing was unjust, that trauma alone is not sufficient to explain Tatum's twisted personality. He craves power, prestige and money; his grandiosity knows no bounds; he wants to be treated like a god. These aspirations are a fool's dream and one that can only bring destruction. Tatum's strivings are an exercise in futility. He is like a puppet that is trying to pull its own strings, in the process getting the strings tangled. Throughout the story Tatum is a mess and his behavior erratic. He is attracted to Lorraine, yet beats her. He risks his life by going into the cave, but it is only for show. He is energetic and resourceful, for reasons that are self-serving. He is the kind of guy who will bail you out of a jam but only for a price; the kind of guy who will help you out then do you in; the kind of guy who will help you fix your car because he wants to steal it. Tatum could have been a hero. He could have called attention to Leo's plight not as part of a gimmick for self-promotion but because he really wanted to help save a life and really cared. He could have been a positive role model for Lorraine and Herbie, and for everyone else who admires him. But he squanders the opportunity and winds up acting the fool and being the fool. What a waste. In this respect, Charles Tatum is a tragic figure.",

            "content": "This is a great film about a newspaper reporter who burned himself out in New York City with lots of boozing and fooling around with plenty of women. This reporter is Chuck Tatum, (Kirk Douglas) who comes to town in Albuquerque, New Mexico in a tow truck after all his tires blew out. Chuck seeks employment from a local Albuquerque Newspaper and manages to get a position on the paper. Chuck gets a big assignment to cover a rattlesnake convention but finds a more interesting story about the cave in of a mine which traps Leo Minosa,(Richard Benedict). Chuck knows from past experience that this will make a great story and he contacts all the right connections for a doctor, construction engineers and the local sheriff. Lorraine Minosa,(Jan Sterling) is the wife of Leo and is really bored with her marriage and Lorraine becomes interested in Chuck Tatum. This entire event brings a media circus to this New Mexico story. This is a film that will capture your attention from the very beginning to the very end, there is some very serious signs of violence and romance. This is a great Kirk Douglas film who gave an outstanding performance along with Jan Sterling who was very sexy and also a very tough and rough gal.",

The months drag by and a bored Tatum is assigned to report on a rattlesnake hunt. With photographer Herbie (Robert Arthur) in tow, a stop for gasoline at a small store will provide Tatum with the chance to exploit a man, Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict), trapped in a cave. The victim's misfortune allows Tatum to orchestrate the rescue and by stretching out the process, he manages to cash-in by selling daily reports to a larger newspaper in NYC.

            "content": "For me this is the best Kirk Douglas has ever been, and Jan Sterling's performance as the tough-as-nails wife of doomed Leo Minosa is also one for the ages. She initially sees her husband being trapped as an opportunity to make a clean getaway. Then she stays only because she can make money, and perhaps because she has the hots for Kirk's reporter character. And even as Leo's plight becomes increasingly dire, she still can't work up a shred of concern or sympathy for her husand of five years. And he's not someone who has ever been mean or mistreated her. She's just bored. What a tough cookie. To Billy Wilder's credit, he never gives her a scene where she's even partially redeemed. She's remains greedy and cold hearted right to the end.While Douglas and Stirling have the showy parts, the cast is uniformly excellent, and really give the movie a lot of its power and credibility. Porter Hall is nicely understated as the newspaper publisher who gives Kirk a job but never seems all that impressed with him. Bob Arthur as the impressionable young reporter is very good, gradually losing his hero worship of Kirk as he says him for what he is. Ray Teal is memorably slimy as the corrupt sheriff with a weird fascination with his pet snake. Smollet, the engineer, really seems like a small town engineer, and not an actor playing one. Great casting. Richard Bennet as Leo Minosa, the trapped man, imbues his character with dignity and humanity, making you really feel his death. There's no sense of a man giving a performance to gain your sympathy. He is who he is and you accept that. The uniform quality of the acting in these small roles is one of the things that made Billy Wilder a great director. Sadly, now many people think of great directing as showy camera work or spectacular special effects. I watch contemporay movies made by big name directors and often the acting is horrible. It's like directing actors has become a lost art.\"Ace in the Hole\" is certainly a wonderful and powerful movie that holds up even after multiple viewings, but there is one thing that I've always wondered about. That Kirk's character never seeks medical attention for his stab wound has always seemed to me questionable. I guess we're supposed to see it as a sort of suicide in atonement for his complicity in Leo's death, but no matter the extent of his self-contempt he's also a narcissist, and narcissists are generally not suicidal. (It would've been a different movie if Kirk's character remained cynical and hard boiled to the end, instead of having the moment of redemption Wilder gives him that he didn't give to Mrs. Minosa.)",

Unfortunately, the director's cynical screenplay, co-written with Walter Newman and Lesser Samuels and earning them an Oscar nomination, was ahead of its time and lost money when it failed to draw an audience even after it was re- released under a more apt title The Big Carnival (1951). Apparently, moviegoers of that time didn't believe that a reporter could be so unscrupulous as to manipulate the news and exploit the rescue of a dying man for circulation, ratings, or even a Pulitzer Prize ... how naive!It stars Kirk Douglas as lying, sensationalist reporter Charles 'Chuck' Tatum, who'd worked in all the largest media outlet cities in the eastern half of the country before he finds himself begging for a job from the owner/editor (Porter Hall) of a newspaper in Albuquerque, New Mexico. After a year of working on stories as mundane as rattlesnake roundups, he finds the perfect opportunity to make it back to the big time when he happens upon Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict), a man that's been trapped in a 450 year old Indian cave ruin in Gallup, N.M. off Route 66. Tatum proceeds to use the man's disgruntled wife (Jan Sterling), the local sheriff (Ray Teal), and a wide-eyed coworker photographer (Robert Arthur) to accomplish his goal. The sheriff even helps the reporter convince a local contractor to pursue a much longer, more newsworthy course of action to save Minosa from the precarious situation (the mine could collapse at any time) because Tatum has promised to act as his reelection campaign manager, growing the lawman's notoriety in exchange for exclusive access to Leo and the cave.Frank Cady plays the first spectator to the scene perfectly as Mr. Federber, whose family is showcased (throughout the movie) as the event grows to ridiculous proportions that include a Ferris wheel and other sideshow activities (for emphasis). It seems that only Minosa's sad Papa (John Berkes) and praying Mama (Frances Dominguez) care about Leo, about whom a folk song is written, sung, and sold at the site. Even his wife Lorraine seems more concerned about selling hamburgers and souvenirs as she establishes and then systematically raises the admission price to the grounds over the course of the weeklong rescue effort, which could have been managed in 12-16 hours if the most expeditious method was taken.The film's only sour note is its (predictable?) ending, which is somewhat less impactful than the rest of this story that bears resemblance to a true incident involving another trapped miner named Floyd Collins that had received some attention years before the release of this movie.",

            "content": "The movie is basically a social commentary, or rather said a commentary against the power of the press and the media-hype they can often create out of something so seemingly small and insignificant. Here we have an average man, being stuck in collapsed mine. Kirk Douglas walks in and bombards it to the 'curse of the mountain of the seven vultures', based on some old Indian legend and creates a big media circus out of it when all of the big newspapers and radio-stations gets a smell of it. This is of course still all real relevant today. This present time perhaps even more than was the case back at the time of this movie. It's all rather effective and I can tell what the film-makers tried to achieve with it all but is it all that interesting to watch really? I don't think so and as a movie it therefore falls kind of flat.It tells the story of the Kirk Douglas character, who is a journalist who has basically hit rock bottom due to circumstance and lost his job at all of the big papers and therefore decides to start all over again at a small and insignificant local newspaper, hoping that his big break will come soon again, once he'll get noticed again for his writing and journalism now that he is back at the game. Once this just doesn't happen he smells his chance when he just happens to come across this story of this guy that is stuck in the mine, when he is passing through on his way to cover another far less significant story. He decides to milk the entire story completely dry, which gets himself back in the picture again in the journalistic world. And her lies a bit of a problem for this movie for me. The one moment it feels as if the Kirk Douglas character is doing this all out of sympathy and the other he's just a cold-hearted journalist, doing it all for his own personal gain. It's hard to really get into the character and what to think of him, since the movie its story keeps trowing things around. It's not really pleasant, also really not since when his characters is cold and stubborn he really is cold and stubborn. Can't really say that I blame Kirk Douglas for this, since he is simply being a superb actor in this movie.I'm a big fan of Billy Wilder but I have to say that this is one of his weaker directed movies. It just misses that little edginess and smartness about its subject that for instance a movie like \"The Lost Weekend\" did had. It's as if he himself did not fully know what direction to head in and what style to apply to it. It's a bit of a bland movie that heads in too many different direction, also with its characters, throughout the movie.But as mentioned earlier the movie is still mostly being effective with its subject, that is quite relevant and shows what's wrong with modern journalism, when all morals are gone and people are doing everything to create and often attempt to control the cause and outcome of their own stories. The movie is just not being told and shot in the best way imaginable. In my opinion still a good- but also a Billy Wilder movie you can easily do without.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

As I remember, this was part of a Wilder double feature with \"Sunset Boulevard.\" I was blown away by how brilliant this movie was, and it was not surprising that audiences in 1951 would totally bypass this film. It is one of the most depressing films made by a Hollywood studio during the fifties. Except for a couple of people, everybody has their own agenda and are thoroughly unlikeable. The screenplay re-defines the word cynical. It is clear that audience word-of-mouth killed this movie quickly, and a name change was not going to bring more people into theaters.And it also meant that it would take society seeing crooked, self-serving people of all walks of life on a daily basis before it would be rediscovered and appreciated for being ahead of its time. Many of the images are truly frightening; at about eighty minutes into the film, the area has turned into a carnival of incredible proportions, and is truly sickening when you consider that there is a man close to death at the time. And there are subtle little touches; the sheriff carries around a snake, and he is a snake himself.Performances are letter perfect, and the script has not one wasted word; it could be remade today with very little having to be changed.

            "content": "Though the picture begins with a very simple and uncomplicated tone, and the plot picks up quickly, even in the first moments it's readily enticing. Kirk Douglas gives a sharp, vibrant performance as acerbic reporter Chuck Tatum. The dialogue handily matches that abrasiveness - if prose could ever feel like the poetic equivalent of stinging nettles, where but in a Billy Wilder film might we get it? Moreover, the lighting in the cave sequences is fantastic, lending tension and a feeling of claustrophobia alongside Hugo Friedhofer's terrific score. And Charles Lang's cinematography is wonderfully crisp and vivid, letting every detail pop out with such clarity that it almost feels like we could reach through the screen and touch the visions before us. Once the story begins in earnest the murk rapidly grows deeper, the true nature of the characters starts to take shape, and stark themes begin to emerge. 'Ace in the hole' makes a big impression in no time at all, and it's plainly outstanding.It's one matter to say the picture explodes with wry opportunism, exploitation, corruption, and sensationalism. It's another matter entirely to note how discretely dark the tale swiftly becomes, and downright bleak in its assessment of society. Grim, morbid \"humor\" and ruthless intelligence characterizes the dialogue and scene writing as the pitch black heart of the characters and the narrative inexorably spread like blight, subsuming the glimmers of humanity: I was told 'Ace in the hole' was harsh and cheerless, but nothing could have prepared me for just how pitilessly hard-nosed and caustic this movie is as it makes us look in the mirror. For all that, though, the story is also completely spellbinding, and in every regard this film is dazzlingly well made.Douglas is the star, and he proves it with a commanding portrayal, but he's hardly alone in that excellence. If his co-stars are less noteworthy, it's only because they have less time in front of the camera. Jan Sterling, Robert Arthur, Richard Benedict, Ray Teal, John Berkes, Frank Jaquet, and even France Dominguez all shine with the material they're given, embodying their parts with terrific range, nuance, personality, and otherwise vitality. Every last cast member has the skill to carry the picture all by themselves, yet are aided nonetheless by Wilder's flawless, expert direction. He brings out the most acrid and rueful aspects in every performance, making 'Ace in the hole' endlessly biting - and matches that deft guiding hand with an incredibly keen eye for shot composition that's often altogether haunting. Why, the entire production is simply grand; to read on the making of the movie to any degree it's clear just how large a spectacle it became in its own way, and that itself is peculiarly fitting given the nature of the tale on hand.This is a feature awash in so much black, abject cynicism that I've a hard time imagining any level of optimism could survive the viewing experience. One could easily exhaust a thesaurus in picking out every dreary, dismal, depressing word with which to describe it. Even so, for as joyless as 'Ace in the hole' is, it's also all but peerless in its superb craft. Writing, direction, acting, all the contributions of crew behind the scenes - every last element of the picture is approached with such perfect care and mindfulness that the whole becomes unimpeachable. There are many classic, essential movies in the world of cinema, and still this one mightily impresses in every possible way. The drama is so potent and charged as to be breathtaking; I lost count of the number of times my reaction to one scene after another was disbelieving bewilderment. Suffice to say that given the exacting critique Wilder serves up with this title it surely won't appeal to all viewers. Yet so exquisite is the storytelling and film-making, and the feelings they elicit, that I can only give this my highest and most enthusiastic recommendation: Bear in mind the distinct, pervasive, acidic gloom, but so long as that ambience is no obstacle, 'Ace in the hole' is a must-see.",

Tatum and his co-worker Herbie (Robert Arthur) are dispatched to report on a rattlesnake hunt, but en route they discover that a man is trapped inside a cave; sensing that this is his opportunity for a big story Tatum sets about trying to free the man, but he does this in the slowest manner possible in order to get the story sold to as many papers as possible, but things don't go according to plan....From the moment you lay eyes on Chuck Tatum you know you're going to be in the company of a fairly bad egg; he's a heavy drinker, a womaniser and a hack in every sense of the word. However, despite learning all of these things from an early stage I was still taken by surprise by how callous he can actually be - my early impressions of him were that he was slightly misguided and a bit unprofessional, but as the story goes on I realised that he was much worse than this - he's actually a borderline sociopath!!! I was both impressed and alarmed by the icy cold manner in which he manipulates the newspapers, the sheriff, and the poor bloke's family into assisting him in playing the story out exactly as he desires - they are all puppets in his grand scheme to make himself as rich as possible and he will quite literally stop at nothing to achieve his desired goal.Despite Tatum's slightly sociopathic tendencies, Wilder does well to still make him seem like a person rather than a caricature. To me he just wanted to get rich and the unethical approach & methods that he uses to sell his story aren't really that far-fetched - we all know that journalists will do practically anything to sell a story and will manipulate facts in order to make the story more attractive to readers (which is what Tatum does as soon as he takes his first picture). What we perhaps have here is a slightly exaggerated example of a real-life person and a real-life scenario (at least that's how I see it). However, Tatum isn't the only bad egg and even the wife of the man stuck in the cave is scheming whilst he's stuck down there. By contrast the man stuck in the hole confesses his undying love for his wife to Tatum which not only gives the film some emotional weight, but it also gives Tatum a dilemma of his own.The performances here are variable, but it has to be said that Douglas was note perfect. He essentially switches from being charming to sociopathic at the drop of a hat and his energy, enthusiasm and multi-layered performance are top-notch. Jan Sterling's portrayal of the poor bloke's scheming wife isn't a match for Douglas, but she is very good in her own right. As Tatum's lapdog, Robert Arthur is constantly in Douglas' shadow and fails to make any kind of impact on the picture. The performances from the supporting cast are generally acceptable.Ultimately, this is a story about one man believing that a sensational story and getting rich are more important than attending to the matter at hand (i.e rescuing the trapped man). In effect, Tatum's greed and self-interest ultimately prove to be his undoing which I think was the point of the whole film. Ace In The Hole is essential viewing especially for those with a leaning towards human interest stories.",

            "content": "Ace in the Hole is a movie which has been made in 1951 but after watching the movie I firmly believe that the movie still holds valid in the current mad mad Fourth Estate race.Ace in the Hole is directed by Billy Wilder and was a flop when it opened in 1951 that too one year after Wilder had provided a real treat in 'Sunset Blvd.' in 1950.With all the venom that Wilder spewed at Hollywood in 'Sunset Blvd.', he outdoes himself here. His teeth are clenched, his fists are up and he's out for blood but this time his target is mass media as represented by newspaperman Chuck Tatum played by Kirk Douglas (Michael Douglas's dad). The film opens as he's driving through Albuquerque, New Mexico. Tatum stops by the local paper, The Sun-Bulletin, to ask for a job.Kirk Douglas gives the fiercest performance of his career, an amoral newspaper reporter caught in dead end Albuquerque who happens upon the story of a lifetime, and will do anything to ensure he gets the scoop.After months of living in a rut he finally stumbles upon the perfect story. Deep within some old Indian ruins, a treasure hunter has gotten himself stuck in a cave-in (Co-relate it with our own Prince story which bombarded our TVs couple of years back). Guy in a well. That'll sell papers, right? What follows is genius, as Tatum engineers the story to be far bigger than it really is. We watch as he manipulates the rescue engineers, the local sheriff, the victim's wife, all with the intent of prolonging the incident. He wants to keep the guy underground as long as possible. This gives Tatum time to write more stories, sell them at top dollar to other newspapers, become a major celebrity in his own right and land piles of cash When thousands gather outside the cave and a feverish media circus begins to grow, Tatum smells victory. But of course things go downhill from here.Wilder has always been a master of tone and he continues that trend here. The film starts very funny in a dark, sadistic sort of way, but Wilder slowly lets the humor drain from the proceedings.Wilder often considered Ace in the Hole to be his greatest film and he'll get no argument from me. As of this writing, I can think of few films that are as timely and relevant as this one. It feels fresh and contemporary, and not dated in the least.",

            "content": "In today's (pathetic) political climate, \"Ace in the Hole\" comes across as even more relevant than it was when it was first released. In this classic tragicomedy, Billy Wilder portrays the media in a most harsh and unforgivable light, as he creates one of the finest cinematic satires of all time. Mixing laugh out loud moments and witty dialogue with heartbreaking tragedy and, at times, unbearable darkness, it's hard for me to even believe that such a film was released in a time in which the world itself seems so innocent and naive. But, as masters like Wilder show, there has always been intelligence and wit in the world-no matter what stereotypes may tell us.Whatever side of politics you are on, you can not say that this film is at all silly, because it is entirely accurate. Ridiculous, overblown news is being shoved into the public's faces left and right nowadays, especially with the new, controversial president-dare I say his name here without causing a damn riot?-the media now finds more opportunities to over exaggerate and, sometimes, straight up slander everyday. For people sick of our society's downfall, \"Ace in the Hole\" is the film for you! It is way ahead of its time, a truly excellent, hilarious, and scathing film. One that does not support beliefs of the liberal or conservative, but of the descent and kind. It is a strong social commentary on greed and the cruelties of man. And it all starts with a simple story that progressively gets worse in worse in both a hilarious and deeply concerning manner.Everything about this movie is practically perfect. The score, filmmaking, humor, and structure all blend splendidly to create a pleasing and enraging experience. Billy Wilder uses a noirish atmosphere to convey this wacky tale, and as the film goes on it works more than you'd ever suspect. I must also praise the dialogue in this film. not only is it witty and satirical, but it is also at times nearly on par with the writing of Paddy Chayefsky, reminding me of \"Network\".If you wish to be hit by a bolt of ingenious satire, \"Ace in the Hole\" is the hilarious and bleak film for you!",

Tatum gets his big chance when he and his fellow reporter and photographer for the paper Herbie Cook, Robert Arthur, come across this cave-in deep in Indian territory outside of Escudero New Mexico. Smelling a big story in the works Tatum finds ancient Indian artifact hunter Leo Minosa, Richard Benedict, trapped deep inside the cave clinging to life and an idea suddenly pops into Tatum's head.Being the only reporter on the scene Tatum plans to keep Leo trapped in the cave as long as he can and make the headlines with the tragic situation Leo finds himself in! It would have taken less then a day to save Leo by shoring up the cave and pulling Leo out of it. But instead Tatum decides, against the advice of the local engineers on the scene, to drill through some 200 feet of rock to finally get to Leo and save his life. Something that would take almost a week to accomplish! Using the corrupt country sheriff Gus Kretzer, Ray Teal, as his strong arm man Tatum gets the ball rolling in making a complete circus out of poor Leo's tragic fate that even Leo's gold digging wife Lorraine, Jan Sterling, who was about to leave him joins in on. With Leo becoming headline news all across the country the fact that his life is in serious danger due to Tatum and Sheriff Kretzan, who up for re-election, manipulating and milking him, or his story, for as long as they can makes things much worse for the poor and desperate man.***SPOILERS*** It's very late in the Leo saga that Tatum finally comes to his senses in what he's not only doing to Leo but to himself as well. With both time and air running out for Leo Tatum decides to stop the drilling and shore up the cave, which he was told to do in the first place, in order to save Leo's life before he dies from his injuries. Tatum has by now completely lost it and in an attempt to get Lorraine to go along with his scam of her being the grieving wife ends up getting stabbed, when he tried to strangle Lorraine,in the gut by her. With his meal ticket,Leo Minosa, now gone Tatum finally sees the light and the damage in what he did and meekly returns back to the office of the Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin to get a job that he feels is more then fitting of his talents: As the papers's junior mans room attendant working not for a salary but on tips alone. Tatum trying to compose himself doesn't quite make it back to his desk dropping dead, from a loss of blood, right there on the spot with his shocked boss the editor of the paper Jacob Q.

            "content": "ACE IN THE HOLE is quite sordid and somewhat cynical dramas. Human manipulation causes human morality, develops corruption and ultimately crime. In this film the demonstration of sensational tragedy has fallen into the background. The human scum and wickedness have surfaced. Noir atmosphere had to create a morally troubled character or in this case more.Monstrous vulgarity in a man works spectacularly. The internal struggle, after things get out of control, is even better. Heartless people is quite realistic. I have the impression, given the characterization and realistic view, how this story is part of a truth. Truth about people, and not only journalists. The news is a cause and a consequence that causes the infection. At times we can see in action morbid human psychology, the desire for success, power and money. Indeed a very good drama, which is true.It is probably hard and shocking observed degradation in society. We can always turn a blind eye and in an instant moment lose human life. Kirk Douglas as Chuck Tatum is a two-faced character. The man who offends instincts, snake poison words and grinds all before it in the pathological ambition. Cynic and a liar who slowly loses control of the situation. The problem arises when his personal ambition conflicts with the ambitions of his like people. The arrogance and cruelty crossing in uncertainty and despair. Kirk Douglas is indeed excellent in this role.Jan Sterling as Lorraine Minosa is the wife eager comfortable life and money. Ray Teal as Sheriff Kretzer, perverse and irresponsible sheriff eager authorities. Richard Benedict as Leo Minosa is a victim of irresponsibility, ambition and lack of professionalism. Unfortunately, he died in ignorance.One man has created a disaster to qualify their own benefit. The media and the people involved. It is absurd to see that passion remorse (after \"murder\") shows a person who is also created chaos. Team ambition leads to a complete collapse. Shocking, little depressing and pretty realistic.",

            "content": "A small town newspaper journalist seizes an opportunity to get back to the big time.Ace In The Hole is a brilliant, savage satire of humanity with a number of memorable scenes and powerful central performance.The plot is fairly simple. A local man gets trapped in a collapsed cave and the incident captures the attention of the public. This is exploited by an ambitious journalist and in the resulting media circus we see humanity at it's most opportunistic and conformative.There is so much ridicule of how people behave in these human-interest situations and it is as relevant today's as it was in 1951. Tatum is the quintessential siren-chasing newsman who is so desperate for success he will doing anything to get it. Kretzer is the corrupt public official complicit in everything that suits his purpose. Mrs Minosa, the victim's wife, is another cynical opportunist. The harshest criticism is aimed at the general public, who not only lap up all the sensationalist, tabloid news, but actually buy tickets to go and see it play out. The gathering crowd is like the hoards of mindless zombies you see queuing outside shops on Black Friday sales day.There are numerous great scenes in the movie like the sweeping landscapes showing the size of the mob growing at the foot of the mountain, but I think the most effective for me is when Tatum slaps Mrs Minosa to make her facial expression appear to be more like someone worried about her husband's life. I think Kirk Douglas unexpectedly slapped Jan Sterling for real to produce that reaction. Not a nice thing to do, but you can't say it isn't cinematic.The striking cinematography coveys the story visually and the editing makes it all tick over at an efficient pace.This is one of the standout performances of Douglas' career, playing another headstrong, singled minded, ruthlessly driven individual, with a larger than life personality. Jan Sterling has a strong presence and holds centre stage with him well.There are a few issues with plausibility of how much Tatum influences every single aspect of what happens, but aside from this everything for me is near perfect.",

This is one of my favourite Kirk Douglas films of all time with a magnificent supporting cast including Jan Sterling (superb), Porter Hall (always reliable character actor), Ray Teal (one of his best roles), Richard Benedict, Robert Arthur and Gene Evans.Kirk Douglas is Chuck Tatum - an unsuccessful reporter on his way to cover a news item about a rattlesnake hunt for a small town newspaper when he hears about a man Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) who is trapped in a mine shaft. Sensing this could be the important scoop he has been looking for that will get him back into the big time he makes his way to the mine location. With the help of crooked sheriff Gus Kretzer (excellently portrayed by Ray Teal) he illegally obtains exclusive rights to the story. What starts out as just a small local interest item builds into a major event with hundreds of people arriving daily and a \"carnival\" atmosphere soon prevails. TV and radio crews plus reporters from other papers converge to cover the attempted rescue - purposely delayed by Douglas to ensure his story is kept in the headlines. With the help of untrustworthy sheriff Ray Teal he deliberately hinders the rescue attempts thereby placing the trapped man in even greater danger. Jan Sterling is perfect as Lorraine Minosa (the unfaithful wife of the trapped man) and her confrontational scenes with Kirk Douglas are electric.Grippingly directed by Billy Wilder (based on a real life incident) the film holds your attention throughout yet its only Oscar nomination was for best story and screenplay - it's hard to believe now but Kirk Douglas and Billy Wilder didn't even get a nomination more's the pity! Just another example of films which are appreciated today but were ignored by the Academy at the time of release.Some favourite lines from the film:Kirk Douglas (to Porter Hall): \"I've lied to men who wear belts, I've lied to men who wear suspenders - but I'd never be so stupid as to lie to a man who wears both belt and suspenders\".Douglas (to Porter Hall): \"Where's my desk?\". Porter Hall: \"The one by the door - you may be out of here by Saturday\". Douglas: \"The sooner the better!\".Jan Sterling (to Douglas): \"I've met some hard boiled eggs in my time, but you - you're twenty minutes!\".Jan Sterling (to Douglas): \"I don't go to church. Kneeling bags my nylons\". Douglas: \"You're making enough dough to buy yourself another pair!\".Douglas (to Porter Hall): \"How would you like to make a thousand dollars a day Mr Boot? I'm a thousand dollar a day newspaper man. You can have me for nothing!\". (Last line of film).Definitely one of Billy Wilder's best - a prestigious classic not to be missed. 10/10.  Clive Roberts.",

While on the way to a town six hours away form where he works he learns about a man named Leo Minosa (played by Richard Benedict)who is trapped in a 450 year old ancient Indian dwelling. While watching this movie the plot reminded me a lot of Sidney Lumet's 1975 masterpiece Dog Day Afternoon because of the few similarities between the two films. This is one of the best Billy Wilder movies that I have seen in a long time along with Witness for the Prosecution (1957), The Apartment (1960), Sunset Boulevard (1950), Some like It Hot (1959), and The Spirit of St. Louis (1957). The Kirk Douglas performance reminds me of John Wayne's career defining performance that he gave in The Searchers (1956). I do find it hard to believe that this movie was only nominated for one Oscar at the 24th Oscar ceremony when I really do think that it should have been nominated for much more awards but the crappy excuse at the time was that it was a critical and commercial failure at the time this movie was released into theaters which I find to be really unfortunate because of how great this movie actually is.",

This performance is no doubt one of his finest as an actor. Billy Wilder has chosen a very poignant yet telling plot for this movie. His vision and direction are extra ordinary.

            "content": "Billy Wilder's role as the master of cynicism has always drawn from a wellspring of compassion and both are in plentiful supply in this dark, dark masterpiece. Wilder, writing with Lesser Samuels and Walter Newman, delivers a hard-boiled tale in which a faded newspaperman (an excellent Kirk Douglas) stumbles upon a human interest story about a miner trapped in a cave (Richard Benedict) and milks it at the miner's expense until it has become an event of carnival proportions and a national media sensation. In addition to the media, Wilder eviscerates a host of sacred cows, including marriage (an intriguing Jan Sterling plays the miner's lonely, corrupt wife), the police and the gullible--yet ultimately penitent--public (represented by everyone's favorite sad sack, Frank Cady, who would later gain fame as Hooterville's store clerk Mr. Drucker on \"Petticoat Junction\" and \"Green Acres\"); but his empathetic treatment of the miner and his desperate parents prove to be a filter through which Wilder can channel his rage and the results are devastating. The Fifties proved to be a fertile era for a burgeoning psychological cinema that questioned the everyday tropes that Americans were living their lives by but were beginning to reject; with pointed images of a community formed to celebrate an individual's despair, Wilder evokes feelings in his audience that are consistent with a jaded post-world war worldview and which, with his prescient subject matter, continue to resonate today.",

Well, this is a total non-sense ... it's Americana pantheon from start to finish. Loosely based on the Floyd Collins entrapment, back in 1925, also known as America's 'first true media spectacle' ... and believe me, it couldn't have happened anywhere but in the US of A. The monstrous drawbacks of America's culture. Walt Disney taught us that life can be made to look pretty ... Ace In The Hole will teach you that life just isn't as pretty as we paint; eventually some self-serving creeps will step in devising a variety of schemes which will allow them to explore and profit from the suffering of others.Secondly; some reviews concerning this film level it with Dogville, accusing Billy Wilder of shamefully dangling explicit misanthropy and nakedly exercising his America-hating. Such finger-pointing, as much as I disagree with it, can easily stick on that scornful and grumpy has-never-been-in-the-USA Danish (aka The Wicked Witch of the Northeast), Lars Von Trier ... but will never hold if hurled at Billy Wilder. With this film, Wilder aims his fire basically at the American media and its innate tendency of turning personal dramas into a freak show in order to maximize profits. Nowadays, the hysteria is not so widely used by serious newspapers and TV news broadcasting ... unless our President decides to invade another country. Kirk Douglas is perfect and you'll finish the film felling total contempt towards the character he enacted.

It's an unflinching, cynical look at journalism and the power of the press, and how it can be manipulated by a single reporter to serve his own agenda. It's dark, ferocious, and vintage Wilder all the way. It is reported that Wilder considers this film as his greatest work of cinema.Kirk Douglas gives a fine performance as sensationalist New York reporter Chuck Tatum, who while working for a small Albuquerque, NM newspaper uncovers the story of Leo Minosa, owner of a trading post who is trapped inside a cave, and the efforts to rescue him. Tatum, who's been looking for the story to get his career back on track, seizes the opportunity and turns the whole thing into a three-ring media circus.Kirk Douglas was at the pinnacle of his career and it shows, he has more than enough grit ,and tough-guy bravura to go around. Kirk Douglas had one of his finest moments in the movies with his Chuck Tatum character. He knew exactly what the public wanted and he gives it to them. Jan Sterling, who plays Lorraine, matches Mr. Douglas all the way. She is excellent.Charles Lang's cinematography captures in vivid detail the carnival atmosphere that is at the center of the film. His camera angles enhance the film tremendously. Hugo Friedhofer provided the musical score that blended perfectly with the action. Arthur Schmidt editing works well. Ultimately this was a Billy Wilder film that will stay in the viewer's memory for quite a long time. 8/10",

A society become paradigm of a world gazing at success' mirror. Billy Wilder was so predictive as he didn't run into critics favors because of his brazen exhibition of a herald falsification realm: that is journalism.It's journalist Charles Tatum's arrogant face that fills up black- and-white scenes of this sublime tableau Billy Wilder sketched out in 1951. He puts in the foreground the black soul of a reporter dumped from all the American biggest newspapers, expelled for his deviances (he's a conman, a drinker, and a playboy), and forced to beg for a job in a suburban newspaper in Albuquerque.A proud man who has known footlights and now doesn't accept to remain in the backstage; a man longing for a payback that takes on revenge's violent connotations and it makes Wilder's Chuck Tatum one of the meanest characters of the cinema history: an overbearing, selfish, ruthless man. He is a journalist who knows how to profit by chance \u2013 e.g. Indians' graves looter Leo Mimosa trapped inside the cave \u2013 and how to turn it into his personal opportunity to come back in the Press circle, under spotlights of the whole world.As a handy poker player, Tatum pulls out the ace in the hole: the case becomes a story, the story becomes a scoop, the scoop becomes a hit. And he is the factotum of the game, the fire-eater calling the shots of the show he sets up with an arriviste sheriff and a dissatisfied woman (Leo's wife) in the arid dusty Escudero. So, where there was nothing but a wretched lodging in the center of nothing now there is a crowded carnival, and from every quarter it comes people to attend Leo Mimosa's rescue; Tatum surreptitiously protracts this intervention in order to boost a story on which he had imprinted his brand name.Hugo Friedhofer's grave soundtrack sharpens the echo of overwhelming oppression used upon everybody by the reporter till to crush Leo's wife (Jan Starling) not to run away and to trap her in his bogus gimmick (but she will injure him not far from the tragic epilogue). In fact, his plan screws up because Leo (Richard Benedict) starts suffering from pneumonia under the landslide. The hole puncher try to get to him while time flies out (and his life does the same). The man who had to be saved is dead: \"Leo Mimosa is dead\", Chuck Tatum shouts out from the top of the mountain: he cries out to the public gathered down in the dusty plains and to the journalists arrived from all over the Nation to take notes on the story. And he also makes the cry roaring inside himself as though he can atone for his petty plan.But it's too late: tragedy's completed. And Tatum's alcohol-deformed face fills up the last shot: he lies down on the Albuquerque newspaper's newsroom pavement becoming the dark side of the show. He stands for the emotional desert of a show created at all costs. He stands for a society dazzled by evanescent things, a society eager to chase the twinkling excess and unable to recognize the goodness of truth.",

            "content": "Twenty years before the phrase 'media-circus' found its way into the lexicon, Billy Wilder envisaged a literal one while relating the story of a conniving reporter who attempts to turn invisible spectacle of a spelunker trapped in a cave, into the scoop of his life. Charles Tatum (Kirk Douglas, at his most powerful and hypnotic) is an unrepentant, sneering, quick-witted reporter whose weakness for liquor has washed up all but the lowest of job prospects. Relieved from his elevated post, he finds himself writing for a podunk daily in Albuquerque, all the timing hungry for a scandal or a tragedy that could turn into his big break. Enroute to one of his tabloid stories, he follows police sirens moving towards a hubbub at the nearby cliff, where a man has been trapped under a cave-in. Tatum knows a scoop when he sniffs one and he realizes he has finally found his ticket back to the big leagues. He sees a human interest story in the situation that he can profile to his needs, even if that means fabricating details. He paints the mountain as a haunted attraction and the man's icy, bottle-blonde love (Jan Sterling) as a virtuous wife. His reports soon become a national media sensation, drawing huge crowds to the scene - thrill seekers, media hounds, hucksters and profiteers descend on the scene in a frenzy of crass curiosity, turning the site into a gaudy carnival. The literal media circus that ensues turns Tatum into a star - he contrives to delay the man's rescue, milk the public's lust for spectacle, and auctions himself off to editors - but it comes at the expense of his integrity, even as the victim quietly faces death.Over 60 years later, Ace in the Hole has lost none of its sharpness. As a diatribe against all that is worst in human nature, it is dipped in pure vitriol. It's as dirty a noir as ever there was. Its world is fallen and irredeemable; its people are impotent ideologues; and concepts of faith and love are childish lies. It's the most cynical, uncompromising work from Billy Wilder - a searing indictment that is clairvoyant in the manner in which it mirrors our fascination with cheap sensationalism and shallow journalistic practices. The only thing that's hard to believe about the movie is that Wilder and his co-screenwriters could have been this far ahead of the curve in their criticism of the media.Ace in the Hole is like a punch in the gut, a kick in the nuts, a bucket of bile flung in the face. Bitter to the end, Ace in the Hole nearly suffocates you on its cynicism. But this is one time you will enjoy being breathless!",

            "content": "Billy Wilder's Ace in the Hole (1951) went into production immediately following Wilder's biggest success, his Oscar-winning box office hit Sunset Boulevard (1950), which is now considered a classic. As a result, Wilder was given unprecedented creative control, serving as one of the film's writers, its director and the producer. He was also granted a percentage of its expected profits which, when the film proved not to be a success (even after its re-released as The Big Carnival), never materialized.The story revolves around Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas) an inmoral reporter who decides to exploit the story of a man, named Leo (Richard Benedict), who is trapped inside a cave; Chuck creates this whole sensationalist narrative in order to regain his past glory as a big city reporter. Ace in The Hole's plot was inspired by two real-life events. Cave explorer W. Floyd Collins was trapped in a cave in 1925, and a three-year-old girl, Kathy Fiscus fell into an abandoned well in 1949. Just like in the film, the victims became media sensations and died before they could've been rescued.Ace in the Hole is a Film Noir that contains many parallels to its predecessor Sunset Boulevard. For example: both Kirk Douglas' Chuck Tatum and William Holden's Joe Gillis start their stories without a functioning car, being both crippled and defiant men (both have no car, to be carless is a visual metaphor of being emasculated); Chuck Tatum and Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond, are both past glories desperate to revive their careers by any means necessary; they also refuse to settle for any less than absolute glory; and finally, Chuck and Norma both manipulate situations in order to create false narratives and accomplish their goals (but their inmoral decisions will condemn them in the end).It's important to understand that in both Sunset Boulevard and Ace in the Hole we're presented with Wilder's vision on American corruption. Now let's look at the differences between both films so we can clarify what makes Ace in the Hole stand out. First, Ideally journalism is supposed to be factual (contrary to the medium depicted in Sunset Boulevard), but just as the main character diminishes the framed quote \"Tell The Truth\", we get the naiveness of this ideal being of common practice. And in second hand, contrary to Sunset Boulevard is the presence of the audience, the crowd gathering outside the cave, homogeneously representing American Society. In an essay for the Criterion Collection, Molly Haskell wrote \"(Wilder) plants his finger firmly and prophetically on the pulse of the new excitement, an addiction to the breaking story that television would create and feed to a nation of adrenaline junkies.\" Haskell is referring to post-war American citizens, self indulging in this kind of manufactured sensationalist stories of \"human interest\" not because they care but rather cause they need to (they even capitalize on the accident with empty attractions). The American Society in this film is not just part of the problem but a problem on itself, they're egomaniac cynics.Cynicism is a natural element of Film Noir, but this film's collective and unpunished cynicism repulsed 1951 movie audiences to the point they even made Paramount lost a fortune. Writer/director Billy Wilder later admitted that it had a negative impact on his career... while also citing it as one of the best films he ever made.Source:\nMolly Haskell's Essay about Ace in the Hole, the Criterion Collection.",

It's the old story, repeated again in \"Network\" (1976), about the tendency of a corrupt media to manipulate people's perceptions of events. Made less than a decade after the fall of Hitler, the film's anti-hero is a genius at creating a mass mentality.Tatum is thoroughly unlikeable. He's cocky, arrogant, ruthless, and greedy. Yet he's good at exploiting situations. He's an opportunist. My problem with this film is the lack of subtlety in Douglas' performance. The script's dialogue helps not at all. Tatum is an in-your-face villain, almost from the get-go. Further, the Tatum character completely overwhelms the story. All other characters, including the trapped man, revolve around Tatum. They exist to further the Tatum character study.This is a very cynical film. There's not more than two or three humane characters in the entire script. Even law and order characters are corrupt. The general public is portrayed rightly as easily manipulated, morbidly curious, and excruciatingly glib.B&W visuals emphasize the negative aspects of humanity, as people descend like vultures to the rescue site that gradually morphs into a literal circus. The labyrinthine cave, a set that is poorly constructed, is a kind of metaphor for Tatum, as he digs himself deeper and deeper into a thematic hole.There's very little nobility or sense of humanity here, and not an ounce of humor. \"Ace In The Hole\" is clearly a message film, one that stresses a deceitful press and a gullible public.It's a message that needs to be repeated, apparently for each new generation of viewers. But I think I would have appreciated this particular film more if the story had played down the Tatum character a bit, and if someone other than Kirk Douglas had been cast in that role.",

It's like a punch in the face, it shows all the rudeness and ugliness of the life behind the billboard. As long as \"American Beauty\" shows the stagnating waters of the rich upper middle class, this is about the road to that calm suburbs home. It's about (at that time) growth of the spirit of good presentation and about having the nerve to ask for what you want without caring if you have the means of supporting your claims or on how many bodies you will have to step over. It's about having respect for nothing be it God (the woman praying) or a plain human (the Ace in the Hole). It's about the uselessness of having an education as long as you bring results. Personal improvements mean nothing if there is no profit tag attached. And even if you do go to school, there must be about something practical, about something recent as anything beyond your birth date is down right irrelevant. Sure, that reference to the real case which this story is based upon also points to the reality of this story, but also to the hollow image of the schooling system. And on these theme there will be another great story - Blackboard Jungle - in just about four years. It's about making the school (the last bastion of knowledge) as shallow and money oriented as the rest of the society. The \"it has always been like this\" of the 21st century was back in 1951 the shock of \"how did we get so far?\".Also you have preeminently figured the cigarettes. You can smoke everywhere, and both good guys and bad guys do it. Now alcohol is a different story, only the bad guys do it and only when they are really bad.Bottom line, this movie makes useless feeble attempts to recreate the story along a milder story line. I'd take Costa-Gavras' Mad City for example. It might look like a good try for those who did not see Ace in the Hole. Bored, shallow, badly acted (at least for what's expected from the Mad City cast), this movie does not have the guts to point out the finger at the audience.

In desperation, the studio tried to rename the movie \"The Big Carnival.\" Were they trying to trick the audience to going to a happy, \"Greatest Show on Earth\"-type movie? Or were they just taken over by Billy Wilder's trademark cynicism? It doesn't even matter; the movie was still a flop. Lost forever and never released on VHS or DVD in America until July 2007, Ace in the Hole, along with Vertigo and just about any Nicholas Ray movie, gathered a cult following and proved that time was all it needed to be recognized as the masterpiece it always was.Kirk Douglas is hard-shelled reporter Chuck Tatum, fired from just about every big newspaper. Hoping to rebuild his reputation, he grudgingly takes a job at a small newspaper in Albuquerque, where nothing really happens...until a man gets trapped in a mine. Using his wit and cunning, Tatum takes this small-town emergency and transforms it into a media circus before the word was even coined. Part of his strategy includes manipulating the corrupt sheriff into delaying the rescue, which gives the story time to reach all over the country and become a media sensation, a la Baby Jessica, the real-life human interest story of the late 80s. And then, everything goes horribly, horribly wrong.Billy Wilder, as noted above, was well-known for two things: for crafting as many classic movies as Spielberg, Ford, Scorsese, Hawks and Bergman, and his wit and undeniable cynicism. After his classic Sunset Blvd., a scathing tragedy disguised as a black comedy about the Hollywood machine, it didn't seem like Wilder could get any more cynical. That was proved wrong by this movie. Chuck Tatum makes Norma Desmond look like Mary Poppins--throughout the course of the movie, he never grows a heart, and his only mild redemption is realizing that the man's wife is even more acerbic than he is, and through her seeing the empty human being he himself has become. Like all dark Billy Wilder movies, there is absolutely no hope or shining light at the end of his characters' tunnels. All paths lead to death, madness or both. Ace in the Hole is absolutely no exception, and it's for that deep cynicism and pessimism that makes this movie so endearing, so timeless, so contemporary.",

The supporting cast was decent, and there were some nice shots and an impressive production design to the film.Billy Wilder's direction was excellent as usual, but what to me was rather underwhelming was that the writing suffered from a rather uninteresting plot, and I did not even feel it justified the 110 minute length.Only recommended for Wilder fans like myself and not for those who are merely infatuated by the unusually high IMDb score.",

This theme has been emulated many times (most recently in 1997's lackluster \"Mad City\"), and probably never quite as well. Wilder said everything that needed to be said about the topic as early as 1951. It is absolutely criminal that this film has NEVER been made available in any home video format.",

            "review_title": "'Ace in the Hole': Fogotten Materpiece Far Ahead of its Time",
            "content": "When I profiled Billy Wilder in 1984 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of \"Some Like it Hot,\" not only interviewing him but serving as the host of a live \"an evening with\" question and answer stage presentation, he surprisingly turned the subject at one point to his 1951 film, \"Ace in the Hole,\" and the plagiarism lawsuit it engendered. He was still smarting nearly a quarter of a century later, as well he should, and was eager to talk about it and set the record straight. Now, all these years after his remarks to me, I can fully grasp how very far ahead of its time \"Ace in the Hole\" indeed was, both in its subject matter _ still incredibly timely in its depiction of an unscrupulous newsman and the public's insatiable appetite for news and anything remotely resembling it _ as well as in the legalities surrounding this harbinger of what we now call \"social media.\" The film was inspired by two real-life events, a 1925 incident in which a man named W. Floyd Collins was trapped inside a landslide in Sand Cave, Kentucky, and a 1949 incident in which a three-year-old girl named Kathy Fiscus fell into an abandoned well in San Marino, California. In both cases, the victims died and in both instances the tragedies had turned into media sensations (reporter William Burke won the Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Kentucky story). After the movie's release, Wilder, who co-wrote the screenplay as well as directed and produced the film, was sued for plagiarism by actor and aspiring screenwriter Victor Desny, who claimed he had contacted Wilder's secretary, Rosella Stewart, to propose a film based on on the Collins story. Wilder's lawyers protested that this verbal summary did not make it a formal story submission and that the Collins story was historical and not governed by copyright laws. In 1953, a judge ruled in favor of Wilder and Paramount, the distributor of the film, but in 1956 the California State Supreme Court overturned that decision, saying the oral submission had been legitimate. Wilder settled, paying roughly $15,000. The case set a precedent, as Wilder pointed out to me, and is a large part of the reason writer, producers, studios and others are so careful about speaking to anyone or receiving correspondence about \"new\" ideas nowadays. It's important to underscore Wilder still insisted plagiarism had not been involved. As for the film itself, a fictitious down on his luck New York reporter (played by Kirk Douglas) banished to an inconsequential newspaper in New Mexico stumbles into a nearby cave-in where a man is trapped and sees the opportunity to get back in the big time by milking the incident for all it's worth, to the point of conspiring to slow the rescue effort. Along the way he has an affair with the victim's wife, beautifully played by Jan Sterling, who is in on the deal. \"Ace in the Hole,\" not surprisingly, was savaged by much of the self-righteous press of the day. No doubt this had much to do with its failure at the box office (the film's final cost was $1,821,052, its box office $1.3 million). It was Wilder's first critical and commercial failure. It was also the first filming which he served as writer, producer and director _ as well as his first film after his breakup with writing partner Charles Brackett, who by the way, took along the duo's more experienced secretary who might have fared better in answering Victor Desny's fateful lawsuit-inducing phone call. Now, in retrospect, many consider this as arguably Wilder's finest work, and certainly his bravest (see Orson Welles and \"Citizen Kane\"). Be aware that a misguided studio pooh-bah at one point renamed \"Ace in the Hole\" as \"The Big Carnival\" without Wilder's knowledge or consent, and that copies of the film may be floating around under that title. No matter what it's called now, it's well worth tracking down and watching, a marvel in virtually every aspect, from writing to performances to its documentary style. The film could have been made yesterday _ that is, if any filmmaker could match Wilder's remarkable talent, and unwavering courage.",

            "content": "Coming off his critically and commercially successful appraisals of the film industry with Sunset Blvd., director, co-producer and co-screenwriter Billy Wilder turned his cynical eye towards the electronic and print media of the times and found it wanting. His response was to seek a collaboration with A-Lister Kirk Douglas and produce a scathing indictment about media-complicity in subjectively creating news, rather than objectively reporting it. Ace in the Hole is the result and even now, almost 70 years later, in a world characterised by global news corporations capable of wielding immense political and economic power, as well as social and cultural influence, the film's anger and misanthropy, resonates with powerful realism.Douglas plays Chuck Tatum a self-absorbed career journalist who finds himself literally begging for work from a small-town newspaper in New Mexico, after being fired from a succession of big city newspapers back east. A year on, the seemingly permanently embittered Tatum in covering a story about a trapped mining prospector named Leo, sees his chance to make it back to the big time. He manipulates the corrupt local sheriff and chief emergency coordinator, into delaying the rescue efforts with the promise of luring tourists and the general public into being on hand to ironically add human colour to a life and death rescue story. He succeeds in whipping up a media frenzy, whilst positioning himself as the legally sole reporter of the event, which escalates literally into a huge media carnival. (Early in the film's release, it was renamed by the studio, as The Big Carnival).Perhaps unsurprisingly Ace in the Hole turned out to be Wilders first mainstream critical and commercial failure, with many contemporary newspaper critics of the time railing unmercifully against the film's bleak narrative. But over time commentators have collectively come to reassess that outlook, instead finding much to admire in the movie. For me, Douglas's portrayal, whether directed or otherwise is too hammy and theatrical, especially in the first and third acts. His performance is accompanied by way too many unrealistic, self-aggrandising soliloquies. It's only in his character's quieter moments towards the final stages of the story, when Tatum realises how much his over-reaching is going to cost Leo and his own personal integrity, that Douglas's acting really strikes a nerve. But the film is saved by many of the fascinating support characters, such as the venally self-serving wife and sheriff, to the non-stereotypical patient and ethical local news editor Jacob Boot and the trapped, fatalistic, suffering prospector Leo, played by a very convincing Richard Benedict.Ace in the Hole's anger lingers far beyond the story's end, reverberating still strongly among 21st century news and media spin cycles and stunts. That alone makes it worthy of the serious movie-watcher's attention.",

Why does it take the Koreans to produce the only (as far as I'm aware) means of buying it? I've never, ever seen it on TV and could hardly have seen it when it came out as I'd have been minus 15 years old!That's the rant over (justified!) and here's to a classic Kirk Douglas and Wilder collaboration. As with his 'The Fortune Cookie', Billy really lays on the spot-on satire about the greed of modern America. And how apt that still is today, with newspaper's hacking mobile phones etc.Douglas is a not-so-young journalist of the thuggish kind who just keeps the wrong side of being a \"louse\". Having lost all credibility in big- time New York, he begs and weedles his way into getting a job on a small-time local rag in the desert. Soon, he has found his gold-digging honeypot of a story - a married man who's fallen down a crevice in some caves that are a shrine to Native Americans.Instead of just getting the poor man out, he calculates and hatches a plan to elongate the man's agony by padding out the rescue but hyping up the story by any means possible. Enter the man's wife, played by a superbly calculating and common Jan Sterling. Soon, the diner that the couple hardly ever had a customer at is turning over big bucks, due to folks flocking in to see the rescue, after Chuck Tatum (Douglas) gets a picture and exclusive on the front page of his grateful paper.Within days, there's a fairground and even a song written specially for the poor fellow still below ground. Entrance to the site has risen from 25c to a dollar. Lorraine (Sterling) sees her way out of a miserable life and it's obvious that she wants to be hooked up with and taken to NY by Tatum, with all that money they've dubiously earned.You can probably see where this is going, though the result, maybe not. The film resonates of the Chilean miner incident not so long ago. There's powerful acting, specially from Douglas and Sterling and superb black & white photography.

            "content": "\"Ace in the hole\" (1951) directed by Billy Wilder as movie it is always a tale concerning fake evaluation, that still explains no accomplished rights of survivors dying slowly from a catastrophe that occurs daily in the world like that. And what makes any people angry, when things are going badly and aren't immediately under prevention - before it might have happened - even then when a sensationalist survey for the good it is hysterical and whatsoever is already too late to secure the labor activity. Perhaps barely much more inevitably and a quite hypocritical still, because delaying its unbelievable truth that is also responsible for an inner circle and so that produces a bitter consciousness concerning the social value of every life in danger. Wilder here in this fiction of strength and passionate feelings, gave us almost one of his most interesting movies of the fifties about social values, when economic standards weren't under regular check up by innovation and responsibility from the owners of the wealthy underground. This spectacle in meantime at open air, view from the entirely social landscape around the horizon, it is of great angriness and despair if you understood what it was at stake here, as inhuman conception of such a sensationalism in the press like a fairly day of payment in a given mine from the beginning of the colonization. Seemingly, director Wilder as Austrian of gem put some irresponsible carnival as being his own style of making a portrait of the collective stupidity, in a time where others were searched by another motivation than greed and cupidity either that it were such as mere items. The cars driven around as in a kind of a caravan's race, going away from the place of all dangers, for the deaths as in the time of Indians, it is as scene showing us there as in an ambulant circus the speed of their drivers, after the news boom was finished for the bad. If it is the truth, it is too with a flavor of ashes of the dust covering the landscape sharply. Possibly getting out any adversity against this kind of running away, for confounding country people about the aim of this speculative event of a retainment of a death, for nothing more than selling its result surely not on the front page of the sensationalist paper. Faith, speculation, business, promotion, all linked with such a happening in a cavern near the frontier of desert, when a man is imprisoned there by the legs and his wife and parents or relatives seemingly entering in such affair for earning something else with this fatality for the communication at the scale of the entirely country, making a deal to sustain the attention of all people hearing the direct broadcast of this epiphenomena of disproportionated size as diversion for keeping in touch with mediocrity for learning nothing than cynicism and hypocrisy. Wilder in his plot gave us the devolution of such a black hole of tiny and reduced importance in news as social panic, for revealing the nature of anyone before the chance of improvisation and bad instincts for social help on the spot of confusion, all that for earning money to increase the prosperity of a few characters there at expense of a victim of popular mind and crazy conscience.",

Kirk Douglas is quite an expert in playing a selfish and manipulative person, much like his film producer role in The Bad and the Beautiful. I am wondering if his these kinds of roles have great influence on his son Michael Douglas' Oscar winning role in Wall Street. The wife of the trapped person was played by Jan Sterling. She was fantastic, especially those tension moments in the scenes between her Kirk Douglas. That slapping scene was top notch in the change of facial expression from admiration to shock.I say the utmost credit has to go to the screen writing. Billy Wilder really can write slick quotes. When the role Jan Sterling was about to abandon her miserable life instead of taking advantage of her husband's disaster, Kirk Douglas' role said something like \"When they bleached your hair, they must have bleached your brain too\" It is amazing that a great movie like this one never appeared in any video medium until the Criterion DVD release.

            "content": "This film works both as film noir and melodrama, whilst cut through with some nice lines in spiky wit. It does however still require strong central performances to make it work, and whilst Kirk Douglas may not be my favourite actor, his performance as the lethally cynical journalist is very good. Yet Jan Sterling who plays the wife of a man who is trapped in a cave, does steal the acting honours. She has a difficult and seemingly unsympathetic role. One which makes you care about someone who couldn't care less about the plight of her husband. The story which involves the trapped man being made to stay trapped, in order to allow the journalist to get a better story, is made for Billy Wilder to direct. He exposes the cynicism of the journalist and then a crooked sheriff who allows the man to stay trapped for political gain. Billy wilder makes it seem effortless in turning a potentially cold movie into a film where wit is allowed to offer a break from the overall cynicism.The film is not without flaws, but they are minor ones, and for some might not be seen as such. Melodrama for example is not to everyone's taste, and it does veer too much towards it at times. Kirk Douglas acting does perhaps strain too much towards it as well. I didn't find it off-putting, as I sometimes do with Kirk Douglas, because overall his acting style is suited to the story.The cinematography is very crisp and clean, and gives the film a freshness that belies the fact it was made in 1951. The film's take also seems fresh. The cynicism of journalistic methods today, may not be as overt as in the film, but your are constantly reminded of the hacking scandal and the way the paparazzi operate today. The last scene of Kirk Douglas falling towards the film camera in the moment of his death, is a justifiably famous one, and comes at the culmination of a terrifically tense sequence. This film also does some nicely nasty detail in the way that even the man trapped in the cave is not entirely innocent. He is in the cave basically too loot an old Indian spiritual site, so he can sell the recovered artifacts at his roadside diner. It's the way all the characters seem to be compromised by their desire for money or fame that suggest that Wilder was attacking capitalism, rather than just the characters themselves.",

He was by than, i feel, immersed in several issues, some concerning his in satisfaction regarding life and cinema industry in America, and others concerning his exploitation towards noir and its narrative possibilities. My opinion is that Wilder took the original conception of noir to its limits with Sunset Boulevard. So in a away, he ended noir with that film. This one was sort of a reprise, a bonus track, a last breath of the primitive conception of noir.The narrative core here is about writing, as with Sunset Boulevard. We have several entities which are responsible for \"writing\" visually what we see, and fight along the story for being in charge of the facts:.the 'seven vultures', the natives belief. they are responsible, at least we suspect, for the imprisoning of a man, which will motivate the whole 'circus' (or was it pure coincidence? fate?) .Kirk Douglas' character, himself responsible for the report of the whole event, during a good part of the film. He is something of a god as he writes (and invents) everything we get to see. this is interesting because we don't have Douglas as our noir 'detective', someone who is as blind about the events and what's behind them as we usually do in noir constructions. We assume he manipulates everything, even though we suspect he will loose control .The crowd. The circus Douglas called for self-promotion will take over, as a multi-headed monster (or a no-head monster); Douglas allows for this to happen, nevertheless e he lost (emotional) control as he moved along; These three elements alone make our construction. This becomes noir as Douglas becomes victim and not god, and we get to question who is in fact controlling the whole thing. Was it in fact a 'curse' of the Indians, was it something we might call fate (Douglas was running from city to city until ending up in that town with an Indian tomb!). This is not good or influential as the masterpiece Wilder produced the previous year, but it is a good piece. The fact that the detective here becomes a writer and aims at controlling the whole thing hints that those behind this project were aiming at breaking noir and taking it to another level. This wasn't it, it's not an important film, it was even a commercial failure. But it was a good try.My opinion: 4/5",

As Douglas would later accomplish in \"Lust for Life\", he literally oozes emotional complexity, as the characters' would in reality, and in extremely different times and circumstance.Billy Wilder somehow foresaw the pathetic future descent of the media into the prurient, exploitative, tabloid-like image of the present. Some cases in point would be: the O.J. trial,'Baby Jessica' in the well, the Menendez trial, a host of other trials, and the Pretorius trial going on right now, to name just a few. In 1951, this film must have been a sensation, causing outrage and denial in its depiction of the alleged 'media circus' phenomenon. The alternate title, \"The Great Carnival\", would have been even more apt, as it doles out the appropriate sarcasm the events to come on-screen would so richly deserve. I give no further details about the film, here, as previous reviews have done this all too well, already. A landmark film.",

            "content": "If I mention a film-noir setting, where does your mind go? Maybe to a damp alley at night or a detective's office or maybe a police interrogation room. Probably not to the New Mexican dessert. Yet that's exactly where this very dark film-noir is set.A man is trapped in a cave. No problem. A local contractor can have him out in eighteen hours. Unfortunately that rescue gets in the way of other peoples' needs. Instead of a quick rescue a six days-long media circus (and then, later, an actual circus) is staged for maximum effect.The reporter at the center of the story is played by Kirk Douglas in a powerful performance. He's cynical, unethical, unscrupulous and a master manipulator. He was fired from a high-profile newspaper because of his drinking problem, lying and even for having an affair with the wife of one of his bosses. He convinces a local corrupt sheriff to milk an underground rescue attempt to pile up votes for the next election, and together they bully the contractor to delay. Even the wife of the trapped man is a cold remorseless woman. As in most film-noirs, sympathetic characters are rare.This movie comes from Billy Wilder who also gave us, \"Double Indemnity\" and \"Sunset Boulevard.\" This movie is as dark and cynical as its cinematic siblings.At is heart there is a basic meanness, a violence, a grit that makes this movie unforgettable. In its day it failed to find its audience. Today, its statements about the media and about mis-applied ethics are, perhaps, more timely than when this film was released 65 years ago. Take a look!",

You might (just might)\ncompare this to \"Sweet Smell of Success\" with Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis about the brutal world of \"the press.\"\nThe latter film is miles and miles deeper, better acted, and complex than this film with Douglas. As is so often the\ncase with reviewers, the poorer film gets a better rating ... oy vey!ACTING:\nKirk Douglas, as so many of his period's (American) actors, had very narrow character range. Narrow like Mitchum,\nWayne, Tierney, Bacall, etc. (By contrast, American actors like Stewart had better range, but still never reached British\nlevel skills.)The only actor here to show range is \"Porter Hall\" who played \"Mr. Boot.\" Normally, he's a weak, nervous, \"push-over\"\ncharacter, but he rises to a calm, morally balanced, leadership role that provides the moral pivot from which this film operates.TEMPO:\nOK, but it gets rather dull with the music ... not interesting or valuable here.CINEMATOGRAPHY:\nFor the context it was fine, but I got tired of looking at the endless dust. Dust, dust, dust!DIRECTING / WRITING:\nI really like Billy Wilder's writing and directing normally, though he's far more liberal than I like. While he's extremely\ngifted, I thought this was largely a dud. The only thing giving this story / film any draw is Douglas, but he's a tiresome\nactor like Cary Grant ... or as said in the performance car world \"all show, and no go.\" They're not \"bad\" actors,\njust so hyped and shallow.NOTES:\nAs much as I love classics, there are some qualities of American culture during that period which I loathe. Namely,\nthe mistreatment of women, e.g. Slapping them around as if that were a norm (WTF), and of course the rampant\nracism (right, that's changed ... oy vey ...).Is it a very good film? No.Should you watch this once? Maybe.Rating: 7.1.",

            "content": "After watching Ace in the Hole, I can see why Billy Wilder wanted Kirk Douglas for the lead in Stalag 17 two years later. Both leads are thoroughly dislikable anti-heroes, but who are redeemed, barely, in the end. And after watching Douglas' performance here, it is apparent that Stalag 17 was written for him. But Ace in the Hole was not a box office success, so it is understandable that Douglas would not want to reprise both the role, and potentially the results, in his next film. You might say he was a little too successful at being hated. But almost everyone in the film is either dislikable or a bit pathetic, not a very cheerful reflection of humanity. Douglas' performance is absolutely electric; he projects onto the screen with great intensity. When you look at the chronology of his credits, this appears to be his first big leading role. Surely, producers understood his great talent from this performance, even if the public did not. But I guess he did not want to be typecast as a bad guy so early in his career and so passed on Stalag 17, even though William Holden won an Oscar for his performance. Wilder also apparently learned from Ace in the Hole that it was now the Fifties and the days of straight up film noir were over. So he added a large dose of humor to Stalag 17, almost too much, but the result was a big success, pretty amazing for a film about a German prisoner of war camp. As the film opened with Douglas in the Albuquerque newspaper office, I couldn't help but think of Groundhog Day. Douglas' cynical reaction to the sampler on the wall, \"Tell the Truth,\" and the woman's facial expression, reminded me of the scene in the bed and breakfast in Groundhog Day with Bill Murray as the cynical big city weatherman. You might say Groundhog Day was a humorous take on the idea of a big city journalist stuck in a hick town. If the measure of literary or cinematic art is to embody eternal truths, then Ace in the Hole qualifies as true art. I guess just about anyone can see how Ace in the Hole captures the spirit of so much of modern journalism, particularly the 24 hour satellite news overkill coverage of any sort of disaster or event, even on the weather channel. The word processing gear has changed, but the spirit of greed has not.",

His power extends beyond just public opinion but to the whole operation itself. Douglas, despite playing a deeply unsympathetic character(Chuck Tatum), delivers a journalist who you can't help but root for and sometimes admire the lengths he will go to get himself back on top.

            "content": "Ace in the Hole is a mixed bag. The professional reviews are all over the map, for good reason. The film starts out with fifteen or so minutes of totally overblown acting, followed by a middle portion of great movie, closed with another fifteen minutes or so of something closer to the beginning segments.The movie is the story of Chuck Tatum, a big-city reporter run out of numerous journalism jobs for a multitude of reasons - lying, drinking, an in-office affair, etc. He lands in Albuquerque at the local paper begging for a job in the most self-righteous way possible, all with the admitted goal of landing a big story that will reopen the doors of the major papers so that he can escape Albuquerque. When sent on the road to a local rattlesnake affair of no real importance, he stops for gas and stumbles upon a local artifact hunter trapped in an Indian cave after a collapse. Tatum seized the moment and makes it his story. He colludes with the local authorities to ensure that the story becomes a drawn-out, larger-than-life affair of one man's struggle to survive. The longer the charade lasts, the greater the public interest, the greater the profits, and the more severe the moral compromises.The film is more interesting as a historical artifact that portrayed a societal condition that unquestionably became (even more) true than as a piece of cinema. It's a dark social satire of society's tendency to glom onto tragedy as spectacle and the news media's complicity in the entire affair. Bad news sells, and more bad news sells more. The recent incident of the Thai soccer team trapped in a cave - which captured global attention with the rescue effort - is an eerily similar variation on plot in the movie.Ace in the Hole excels in its vicious satire of society, quite literally demonstrating the circus people erect as they gleefully observe others' tragedies. As a movie, though, it's very on-the-nose, often with acting to match. Certainly worth a watch, but approach more from its place in time rather than as a timeless film.",

            "content": "The word cynical has been used to describe virtually all of Billy Wilder's movies, but in the case of ACE IN THE HOLE, a more appropriate adjective might be corrosive. The writing here is just as pungent as any other script of his, but it's got a sour taste, as if Wilder has lost faith in the better angels of our nature. In SUNSET BLVD, he explored the dark side of Hollywood, but with ACE IN THE HOLE, he tackles not only the fourth estate but a gullible public that eagerly laps up what passes for news.Wilder based his film on the real-life saga of Floyd Collins, a Kentucky man who, in 1925, was trapped in a cave following a landslide. A Louisville reporter covering the story dispatched article after article to a nation gripped by what happened, ultimately winning a Pulitzer Prize. Whether that newspaperman inspired Wilder's antihero Chuck Tatum is not certain, but the director used his fictional character to illustrate how people can be manipulated towards our worst tendencies.Chuck Tatum is a disgraced reporter looking to rejuvenate his career after being employed by -and fired from- no less than half a dozen newspapers. I don't use the word redeem because Tatum is not a man with redeemable qualities....nor is he looking for any redemption. Not being the Woodward or Bernstein type, he's more occupied with sensationalistic human interest stories that will boost circulation. But he's burned so many bridges that he's been practically exiled to New Mexico. Whether he was intending to pass through or not, car trouble and meager funds force him to settle down there.Making his way to the Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin, a small-time paper, Tatum offers his services to the editor and founder, a Mr Boot, at a bargain rate. As he tells him, \"I'm a $250 a week newspaperman, Mr Boot. You can have me for $50\". Boot is an old-fashioned newsman who believes that integrity -something anathema to Tatum- is a virtue essential to journalism. Someone like William Randolph Hearst would stick in his craw. Nevertheless, Tatum takes the job, and whiles away his stretch in what he refers to as a sunbaked Siberia, dreaming of the scoop that will take him back to the big time.The opportunity arrives almost a year later when covering a rattlesnake hunt, he stumbles upon Leo Minosa, a man trapped under a cave-in while retrieving Native American artifacts.",

            "content": "There has probably never been a movie from a major director quite like Ace in the Hole. It is a movie of almost unrelenting bleakness and cynicism, lightened only slightly at its outermost margins. It also not only stands up well more than 50 years later, it has a freshness and relevance that comes from an almost uncannily eerie spot on prediction about the future of the role of media in our culture. Wilder notably responded to the initial negative reaction to the film by noting that he did not think he made in cynical enough. In a time of wall-to-wall media coverage of the parentage of Anna Nicole Smith's baby, breathless television commentary on the suit Kobe Bryant wore to a hearing on his rape case or a prosecutor's hairstyle, crowds of gawkers outside of a mine disaster, Ace in the Hole plays with a more harshly realistic light now than it probably did on its initial release.Kirk Douglas gives a tremendous, fearless performance as Chuck Tatum, a newspaper reporter who has fallen off the face of the journalistic globe and who smells the chance to regain his fortune when he stumbles on the story of Leo Minosa, trapped in an old Indian cliff dwelling. Tatum immediately recognizes that he can remake his name on Leo's story, if he can stretch the coverage out long enough. With the connivance of the fame-hungry local sheriff (despicably well played by Ray Teal), Tatum deliberately delays the rescue in order to maximize the story.I have never seen Douglas give a performance quite like this, or in a role like this. In fact, there may not be another role like this in that era. Tatum is almost uncompromisingly nasty and self-serving to everyone; his boss, his coworker, Leo's slatternly wife, and Leo himself. Douglas the movie star disappears completely in this film. It is a masterful performance; any clue that we are watching Kirk Douglas acting would tear the film down.Also wonderful is Jan Sterling as Leo's femme fatale (literally) wife, whose reaction, at first, is that Leo's predicament gives her a head start on leaving him. Later, Tatum convinces her that she can make scads of money of her husband, which she does with tremendous malice - the price to visit the cliff dwelling goes from free to one dollar quite rapidly. Sterling brings a great balance of sexiness and ruthlessness to her role.But the goat of this movie is not just two or three heartless people, it is all of us. As in Frank Cady (Sam Drucker in Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies and Petticoat Junction) who, with his wife, is proudly and fiercely the first of the throng that encamps at the cliff dwelling, and who is not above using his status for his own personal gain; he turns an interview into an advertisement for his insurance business. Leo's predicament draws a huge crowd, including a literal carnival, and other people who are looking to cash in on Leo, most notably a country band hawking the sheet music to their song, \"We're Coming Leo.\" Wilder handles all of this material with his usual straightforward aplomb. Wilder is not one for shots that call attention to themselves, and the unpretentious nature of his direction serves the starkness of the story well. Likewise the script is full of the bitter wit and great lines that grace any Wilder film.But the film has one major failure, and that is the end. Tatum, it turns out, at least belatedly has a heart and isn't the most cynical person in the film, and we get an unnecessary and unlikely attempted murder, a stabbing, comeuppance for the bad guy - all of which seems tacked on and diminishes the film. To me the real end of the movie comes a few minutes earlier, when Tatum announces that Leo had died, and the carnival closes down, the crowds leave and even as the dust begins to settle, we see a long shot of the solitary figure of Leo's lame father, slowly hobbling back to the mountain that still holds the body of his son. That is an unforgettable shot. That ending, with Tatum essentially unredeemed and alive, would serve the movie much better.Still, this bitter, cynical and well-made movie is a great gem, and a fine addition to Wilder's brilliant oeuvre",

He's egotistical, unapologetic, and seemingly heartless. This is not the Kirk Douglas I've always envisioned, and he really gets a chance to become a completely different person is this film. You almost completely hate him, until you realize that he's ultimately a self-destructive lunatic, which, in a strange way, makes the character more sympathetic.The supporting cast is very good here, and every scene \"pops\" with intensity and unpredictability, thanks to quick, snappy dialogue and editing.

For one, its summary reminded me a lot of the Simpsons' episode Radio Bart (1992) where Bart fools the town into thinking a child named Timmy has fallen down a well. Some other similar (but more dramatic) connections are: the but-at-what-cost opportunism from films like The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), as well as the hot news story making an explosive impact like in The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990).The setup is very good, but I feel this movie particularly shines in its third act, when time and options are running out for the rescue.",

            "review_title": "Belt and braces",
            "content": "This review was written of a screening at Cambridge Film Festival (UK) - 15 to 25 September 2011* Contains spoilers *Billy Wilder co-wrote the film, so it seemed well deserved to think of reviving Ace in the Hole, not just as part of a theme of journalism in film. As to the pairing with the short (not so short) Wakefield Express about a newspaper of that name (and its production and that of four sister papers), I am less sure, and think that I would have preferred to go, without an introduction, straight to Kirk Douglas, as Chuck Tatum, talking his way into a job in Albuquerque.(If the short had been screened second, there would have been a risk that that some might (I would) have left after the feature (but so be it), and, although I accept that accompanying films were part of the fabric of how films were shown even in my childhood, that is not a usual way with revivals.) Chuck has been there a year when we see him next, and I failed to notice that now he has 'gone native' by adopting the local habit of wearing braces on his trousers, but also a belt. Everybody knows him, everybody knows his rants about the stultifying nature of small-town news. (Garrison Keillor may have seen this film: his narrator in Love Me reminds me of it, now that I \u2013 have a chance to \u2013 reflect.) Rattle-snakes aren't Chuck's thing, unlike the sheriff where he ends up, but he is dispatched to a gathering in their honour: he does not get to the destination, but we have a flavour of it through the Sheriff Kretzer's specimen (and its tastes in food), because he sees the meat in a news story of Leo Minosa, a man trapped underground, trapped because (since Leo interprets being imprisoned as punishment) he went there to plunder a native American burial-ground yet another time.Leo trusts the journalist who pushed past authority to get to him, and believes that he is trying to get him out quickly, rather than realizing that Chuck is spinning out the story as part of a plan to get back into a job in New York (or Chicago). The plan works, but the curse is that the delay has brought about Leo's inevitable death \u2013 by then, Chuck, sure of himself, has already taken off his braces, thereby transporting us to the proprietor's office and his mockery of such means of playing it safe.So, as the imagery has told us, Chuck has started playing without a safety-net, and, when he could seek assistance for himself, he delays \u2013 again, the theme of putting something off \u2013 too long, because he feels obligated to see that Leo is given the final rites. Still not tending to his needs, and, after both dismissing the crowd that has gathered in the preceding days and having failed to interest his New York boss in the story of his betrayal, Chuck goes back to Albuquerque with that story.He had played the newspaper bosses off against each other to get what he wanted, but his self-destructive self stakes everything on a closing story behind the final one: having seemed unable to announce Leo's death to the world as 'a scoop', he has declaimed the matter in public and told everyone to go, a scene perhaps reminiscent of Christ clearing the Temple (but, here, the idolatrous temple of his own making, and one that contains a body to prove it).Not for the most pure of motives, he has resisted the advances of Leo's wife Lorraine (with the suitable bewitchment of Jan Sterling), who really just wants something better than Leo, his family, and the run-down desert caf\u00e9 that they run. She only did not leave earlier (as she does afterwards) because she, too, believes in Chuck's persuasive rhetoric, but she does not want to have to play the grieving wife to help the rescue story. Misjudging it, Chuck pushes it too far, too far beyond what is safe, by trying to force Lorraine back into her role, because it is his role, not hers.In the final analysis, he staked too highly. In spotting and creating a dramatic story, in exploiting (as he says in relation to the sheriff's snake festival and the card-game there that Chuck forced him to miss), he thought that he had, in Leo, an ace in the hole, not a pair of deuces.With whom (or what), then, has Chuck been playing poker that his seemingly winning hand has collapsed, and been shown for what it is? Is he really a tragic hero, and is that what made Ace in the Hole, for all that it is well written, something that also did not make the film itself a winner with an audience that does not seek that sort of ending?",

Winding up in New Mexico, Tatum gets work from the local newspaper, but finds that there's not much in the way of pressing news. However, when Tatum catches wind of a treasure hunter (Richard Benedict) trapped in a mineshaft, he turns the story into a media sensation\n\nThere is something so special about Billy Wilder's films, the way that he manages to capture you in the movie from the first second of the movie, is always so special and something I can't get enough of. The screenplay written by Billy Wilder and his team is so great, there is always tension and the characters feel like they are always developing in every scene. Technically the movie looks gorgeous in black and white again, especially with the wide shots of the whole area and sets, because that set was enormous. The shots in the mountain were incredible as well and felt very challenging and psychically to shoot, the way that Billy Wilder shot it. Kirk Douglas was of course the highlight of the movie, with a performance that I will not forget soon. The rest of the cast is great as well, however they definitely don't reach the same heights that Kirk Douglas reaches. The story is gripping from the first moment and ends with an iconic shot and one that will leave you thinking about the whole movie a second time. Ace In the Hole is not my favorite work by Billy Wilder, but certainly one that is worthy in his filmography!",

            "content": "Wilder's take on the literal media circus hangs just out of range of mainstream classic territory, lacking the name recognition of similar scathing social morality tales like 12 Angry Men. However, Ace in the Hole is a towering accomplishment that only gets better with age, an unsympathetic look at media sensationalism and its inherent amorality, but touching upon deeper, universally human flaws - opportunism, the absence of empathy, and base greed. Intensely cynical and introspective, the film is not pleasant viewing but it is of exceptional quality. If there is a complaint, it's the willingness to give Tatum some benefit of the doubt with a morose, drunken regret at the results of his actions when there may have been a greater poignancy and foresight in ascribing the same level of callous opportunism that Sterling's Lorraine Minosa did, pocketing the profit and hitching a ride out once the meal ticket ran dry. Douglas is note-perfect as Tatum, don't let his popular acclaim take away from the real capability of his performances; as a macabre ringleader, Tatum orchestrates a frenzy of interest in a rescue attempt for his own gain, and as the cars roll in what was originally intended to be a mildly profitable sideline finds itself corrupting the intent of the enterprise, tacking on days to the schedule so that more papers, burgers, and tickets can be sold. And when it's all over, the tents are packed up, the cars filter away, and only footprints and garbage are left, as the circus moves on for a new source of sustaining entertainment. Fully deserving of a renewed widescale appreciation, not just among film buffs. (4.5/5)",

Chuck Tatum personifies all that is wrong with the media - the lies, the over-dramatization, the influencing of the story when they should just be observers, the lack of ethics.  Also shows how easily lead and herded the average person is, and how people are happy to treat life-threatening danger to others as something for their amusement.\n\nWonderfully written and directed by Billy Wilder, with some great detail that lesser directors would not have thought of (the escalating prices of admission to the park always made me laugh!). While Tatum's actions are reprehensible, his Machiavellian manipulations are so brilliant that you admire him, in a way, and this is due to Wilder's script and direction.\n\nGreat performance by Kirk Douglas in the lead role.  He imbues Tatum with a bravura and conniving charm that is difficult to resist. \n\nNot a perfect movie though.  Was headed for it at one stage but loses focus a touch towards the end.

You can already tell that Kirk Douglas' character is a rotten one. An amoral low level scum that's willing to do anything for a shot of glory. Sarcastic and disrespectful the way he greets the Native American inside the newspaper office by saying, \"How\". Omg lmao! The director of the Albuquerque newspaper wears both a belt and suspenders lol! It's scary to think that there's people out there similar to Tatum, and worse. Reporters and journalists willing to twist the news and milk a story/idea in order make a sensation out of it, especially if it means scaring or putting people into fear or panic. Like he said, \"Good news is no news\". \n\nI like the locations they picked to film in this movie. They're really showing off the beautiful parts of New Mexico. That cave dwelling looks really interesting to go and visit. Damn Tatum is clever, I do have to give him that. The way he decides to volunteer to bring the blanket and coffee to Leo who's stuck in the cave so that he can get more information for the story that he's going to write. I like the scenes inside the cave. Definitely atmospheric and eerie. See this is why you don't go messing around with dead people's things, you should leave them alone. Leo was taking Native American pottery and belongings from within the cave to sell them and it seems the spirits of the dead had enough of him taking their belongings and punished him by trapping him inside the cave where their dead bodies rest. \n\nIt's crazy the way Tatum is orchestrating the whole situation to benefit himself. Not giving a care in the world towards Leo's wellbeing and health. The way he's pulling the strings so the story can keep going, keep being relevant. Now instead of getting Leo out through the cave entrance, they're going to dig through the top of the mountain because it's going to take longer to get Leo out. I can't imagine all the psychological damage and trauma that it's going to cause Leo - having to listen to that incessant pounding all day and night. That'd drive any man crazy. That's pretty selfish of Leo's young hot blonde wife to want to abandon him and leave now that he can't chase after her, since he's stuck and all.\n\nThis movie kind of proves how dumb Americans can be and how willing they are to eat up a story as long as they make a big sensation out of it. It's disgusting to watch how they've made a whole event out of one man's misfortune. As if it's some kind of carnival or circus where everyone can come congregate and have fun. It's so stupid. Wow, I can't believe Leo contracted pneumonia. All thanks to Tatum's idea of wanting to drill from the top. If Leo dies, I don't see how Tatum can live with himself for the rest of his life. The amount of guilt that he's going to have to carry with him will be psychologically destructive. The way he gets the priest into the cave in order to bless Leo before he dies. It seems Tatum's already feeling guilty for what he's done. Tatum kinda deserved to get shanked by Lorraine and lose his story in the end. And that final shot of him falling to the ground with his cold dead eyes inches away from the camera really left an impression on me. What an ending. \n\nA masterclass of cinema. This is how you make a hard hitting and impactful movie. Kirk Douglas really nailed it out of the park with his gritty and visceral performance as Chuck Tatum. Regardless of its dark themes, it's a pivotal, essential and forever relevant film that warns us about the dangers, critical impact and influence that the media/news can have on its people - especially Americans. This is a damn good fantastic movie that should be watched in one's lifetime. I'd definitely watch it again.",

Its commentary on journalism, and the emphasis that we place on stories rather than individual human lives, is effectively unsettling.

A society become paradigm of a world gazing at success' mirror. Billy Wilder was so predictive as he didn't run into critics favors because of his brazen exhibition of a herald falsification realm: that is journalism.\n\nIt's journalist Charles Tatum's arrogant face that fills up black-and-white scenes of this sublime tableau Billy Wilder sketched out in 1951. He puts in the foreground the black soul of a reporter dumped from all the American biggest newspapers, expelled for his deviances (he's a conman, a drinker, and a playboy), and forced to beg for a job in a suburban newspaper in Albuquerque.\n\nA proud man who has known footlights and now doesn't accept to remain in the backstage; a man longing for a payback that takes on revenge's violent connotations and it makes Wilder's Chuck Tatum one of the meanest characters of the cinema history: an overbearing, selfish, ruthless man. He is a journalist who knows how to profit by chance - e.g. Indians' graves looter Leo Mimosa trapped inside the cave - and how to turn it into his personal opportunity to come back in the Press circle, under spotlights of the whole world.\n\nAs a handy poker player, Tatum pulls out the ace in the hole: the case becomes a story, the story becomes a scoop, the scoop becomes a hit. And he is the factotum of the game, the fire-eater calling the shots of the show he sets up with an arriviste sheriff and a dissatisfied woman (Leo's wife) in the arid dusty Escudero. So, where there was nothing but a wretched lodging in the center of nothing now there is a crowded carnival, and from every quarter it comes people to attend Leo Mimosa's rescue; Tatum surreptitiously protracts this intervention in order to boost a story on which he had imprinted his brand name.\n\nHugo Friedhofer's grave soundtrack sharpens the echo of overwhelming oppression used upon everybody by the reporter till to crush Leo's wife (Jan Starling) not to run away and to trap her in his bogus gimmick (but she will injure him not far from the tragic epilogue). In fact, his plan screws up because Leo (Richard Benedict) starts suffering from pneumonia under the landslide. The hole puncher try to get to him while time flies out (and his life does the same). The man who had to be saved is dead: \"Leo Mimosa is dead\", Chuck Tatum shouts out from the top of the mountain: he cries out to the public gathered down in the dusty plains and to the journalists arrived from all over the Nation to take notes on the story. And he also makes the cry roaring inside himself as though he can atone for his petty plan.\n\nBut it's too late: tragedy's completed. And Tatum's alcohol-deformed face fills up the last shot: he lies down on the Albuquerque newspaper's newsroom pavement becoming the dark side of the show. He stands for the emotional desert of a show created at all costs. He stands for a society dazzled by evanescent things, a society eager to chase the twinkling excess and unable to recognize the goodness of truth.",

However he dreams of working his way back by turning the simple story of a man trapped in a mine into national news. Along the way he makes a lot of questionable decisions to keep the story going, and that's where the movie really gets interesting. Some of the conversations that Douglas has with other characters about how the media can manufacture a news story is very intriguing and still relevant today. I was totally impressed by Kirk Douglas's performance. He is the most intelligent guy in the room, and certainly takes control of most situations. Yet he still manages to be someone I was rooting for throughout the film. It's not easy to play someone with extreme ego and determination, but also show some heart and conscience behind that, but Douglas has the talent to do that. Jan Sterling is the heartless wife of the trapped man, and she is absolutely despicable (which is exactly what the role calls for, so this isn't really a complaint.) Porter Hall was exceptional as Boot (the editor of the newspaper.) He becomes the physical embodiment of truth, and plagues Douglas as the character who represents the conscience of the movie. Finally I should mention Richard Benedict as the man trapped in the mine. He is so nice and friendly that it's hard to watch him suffer. His slow descent into despair is played amazingly, and almost brought me to tears later in the movie.\n\nThat emotional core is what I was most impressed with while watching Ace in the Hole. I was totally invested in the story, and found myself running the gamut of emotions throughout. I was so strongly affected that I sat in silence after the film ended, until my wife asked me what was wrong. The performances were great, but the script is what really drove it all home. There were a lot of lines where people were saying one thing while clearly meaning something different, and they trusted the audience enough to follow what was going on without holding our hands. The look of the film was good for a black and white film, they used some really creative camera placement, and the interior of the cave felt very authentic. It's worth mentioning that I watched this on the Criterion DVD, which has brilliantly restored the video and audio. I could easily praise this film all day, it was one of the best films from the early fifties that I've ever seen. Also the themes are still poignant to this day despite the fact that newspapers are dying. Ace in the Hole takes a real look at how the media executes a story and can indirectly influence events so that they can make it as big a story as possible. Add this to the list of films I highly recommend you watch, it's a winner.",

Fast forward 60+ yrs and Wilder, as usual, hits the nail on the head with what he saw happening back then. The entire film rests on a stunning performance by the great Kirk Douglas as the most slimy and self-interested newspaper reporter to ever crawl out of the primordial ooze. It's a fantastic performance, Douglas just makes us hate him more and more as he sinks to what seem like new lows, but for him, don't seem particularly bad at all. As bad as he is, Lorraine (Jan Sterling), wife of Leo, the man stuck in the hole, is even worse. From her first appearance on the screen, she's more than ready to leave with her husband stuck underground without a second thought, because she's not getting what she wants. She represents the absolute worst in people, and Douglas barely has to do anything other than make her stay to milk the 'grieving widow' role. The last 20 minutes of film are such a testament against the worst of humanity, that I'm amazed this movie was ever released. Nothing close to a happy ending in any way, and that's what makes this as strong a film as it is.",

            "content": "Similar to Kubrick; Wilder was a man that pushed the limits, thematically, within the boundaries  of mainstream entertainment and beyond the limitations of the audiences expectations. Familiar at taking a swipe at societies idealized institutions which is obviously reflected through his body of work: From the degrading of Hollywood's idealized commodities in \"Sunset Boulevard,\" the dark side of human nature within \"Double Indemnity\" and the cynical characteristics of the business corporation in the fifties within \"The Apartment,\" Wilder was most definitely a man that contained audacity. Besides such films, Wilder continued such wondrous efforts with the Kirk Douglas vehicle \"Ace in the Hole.\" A film   that continues Wilder's challenging efforts on exploring human nature - 'Human interest' - and its relations to the media.\r\n\r\nThe story follows the cynical down-and-out journalist Chuck Tatum who finds a small-time job within Albuquerque. However, Tatum exploits the trapping of man (Benedict) to gain his way back to fortune through a journey of morality.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Tatum's world is that it's filled with not one likable character. Each individual is motivated cynically rather than democratically. Wilder constructs it beautifully as we watch each individual gain a sense of luxury on the behalf of Tatum's exploitation of the trapped Leo (Benedict), which ultimately makes us question the nature of human morality. Tatum's comments highlights such themes \"Bad news sells best. Cause good news is no news.\" Besides Wilder's thematical brilliance, Douglas is mesmerizing. From his cynical nature and uncompromising motivations (slap sequence), it's quite astonishing after watching Kubrick's \"Paths of Glory\" to notice Douglas' chameleon ability in switching from the moral to the immoral.\r\n\r\nParadoxically, \"Ace in the Hole\" has aged beautifully within it's relation to the media and its cynical nature, but the theme ultimately seems tiresome. Nevertheless, I personally love directors that are willing to challenge the norm - especially within the conventions of the superior Hollywood - by making a film that succeeds as a moral statement towards the human condition.",

            "content": "A brilliant, dark satire that features a top-notch performance from Kirk Douglas. There are two separate stories that inspired Billy Wilder and the writers for Ace in the Hole. They were both about people who got stuck and the reporters that blew up the stories in the papers. Sadly enough, neither of them survived. What's explored in Ace in the Hole is the question as to whether or not journalists have too strong of a hand in the way things can be played out. They have so much power. If you can get the public to read what you have to say then you can sway anyone high enough that could possibly want something from you. Chuck Tatum's a nasty man. You can see it in his eyes: he's willing to do anything for a big story just to get back to New York and get out of his crummy new job. Of course he went in basically on his hands and knees trying to get this crummy new job, even though he plays it up like he's only doing the paper a favor. After a year of staying where he doesn't want to, Tatum is sent out on a job with a fresh college graduate. They are going to travel and cover the story of a snake hunt (or so I believe that's the original story). On the way there they discover a man has been trapped in a mine. No one else knows about this yet and Tatum realizes what he's got on his hands: a story he can turn huge and get people's attention. But he can't simply give the facts and let the story play out. No, it can't be that easy. Instead he tells the rescue team to drill from the top to take more time and they only listen because Tatum already has the corrupted sheriff on his side. He's told the sheriff he will give him praises in his paper and not talk about his absence as long as if he gets him what he wants. Plus, the longer he's down there and the more they look like they're working hard, the better it is for the both of them. Then there's Lorraine Minosa, the wife of Leo, the guy stuck down in the mine. She's ready to leave and never come back because he promised her a life that she didn't get. Of course Tatum stops her from leaving and shows her how much money she can make by the travelers coming by to see what's going on with Leo. She starts to charge people to come around the mine and she even gets tons of service in the restaurant. She's making thousands of dollars. A carnival even comes to set up outside of the mine. It becomes a huge event where everyone hangs around, excited to be on television and see what's going on. The first couple to arrive after reading in the paper about Leo make a second appearance when they go on TV to state they were there first. As if anyone really cares. Is the news really something that should bring out thousands of people? Especially news of a man who might die? The second act mainly follows the slow descent of Leo's situation and Tatum making more sleazy choices. Lorraine starts becoming attracted to Tatum, and we see her try to come onto him and he tells her to stop smiling because it's bad for the story. When she tells him to make her stop smiling in a flirtatious way he smacks her in the face. He tells her to keep that upset look and tears because that's the way she should be. No matter what, Tatum continually beats down Lorraine just so his story can have the humanism of a wife who cares for her husband. Everything turns when Tatum discovers that Leo's actually sick and might die if he doesn't get out of there soon. The only problem is that they are too far in drilling to do anything else. He begins to help Leo take steps towards his death, like getting a priest and listening to him tell about the gift he has for his wife for their five year anniversary. Tatum finds the gift and gives it to Lorraine, hoping that she will finally feel guilty like him. But she doesn't. She doesn't even like the gift. She can buy a better and real fur scarf herself because of all the money she's made. Perhaps Leo was a greedy man, but he didn't deserve to die, which is why it's so heartbreaking when he does. We can feel the pain inside Tatum. The guilt keeps swelling without a hint of disappearing. Tatum continues to search for redemption but no one will listen to his confession. They don't care. His story's ruined and everyone's sad that Leo died. It's all over now. The twisted ending consists of Lorraine stabbing Tatum for beating her down so often then him going back to his job and saying a similar line to the beginning, he's worth $1,000, before he collapses and dies. Billy Wilder knew what he was doing here. Not only is there a deep meaning to his story, but on the surface level you get interesting characters and none of them are good people. It just goes to show you why Billy Wilder was one of the best masterful filmmakers there ever was.",

Second, it's a Billy Wilder, and if you've heard of him, you know that he's a master of his craft. Third, it stars Kirk Douglas. Now he may not look like much today, since he's 95 years old, but the dude is a legend, and was a stud 61 years ago. It also stars Jan Sterling. Now I had no idea who that was, but turns out she's a damn good actress! The film is an excellent social commentary on journalism. Another similar film that's equally fantastic is Sweet Smell Of Success. Both of them use journalism to exploit people/events, and both use very tongue-in-cheek dialogue. I was lucky to get to see this at Nick Digilio's Chicago Film Club (Rosemont's Muvico). By the way, the theater was 21 and over, alcoholic drinks allowed, huge seats, and a 4k digital projection\u00e2\u00a6niiiice. But wait, there's more! Nick introduced the film and held a discussion after, so yes, I was smiling the entire night haha. In the discussion, he explained that if this movie has a counterpart, it would easily be Network, for its portrayal of a television network (also brought to you by another film icon, Sidney Lumet). So if you're a film nut like me, definitely do not miss this one\u00e2\u00a6err, even if you have missed it for the last 60 years.",

Its scenes in the caves manage to convey how we would feel if we were in the predicament that the unfortunate Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) finds himself in, but they come across as slightly repetitive and ultimately, the film is better during the scenes where Tatum gets into arguments with his colleagues and rivals. A bit more focus on the satirical side of the film might have improved as well as giving a more complete analysis of the relationship between Tatum and Leo's wife Lorraine (Jan Sterling) would have helped, but this still gets the thumbs up on the fact that it never stops making us not care about how the film ends.",

There is a lot of darkness surrounding this film and it brings out the worst in all of us. In addition, it shows just how gleefully we're willing to go along with the crowd even though we know someone is in dire need of help; we simply don't care, we just go along with the carnival.
