            "content": "I love movies like this. Theatre-styled motion pictures driven by dialog versus action. Get a few guys together in a room, watch them talk -- I have a soft spot for this stuff. I have ever since I can remember. Some of my favorite films are character-driven ones: \"The Hustler,\" \"The Big Kahuna,\" \"Midnight Run,\" \"Planes, Trains & Automobiles.\" At first glance this list seems skeptical -- but basically all these films follow the same central theme: clever dialog, character interaction and evolution, and depth.\"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is one of the best of the genre. Scripted by David Mamet, the dialog never hits and weak patches -- it is realistic, extremely fun to listen to, and the actors all deliver flawless performances.Al Pacino finally finds the perfect role to let himself vent (as he started to do in \"Scent of a Woman\" the same year, and won an Oscar for -- he deserved it more for this). Pacino has some great one-liners and quips, but he never seems too broad to find believable.Jack Lemmon is similarly impressive, in what he called one of his favorite films of his entire career. Lemmon abandoned his comedic roots for this drama and it paid off -- he's not only an excellent funnyman, but a great actor.Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, and Alec Baldwin fill out the rest of the cast and all do very well; especially Baldwin in a brief cameo. I've never had much consideration for Baldwin as an actor, but his five minutes' worth of screen time here reminded me that when he's good, he really IS good! Overall \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is not only one of my favorite films of the genre but also a solid movie by any means. If you aren't bored by movies in which people talk instead of running around defusing bombs, you'll probably really get a kick out of this.",

            "content": "I cannot believe this film has been out there all these years and I just now saw it for the first time this week. I rented it on a whim and I've watched it four times since Monday.Glengarry Glen Ross is the story of a failing real estate office in which four agents are told they'd better get some property sold quick, or they'll be out of a job. By the end of the month, the top seller will win himself a Cadillac, the guy who finishes second will win himself a set of steak knives. The other two jokers will be out on the street. The problem is that the good leads are locked away in a filing cabinet in the office manager's room. They won't be distributed until the end of the contest. The guys are left with only leads that likely won't pan out at all.The four salesmen are each very memorable individuals. Al Pacino plays the best of the bunch. He's smooth and confident, and he seems to be the only guy making any good sales recently. Jack Lemmon is the old lion of the bunch. He's a good talker, but he's been on a stretch of terrible luck both professionally and personally. It's looking like he is now obsolete, and could be one of the guys let go. Ed Harris is a brooding; scheming character also on a streak of bad luck. His plan is not to make sales, but break into the office and steal the good leads. Alan Arkin is a meek fellow who cannot even dial the right phone number or carry on any type of meaningful conversation. Each actor has their character down perfectly.The story unfolds in less than a 24 hour period. Alec Baldwin is a hotshot salesman from \"downtown\" who shows up at the beginning of the film and lets the guys know how worthless they are. He lays down the terms of the contest in some very colorfully profane language that sets the tone for the rest of the script. Profanity can be monotonous and gratuitous, but not here. Mamet's script is like a piece of art formed by interlacing all the fine swear words in the English language together with a touch of ironic gloom. And how often do you hear the word \"c*cksucker\" said with the articulate dignity of Jack Lemmon? We see each character for what they are, and each actor is allowed to show us why they are so famous. I believe this film to be a landmark piece of cinema for this generation. As much as 12 Angry Men was in its own time. How often do you see such a cast get together with such a fine script? Not often enough, I'd say.The Kevin Spacey character has a special place in my heart. I also work at a job where I have to deal with a bunch of pompous salesmen. I suppose it comes with the job, but salesmen always seem to think they are more important than they are. What they don't seem to understand is that different people can be hired to sell the same goods and services. More often than not, it is the company that retains or loses customers. That said, sales is a ballsy profession, and it does take genuine skill and luck to be successful at it.For those out there who either are salesmen or like them, then this film will also be a treat. There is one beautiful scene in particular when Jack Lemmon has just made what he thinks is a huge sale to break his slump. He bursts into the office and happily demands his sale be noted on the board with everyone else's. Nobody but Pacino seems interested (Harris for example acts jealous and spiteful) in hearing the details. Pacino comes over and sits by Lemmon and listens to how the old master was able to pull it off. The camera subtly backs off and lets the two share the moment together. That was very well-done.Due to all the profanity in this film, it is basically not possible to show it on network television. This may be the primary reason the film has slipped through the cracks over the years, and not made many top 100 lists and so forth. If you want to see some great actors doing what they do best, then DO NOT MISS THIS FILM! 10 of 10 stars the Hound.",

            "content": "I went into \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" totally blind. I had no idea who David Mamet was really (other than the fact that he was a writer), never saw any of his plays, or realized that he'd been in business for a while (through some backtracking, I found out that he was the writer behind the film version of \"The Untouchables\", one of the best films of the 80's). All that changed after I saw this brilliant, BRILLIANT film. It amazes me how all the big names in this film (and there are plenty, Jack Lemmon, Kevin Spacey, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, and Alec Baldwin) were pulled together for this two-act movie play about a salesman's life. It's all very dialogue heavy throughout, only about three or four different locations (the primary action all taking place in the office) and yet I was never bored for a second. Counting up all the \"F*** You!\"s in this film has convinced me that the tongue stings in ways a torture specialist can only imagine. The dialogue is clever, vicious, and occasionally even a little funny (particularly when Pacino is in action; intentional or not, he can be a VERY funny guy). The plotting doesn't show all it's cards straight away, as there are one or two suprises that ultimately catch the viewer off-guard.Now as to the cast, what to say that hasn't been said? Hmmm...nothing really, I suppose. Watching Lemmon's desperation, Harris' anger, Pacino's laid-back cool, Spacey's authoritarian chutzpah, and Baldwin's icy dissection of his employees is astounishing to behold. Lesser actors would have made the results much less memorable and/or believable. These guys make it unforgettable. Two decades from now on, when all the hooplas of the 90's \"hits\" dies down, people will rediscover what I already know: \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is one for the ages.",

            "content": "This film is perfect. I give out 10s about as often as Stanley Kubrick made films, and Glengarry Glen Ross is one of them.There is so much more in this film than just a bunch of guys in a real estate office. I'm puzzled, as an aside, why the language is considered such a big deal. There is less of it in GGR than in the average DeNiro film I watch. Maybe it's because the film is composed of almost nothing but dialogue.Back to the content. GGR contains at least two, maybe three of my favorite performances by anyone. Baldwin, who I really don't like, is perfect. Lemmon is excruciatingly good, and Pacino actually makes me forget who I'm watching. He really sinks into his character. Pryce also gives a commendable performance.For those who didn't get this film, who think it's just dark and pointless, here's the point. The title is Glengarry Glen Ross. If you listen to the conversations you will notice that the Glengarry leads are the new leads, the ones given to closers, the leads given to those who go out and squeeze as much money out of people as they can so they don't lose their jobs.Glen Ross farms are talked about in a brilliantly written conversation between Ed Harris and Alan Arkin, the one when Harris orders donuts and Arkin keeps repeating back to him what he said. \"..Boots, yes.\" In that conversation, Harris talks about what he learned when he first got into the sales racket. You don't sell one car to a guy, you sell him 5 cars over fifteen years. But, he says, those guys who come in and burn everyone for as much money as they can get and then go to Argentina ruined a good thing. The drive to win the Cadillac had ruined the ideal of maintaining a mutually beneficial relationship between customer and salesman. Sharks like Baldwin came in, made their millions, and left a wasteland for the \"losers\" to work in.The film is about how business in America is war, and about how the drive for capital has ultimately dehumanized us. The strongest contrast is between Baldwin and Lemmon. Baldwin is a machine. Everything in his life, his very identity, is defined by the fact that his watch cost more than a \"loser's\" car. \"Family man? Go home and play with your kids.\" \"A loser is always a loser.\" His name is that he drives a BMW.With Lemmon, pay attention to the brief references to his daughter. The man is desperate to make money, not only to keep his job, but to pay for his daughter's medical treatment. A very human thing.Eventually, these men prey not only on customers, but on each other. It's vicious. If you don't understand why, all you'll see is the viciousness, and you probably won't enjoy the film.",

            "content": "I've read the comments about the amount of profanity in this movie..if you've ever worked in a less than ethical sale office, you'll know the language is very real...having worked a few years in telemarketing selling everything from wireless cable licenses to vitamins and ad specs, I can tell you, the dialog is very real.This is my favorite movie of all time...sure, it's not flashy, upbeat or effect-laden, but it's so realistic that the first time I saw it, I got goosebumps...Every character in the movie is one that I recognized from my office experiences...the mega-closer mouth piece (Baldwin), the complainers who always complained about the leads (Lemon and Arkin), the office manager who'd never actually sold anything before but had a little rub  (Spacey), the hotshot salesman (Pacino)... it was just so real...anyone who's ever worked in a brokerage can tell you about the amounts of profanity in the sales profession...especially high pressure sales...Ben Affleck's performance in \"Boiler Room\" has shades of Baldwin's performance in this movie...not a bad thing, just an observation. Baldwin's best acting is this 5 minute scene and his \"I am God\" speech in \"Malice\".Amazing acting all around, tight realistic dialog (first time I saw this, I could almost say the words before they were spoken) Highly recommended! 10",

            "review_title": "Mamet Sells It",
            "content": "Those who must rely on their wits to make a living are often prone to desperate measures born of the insecurities inherent in their field of endeavor-- a straight commission salesman, for example; or in this instance, a real estate salesman, in particular.  And under pressure, to what will one in such a position resort to stay afloat when times are tough?  A legitimate question that every consumer would no doubt like to have answered before signing the dotted line and committing some big money to a purchase.  Well, hold tight, because help is on the way, as writer/director David Mamet goes to great lengths to answer it in `Glengarry Glen Ross,' an unflinching, hard-edged film that examines the motivations of those who would readily and eagerly separate you from more than a few of your hard earned dollars, and whose least concern, apparently, is the value of their product or that parcel of land, which according to them is situated just this side of Shangri-la.  And if you've ever trusted a big-ticket salesman in your life, after visiting Mamet's film, it's doubtful you ever will again.\tVery simply, the story is this:  The Company wants results; the hierarchy expects their salesmen to produce, and they don't care how.  Toward that end, a `motivator' (Alec Baldwin), has been dispatched to this particular office to put things into perspective for those who would sell their wares, as it were.  The deal is, that at the end of a given period of time, the salesman whose name is at the top of the tote board will get a new car; those who fail to meet their quota are out the door.  End of story.  They will, however, be supplied with `leads,' but from the `old' file.  The new, `fresh' leads are reserved for those who first prove themselves worthy, those who can do whatever it takes to make the sale, without qualm, reservation or conscience.  But the prospect of being put on the street in the wake of the give-no-quarter edict only serves to drive one amongst them to an act of desperation-- an irrational act from which there can be no forgiveness and no redemption.  A tough verdict, but then again, nobody said life was going to be easy.\tIn adapting his own play for the screen, Mamet returns to one of his favorite themes by exploring yet another variation of the `con' forever being perpetrated somewhere, on someone, in one way or another.  In Mamet's world (in films such as `House of Games' and the more recent `Heist') nothing is ever as it seems, and the confidence game is always afoot, the causes and effects of which make up the drama of his stories.  And this film is no exception.  Whether it's the smooth and savvy top-dog of the office, Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), schmoozing a client into handing over a check, or a veteran loser like Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon) showing up at someone's door on a cold call at a most inopportune and inconvenient moment and refusing to leave, Mamet convincingly maintains that the con-is-always-on, and the result-- especially in this film-- is a bleak, but riveting commentary on the human condition, delivered with an intensity that will keep you on the very edge of your emotional seat right up to the end.\tThe cast Mamet assembled for this offering is superb:  Al Pacino is in top form and extremely effective with a comparatively tempered performance; the scene in which he lulls his customer (played by Jonathan Pryce) into complacency is absolutely hypnotic.  This is the salesman you hope you never encounter, especially if something like the Brooklyn Bridge is being offered, as such overtures as those proffered by Ricky Roma are just too hard to refuse.  And Pacino not only sells it, he closes the deal, as well.\tEd Harris, as Dave Moss, is outstanding, also, creating a character whose bitterness seems to flow from the inside out, and has long since overwhelmed that ability and better part of himself that could've made him a successful salesman, had he but turned his energies to more positive concerns and away from the self-defeating, self-pity into which he has descended.  While at the opposite end of the spectrum is George, played by Alan Arkin, who unlike Dave (who though unable to act upon it, at least had promise at some point in his career) has nothing but insecurity and empty dreams to sustain him. As wonderfully realized by Arkin, he's the proverbial duck-out-of-water, who belongs anywhere except in a job as a salesman.\tThe best performance of all, however, is turned in by Jack Lemmon, who in Shelley Levene creates a character so steeped in despair and hopelessness that's it's almost tangible.  You have but to look into Lemmon's eyes to understand the turmoil and depth of Shelley's desperation, and Lemmon successfully conveys the complexities of this man in terms that are believable and incredibly real.  He makes Shelley a guy you can feel for without necessarily sympathizing with him.  It's simply a terrific piece of work by a terrific actor.\tAnother of the film's strengths is the performance by Kevin Spacey, as John Williamson, the office manager.  It's an understated, but pivotal role, and Spacey does a good job of making it convincing, which ultimately heightens the overall impact of the film, especially the climax.\n\tThe supporting cast includes Bruce Altman (Mr. Spannel), Jude Ciccoledda (Detective) and Paul Butler (Policeman).  Mamet builds and sustains a tension throughout this film that drives the anxiety level through the roof; at times, it's exhausting to watch.  In the end, however, `Glengarry Glen Ross' is a satisfying experience, involving very real situations with which many in the audience will be able to relate, and delivered with a high-powered energy equal to the subject matter.  And once you catch your breath, it's one you're going to appreciate even more.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",

            "review_title": "An intense emotional experience",
            "content": "(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon.)It doesn't take a movie connoisseur to see that this is a stage play filmed.So what? The play is a work of genius--it won a Pulitzer Prize--and the cast is about as good as you can get. Jack Lemmon gives a performance that will tear your heart out...well, if you're like any of the characters in the play, you have no heart! And Al Pacino gets to put the pedal to the metal and fire on all cylinders. He is great when he's screaming, and he's even better when he's handing out buddy-buddy BS philosophy. Kevin Spacey as John Williamson, the boss of the boiler room crew, has the skin of a rhino and the heart of a baboon. Incidentally, the language is foul, fouler and foulest, and indeed, poor David Mamet, who wrote the play and adapted it for the screen, ran out of expletives. I mean how many ways can you suggest that someone perform impossible acts upon themselves? Yet, considering the moral fiber of the characters, the language seemed not inappropriate.Indeed, Mamet is a master of dialogue and some of the set pieces are just marvels. The exchange between Dave Moss (Ed Harris) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin) as Moss leads up to his plan to steal the precious 'leads' is like a ping pong match done as a pas de deux. And the harangue by Alec Baldwin as the brass...endowed motivational speaker was a crack up.This is an extraordinarily intense film, so intense if you watch carefully you can see first Jack Lemmon and then Al Pacino so fired up and wildly expressive that spit comes out of their mouths along with the words. (I've done that.) In fact, all the actors feed off of one another. Being on the set must have been just an amazing experience with everyone trying to outdo everyone else. The timing alone is worth the ticket.Note that no women grace the screen. I mean zero. This is a war flick with con artists in the trenches. Note also how carefully plotted the story is. Mamet thought it out and worked and reworked it so that everything fits. For example when 'The Machine' Levene makes his little slip revealing that he knew that the Roma contract had not been sent, we can immediately fill in the details realizing that Dave Moss had gotten to him with his cowardly scheme. And when Levene learns that his miraculous $82,000 sale is to crazies who have no money and just like to talk to salesmen, we see how perfectly ironic that is, and how tragic, like the life of Willy Loman in Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman. We can also see, if we really want to look beyond the movie, that Jack Lemmon's interpretation of Levene owes something to Willy Loman as does Mamet's creation. I have seen Jack Lemmon in many things, beginning with Mr. Roberts (1955) through Some Like It Hot (1959) to Grumpy Old Men (1993) and he has been wonderful, one of the great stars of the silver screen, but I don't think I've ever seen him more convincing than here. All the other actors in this film also have done larger pieces and had more demanding roles, but I'll bet they seldom had more fun.You don't want to miss this movie. It is one of a kind. The cynicism is palpable and the desperation so humanly demeaning that it's almost funny.",

            "review_title": "In Many Ways, One Of A Kind",
            "content": "Despite being character-driven, dialogue-heavy and very stagy, this movie adaptation of David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize winning play is immensely powerful, hard-hitting and intense. The stakes are high right from the start as a group of salesmen have to struggle against impossible odds (and each other) just to stay in their jobs. The ways in which the different characters respond to the pressure they're under provides a fascinating insight into human behaviour and their anger, frustration and resentment about the way they're being treated, triggers a whole series of highly-charged confrontations that generate a great deal of the energy that makes this remarkable drama so compelling.When a group of real estate salesmen working for a small company begin to under-perform, an executive called Blake (Alec Baldwin) is brought in to give a motivational speech. His technique involves launching into a furious rant during which he insults, patronises and humiliates the three men present and announces that a sales contest is to be held. The prize for the winner will be a Cadillac, the salesman who comes second will be rewarded with a set of steak knives and everyone else in the team will be fired. The men's common complaint about the useless leads they're being given by the company is discredited by Blake who constantly boasts about his own wealth and says that salesmen should \"always be closing\". Furthermore, he adds that he's brought with him a bundle of new leads which will only be given to the men who are able to close sales using the existing leads.The bad leads that the men have been working with, are people who they know either don't want to or can't afford to buy the properties they're selling plus a few time-wasters who just like talking to salesmen, but have no intention of buying.Typically, the three men respond in different ways to Blake's tirade. George Aaronow (Alan Arkin) who'd already become disillusioned by his inability to close any sales is totally crushed. The more hot-headed Dave Moss (Ed Harris) is fired-up to retaliate against the company with the same level of aggression and disrespect that Blake had delivered to him and so tries to involve Aaronow in a plan to steal the new leads and sell them on to a rival firm. By contrast, Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon) who's the company's most experienced salesman is prepared to do absolutely anything, however, disreputable, just to survive. The office manager John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) enforces Blake's instructions by keeping the new leads under lock and key but when the office is burgled and the leads are taken, Williamson calls in the police and everyone in the team, including top-performing salesman Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), who was absent from Blake's meeting, find themselves under suspicion.The most striking feature of this movie is its sizzling dialogue which is sharp, well-written and rapidly-delivered. It reflects perfectly the desperation and aggression of its characters who are mostly fast-talking individuals with an extensive vocabulary of profanities which they use frequently and forcefully during their numerous outbursts. All the characters are well-defined and come over as extremely authentic, not least, because they're all very recognisable types.With its all-star cast of top-class acting talent, \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is full of powerful performances. Alec Baldwin makes a huge impression in his cameo role as Blake and Al Pacino is terrific as the company's current most successful salesman. He oozes charm, is thoroughly amoral and excels in his scenes with one of his clients (played by Jonathan Pryce) and his old mentor Shelley Levene.Levene, as played by Jack Lemmon, attempts to bribe Williamson in a variety of different ways to get his hands on the good leads and uses some elaborate deceptions in his dealings with his potential clients. In an outstanding performance, Lemmon actually makes this unpleasant man sympathetic, partly because of a distressing problem that he has in his personal life and also because of the constant optimism he displays, even though he knows that he's over-the-hill and his most successful years are behind him.\"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is unquestionably an extraordinary movie and in many ways, one of a kind.",

            "content": "I cannot believe this film is rated below an 8What else can be written about James Foley's adaptation of David Mamet's Pulitzer prize winning play other than devastatingly scorching.Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin, Kevin Spacey, Alan Arkin, and Jonathan Pryce: perhaps the greatest acting ensemble ever put before a camera, collectively portray employees of a real estate agency- the sales department. Some of the greatest characters written in the 20th century cinema. Lemmon, 'the machine' Levene, is the old hero, now on a steady and sharp decline. Revered by others. Pacino,Ricky Roma the hot shot. He keeps an arm's length from everyone. Alan Arkin, George, is simply the loser. Never was hot, never will be - totally hopeless. Ed Harris is Dave Moss, a fighter, kinda like DeNiro in Raging Bull. Not hot, willing to do anything to reach the top. Like a rabid pitbull. Frustrated and at the boiling point. Kevin Spacey, Williamson, is the manager. A puppet of the owners, a real pencil pusher. But at least he doesn't live off of door-to-door sales. Alec Baldwin, in his greatest performance of his career, only taking up a mere 10 mins of screen time, tears the screen to shreds and burns the film up with one of the most incendiary, provocative, foul-mouthed, scene-chomping speeches ever. I was 17 when I saw this in the theatre and Alec Baldwin blew my mind with that scene. In college we used to watch this film over and over and rewind the speech 10 times over. We knew every line, every gesture. Jack Lemmon's face when Baldwin yells \"Put that coffee down! Coffee's for closers\". Or \"You see this watch? this watch costs more than your car\".We would kill ourselves laughing, that's how much we loved it.Mamet's character driven screenplay delves into the place in our souls and in our psyches, where desperation exits. The men live off of selling near useless Florida real estate, and their tool is the cold call - the hard sell. Lemmon, Pacino,and Bladwin are true masters. Gold belt senseis of the cold call. The bullcrap that they can unload is remarkable. Stream of consciousness. Lie upon lie. Smug and greasy. Pacino's monologue to the hapless gimmel Pryce, leads to tangents about pedophilia, and the stench of urine in subways. He wields a cheezy brochure of the properties like it's Shakespeare, with a picture of a faberg\u00e9 egg on it. Lemmon meanwhile desperately stands in rain drenched phone booths, creating illusions to the listener like a verbal ballet. When he worms his way into one of the lead's house, he plants himself on the couch and grabs a stuffed animal he sees there. That little thing he does there, that gesture; in those 3 seconds, his character's conflict is symbolized. Though the guru to all younger than him, his decline is turning into an avalanche, ready to bury him. He is so desperate he resorts to the cheesiest, phoniest, approaches. It is heartbreaking to watch. Drama not unlike that of the great Greek tragedies of Aeschylus and Euripides. Classic human fare. Alan Arkin is slightly type-cast as the bumbling, mumbling, passive, loser. He has done it so many times. But this has to be the apex of that characterization for him. Ed Harris is so full rage, spitting venom (and literally spitting on Al Pacino during his farewell speech, his \"farewell to the troops\"). It is literally one of the most expletive laden tirades ever projected in mainstream cinemas. You are just waiting for his ears to smoke and his head to explode. Gut wrenching. Williamson, is subject to, by Roma and Levene, the harshest tongue whippings ever. Ferocious, nasty, derogatory. Spacey is literally humiliated by these masters of bulls**t. He most certainly gets his comeuppance; and later, a pretty nasty little service return of his own. Much is written in these reviews about the swearing in the film. Swearing, in Mamet's works, is part of the syntax of those worlds. It is almost like the curse words become subtext. It is like the pli\u00e9 in his abusive ballet of words. But nonetheless, umbrage can be made about this matter. It is after all, foul swearing, carpet-bombed from a writer who uses it as his key verbal motif. You simply have to accept as Mamet's artistic license and move on. It is one of those things that you simply cannot let ruin the experience for you. Mamet is widely considered one of the greatest living playwright and screenwriter in the English language. Just consider the swearing as part of the stylization of the cold-caller salesman language.The narrative of Glengarry Glen Ross takes place in one evening and the next morning, and is mostly in a dingy office and a Chinese restaurant. Superbly light, and with an awesome jazz score, it has great camera moves that highlight, accent, punctuate, and round out the actors' performances. My favourite motif is the subway that rattles by - at crucial moments of crucial dialogues. It is interesting to note, that the director, James Foley, who superbly crafted this ensemble piece, never really became an A-list director. All the elements are there, perfectly and purposely assembled - the sound, the image, the performances. Perhaps, Mamet did more directing than the writer normally would? Or did the real cinema pros - the cast - just take the ball and run, literally directing the film themselves, so used to playing those roles on stage, with the exception of Pacino and Baldwin. Another note of interest, is that I have seen this film numerous times, with a variety of people, and have yet to meet a female who liked it. This seems to categorize Glengarry Glen Ross as perhaps one the more masculine, testosterone soaked, man-only films ever. Like wild male animals fighting it out in the jungles. Despite that, I say this is definitely a must see for guy and gal cinema lovers all over.",

            "content": "For those who are fans of action, explosions and flashy special f/x--this is not your movie.  For those who are fans of extraordinary acting, strong characters, a great plot and priceless dialogue--it just doesn't get any better than this!  When I say you're in for a treat, I mean it with the utmost certainty.  Al Pacino and Kevin Spacey are on my list of favorite actors.  The rest of the cast isn't quite on there, but they're all actors that I highly admire and some of which come close to being on my favorites list.  First of all, it's hard to not be at least somewhat interested by a film written by David Mamet.  He is simply the master when it comes to pacing and sharp dialogue.  He truly has a style like no other.  There's a million lines in this movie that I love to quote, many of which are in Alec Baldwin's opening speech.  \"F**k you, that's my name.  You came here in a Hyundai, I drive a 80,000-dollar Oldsmobile--that's my name.\"  And Kevin Spacey's \"Go to lunch\" speech is great as well.  Every time I watch that scene I think back to when he read those same lines with a student on \"Inside the Actor's Studio.\"  Mamet's dialogue is delivered a lightning-fast pace, which I find fascinating.  It makes you feel like you're watching an old movie, only in color and with an abundance of cuss words.  This film brought tears to my eyes, not because it's incredibly sad, but because it's so intense.  Watching actors like Al Pacino and Jack Lemmon share a scene is like a dream for any true film buff.  Lemmon gave one of the best performances of his entire film career in this movie, and that's saying a whole lot!  Needless to say, we suffered a tragic loss when he died.  It's a surprise that he didn't receive an Oscar for his work in \"Glengarry.\" Pacino also gives one of his best performances, in my opinion.  In his recent films like \"The Recruit\" and \"Simone,\" he hasn't gotten the chance to show off his acting chops to the fullest extent.  His performance in this movie is an example of Pacino in full gear.  Spacey is perfectly slimy in his role, and I despised him every minute he was on screen.  Everyone who's ever had a job is familiar with some secretary or assistant manager, who's uptight and constantly plays by-the-book, just so he can maintain the respect of the boss whose butt he kisses every minute of the day.  We've all encountered scumb*gs like him, and that's why it made it so easy for me to hate his guts.  Every character is multi-dimensional, and I was able to feel either a deep sympathy or a deep hatred towards each of them.  Some have criticized this film for being visually unimpressive, since it takes place mainly on one location.  That didn't bother me one bit.  When you have actors this engaging, setting is definitely not the issue.  People always feel that when a play is adapted onto screen, it has to take place in many different locations, to \"take advantage\" of it being a motion picture.  I always feel that good writing and good acting are the key elements of a good movie.  If you want to see great visuals, go rent the whole \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy.  But for those begging for something of substance should love this movie.  I'm constantly on the edge-of-my-seat when I watch this movie.  All aspiring actors should be required to watch \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" as a prerequisite, because all you need to know about great acting is in this movie.  A DON'T MISS!!  (10 out of 10)",

            "content": "There's a scene in Glengarry Glen Ross where Shelly 'the Machine' Levine (Lemmon) says that a man is his job. And as far as some people go, he's right. Many men define themselves by the work they do, the money they earn and the car they drive. I mean, who cares about friends and family or higher aspirations? Or even simple things like happiness? That crap is for deadbeats. The real meaning of life is a high wage and to vanquish your enemies. Everything else is a pointless waste of time.In the great scene where Baldwin gives his 'motivational speech', he mocks the notion of a man being a nice person or a good father. Yeah, is that going to pay for your nice suit or your expensive watch? No it's not. And he says that any man who can't close a deal should hit the bricks; they should leave. This is pure Darwinism. Do or die. Kill or be killed.In this sort of environment personal lives are next to non-existent, but Shelly Levine does attempt to extend beyond these limits. Through a series of phone calls we hear that he has an ill daughter. But to be honest he always sounds like he's going through the motions. Shelly's heart is elsewhere. His heart belongs to the sale.There's more than one instance when the sale is spoken about or shown to be close to a sexual act, but the best example is probably the scene where Shelly and Ricky Roma (Pacino) are discussing a deal Shelly's closed. He's been going through a lean phase, unable to sell anything, but suddenly he's on top of the word, spilling his guts to his pal. And he talks about it like he's been with a woman. 'They signed. It was great. It was so f****** great. It was like they wilted all at once.' And to make the story even more sexual, Levine had been waiting for 22 minutes for his 'clients' to sign the deal. 22 minutes that he had to spend in silence waiting for them to sign the contract. In a world of lies and deceit, this is the closest these men can get to intimacy \u0096 the signing of a piece of paper has a purity and a joy that even the act of love lacks.But it's not just the orgasm of a scratched name that provides satisfaction, there's also the foreplay. Sometimes it goes horribly wrong like in the excruciating scene when Shelly turns up at someone's home and faces a brick wall, but sometimes it goes like clockwork. An example of this is when Ricky Roma is talking to James Lingk (Pryce). Roma isn't so much selling as seducing. He whispers soft words into Lingk's ear and charms the pants off him. Lingk is fooled into thinking that this is a genuine relationship, that there's sincerity here. And for once he feels like a man. He can step out of his wife's shadow and show that he has a pair of balls. But unfortunately, later, those balls are cut off and he comes back begging for his money. But he only does it because his wife has told him to get his cheque back. And at the end he goes to the remarkable length of apologising to Ricky. This is how deep the seduction has gone. The broken sale is a betrayal of sacred the link between men.But even the sacred bond between men is shown to be completely phoney. After all, what's the next best thing to making lots of money? To see your colleagues or your friends fail miserably. And what's more infuriating than someone else's success? Answer: nothing.Some of the best exchanges in the film occur between Levine and Williamson (Spacey). They should be pulling for the same team, but they hate each other's guts. Williamson is a 'secretary' and Levine is a washed up has-been with a big mouth. So at the beginning, when he can't make a sale, Levine is servile and pleading \u0096 he even tries to buy leads from Williamson. But once Levine closes a deal, the real Shelly comes out. He taunts Williamson and asks him what he is. He even demands the new Glengarry leads. But then once Levine becomes comfortable, Williamson tells him the bad news that his deal won't go through, that the people he sold to are insane. It's an incredibly cruel scene, with some scathing dialogue. 'Why?' asks Levine, wanting to know why he wasn't told earlier (Williamson was aware all along that a deal wouldn't stick). 'Because I don't like you,' replies Williamson. 'My daughter?' 'F*** you.' In this world there are few things better than screwing someone over, to drag them down and pull yourself up.However, there is one seemingly sincere relationship \u0096 the one between Roma and Levine. They seem to get along quite amiably. But then again, you get the feeling that these men are two sides of the same coin. You get the feeling that Roma is a reflection of Levine in his youth. How long before things goes south for Roma? How long before his confidence is ruined and he's reduced to begging for scraps? And the ending wonderfully illustrates how lonely this type of existence is. Levine, unknown to Roma, is going to be arrested for robbing the office \u0096 Levine pathetically tries to talk to Roma one last time before being hauled into to speak to a police officer, but Roma is busy on the phone. So Levine's departure goes unnoticed. And worse than that, Ricky goes off to lunch alone and Levine's colleagues continue to try and sell. Yes, the world will manage to revolve with Levine behind bars. He, like us, is easily replaced. Therefore if work is what defines us, we have nothing when it's taken away.",

Which is incredible, when you think not just of the dialogue and \"ahms\", but the speed in which it is delivered! Really fascinating to say the least.And then the story! I mean how can anyone not be drawn in? Yes the characters shown here are different levels of despicable and still you root for them. Because you see their struggle! Because Alec Baldwin is the evil that gives them a deadline ... btw. that performance of his ... talking to Alda, Harris and Lemmon that way? Wow ... I mean just wow. And then you have Kevin Spacey who is quite contraint and still leaves as much dents as any other actor in this. Have I talked about Pacino yet? No? Again, just hearing and seeing those names ... masterclass in so many ways. And then the ending - I think you can draw things from this from multiple viewings.

            "content": "To answer everyone's question first upon seeing the title, no Glengarry Glen Ross does not have a Scottish setting. The title is an amalgam of of a series of property lots that this group of shark real estate salesman are trying to peddle. As sleazy a bunch as you will ever find are the staff of this real estate firm, located in Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn. David Mamet's play ran in the 1984-1985 season on Broadway for 378 performances and it's a property for a great ensemble cast which is what was assembled here. Al Pacino got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, yet it's unfair to single out his performance as better than the others. Any one of them could have been nominated, they all have their moments.By the time Glengarry Glen Ross came to the screen, the Reagan years were over. The Eighties were a decade driven by unbridled capitalism the likes we had not seen since the robber barons. But those people created industry, the wealth of the eighties was in get rich quick stock market speculation. The only real new industry was the computer driven ones as we moved from the age of industry to the age of information. These salesmen are the Reagan era personified. Make money at any cost even if you become an outright conman. They are in their thirties and forties, one however is reaching senior citizen status and ought to be retired, but has financial obligations.That of course is Jack Lemmon who is playing a very similar part to the one he won an Oscar for in Save the Tiger. That character too, faced middle age with pressing financial concerns and he makes a choice to have an arson fire at his factory with the insurance settlement getting him out of debt. Here Lemmon's Shelley 'the Machine' Levine, once a crack salesman has let the younger ones including his own prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Pacino out do him in a highly competitive environment. He makes a wrong choice and it doesn't work out so good.Ed Harris as a loudmouth blowhard of a salesman and Kevin Spacey as the harried office manager make their characters real. Alec Baldwin has a small ten minute role at the beginning of the film as the motivational vice president of the firm who provides some real incentives for these guys to keep their jobs. Inadvertently he sets up all the events to follow. His performance is very similar to the one that Ben Affleck did in Boiler Room.Glengarry Glen Ross is a stunning commentary on the American get rich quick ethic and the Reagan years. It's great ensemble acting and should not be missed.",

The entire film consists of a group of desperate real estate salesman sitting around at the office, in a car, in a phone booth, at a bar; simply sitting and talking, and not doing particularly much. An early morning burglary occurs during the film, but we don't get to see that. The characters just talk. They get angry, they utter countless obscenities to express their frustration, and they each get into a highly-vocal confrontation with each member of the all-male cast at least once. Herein lies the film's brilliance.If ever there was a film with the perfect ensemble cast, this one is it. Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin\u0085 Everybody involved plays their character to blissful perfection, and not an ounce of talent goes to waste. David Mamet's grittily realistic script is snappy enough to rival anything that Tarantino or the Coen Brothers have ever written, and the actors exploit this to its full potential. Watching these stunning performances is a simply mesmerising experience, and the running time flew by so unbelievably quickly that I came out wishing it had gone on for twice as long.'Glengarry Glen Ross' covers two days in the life of a real estate salesman (or, more accurately, one night and the following morning). The film dashes about between the characters; people come and go as they please. As such, it is difficult to determine a leading character, though Jack Lemmon's Shelley Levene undoubtedly forms the film's backbone. In past years, \"The Machine\" Levene was a powerful force within the company, the most successful salesman for eight months of the year, three years' running. However, now he's experiencing what he describes as a \"bad streak,\" and faces being fired if he doesn't accomplish anything profitable in the very near future. Being laid off would probably prove a relief for Levene, but his daughter is in need of an operation, and he needs the money to support her. Lemmon is absolutely perfect in the role, cutting effortlessly between despair and desperation, fear and elation. We are sympathetic towards his plight, but Levene ultimately embodies those qualities that we detest in a human being \u0096 he will cheat, lie and steal, without even a moment's consideration for the wellbeing of his \"victims.\" All that matters to him is getting clients to sign on that dotted line. This effectively describes every character in the film.If watching characters simply talk to each other for 90 minutes can be this unbelievably captivating, then why do we even need anything to happen in our films?!

Obviously someone did because the trivia section here says it happened eighty three times. Considering the 'F' word was used almost twice as much, I don't know why 'leads' jarred me so much every time I heard it. Just goes to show that the other word is so much more common in movies today.You know, the title of this film has bothered me ever since it came out. Without knowing the story and the real estate deals involved, it never made any sense to me. Now that I've seen it I have the context so it's become a non-issue.I never worked in sales except for a brief stint in autos about a decade ago. It seemed like a rigged game in the office I worked for; fifty cars in four months and only made ten grand. You do the math. I chalk it up to a learning experience for the brief time involved at a time I didn't really need to make a lot. The cutthroat stuff never appealed to me and I'd rather make an honest living anyway. I know there are bullies like Blake out there, but they can't look in a mirror. Speaking of which, it's extraordinary to me that Alec Baldwin turned into this character for real over the past couple of years as evidenced by the cell phone rant to his daughter and the recent Airlines tirade fiasco. What a guy! This won't be everyone's cup of tea for sure, but if the chicanery involved in high stakes pressure selling appeals to you, this is one of the best. Any one of the principals - Pacino, Lemmon, Arkin, Spacey or Harris - is top drawer and worth the price of admission alone. The set-up with Moss (Harris) and George (Arkin) over robbing the office was a clever sleight of hand piece by the time The Machine (Lemmon) 'fessed up.

Every performance here is what counts to make Mamet's words work (this was once a play, and you can tell from the language alone).  Pacino is really good as the office hot-shot, always selling even at the point of conning, which usually happens in this line of work.  As usual Harris is great and has another role to add to the great list he has.  However it is Lemmon who steals much of the show here as Shelley Levene (It's one of his best performances to date, which is a lot to say considering his career), who is the loser at the office who tries to sell, but is just starting to get a little too old for the job; that plus the added pressure from a fellow employee, played by Kevin Spacey in such a straight role it is actually an evil part.  And then there's Alec Baldwin, who I can see probably gave a lot of inspiration to Ben Affleck's character in the powerful Boiler Room.  His bit part is small but his most significant part to date.  In his crucial speech scene (the one where he says \"1st place is a car, 2nd place is steak knives and 3rd place, your gone), his character paints the picture for the trouble that is being a salesman.  And that is what so dynamic about the movie.  Not just the acting and writing (which are phenomenal, don't get me wrong), but also the feel that comes with the movie.  It is stunning pretty much all of the way, and very credible.  One note though: please don't watch this movie on television, you will see so much dubbing in the film that not only will it destroy the visceral effect the movie has for the viewer, but the lip readers will get confused.

            "content": "No film that I have ever seen expresses the path that the working man follows better than this one. Lemmon and Arkin are perfect as the salesman who's luck has turned towards the negative. You can literally see their will to live being sucked out of them with every blown sale and missed opportunity. Ed Harris is great as the angry salesman who is willing to do what it takes to save his own future. Kevin Spacey plays the tight -collared boss to a T, pushing people and not giving them the breaks they need.  The two most quoted characters of any movie I know are those played by Pacino and Baldwin. Pacino always excels in parts where his anger and ability to create believable outbursts are showcased, as they are in this part. All that I can say about Baldwin is that this is definitely his best performance and the writing for his character is unbelievable. I can watch his 10 minute scene over and over again. This movie rules in every way possible. 10 out of 10.   (I don't give that rating easily)",

This screenplay is brilliant, with many thought-provoking moments and also some emotionally resonant ones too.The other asset is the acting. In what is essentially an ensemble cast, the entire cast give superb performances particularly Al Pacino, Alec Baldwin and Ed Harris, and even Kevin Spacey makes a telling cameo.Cinematography and editing wise Glengarry Glen Ross cannot be faulted either. While most of the film takes place in one place, the cinematography and editing make this work.The story is always compelling and the film is further advantaged by strong direction, good pacing and well-written characters.In conclusion, a wonderful film helped by the script and performances especially. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "This is a well-directed adaptation of David Mamet's trenchant play about corrupt real estate salesman, and one's enjoyment of it will depend on whether one cares for Mamet's tricksy, obscenity-laden dialogue, and if one is a fan of first-rate acting. I'm less than enthusiastic about Mamet's work, which strikes me as gimmicky and repetitive. He seems to be always working out some private issues that he inevitably hangs on sexual or economic politics; and there is a lack of depth and originality in his work, and a penchant for envelope-pushing that I do not personally care for. On the other hand, Mamet actors seem to rate him highly, and tend to give their all when appearing in his work. Glengarry Glen Ross is exceedingly well acted by all,--Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Alec Baldwin and, in a small but pivotal role, Jonathan Pryce. The edge of desperation around the eyes, and the crack in his Ivy league voice, makes Jack Lemmon's character of Shelley a pathetic, well-rounded figure. Harris and Arkin breathe life into their one-dimensional characters, and seem continually to be shouting throughout the film. Pacino's performance is the most flamboyant and also the most disciplined of the group, making the loathsome Ricky Roma both charismatic and repulsive. He at times sounds like he's literally singing his lines, and he moves more gracefully than I've ever seen him. The play is at times ludicrous, and the resolution (who stole the leads?) is strictly from the Golden Age of television. I can't imagine that people in real life could carry on like the characters in this play do for more than an hour or so, as most normal people would, were they to conduct themselves at such a fever pitch, go into cardiac arrest or suffer a stroke. Overall this is a first-rate adaptation of an essentially second-rate piece of work, with hollering and swearing making up for imagination and true insight into characters.",

Great all-male ensemble does first-rate work (with Alec Baldwin in the newly-written role of the company's Standard Bearer, a demoralizing sales hotshot who sees the workplace as a battlefield); yet, for all their combined brilliance, the material as presented here is difficult to watch. Barbed, ugly, belligerent, it leaves the viewer beaten and bowed. Jack Lemmon's \"Save the Tiger\" only scratched at the surface of these characters' dead-end lives. Director James Foley goes a bit heavy on the rain-drenched pitifulness (his chilly blues and grays become visually monotonous), while Mamet--an intelligent and insightful writer--refuses to let up, giving us no relief from the pummeling deluge of verbal assaults. This is one to admire for its obvious craft and as a showcase for the actors, yet it's not a picture to take to heart. ** from ****",

There's Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), the successful salesman without much care for his cohorts. There's John Williamson (Kevin Spacey), a jerk inheriting everything. There's Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon), Dave Moss (Ed Harris) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin), the aging, less successful members who are probably about to get fired. But overall, things don't look to great for anyone.In conclusion, this is really the type of movie that could easily freeze your blood.

            "content": "One of the main themes of the works by David Mamet is the tension between human relationships and professional goals. In Speed the Plow, a movie producer is torn between greenlighting the artsy project sponsored by the young woman he likes and a more conventional script likely to become a hit. In American Buffalo, petty criminal \"Teach\" gaslights his fellow thieves at the prospect of a promising robbery.Seldom, however, the depiction of a toxic business environment smothering human relationships has been as effective as in Glengarry Glen Ross, a gripping drama/character study about a group of real estate salesmen followed the day before and after their office is robbed.Nearly every relationship in the film is some shade of awful. Desperate Levene (Jack Lemmon), former ace salesman on a bad streak, tries to appeal to supericilious middle-manager Williamson (Kevin Spacey), but all his pleas fall completely flat. Levene isn't bringing results so he is worth nothing to Williamson.The flipside is the relationship between Williamson and hotshot salesman Roma (Al Pacino). Roma despises his young, inexperienced boss and loses no opportunity to verbally tear him to shreds.See also Roma's persuasion of client Lingk (Jonathan Pryce), a man with crippling self-esteem issues who falls for Roma pretending to be his friend; or bitter Moss (Ed Harris), apparently supporting spineless Aaronow (Alan Arkin) only to attempt to drag him into a scheme.The only non-poisonous relationship, based on mutual respect, seems to be the one between Roma and Levene; the movie suggests they are symbolically the same person in a different stage of life, with Roma being Levene's brilliant past while Levene is Roma's bleak future. In fact, when Levene temporarily gains the upper-hand on Williamson, he adopts Roma-like mockery and scorn.The most vicious scene, however, is the brutal motivational speech delivered by powerful Blake (Alex Baldwin) to the increasingly humiliated salesmen. Mamet's staccato, profanity-heavy dialogue has never been sharper, his portrayal of how professional goals can destroy human relationships never bleaker. Acting is masterful throughout.8/10.",

            "content": "This movie wasn't a hard sale to me. Full of morality bankrupt, profanity spitting, corrupt characters trying to survive in a harsh environment like real estate made a worthwhile watch for me. I was going to see this movie, no matter what. After seeing it, this movie adds up to be, one of the most fearless uncompromising films, I ever saw, on the dark side of the America capitalism. Directed by James Foley, the movie follows the group of everyday real estate salesmen: Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), Shelley Levine (Jack Lemmon), George Aaronow (Alan Arkin), & Dave Moss (Ed Harris) being forced, by an a group of aggressive representative from the corporate office, in office manager, John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) & William Blake (Alec Baldwin) to sell more property or be fired if they fail. Driven by the \"always be closing\" mentality, the stress of their job, will ultimately pushes the characters into new ground of dishonestly and corrupted in order to save their job. Indeed, every dream has a price, but the question, is it really worth it? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this is one of the greatest acting ensemble cast, I have ever seem. While, all of the real estate characters do seem a bit shallow, unlikeable and too mean-spirited. I just glad, the film had all-well fine actors in it, so you would stick around, and watch the characters, rather than getting turn off, by their actions. All of the actors in this film, were masters in their own sense of style and work. I love how Kevin Spacey was able to make the jump from theater work to film. I love how Alan Arkin was able to expand his character's back-story. I love how Ed Harris was able to put his words, in, despite originally getting the fewer amount of scenes in the original play. I also love how Al Pacino was even able to show up for this film, despite originally not being able, too. However, I love Jack Lemmon's performance in the film, the most. His performance was so good that the Simpson's create a character call Gil Gunderson in his honor. Even Alec Baldwin, whom character wasn't even in the original Broadway stage-play was amazing! I love the tone and delivery of his famous speech. It remind me, so much of \"Greed is good' type monologues from 2000's Boiler Room, 2013's Wolf of Wall Street & 1987's Wall Street! I also love how David Mamet's screenplay considerably expanded his original play script for this movie. It provide more context of the pressure placed on the salesmen. Many critics, consider the screenplay to be far superior than, the Pultizer Prize winning original text; and I agree with that statement. Ever since its release, the film has been used to train real life salesmen how to sell and how not to sell. However, the movie does have some flaws. Since, the movie is based on the 1984 Tony winning stage play of the same name, it's limited to a few location sites. For a movie about selling real estates; you rarely see any of the sites like Clear Meadows, Glengarry Highlands and Glen Ross Farms, at all. Not only does most of the movie take place in the dull looking main office, but most of the film's astrosphere is depressing and gloomy. Nothing, but rain. Still, I have to give the movie some credit. Its melancholy tone does match with the jazz music that composer James Newton Howard, fish out for this film. I just wish, this movie wasn't limited by the amount of characters actors. Due to this, it feels weird, never to see, certain important characters like Doctor Ravadem Patel, Jerry Graff, the Nyborg couple or even the business partners, Mitch & Murray. You would think, that they would, at least, have a few scenes with them. We don't even see, any female characters in the film at all; only mentions. Not having important characters like James Lingk & Larry Spennel's wife, seem kinda wrong. It's also very odd, how uber masculine, this movie is. Seeing how in the real-life, 1990s, there is more female real estate professionals than men working that in field. You would think, there would be, at least, one female agent, but no! Because of this, the movie does seem, a little bit of a sausage feast. While, the movie can seem a bit unrealistic, due to a real estate office being able to yell and spit out that much profanity at each other, without getting fired. I just glad, most of the dialogue wasn't boring. Still, there were some parts, that felt like I was listening to a telemarketer, non-stop. Because of this, I kinda felt like the pacing for this film was indeed, drawn out and tedious. It really takes forever to get anywhere or establish anything. Since, the movie had so much salesman lingo and pitches, the movie could also, be a bit confusing at times. The most confusing scene in the film has to be the talk between James Lingk (Jonathan Pryce) and Richard Roma. A lot of people are saying that both men are gay due to the sexual references in his speech. However, as I see it, Roma smartly trying to use that, to seduce him into a sale. It's nothing more than lying and exploitation. This scene shows the dangers of American Capitalism. You really can't trust, a salesman with anything. Overall: This animalistic movie is a must watch. If you like the 1969's documentary, Salesman, 1985's Death of a Salesman or 1987's Tin Men, I think you would love this movie as well. So check it out. It's an extremely well-acted tragedy about men being force on the edge.",

I've never had much sympathy for the likes of salespersons; they badger you, they interrupt your day, and they lie.I remember when I bought a Kirby vacuum from a door-to-door salesman. He sold my wife on it so I come home and I'm $1800 poorer. They gave us a contract that was 18 months 0%. Well, the bank called and said, \"So, we have a contract here for 12 months 0%.\"I said, \"No. It's 18 months 0%.\"The bank said, \"We don't do 18 month 0% contracts.\"I said, \"Then void it and come get your vacuum.\"Ricky (Al Pacino), Shelley (Jack Lemmon), George (Alan Arkin), and Dave (Ed Harris) were in the business of selling property for Premiere Properties, a hole in the wall company in New York. They would do anything to make a sell--and who wouldn't if you depended on it to eat everyday. They are good salesmen, even if they *ahem* bend the truth a little bit, but even a good salesperson needs good leads.I think they said the word \"lead\" about 100 times in the span of an hour and 40 minutes. They wanted the good leads and didn't want the old stale leads. It was a miserable existence.I think the cast of \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" made the matter of property sales about as interesting as could be. The topic itself is not that enthralling, so to make a movie about it in which the audience doesn't go to sleep is admirable. I think all the performances were great, with Jack Lemmon and Pacino being the best. Did I ever feel sorry for them. I'm still shutting down any salesman that tries to pitch me, but I do feel sorry for them.",

Diverence is that in \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" all of the actors share most of their screen time together in the same scene's, the result is a true treat for us the viewers. Just imaging a scene in which Al Pacino, Ed Harris and Jack Lemmon are all outclassing each other constantly with every line they speak.But who deserves most credit for this masterpiece? Strangely not anyone of the actors but writer David Mamet does. The dialog in the movie is simply brilliant and make me consider this a 'verbal-action-movie'. Also the characters he created are really solid. Not one is a real 'good guy' and he shows that there is a dark side in everyone of us.I'm a big Al Pacino fan so he easily is my favorite character in the movie but maybe even better acting in this movie is Jack Lemmon. A character that also deserves more credit than it's getting is Ed Harris as Dave Moss. Big surprise in the movie is Kevin Spacey who at the time was a fairly unknown screen actor. Letting him play a big part in a cast filled with some well known names at the time seemed like a big gamble but Spacey reminds us constantly in every scene why he was cast. Alec Baldwin shows up in a unforgettable small role, as the biggest *peep* of them all.You have to be a fan of-and in the right mood to fully appreciate this character movie. Also watch this movie with your head clear, since it is not always easy to follow because of the very much and fast dialog and the fairly high pace of the movie.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Ultimately propagating the conundrum of \"Are all of us going to burn in Hell?\"The film starts out with the portrayal of three washed out salesman who are ready to be thrown to the wolves!! Alec Balwin is a motivator who comes in from corporate and dices all of the lackluster has-been salesmen to shreds.. Kevin Spacey is a spawn of nepotism, he is not only a jerk, but, a particular kind of jerk!! Al Pacino is the dynamo salesman who has the whole sales rigmarole by the throat!! Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin and Ed Harris are the three washed up salesmen who are toyed with and totally discarded for not producing!!What resonates in this film is the intensity of emotions that highlight the dark and psychologically negative aspects of failure!! You are making money, you are OK, you are not making money, you are not OK!! Suffice it to say, this is a masterpiece of understatement!!! An aging salesman is perpetually afflicted by ossification and despondence...If your career is finished, you in a sense are finished, and your emeritus years signify a painful non productivity...This should not be the case, however, being a closer as opposed to being a non-closer evolutionizes such a horrifying fate!!! The rejection these salesmen get is a lot colder than any Chicago winter that these salesman have experienced!! For these three, Chicago has become that toddling town that will let you down!! Stage play movies are often times my favorites!!! They raise the standards in cinema today!! The directing, the cinematography of the Chicago neighborhoods, and the aggregate irritation and unassuming aura which accommodates human failure by way of outdated restaurants and continuous subway noises, were all sensational in this movie.. Of course, the plethora of paramount acting performances by actors who are the best in the business is without a doubt this movie's stellar feature!! What is the acrimonious and ultimately prevailing concept to this movie? \"If life never chews you up and spits you out, then this is not a terrific film\"",

There's not a lot else other than that & about 10,000 expletives of which about 98% of those we could have done without.It's enough to put anyone off the worlds of real estate & tele sales but then that was probably the point.3/10",

I would of jumped at the chance to watch this on the stage with these actors. Genius. The script & the cast. Everyone is really good in this movie but right now I'm reminded of how amazing Al Pacino was. His performance seems so nuanced and smooth while also being brilliantly explosive. There's a competence and self-assuredness that he conveys so well just with the look in his eyes. He completely owns the space he holds in each scene. Out of all the cast members Alec had the least acting experience. This must have been a tough scene for him to perform in front of Alan Arkin, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey but friggin' nailed it! The entire ensemble functioned as one perfect unit. They were all 100% committed to the script and the film to point that (as I recall) they all forfeited their pay in order that the film could be done. The lighting and effects are first class. This is a masterpiece of film making. Lemmon brought his A game as did everyone else. For me, it's one of those films (in my top 100 favs list) that I watch every year, like I'd visit a fine art gallery.....experiencing it anew, in the moment. What happened to great film making? It's virtually gone today.",

Basically one day at a Chicago real-estate office, big man Blake (Alec Baldwin) gives a strong (and arrogant) incentive, and pressures the salesmen of the company to sell more or lose their jobs. First prize of this contest is a Cadillac Eldorado, second prize is a set of steak knives, third prize is being fired. No-one can afford to lose for good sales leads. The four salesmen, including Ricky Roma (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Al Pacino), oldest member Shelley Levene (a superb Jack Lemmon), George Aaronow (Little Miss Sunshine's Alan Arkin) and Dave Moss (Ed Harris) are now doing everything they can to make the perfect sale and get top of the leader board. There is a robbery, and unforeseen consequences will come to the characters. John Williamson (then little known Kevin Spacey), as Blake's associate is the man who is responsible for the leader board, and he is also just as arrogant as his over-ruler. Also starring Jonathan Pryce as James Lingk, who helps Ricky with some of the sales information. For me, some of the highlights were not just the quality performances, but the use of bad language, in some moments I found myself laughing. Jack Lemmon was number 43, Kevin Spacey number 4, and Al Pacino number 1 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Pacino was also number 26 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Robert De Niro) on The World's Greatest Actor.

His character is abusive, and his tone nothing but caustic, but that's why the \"Always Be Closing\" speech is so memorable. To say nothing of those brass balls, which he takes literally and puts his indelible mark on a movie with such a formidable cast.That scene plays very early on in the movie's running time, but it only gets better from there. The fiery temperament of David Mamet's words alternates between Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris and Al Pacino, each man lighting up the screen in his own time. Pacino and Lemmon both give it their all, but it's Lemmon (for me) who owns this. His exhausting desperation and endless sales drilling is the workhorse performance that shoulders most of the movie.But everyone here has their moment in the sun, and it's amazing what kind of excitement this movie's dialogue can generate.8/10",

While the storyline isn't overly interesting, the chief selling point of this film is in the performances. Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Alec Baldwin and Jonathan Pryce are all excellent in characterisations that are multi-layered and believable. In particular it's great to see Lemmon in such a raw role, he pulls it off immaculately; while Baldwin proves he's got more talent than you might expect in an explosive ten minute appearance. Writer David Mamet has to be given a lot of credit here in providing all of the actors with a strong script to work off in the first place. The film is full of profanity-laden tough talking by men seemingly on the edge of nervous breakdowns. The general atmosphere of the film is one of hopelessness and despair. It's not exactly a happy ride but it is a satisfying one. This is undoubtedly not a film that will appeal to everyone, seeing as it's theatrical trappings and dialogue-driven narrative will not be to all tastes. Although despite the limited locations, the film is well shot and lit, while the jazz score gives it a mournful mood that adds a lot to proceedings.Overall a very impressive emsemble piece. If you appreciate plays then this is a really good example of a cinematic presentation of such. It's more about acting and writing than cinema but don't let that put you off.",

            "content": "It was my luck to see this David Mamet play on Broadway about 1990, with Vincent Gardenia (as Shelley Levine - Jack Lemmon's role) heading a first rate cast. I liked it, but when the movie came out in 1992 I failed to see it at the time. This despite the fact that it's ensemble cast was considered as having done a great job in the film version by most of the film critics. Yet, despite this fanfare, except for nominating Al Pacino for best actor (for the role of hotshot salesman Ricky Roma), the Academy Awards did not note the film at all, and Pacino lost that year.But GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS really does not require \"Oscar\" recognition to remain among the top ten ensemble casts movie jobs in American film. It also is an intriguing look at the world of salesmen at it's most intense. The salesmen here are real estate salesmen (\"Glengarry Glen Ross\" are two valuable pieces of real estate the firm is planning to start selling soon - and a set of valuable customer leads on these properties are at the center of the story). Besides Levine and Roma, the other salesmen in the firm are Moss (Ed Harris) and Aaronov (Alan Arkin). This particular office of the multi-state realty firm is run by Williamson (Kevin Spacey). Part of the wildness of the film is that Williamson's style is not tolerant of the boy's club boasting and tricks of the sales force - tricks, by the way, that are not working as well as they used to.Sales are generally down, and the firm's partners send legendary super-salesman Blake (Alec Baldwin) to give a talk to the salesman. Blake is not standing for the old war stories of these blow hearts. He tells them how low they are all viewed by the top management, and is giving them a contest which is really an ultimatum: In one week whoever makes the most sales will be given a Eldorado as first prize. Second prize is a set of cheap steak knives. Everyone else outside of those two places will lose their jobs as failures.The salesmen are hard working, but there have been problems with properties they have to unload, as well as the fact that the leads dished out are hardly first rate. But if they were top notch salesmen they would be able to sell these properties - and they all claim that they are.Best is Roma - the hotshot salesman, who we see managing to download worthless, overpriced land on one Lingk (Jonathan Pryce) over drinks in a Chinese restaurant. He seems most assured of coming in first place. Levine is a once good salesman of some years earlier, but of late things keep falling between his fingers. Aaronov is an honest plodder, a tortoise to Roma's hare, but he has been turning in very few sales himself. As for Moss, he strikes the viewer as a constant complainer, and one gets the impression he really is not very good at his job.Roma is certain the Lingk sale will put him into the top slot. Then Levine comes in having made an $82,000.00 sale to an elderly couple (the huge amount is that it would be for 8 apartment units - like a small apartment house). They are wildly congratulating each other, when they learn the offices of Williamson were burgled during the night, and that some of the Glengarry leads were stolen. This jeopardizes both sales because of the police investigation going on.The film strips the entire cast of pretenses. Baldwin's part is relatively short (just one massive scene at the start - written for him for the film not the play). He is crude, vulgar, but direct. He does not care about events from fifteen years back that they might talk of - it's today that counts. His putting Moss into his place by pointing out his watch is worth more than Moss' current automobile is proof that however nasty his speech is it happens to be true. It was a wonderful cameo role for Baldwin.Lemmon's Levine is like Willy Loman, only a little younger. He knows how to lie and cheat customers with the best, but he has had problems with his daughter that have preoccupied him of late. But that is the same type of sentiment that Loman found is not part of the business ethic. Pacino's Roma is Lemmon's admirer, and they have the closest thing to a real friendship in that office. In fact, when Pacino is having problems with Pryce (having second thoughts on the sale after a talk with his wife), Lemmon actually tries to help Pacino out in a complicated lie. Harris' Moss is a slimy type - he tries to get Arkin into a scheme to steal the Glengarry leads from Spacey's office, even suggesting that Arkin is an accomplice after the fact no matter whether he'll do it or not. Arkin is a nervous type - a plodder - but both basically honest and also aware of his small caliber personality that can't gain respect from anyone (his one tirade is confronted by an increasingly annoyed Spacey who basically orders him to go out and have lunch!). As for Spacey, he is aware that his powers are only meted out from above, and he does what is ethical to the clients in an unethical business (we never hear what Baldwin tells him about his office management). But his openness with customers ends up screwing things for at least one salesman, and the whole pack feel he's a waste. Actually he turns out to be the smartest in the office.Despite Mamet's joyous use of foul language, GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS remains a marvelous ensemble work for stage and film, and a remarkably honest view of what really matters, in the end, in American business.",

In fact the biggest effect in the film is the scene where it is raining. Everything else is dialogues, monologues between the main roles with a few supporting roles. It's actually no wonder because it's an adaptation of David Mamet's successful drama. I usually have a problem when a drama is switched to a movie, but this movie is an exception. We are shown the amount of stress, emotions, lying, swearing and what not at real estate sellers. With the actors, everyone gave their maximum, there is no weak link, I was personally most impressed by Jack Lemmom and my personal favorite, Al Pacino, whom I would enjoy watching him reading the composition of the toilet cleaner. If you are looking for a flaw in the film, it is that it has not aged well in minor things, considering that it is still a 1992 film, but these are still trifles that are not important. Also this is not a film for everyone's taste because, as I stated, the film has no plot. I have to mention that the film contains over 200 swear words where the f word dominates.

Jack Lemmon is the desperate, pitiful Shelley \"The Machine\" Levine, hot favourite for imminent redundancy at a realty office that straddles the line between pushiness and con artistry. He's one of four salesmen given a sobering ultimatum: buck up, and get a Caddy, or fall down and get the chop. Ed Harris is Monk, whose sense of persecution is getting of hand; Alan Arkin the meek George, an obvious fall guy should a planned break-in go ahead. Al Pacino rounds out the quartet as hotshot Ricky Roma \u2013 first shown putting the moves on scam fodder Jonathan Pryce in a brightly-lit bar. Their boss is Kevin Spacey \u2013 apparently in the post due to nepotism. One minute he's superior, the next like a shamed child.Mamet's script is pungent, littered with acerbic one-liners, trenchant observation and four-letter words, while the sting in the tale elevates the film \u2013 adapted from a Pulitzer Prize-winning play \u2013 to the level of epic tragedy. The highest praise I can think of is that it recalls Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman, which also ripped apart the American Dream, along with Barry Levinson's fascinating Tin Men, though that work was more reconciliatory and less abrasive. The direction is claustrophobic if a little limited, relying as it does on just the one camera-manoeuvre, but it's the acting you'll remember, with exceptional performances across the board.

            "content": "Glengarry Glen Ross is an film adaptation of David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize winning stage play and it shows with its performance based drama and loose plot. At times I did wonder how much could the screen medium really add to the story? How do you shoot something that would be show to an audience entirely from one angle without making it boring but also not distill the narrative? It's odd. There are a few cinematic moments which stand out. One is as Levene steps outside the dreary grey office and into the night while Moss and Aaronow converse in the car, and here it almost veer into neo-noir territory, as he steps inside a payphone booth where the strong contrast of neon red on blue lighting, the lazy jazz backing and the rain make these salesmen's lives decidedly more bleak and morally ambiguous. Another is as Levene makes yet another sales call, and he murmurs an instruction to a off- screen secretary/assistant in what would be a busy office, but as the camera arcs around there is not a person in sight. Claustrophobia is also supposed to be key here, although to be honest I didn't notice that element. Anyways, it is always interesting to see how one medium can complement another.Many have already talked of the infamous monologue \"Coffee is for closers\" from Alec Baldwin. It is tremendously compelling, so much so that it becomes the mantra for real life sales industries. What is interesting is a slight drawback to this (and as he does not exist in the original play, this creates a new problem) - which is the effect of the speech in manifesting a sort of shared animosity for the dilemma in the four salesmen. This is in itself ironic because it is the complete opposite of what Baldwin preaches. And so Moss and Aaronow strike up a plan to commit theft against the company that would so easily fire them, and they both walk out of the interrogating office furious and completely in denial about the accusations leveled at them, but at the time, we do not know that only one of these reactions is genuine (which severely lessens its effect once we find out Aaronow is innocent, I think). But he has collaborated with another in the office.Another thing the Baldwin speech indicates is the lack of the star closer, Roma, whom does not even bother attending while he rests at the top of the leaderboard. He is already living out its ideals in his work, but by contrast he is not ruthless and without care, but almost seductive in the way he charms a potential buyer. He rambles on and on about philosophical and moral and abstract ideals, and after countless drinks and tender glances only then does he slip an offer to buy, no, an opportunity. Pacino conjures a master illusion from a dusty suit and slides his way into his heart. When Pryce arrives the next morning, meekly trying to reverse the purchase, he is again at work, and see how Pacino squirm and weasels his way once again, beneath a veneer of sleaziness (his strong reaction to winning a Cadillac is evident of this). And what does Pryce's character do upon discovering the manipulation? He doesn't erupt in anger and profanity, but begs forgiveness, as if he is the one who has let Roma down. And in this moment we know exactly why he is number one on the chalkboard. But the star must be Lemmon's Levene. His performance is remarkable; observe how effortlessly he switches into sales mode, how easily he pretends as if he was some important, high ranking sales associates with an abundance of wealth and inquiries and meetings to get to (Levene must evidently fantasise about such a career, such is the way he can instantly conjure them). When he pays a house visit to a potential (although they both know such a sale will not happen), he is sincere and honest and attempts to disarm the man with goodwill and familiarity, but beneath this persona we see a person who is cracking. He has been presented with a Catch 22, and cannot rise from the bottom, and feels disillusioned that such a veteran of his industry could be treated this way. He reacts with anger and profanity as they all do, but not before attempting to bribe and plead and threaten his way out of the situation to the office manager Williamson. This is so effective because we have prior witnessed his charm, and now he must beg, teary eyed, only to be shut down harshly. In Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street, the stockbrokers are straight up crooks, and there is no time wasted in establishing this, as booze and women and wild parties are hurled from the screen. Here, there is a semblance of authenticity because it is necessary to contrast the two to show just how miserable these men and their lives are. The leads are weak? F*cking leads are weak. You're weak. And so they lash out with tirades laden with profanity, and each victory is gloated unbearably, and each loss is treated as a tragedy. Who is the lowest on the chalkboard? It could be any of the four. They are each so desperate. And for what, 10%? Mitch and Murray, unseen, are the real winners here.",

            "content": "Glengarry Glen Ross, despite its grim subject matter, is one of my favourite films. Based on David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, it intelligently dissects the life of the salesman in more ways than one, a bit like how The Sopranos dissected mob life. All the weirder then that Glengarry Glen Ross has actually been used to train salesmen. That'd be like if mobsters turned to The Sopranos for advice on how to succeed at mob life. I suppose it speaks favorable of the film's portrayal of a salesman's life, but the point of Glen Ross is not to serve as a training video.Glen Ross deals with the lives of a handful of real estate salesmen. All of them except for the highly successful Roma (Al Pacino) are struggling with lousy leads. One rainy night they're called to the office where they receive some troubling news: the higher-ups have created a contest: whoever earns the most money will get a brand-new Cadillac; second prize is a set of steak knives (aka you're fired); third prize is you're fired (aka you're fired). Not exactly a comforting prospect for the salesmen. Burdened with the prospect of losing their jobs, each salesman tries to make the best out of the situation the only way they can: by lying, scheming, robbing, manipulating and any combination thereof. When the office is robbed, the police arrive the following morning to interrogate each salesman privately.From a 'realism' standpoint, the script feels 'artificial' in a Paddy Chayefsky's Network kind of way\u0085and that's a good thing. As Roma says at one point, \"anyone in this office lives on his wits.\" Everything they say means something. Double meanings and subtext abound. These people aren't here to casually talk to one another, but to make money. This involves selling not just a product, but an illusion as seen when Roma rambles philosophically to a potential client before revealing a piece of land he could purchase. Language plays a pivotal role in the lives of these men and director James Foley ensures the film's editing emphasizes the flow of the dialogue. The script is indeed one of the best parts and screenwriter Mamet actually added parts, like Baldwin's diabolical monologue on the sales contest and how much the salesmen (except the absent Roma) suck at their jobs.The ensemble assembled here is one of the best ever: Pacino, Lemmon, Spacey, Harris, Arkin, Pryce and Baldwin are all present and accounted for. But rather than letting too many familiar faces ruin the immersion, this is a case where it all fits (which just makes it more puzzling why Glen Ross wasn't a financial success upon release.) One of the film's biggest successes is that its indictment of the life of salesmen doesn't up the drama to such a degree that the film becomes unwatchable.

            "content": "\"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is writer David Mamet's masterpiece. In the 1992 classic, his rapid, incisive dialogue is quicker and more brutal than in every other movie he's done, and the characters, played by such people as Kevin Spacey, Al Pacino and Jack Lemmon, all exhibit a kind of rowdy vileness and vitriolic disposition that is appalling, engaging and astounding. Mamet's message is not just that real estate is a cutthroat business; the real focus of Mamet's screenplay, based on his 1984 Pulitzer Prize winning play, is the struggle between men--the need for a weak, hurting, woeful individual to lash out against those who prevent him from being better; and the need for those at the top of their game to slander those they know are starving.The movie's portrayal of a bummed real estate office down on their luck could be the portrayal of practically any tableau of unhappy, unruly men prepared to do anything to make a dollar. It's Mamet's characterizations--Al Pacino as Richard Roma, the slick, conniving, office leader; Jack Lemmon as Shelly \"the machine\" Levine, an old timer on a bad streak; Kevin Spacey as Williamson, the boss, a man who garners no respect from those below him; and Ed Harris and Alan Arkin as frustrated salesmen at the end of their wits--that makes the movie so important, so timeless. These are men of character who possess a twisted uniqueness, but also possess a common connection to all working people; they're fed up with work, with bosses, the unknowns, the pay, the long hours. They go through their routine gripped by spite and depression, confusion and anger, aware of how terrible their lives are, but too entrenched in their career to do anything about it. They're a part of the American dream but at the bottom rung of the ladder. They're living as capitalist independents but are no more satisfied with their work in the 20th century as a man might have been one hundred years before. They wear nice suits and ties and shoes, and some of them drive nice cars, but none of that can erase feelings of hopelessness and subjugation. When an upper level real estate agent gives a pep talk to Jack Lemmon and his coworkers on a dreary rainy night, he doesn't try to lift their spirits; he motivates by poking fun, denouncing, condemning and harassing.To Mamet, the real estate business doesn't try to make a man feel better about himself; it's there to make a man feel worse--to feel brutalized, hopeless and frustrated. And even those who make it-like the rich real estate agent who verbally tears down all he thinks are less than him--even they don't have any real end in life; for at the top, men still care about possessions and power.It's as though business traps a man, telling him what is good and right in life while shutting him out of every potential alternative. And as we see Jack Lemmon and Ed Harris and Alan Arkin battle against the relentless tide of job fulfillment, we see they have no other desires; all they care about is finding leads, twisting people's arms, making a few dollars. They come to believe that selling real estate is the most important thing in life, paramount to everything else, and their blinded pursuit ruins them, making them slouch in their chairs, making their eyes big and puffy, making them attack other men--good men--who were probably different people before they started. The film is visceral, bewildering, and depressing, showing what life could be for those who can't break out of a rigid system, who can't break free from a lowly, unhappy, position in life. The delivery of Mamet's dialogue by the actors is superb, ranking among the best ensemble casts of the 1990s. There is hardly a movie that more accurately shows people struggling to stay afloat in their job, besieged by inequities, dislike, and disrespect.",

            "content": "David Mamet just knows how to do it right. He's had a few misses as a director, but I can't see any way to deny that Mamet is one of the best writers to ever exist. With Glengarry Glen Ross he took on the bold task of adapting his own play for the screen and many have said that he actually managed to improve on the original format. Whether or not that's true, what is true is that the film is miraculous.Mamet studies several men as they traverse the hardships of working at a real estate office, told through one night and early morning when the pressure is on for them to close their worn out leads. The dialogue is Mamet at his finest; a cynical portrayal of blue-collar working that can get anyone who's ever worked a day in their life to relate. The frustrations, the bitter resentment towards peers and superiors, it's all feelings that anyone has felt and he pours it into this compelling journey of interesting and diverse characters.Looking at the roster of actors here it's kind of baffling that only one of them managed to get award nominations for their work in this, because every single member of the cast delivers fireworks; it's honestly one of the greatest ensembles ever put on film. Whether it's Jack Lemmon's heartbreaking desperation, Al Pacino's fury and swagger, Ed Harris' violent rage against the world or Kevin Spacey's smarmy superiority, everyone in the cast shines through each scene they have. This is a lesson on how to act in one hundred minutes; I could go on for days about the skill that these actors possess throughout this film, not a single one of them missing a beat. It's like they all had some private competition on who can act the best...and they all won.Still, what makes Mamet's script work so well is that it's not just a vehicle for these incredible actors; it's loaded with calculated flavor and universal themes that have lived on and even became more socially relevant now than they were when the film was made. Along with all of this, I loved the little running motifs throughout the film; the use of chewing gum as a sign of power in the situations between characters, the constant passing of trains potentially used to symbolize how lost these men are and how they're all just running in circles. It's a brilliant achievement on every level and one that totally sings from start to finish.",

While this isn't necessarily a killing drawback, it doesn't provide a reason to see the film rather than a good stage production.The compensation lies in the performances. For Alec Baldwin to steal the show from the line-up around him is a work of unparalleled larceny, and yet he does, with the help of a painfully funny new monologue provided by Mamet. The ghost of amusement in his voice as he asks, \"Oh, have I got your attention now?\" is something terrible to hear. He is Contempt Incarnate, and the outrageousness of the scene borders on the surreal.The rest of the cast is predictably good, with Harris and Arkin particularly adept at Mamet's cross-talk rhythm, Pacino masterfully arrogant, and Spacey, before he had hit stardom, icily memorable. Lemmon goes further; his work here has some of the iconic quality of his performances of the 1960s. (The \"Simpsons\" character modeled on Lemmon's Shelley isn't a bad bell-weather for enduring pop resonance.) The crawling sense of need he projects becomes something genuinely uncomfortable to watch. Arriving at a young couple's house drenched in rain, his gray-white hair plastered flat, and his mouth pulled back in its ghastly salesman's smile, he captures something alarmingly real about the price of failure in America. As his sales pitch evaporates he is at last left only with an increasingly forced chuckle. In a life that consists only of patter, tragedy is having nothing left to say.",

David Mamet takes his Pulitzer Prize winning Broadway play with his own screen adaptation to the big screen with an additional character pivotal to the movie written into the cast. Great acting from a terrific ensemble cast featuring Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin and Jonathan Pryce. Pacino was nominated as Best Supporting Actor from the group for the 1992 Academy Award. Any of the others it could be argued would have been worthy of a nomination themselves. Mamet had been successful with his screenplay of the remake of The Postman Always Rings Twice and his original story for The Untouchables on the big screen before Glengary as well as some lesser films. He would have limited continued success with such films later on like Hoffa, Wag the Dog and Hannibal. James Foley had never had a successful film as a Director before this and never has had since. It's a great character study but after studying them you find you don't care for any of the characters. Lemmon gives a sentimental performance but what is his character doing in this venomous boiler room real estate office specializing in selling worthless real estate in the first place? This may have been quick and snappy and explosive on the stage but on the big screen it's confined and claustrophobic. It's intense but there is no life and death plot to warrant it's intensity. The Lemmon character might be to old and desperate to keep his job but maybe it's time to collect social security and be a greeter a Wall Mart. For the rest of the characters move on and get a decent job somewhere else. Why all the drama? I would give this a 6.5 out of 10.",

Nothing strange there since it is, after all, an adaptation of a stage play and a Pulitzer Prize winner at that and writer and director have done the bare minimum to 'open it out' for the screen, venturing from the salesmen's room in the real estate office only briefly and logically to the Chinese restaurant across the street, the alley behind the office, Ed Harris's car and the home of a potential mark. Over and above everything else this is a film about language, the spoken as opposed to the written word or, more specifically the language as she is spoken in the workplace which means the spectrum running from elation to despair with everything in between. With language of this calibre it'd be a pity to waste it on hacks or journeymen actors so step forward colossi, none more so than Jack Lemmon giving on screen a performance to stand beside his James O'Neill on stage in Long Day's Journey Into Night (in which, incidentally, a then much less well-known Kevin Spacey played his older son Jamie). To the best of my knowledge Lemmon never gave a bad performance in his life, frankly the man was incapable of so doing, but his screen acting career was punctuated with a dazzling array of beacons from Ensign Pulver in Mr Roberts through C.C. Baxter in The Apartment via Some Like It Hot, Days Of Wine And Roses, Save The Tiger et al but all were as nothing compared to his Shelley Levene in this great movie which towers above everything else including Alec Baldwin's tour de force, Al Pacino's ruthless closer Ed Harris and Alan Arkadin's professional losers and Kevin Spacey's nepotic ass-kisser.

The one depicted in Mamet's celebrated play, and shown here on the screen to coruscating effect by director James Foley, is a veritable viper's nest, a hotbed of jealousy and desperation, peopled by men who have sold their souls, but don't know what for. Like strung out junkies, they crave for the golden leads residing in their despised manager's office, but only by closing the crappy leads they currently have will they gain access to the good stuff.Mamet briefly worked in the boiler room atmosphere of a real estate office, and the authenticity of his portrayal is both convincing and astonishing. There are no good guys in this film, just guys \u2013 desperate, cocky, hard-edged, ruthless, disillusioned, frustrated guys, and all, to some degree or another, a mirror on every working environment across the globe. Pacino is Ricky Roma, the hot-shot salesman on target to win the Cadillac for being the office's top salesman (\"second prize is a set of steak knives,\" whip-cracking motivator Alec Baldwin, in a brief, career-best performance, advises them, \"third place, and you're OUT.\"). Roma seduces his leads into buying by philosophising about morality \u2013 the very concept which he, and every other salesman, is forced to eschew in order to succeed. Pacino excels as a driven man with no time for sentiment, but with a soft spot for his colleague, Shelley 'The Machine' Levine (Jack Lemmon), the ageing, one-time hotshot from whom Roma has inherited the mantle, and from whom the younger man learned his skills. Levine's salad days are far behind him now though, and the turmoil is there in his eyes, giving the lie to the sharp patter and wavering confidence that can ebb and flow in the course of one conversation. Lemmon gives a totally convincing performance, making it hard for anyone to believe he had to learn any lines for the part, they seem so much a part of the man speaking them.The other office members in what is a knockout ensemble cast are Dave Moss, played by Ed Harris, an adept salesman frustrated almost to the point of paralysis by the nothing leads he is forced to pursue, and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin), a self-effacing nobody, making up the numbers in a career for which he is completely unsuited. These four men are overseen by John Williamson (Kevin Spacey), company man, nephew of a company bigwig, and a man for whom none of the others have an ounce of respect.The speed and ferocity with which Mamet's scathing lines are delivered supply an intensity to the story that is almost exhausting at times, and the viewer finds himself sympathising with almost everybody while liking none of them. It is as if Mamet is holding up a mirror to the screen, showing us what we would all inevitably become in similar circumstances. And at the same time he exposes the futility of it all, the meaninglessness of the intensity \u2013 it's all rented, everything we have; it's never owned and all we \u2013 and the characters on the screen \u2013 are striving so tortuously for is the illusion of security, something which is as substantial as a bubble in the wind.Glengarry Glen Ross is not a film for all tastes. The profanity rolls off every actor's tongue in an unstoppable tide, and the intensity will be too much for some. It is also little more than a filmed play \u2013 although the performance of the actors and Foley's skilled direction always provide something to capture the viewers attention \u2013 which means it is essentially a bunch of people talking.",

This is largely thanks to Foley's solid direction, which constantly comes across as cinematic while still highlighting what made the original story work so well: its dialogue. Most of that dialogue is lifted straight from Mamet's initial version by Mamet himself. It's fast-paced and unforgiving, mimicking real speech while actually being quite far away from it. It gives the movie's fantastic cast something to work with, and work with it they do. The performances here are fantastic; Lemmon, Harris and Pacino turn in some of their absolute best work (which is no small feat, that's for sure). The thing doesn't seem overly showy, even though it is. Instead, it just seems urgent and of-the-now, its players constantly clawing at each other's throats and its power dynamics shifting constantly. It's an impressive feat. It's also oddly enjoyable.

The film takes us inside the pressure cooker of a second-rate Chicago real estate office and the world of dead-beats, sits, streaks, and Cadillac boards. Where if you don't close, it's your job. Where desperate, angry men will do anything to get ahead, to get the premium leads. When two people \"talking\" and \"speaking\" about something mean different things, and listening can make you a criminal. When a man can look at the office across the street and see heaven, but in truth it's no better than where he's standing...just different. It is fascinating material, all the more so because I happen to be a salesman. GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS is the film that introduced me to the work of Chicago playwright David Mamet. I have since become endeared to the profane scherzo of the dialectic, the use of obscenity in a gritty realistic way; the cadence, the tempo and meter. Mamet, who wrote the script based on his lean play, uses small details to set a character up, instead of falling back on clich\u00e9s. There are no flashbacks or other tricks here, the information is supplied by what the character says in the throw-away lines and quick asides. In addition, Mamet has fleshed out the story line quite a bit for the film. Including the addition of Blake (Alec Baldwin), the guy \"from downtown, from Mitch & Murray\", whom Mamet uses to introduce the sales incentive, which serves as the catalyst of the drama: \"third prize is you're fired\". In his brief scene Baldwin chisels a realistic and frightening performance.The rest of the cast speaks for itself: an inspired Jack Lemmon as the powerfully desperate Shelly \"The Machine\" Levene; Al Pacino as the seductively slick Ricky Roma; Ed Harris in a bravado performance as Dave Moss, George Aronow, the hapless, but likable everyman played by Alan Arkin; Kevin Spacey as the street-lame office manager; and Jonathan Pryce in an effective role as a cuckold client. Each of the gifted cast members fall into the vibe of the speech and action that Mamet brings to the story. The director, James Foley, and his crew stay out of the way of the actors. With that much energy in a cast, to overstage the scene would have been distracting, throwing off the balance of the language. Foley knows it's about the characters and not about his personal style as a film maker; for that I give him credit. GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS is lightning in a bottle, a unique film with a great cast.

It is among one of the most intelligent and most poignant pictures of the nineties decade, and occupies some of the finest dialog and performances from then, as well. Al Pacino gives a breakneck performance as Ricky, and kicks in during the last forty minutes which are set entirely in the office, with the camera circling to whoever happens to be speaking. Spacey, who is arguably one of the best \"everyman's\" in film, is stupendous, and the same can be said for Alan Arkin. But the performances I was sold on the most were Jack Lemmon, who unintentionally makes his character sympathetic, despite being a shameful, snaky soul, and Alec Baldwin, whose appearance in the film is less than ten minutes, but carries forth an impact that is truly a lasting one. He tells the office in his verbally abusive speech that they need to \"Always Be Closing and need to remember four things when striking a deal; Attention, Interest, Decision, and Action. Baldwin's delivery is rock solid and was worthy of an Oscar nominee, which the Academy sadly overlooked. I thought if he would've appeared a few more times during the film it would've been apparent he got a nomination. But that's the beauty of his performance - he shows up, bats off obscenities, passes judgment, and then walks out the door. What a beautifully cynical performance he gives.The whole film can be summed up by the phrase, \"beautifully cynical.\" It paints a bleak, gray portrait of the real estate world, how foggy and grim it really is, where desperation, thievery, and cloudy negotiations cut through honesty and devotion. The picture was based on a play by the film's screenwriter, David Mamet, and looks and feels every bit like one. It has only a handful of basic settings, cut-throat characters, some of the sharpest monologues out there, and the time just fleets past you. Glengarry Glen Ross is a deeply involving gem of a picture, all leading up to a heartless and involving conclusion. It's a shame a great film by all these actors today is seldom seen.Starring: Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, and Jonathan Pryce. Directed by: James Foley.",

            "content": "\"Glengarry Glen Ross\" left me with mixed feelings regarding real estate salesmen. The depiction of their dishonest tactics was so bold, accurate and eye opening that I wondered if salesmen weren't the epitome of the word 'manipulation'. Yet, I also felt sorry for them because their eagerness to sell was often proportional to desperateness. And Jack Lemmon's performance as Shelley Levene is essential to understand the pressure endured by these men who can go from 'closers' to losers in the blink of an eye.It's a rotten, nasty and hypocrite world indeed where Levene used to be the top-dog before slipping into mediocrity and desperately trying to reconquer a lost glory. Levene is renowned by the Simpsons fans, for having inspired the recurrent character of Gil Gunderson: the poor schmuck who could never sell anything. Gil made his first appearance in the episode where Marge worked as a real estate agent. Her boss Lionel Hutz then revealed the unforgettable secret: \"the right house is the house you sell, and the right person is anyone\". The opening speech delivered by Alec Baldwin echoes Hutz' paradigm with such closeness it's almost scary. As Blake, the slick hot-shot from the office owners, Alec Baldwin sets the tone by assessing the new rules of the game: everyone must sell to the leads he's assigned to in one week, to get access to the cherished Glengarry leads. The first prize is a Cadillac, the second a set of knives, the third one is \"you're fired\". Far from the inspirational-trainer model, Baldwin exemplifies the dictatorship of results, valuable for any other business, such a vital issue he doesn't even embarrass himself with courtesy. I work in a real estate company, but even before, I knew men like this and the painful truth is the following: if you're touched b their words, you're the winning type, if you're exasperated by the contempt they display and the way they exploit wealth as an alibi for competence: you're not cur for the business. Naturally, the employees are all upset and we're tempted to empathize with them. I even related to their constant nagging about the leads' weaknesses, because I had to deal with their issues, and quickly learned when a 'no' meant 'no'. In one of the film's most memorable scenes, Levene tries to convince a reluctant buyer and while he's cordially invited to leave the house, there's so much despair in Lemmon's eyes I felt he was at the verge of cracking up and starting to beg on his knees. And as we go deeper in the man's motives, we feel more indulgent, but James Foley's directing conveys a shadowy and film-noir vibe, as if we were following gangsters, which takes all its relevance when Ed Harris and Alan Arkin contemplate easier ways to get money. Paraphrasing \"The Godfather Part II\", 'this is the business they've chosen'.\"Glengarry Glen Ross\"' plot is complex, but it's fascinating how the complexity is governed by men who're put to extreme limits, it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe, the eternal ends justifying the means. The whole business is rotten and even if we try to empathize, we witness the blatant manipulation of a weak customer. The manipulator is Ricky Roma, played by Al Pacino, (who was Oscar-nominated for the role) sensing the insecurity of his client, after long philosophical monologues about love and life, in fact, a Machiavellian exercise in seduction to lure him into signing the contract the same night. We understand why he is the best, and how significant his absence was during Blake's speech; he was above the flood of insults his unfortunate colleagues received.To complete the cast ensemble, Kevin Spacey is Williamson, the in-between manager who crystallizes all the hatred and not without reasons: never on the sit, least experienced yet the one in the safest place thanks to his connections. No more or less jerk than the others though, Williamson indirectly mirrors the innate hypocrisy of their jobs: treated with respect when his services are needed or like crap the rest of the time. The script features different layers of corruption and moral flaws finally exploding when pressure is too much to take, in a cinematic blaze of energy, humor, anger and loads of some of the most memorable F-bombs ever shouted in a film, especially from Ed Harris who personifies the bitterness and anger of the average worker who can't take it anymore.\"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is remarkably acted, directed and written, one of the best play-to-film adaptation, resonating like a modern \"12 Angry Men\". It's easy to tell that David Mamet 'knew the ropes' when he wrote the dialogs, the script hasn't lost one ounce of significance especially during our days of economical crisis. And Lemmon, in a heart-braking performance, highlights the limits one man can pushed up to, for money, and the sometimes exhilarating, sometimes devastating, but always corrupting effect of 'winning'. I can't understand how neither Jack Lemmon nor David Mamet were Oscar-nominated. Pacino was great but as a scene-stealer, Lemmon was the soul of the film, and this performance is one of his career's highlights, with a wide range of emotions sometimes displayed in one scene.And I still can't get over his teary eyes while saying \"my daughter\" as a last-ditch attempt to gain Spacey's sympathy. But being 'the Machine' doesn't prevent from being victim of 'machinations' and Spacey's answer made me realize why the film is so full of profanity. I said in the review \"it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe\" in fact, I forgot the ultimate step which consists on two words, and one of them is the F-one.It's only fitting that the most repeated line of the film is the one that best sums up the nastiness of the world it's plunging us into.",

            "content": "I decided to watched this movie because of the outstanding cast. Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Alan Arkin, Alec Baldwin. With those names, this movie couldn't fail. And it didn't. It isn't a high tension corporate espionage type thriller. In fact in many ways it's not that exciting. A lot of the movie is set simply inside a real estate office. But the movie portrays perfectly the problem of corporate greed, in which numbers are more important than people, and where successes of the past are quickly and easily forgotten in the cold, hard reality of \"what have you done for me lately?\"The sales staff (with the exception of Roma - Pacino) is struggling, and so a heavy hitter from \"downtown\" - Baldwin - is called in to read the riot act to them. Baldwin only appears in the first few minutes of the movie, by the way, but he nailed the part perfectly and left a lasting impression. Basically the message was \"sell, or you're gone in a week.\" The reactions of the various salesmen and how they handle the pressure is what makes the movie. I had different reactions to each one. Moss (Ed Harris) came across as throughly unlikeable - a whiner and a manipulator who seems to want to get away with doing as little as possible and who doesn't have the guts to get his own hands dirty. Aaronov (Alan Arkin) came across as a decent guy who probably was totally past his prime but couldn't imagine not being in real estate. Williamson (Spacey) seemed exactly as the other characters seemed to portray him: not exactly up to the job given him as office manager. Not surprisingly, the movie revolved around Levene (Lemmon) and Roma. Roma is the typical super salesman. He'll win some and he'll lose some and in the end he'll be fine. His biggest concern wasn't losing his job; it was losing out on the Cadillac promised to the most successful salesman! He really wanted that car and the prestige that accompanied being Number One! Levene was the tragic character in the movie. A former sales star displaced by Roma, he's struggling, he has an institutionalized daughter whose medical expenses are high and he needs this job badly. Of all the characters, he's the one you root for, and, in the end, the most memorable line in the movie came from a conversation between Levene and Williamson. Williamson gives him a useless lead: someone who'll buy anything but has no money to pay for it. Levene makes the sale and thinks he's on top again, then discovers the truth. Then:LEVENE: Why would you do this to me? WILLIAMSON: Because I don't like you!Those two lines just seemed to sum up so much of what this movie was trying to say.The dramatic tension comes eventually from the theft of prime sales leads. Who stole them? Which one of these guys was desperate enough to do it? It may not be the most exciting story ever, but your attention will not waver until you find out. 8/10",

            "content": "Five minutes into the picture & there's so much awesomeness on the screen that it's too much to handle. Boasting a star cast of Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin, Alan Arkin & Jonathan Pryce, all brilliantly introduced in the film's opening moments, Glengarry Glen Ross is an acting powerhouse but what makes it even better is its deftly written story & excellent direction.The story of Glengarry Glen Ross concerns four real estate salesmen working for Mitch & Murray who are berated by the very person their superiors sent to motivate them, and find out that they have limited time to close the deals or they're fired. First prize is a Cadillac, second is a steak of knives & third is getting the sack, their night begins on a high-pressure note where some try to finish the given job while others plan to hit back on their employers.Expertly directed by James Foley, the film instantly sets up its premise & is highly gripping once all the characters have been introduced. David Mamet's screenplay is another gem that provides ample on-screen time to each one of its characters while its foul-mouthed dialogues further amplify its intensity. Also, Cinematography makes fine use of its low-light photography & Editing handles the subplots so well that it ends up making the story all the more engaging.Coming to the performances, every single cast here manages to shine in their given roles. Pacino is incredibly charismatic, Harris covers his character's frustration amazingly well, Lemmon delivers possibly the most impressive performance of them all, Spacey chips in nicely with what he's given & Alec Baldwin is present on the screen in only one scene yet his show-stealing monologue will manage to stay with the viewers long after the film has finished.On an overall scale, Glengarry Glen Ross is an intensely interesting cinema that enters through the back door of a real estate office to examine the tactics used by salesmen to do their duty. And it can be applied to any existing occupation for everyone is only trying to make a living & there is always too much pressure to succeed. Baldwin's speech can be taken either ways but if one is able to see the intent behind it, then it's the best motivational speech of all time. Highly recommended.",

I remember watching the scene with Alec Baldwin before but apparently forgot what movie it came from. I was so pleasantly surprised to see it here again! I remember an Al Pacino soundboard with him saying he was Richard Roma and once again, I had no clue this was the movie where it came from. It was so cool to see these little video and audio clips I had seen and heard before come to life here! Anyway, the movie's only fault is probably how Alec Baldwin should have appeared more.I thought he was going to be the new boss in this company, but he was just there as a motivational speaker. Al Pacino of course makes this movie. I was really impressed at how they took such an adult concept and put it in a movie that was only 100 minutes long. Normally, you'd think a film that iconic with such big name actors would be long and epic. I'm not complaining at all. This movie was still great and I loved how it seemed to be really saying something about business. I'm not into real estate or big stuff like that, but I did think it's something most workers can identify with. It's worth its reputation, even if I couldn't identify it at first. ***1/2",

We watch the pressure and the difficulties that the salesmen face everyday in their job and what they have to do in order to sale as many leads as they can. The direction which was made by James Foley was very good and he presented very well the lives of the salesmen from the inside, with their highs and their lows and he made a very good combination of both good and bad salesmen. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to admit that Jack Lemmon who played as Shelley Levene, Ed Harris who played as Dave Moss and Al Pacino who played as Ricky Roma were simply amazing. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Kevin Spacey's who played as John Williamson and gave a different touch in the movie.",

            "content": "Every aspect of this film should have received an award nomination. Every aspect of this film is done to a point. It's a play on the big screen, but it's an intense and introspective search of human desperation in an isolated incident, filmed so perfectly and naturally that the viewer can't doubt its realism. In the style of Arthur Miller, we have a story that may seem to desire the reform of the real estate industry, but that's absurd. It is an examination of the human reaction to having their back to the wall. Calm; negotiations; bribery; dirty deals; thievery; crime; and desperation.We have a film of immensely emotional and carefully constructed dialogue. Mamet builds the characters and feelings of the real estate agents through each line of dialogue. The screenplay dictates more a character study than a plot. The slow reveal of events only works to further characterize and emphasize personality.With such great characters in the film, they need great performances to make them come alive. Jack Lemmon leads the pack by far. Cheated out of a nomination, it feels like Lemmon is playing himself \u2013 a washed up character who once was the best. You can see the pain, the desperation, and the raw emotion on his face, but you can hear it in each line delivered. Lemmon leads the film and drives the character study, and he is the main subject. Al Pacino delivers a finely tuned and seasoned role that supports Lemmon' character through his downfall. Alec Baldwin punches out a brief performance with an intensity that the catalyst for the entire film needs. Alan Arkin is the pathetic one that was always pathetic. Arkin reads between the lines and conveys a convincing character. Ed Harris plays the character of rage and revenge, the one who has always been cheated, maybe an alcoholic \u2013 and Harris gets it right. Kevin Spacey, unfortunately, is dull and blah. His character is supposed to be a stone statue, but even a statue can have a fire in his eye.James Foley directs a monster of a cast through a delicate screenplay, turning in a beautiful film. The piece takes place in a naturally built production design, complete with a Chinese restaurant and a real estate office. But everything is buried too deep under the natural realism of the film. The emotions are perfect, but somewhat stale. It feels like a sweet glazed jelly donut without the jelly. There's a beautiful film that has substance, but no essence. Here, we have the 'Death of a Real Estate Agent', but just one notch below \"Death of a Salesman.\"",

            "content": "If Michael, Magic and Larry, etc. became the first ever \"Dream Team\" of basketball players in 1992, then the cast of the \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" should be considered the \"Dream Team\" of male acting. There's Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, Jonathan Pryce and Alec Baldwin. You won't find seven better names in an opening credit sequence.Together they make up the all-male cast of the film adaptation of David Mamet's play and they lend it the sheer power that this exploration of human nature through the eyes of desperate salesmen might not have otherwise had.It's no surprise director James Foley was incredible wary of taking a story that clearly belongs on the stage and turning into into a film. \"Glengarry\" is dialogue-driven and there's absolutely no physical action in the entire script, which takes place in less than 24 hours real time. It relies heavily on impassioned monologues and the morally ambiguous characters delivering them.The film's first major scene features an angry speech from Baldwin meant to fire up a group of slimy, foul-mouthed real-estate salesmen, explaining that whoever finishes top in sales wins a Cadillac and the loser gets fired. Firm boss Williamson (Spacey) hands the men tired leads and they complain that without the new Glengarry leads, they won't sell a thing.The highlight is a 66-year-old Jack Lemmon as Shelley Levene. I'm baffled at the fact that he received no Oscar nomination considering his status with the Academy. Levene is completely desperate: he works the old leads until he can't anymore, tries to bribe Williamson for Glengarry leads and Lemmon absolutely nails the obnoxious salesman who always has some cheap maneuver in his back pocket. Instead, Pacino got the nomination as Ricky Roma, the hotshot salesman with a serious attitude. He's excellent, but we've seen Pacino with that kind of command numerous times before.\"Glengarry\" is a tough film, but Foley and this amazing cast sell you on it the best they can. The story leans on its characters, the talent playing them and the illustrative and attention- seizing monologues they deliver and it can lean away considering those aspects are like impervious steel. There's no way the film could be handled any better. Foley gives maximum effort to provide the most compelling angles for the dialogue, shots that will reveal as much character as possible and stimulate audience thinking. Its very open-ended themes will connect with only a chunk of its viewers, but you have to admire the absolute power that this amassing of talent commands on the screen. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey and Alec Baldwin head up this adaptation of an award-studded stage production. Naturally, given a cast so drenched with talent, the audience is going to want to see them flaunt their acting chops, and thankfully, that's the key to this entire production. Without a tight band of intense, versatile, believable characters at its core there's no chance a plot that revolves around sales calls and a bland office robbery would be anything more than a snoozer. But in this cast's hands, with this combination of sharp, passionate dialog and sleazy, self-serving lack of morality, it's totally entrancing. Like many play-to-film interpretations, there is a certain amount of stagnation in terms of the film's scenery. The vast majority of the action takes place in a sales office, with phone calls, police interviews and (de)motivational speakers providing the flavor. Those tame surroundings work in a variety of unusual ways, though: as a means to ground the story in reality, an exercise in diverting our attention solely to the acting, and a device to give the rare peeks outside the office's not-so-friendly confines an added dash of color. A master class in cadence and characterization, it's a deep, emphatic and intoxicating look at the gamut of techniques a desperate salesman can (and will) employ.",

            "content": "I have been longing to watch a movie of this kind. Simple, minimal, yet rich with ideas that probe the mind. This reminds me of movies like Buried, 12 Angry Men, and The Big Kahuna. Limited setting, no significant plot, just interactive dialogue delivered by superb acting. Movies like this are excellent at portraying the essence of cinema, acting. The ability to cause emotion in an audience through tone, expression and posture. Sadly movies try to wow you with CGI, musical effects or shocking gore. But true wonder is usually reached through empathy with an actor that truly expresses some aspect of humanity.The movie is just a series of conversations between real estate agents. They talk with clients on the phone or among themselves. Knowing this one might expect a slow boring movie, that is not the case. Instead, one is met with subtle humor and intriguing characters that grab your curiosity. The main sociological context here is a critique of capitalism that manifests through the movie's portrayal of the working man. The working man in this movie has given up his morals and values for the sake of living. Money making and materialistic possessions are equated with power and with the essence of the masculine itself. This obviously has a lot of negative implications for the health of our society as a whole.There is nothing that special about the cinematography, soundtrack or otherwise, but there doesn't need to be. For the real strength of such a movie is the collection of actors that drive it forwards. Another weakness is the lack of women in the movie. Of course, that may be done on purpose with a certain aim of describing how males dominate the workplace, but still a female perspective could have added nuance to the commentary and to the progression of the ideas being discussed.",

But I couldn't see myself seeing this over and over.If for no other reason than the movie's ending and how my favorite character has done something (for desperate reasons) for which there is no recourse but to be fired.

            "content": "\"Glengarry Glen Ross\" revolves around a group of underperforming real estate salesmen who are given notice that if they don't turn around their misfortunes post-haste they're out the door at the end of the month. Unfortunately, the leads that they have to work with make this task difficult, so they scheme to get their hands on the new 'Glengarry Glen Ross' leads that are 'for closers only'.The first thing that must be said about this film is that the cast is outstanding. Let's see, we've got Oscar winners Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Alan Arkin & Kevin Spacey and Oscar nominees Ed Harris & Alec Baldwin. Each of these individuals delivers a top-notch performance. I hate to single anyone out but it must be said that Lemmon's performance in particular is awe-inspiring. In the end, though, Pacino was the only cast member nominated for an Academy Award.David Mamet's script, based on his own Pulitzer Prize-winning play, is also top-notch. There is a certain cadence to his language, peppered with profanities as it is. Most importantly, it savours strongly of realism and draws us into the world of these high-pressure salesmen. I cannot fathom how it could have gone without an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.James Foley's direction is ably handled but it's nothing to get excited about. Since the film is based on a stage play there's not much of an opportunity to get creative anyways. The score by James Newton Howard is decent as well and sticks firmly in the background like the jazzy soundtrack choices.In my opinion, this film is an under-appreciated gem. The DVD seems to have been discontinued by the studio, which further illustrates the film's lack of respect. By all means, seek out this film and give it the attention that it deserves.",

            "content": "My strange title spells out the A B C of selling - Always Be Closing but also hints at how ugly this film's dialogue often is.But David Mamet's screenplay, from his Pulitzer prize-winning play is about a man's world and is set in one, where men of varying personalities and abilities speak freely as men do, often in passion, often in anger and often with both.Whilst cinematically restrictive, director James Foley's rather claustrophobic 4:3 ratio swings along with the crisp, tart dialogue and soon one is entranced by the super-actor ensemble cast of Ed Harris, Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Alan Arkin, Jonathan Pryce and Alec Baldwin. Even Jack Lemmon pulls in one of his best ever performances in a sort of Death of a Salesman type of character who knows he's lost his magic touch and hates it even more when reminded of this.Which he is, often by the intentionally obnoxious, condescending comparative youngster Baldwin, as he pounds out the brutality of selling real estate in Chicago. Each man has his own turn to pour out his grievances, bitterness and above all, rivalry, yet they all have a common aim, not to get fired - and to get the figures that the Baldwin whizz-kid wants and where the difference between salesman of the month is a new Cadillac and second is, well, steak knives.The actual story pretty well takes second billing as the dialogue and the men's scorn, wrath and lives are put on the line, exposed like dirty washing put out to dry. One could easily give a higher score than I have done and maybe I should have, but I'm plumping for 8/10, as as I said, quite a lot of the dialogue is fairly grating and is often downright nasty, so it's not the easiest or most enjoyable film I've ever seen. Taken as an actor's piece (Pacino was Oscar nominated) and a study of modern day male rivalry, then it is excellent.",

            "content": "There is a great scene in this movie. Actually there are many great scenes, but I choose to mention this one since it sets up the main course of action. The scene is relatively simple: three worn out salesmen are told that they're fired and have one week to regain their respective positions, or they're fired for good. Simple, yes, but it is delivered with a scorching fierceness that makes Alec Baldwin's roughly six minute performance resonate throughout the entire film. But in doing so, it doesn't overshadow or diminish the rest of the performances which are great even by themselves. So in putting all these performances together into one film you truly have something that is greater than just the sum of its already good parts.The film seemingly draws from Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman,\" but it shows what Miller's play chose not too: professional struggle. Meaning not at home, but at work. Not with wives and sons, but with co-workers and bosses. Basically the other side of the spectrum and it is no less interesting to see especially when it is delivered so well. Throughout the film the camera is relatively static, the characters in only a few different places all wearing the same plain clothes. But the subtleties and little gestures of each character flesh them out as to almost be palpable to someone watching. The use of profanity is also very good. Many film's use profane dialog as punchlines or simply since it is like violence in action films: it sells. What \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" offers is not characters who talk, but character who convey emotion, and that is the essence of human speech - both in real life and in the movies.Scripter David Mamet also co-wrote (albeit under an alias) the screenplay for the action film \"Ronin\" from 1998. On the surface it's an action movie with great car chases, but the dialog there is reflective of Mamet's style that he demonstrates here. Not surprisingly \"Ronin\" is one of the best rated action film's here on IMDb and that, at least by now, shouldn't come to anyone as a surprise. --- 9/10Rated R for profanity. Ages 13+",

Fellow strugglers Moss and George moan mightily about this inhuman treatment. Only Roma, on a hot streak, seems untouched by the impending deadline.Glengarry Glen Ross is a masterpiece on many levels. A masterclass in writing from Mamet, whose excoriating script dissects masculinity and the futile pursuit of mammon. A masterclass in ensemble acting, with Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin and Kevin Spacey all in devastating form as men keeping their head above water, and Alec Baldwin in a near-cameo that is still the benchmark for any actor who only has one scene to make an impression. Even an incongruous Jonathan Pryce, as Mark Lingk, manages not to get lost among his testosterone-fuelled contemporaries. But if it is not a contradiction to select a stand-out in an ensemble piece, then Jack Lemmon's performance simply defies description. In a climatic scene with Pacino then Spacey, he moves from angst to arrogance to obsequiousness, a multi-dimensional delivery of character that remains unsurpassed.As befits the material and performances, the directing is unobtrusive. It rains constantly. People are not nice. There can be a hell in this world, as Pacino says, and I won't live in it. We do, however, glimpse it here. Superb.",

            "content": "I remember when this was previewing (as trailers) in theaters in the early nineties before it came out; most of the audience couldn't figure out what it was about, so it was poorly marketed. It's ironic that it's about selling - the selling of a concept, a dream, that glorious piece of American property we all think about at one time or another. Since then, the film, like \"Shawshank Redemption,\" has grown in reputation, and rightly so. Perhaps the greatest all-male ensemble cast was put together to flesh out seven unique, intriguing characters who all let loose their rage and despair on camera (I used to think the best male cast was \"The Great Escape\" from '63, but I now confine that opinion to the sixties decade). Most of the characters make their living in a real estate office, but it's like no such office I've ever been in. Though it's never spelled out, I think this is where all those horror stories about purchasing useless swamp land come from. The characters must make their living via this 'hard sell' process - they're probably selling stuff which they know is no good and they've developed intricate con(niving) stories to pretty up the items, but they're probably also filled with self-loathing and a general displeasure with the world for being in the position they're in. But this is conjecture, amateur psycho-analysis developed for those truly superior film stories (from David Mamet's play) where the viewer finds himself 2nd-guessing the complicated characters. On the surface, a couple of the characters (played by Lemmon & Pacino) seem to actually enjoy being at the top of their game, old school professionals with much pride in their work and who make this selling to unsuspecting 'victims' a new kind of art form.Much, if not all, of this information comes from the lengthy dialogue by Mamet. In this film, the dialogue is all-important not only for imparting factual information but in the nuances and style presented by each performer. Unlike most other feature films, where actors enjoy acting 'on an impulse' for many of the scenes, disregarding much of the written word, here they had to stay exact to the script. Each of their lines and, therefore, each of their speeches needed to remain within this strict framework yet, at the same time, the actors had to convey a reality to the story - to not make it look like simple acting out of a screenplay or reading a bunch of lines. They really had their work cut out for them and, man, does it show in the finished product, because they made it work. This is why one may have heard elsewhere how Baldwin's 7 minutes of screen time are the best of his career (I once played his scene to the office staff I worked with in the mid-nineties and they were just spellbound during the entire thing; afterwards, they looked shellshocked). It's also inspiring that each of the ensemble, each creating a distinctive and memorable character, succeed for themselves on every level - there are no weak parts.If I had to pick one as a favorite, I suppose mine would be Lemmon's 'the machine' Levene, the older veteran of the bunch. Lemmon threw out most of his well-known mannerisms & tricks and, at the same time, drew on his many years of thespian experience. He catches lightning in a bottle here as an older man at the end of his rope, with problems a viewer can really sympathize with, but also swaggering with offensive personality traits that make you realize he's his own worst enemy. One minute you feel that sinking despair he seems surrounded by, like a drowning rat (in the rain, in a phone booth); the next you want to slap him for being such a boorish loudmouth. He ends up with the best arc of the story and it's brutal by the end. Pacino is excellent as usual as the smoothest operator; we're used to hearing Pacino yell by now, but here it really does make you wince when he let's loose. And speaking of yelling, Harris just explodes in his final scene, almost literally. The rage building within him throughout the film is released in a torrent, drenching the walls - it's an unnerving display of male anger rarely, if ever, captured in the movies. Interesting to note that Spacey, one of Hollywood's most celebrated actors nowadays, comes off as 4th or 5th best in this, but his is the least flamboyant character. And I probably related more to his office manager than any of the others.",

The only other work to do this at this standard is Arthur Miller's play \"Death of a Salesman\". Other films that have done this, \"Wall Street\" and the more recent \"Boiler Room\" are good but not as good as this.Remarkable character work by every actor involved here portrays the heartbreaking and merciless atmosphere these people are caught up in. Of the four real estate salesmen we meet in this movie, only one of them, Roma (Al Pacino), makes any money at it. Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon) was once a great salesman now on an irreversible decline and is on the point of collapse. The other two Aaronow (Alan Arkin) and Moss (Ed Harris), shuffle on hopelessly but Moss is thinking of pulling out and screwing over the office while he's at it. They are lorded over by the office administrator Williamson (Kevin Spacey), who looks down on them all even though he's never actually been a salesman himself. But things heat up for them all when a pitiless corporate hotshot Blake (Alec Baldwin) is brought in to tell the losers among them to close deals or they will be fired...Fantastic from the get-go, nearly every moment of this drama shines. Three scenes stand out: Roma's scene in the restaurant early on where he seduces someone he randomly meets (Jonathan Pryce) and through careful schmoozing turns that encounter into a sale. In parallel to this is a scene taking place across the road in the sales office, where Roma's hapless colleagues are getting their ears burned by Blake. Then there is the final scene where Levene sees all his hopes destroyed by Williamson, after the latter discovers that he's behind a robbery at the office.Bizarrely ignored and under-hyped at the time of it's release, only now is \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" receiving the kind of adulation it deserves.A winner.",

This is truly one of those films that one cannot imagine being remade with any success because it is hard to imagine finding actor's more perfectly suited to the roles, who more perfectly understand both their own characters and Mamet's unique rhythms, and who click so precisely.So, even if you've never liked Lemmon much, or you've found Pacino over-the-top, Ed Harris dull or Alan Arkin annoying, see this movie, because you will take away a profound respect for their talents.",

            "content": "While 'Glengarry Glen Ross' deals with the world of real estate sales, anyone who has sold cars, vacations, investments or any number of other things that require a 'close' will be able to relate to the high-pressure desperation these salesmen, its characters, constantly live under. David Mamet's brilliant screenplay is a lesson in how to write dialogue. Taken from the play of the same name and embellished somewhat for the movie, Mamet's words are obscenely poetic, hypnotic in their effect and almost musical in their cadence. And make no mistake, they are obscene. The work 'fuck' is used something like 150 times in the course of the 100 minute film. But again, as anyone who has ever been part of this world can attest, that is precisely what makes 'Glengarry Glen Ross' so unflinchingly believable; that's how these people talk. Mamet hasn't created these characters so much as he's simply listened to them. Alec Baldwin's profane 'motivational' speech (written especially for the film) early on gives audiences an electric jolt of an idea what they're in store for. There is no pretense of appealing to the salesmens' better natures, no idealistic claptrap about what being a professional sales rep means; everyone in the room is far too jaded for any of that. No, Baldwin's spiel focuses on the only two things that matter to these men anymore- greed and desperation. Greed: first prize in this month's sales contest is a new Cadillac. Desperation: third prize is, you're fired. You're all losers, Baldwin tells them, you don't even deserve to be in my presence. And the salesmen are largely unfazed; you can see them sizing up Baldwin and his presentation, making mental notes. Jack Lemmon plays the oldest of the sales crew, someone who at one time made a lot of money selling real estate supposedly, but the bullshit and lies are so thick in this office, there's no way of knowing if that's true. Al Pacino is the current hot-shot; slick, smooth and cold-blooded. Pacino's sales pitch to Jonathan Pryce in a corner bar is such a masterpiece of obfuscation, we are no more certain of what Pacino is talking the customer into than Pryce is. All that one knows is at the end of it, he has a signature on the proverbial dotted line. Ed Harris and Alan Arkin are the other two salesmen and Kevin Spacey plays the office manager. Spacey in particular portrays an early version of the kind of chillingly heartless character he would become known for throughout his career. The title of 'Glengarry Glen Ross' refers to a set of leads (potential customers) that the real estate company management is dangling in front of the luckless reps, like some sort of golden carrot. They are to be handed out to the most productive salesmen. As with most high-pressure sales jobs, it's not even a matter of \"what have you done for me lately,\" it's more like, \"what have you done for me in the last thirty minutes?\" The last sale made is forgotten as soon as it's over and then it's on to the next. Yes, this movie is depressing and for anyone who's had to endure a job like this, it's like a flashback to the worst time in your life. One feels, and is intended to feel, that what these men do is a sad, sick, empty way to make a living. But it's also rewarding to watch these great actors giving bravura performances and delivering such unforgettable lines. 'Glengarry Glen Ross' is a film you'll not soon forget.",

            "content": "Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent film from 1992 based off David Mamet's critically acclaimed stage play. Some might think it's about men trying to save their jobs, but more it's an analysis of the nature of man when faced with obstacles and what lengths he'll go to in overcoming them.Taking place in a major city similar to New York or Chicago, most of the story unfolds in a nondescript office that seems to look like a dungeon. This is a great parallel to the pressure the men feel in their role as prisoners inside this dungeon. They work for a second or third tier real estate company, selling overpriced land in shady ways to terrible leads. The working conditions are poor and the employees get almost no support or encouragement from their meek, by the book boss John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) or from the out of sight, out of mind owners Mitch and Murray. Each salesperson has their own distinct personality: Ricky Roma (Pacino) is the charming, hot-shot sales expert who stands atop the sales leader board, Shelley Levene (Lemmon) is the aging, past his prime veteran who's value with the firm is quickly dropping and whose personal life like his professional life is falling apart, Dave Moss (Ed Harris) is the frustrated, angry middle aged man who's tired of the conditions he experiences everyday at the office and is ready to fight back, and George Aaronow (Arkin) is the weak, pathetic man who really has no business working in sales other than the fact that he's desperate for work.Things change for the office when \"downtown\" sends Blake (Alec Baldwin in perhaps his best performance ever), an extremely successful sales rep, over for a sales team meeting. The cocky, abusive Blake rips the men apart for their poor sales and instills in them acronyms like \"ABC\" and \"ADIA\" to help them sell more. He also informs the men that only the top two sales reps will keep their jobs while the other two will be fired. The top rep wins a car and second place a set of knives. He ends the meeting by giving the valuable Glengarry leads to Williamson until the sales team proves that they are closers. Under this new pressure, the men take drastic measures to try as hard as they can to close business.What makes this movie so great is the simplicity of it. There's no flash, no major action items, but terrific chemistry between the actors, characters and conflict through dialog. Pacino, Baldwin, Lemmon, Spacey, Harris and Arikin all give top performances. Also, the movie hits home about what many men (and women) go through in the work place daily. Many work in similar situations with little hope, little opportunity and little salary. The desperation, the language, the pressure, the conflict and the fear that is shown in the movie is very real for millions who need to put food on the table and face an uphill climb to do so.Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent commentary on the condition of man and what he has to do to overcome it. I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "\"The best cast I've ever worked with\" said Jack Lemmon after filming Glengarry Glen Ross, and it is definitely no surprise as to why he would make such a bold statement. But what else do you expect from an ensemble of greats; including the likes of Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Jonathan Price and a cameo from Alec Baldwin. All of the cast are essential in driving the narrative and perform with utmost level of foul-mouthed professionalism.\"It takes brass balls to sell real-estate\" exclaims Blake (played by Alec Baldwin), a corporate business tycoon. Furthermore, it is in this early monologue that Blake verbally abuses a group of real-estate workers and threatens to fire them all unless they produce tangible sales over the space of a few days. All of the men are handed defective leads, which are in urgent need of closing; the closer who comes first wins a Cadillac, the runner-up receives a set of steak knives and anyone else gets fired. It is a blunt and to-the-point story, which becomes exceedingly problematical after a break-in at the office, whereby the \"Glengarry\" leads are stolen. Soon the film becomes a vehicle for depicting greed, as each of the protagonists slyly con their colleagues, representatives and consumers for the one \"big break.\" Brusque and dynamic mannerisms display the character's lust to win. Razor-sharp and profanity-laden dialogue will leave the viewer gasping for more. This callous language is what makes the film so exceptionally nail-biting. Grasping the upper-hand in the business world is a process which requires constant and immediate struggle. Due to deceitful manipulations the person in control is constantly shifting their status (this can be most notably observed during the final conversation between Kevin Spacey and Jack Lemmon). For the most part, Glengarry Glen Ross relies on its razor-sharp screenplay and weasel-like performances, but the technicalities are just as remarkable, mostly focused on creating a theatrically claustrophobic atmosphere. This is best suited, being that the piece is dedicated in keeping to its stage roots.Nevertheless, the cynical temperament enables the picture to become unhindered in its honesty, and transmits every misdemeanour with both wit and sincerity. The film's characters have been demoralised in the workplace because of the stream of verbal abuse, condescending lies and the concluding dismemberment of their drained existence. Arguably, the outdoor land that the real-estate agents are attempting to sell could be seen as a contrast to the office environment that they are so intensely surrounded by. Among the greatest films of the '90s, Glengarry Glen Ross contains a superb blend of all that is necessary in crafting an irreplaceable ensemble piece. Vulgar and essential, this is a picture brimming with depressing honesty and acidic realism. Not one to be missed, by any means.",

Either of them would have totally overshadowed a weaker counterpart. Kevin Spacey plays the cold, self-interested office manager to the hilt.

With names like Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin and Jack Lemmon, expectations were high.Glengarry Glen Ross is a look at the behind-the-scenes machinations of a group of estate agents, what drives them, and how they go about 'closing' in their different ways. Alec Baldwin, in a film-stealing, scenery-chewing performance, is the boss who comes in and lights a fire under the agents with an aggression-fuelled job-threatening speech. He announces a sales competition where for those who come third and fourth the prize is the sack. Although only in the film for a few minutes for one speech, Baldwin sets the tone for the rest of the film. The rest are then sent out to try and 'close the leads'.The film is a rather dry and slow affair, more of a character study than a plot-driven story, at least at first. The vast majority of the action takes pace in their office, with brief interludes in a nearby Chinese restaurant. Harris, Pacino, Lemmon and Alan Arkin are all salesmen and we see how each of them go about their work in their own inimitable ways. However, the cast deliver an ensemble acting class. Pacino once again delivers a driven hothead performance, one straight from the repertoire. He has mastered this type of performance to the extent of making it look effortless, and adding to his list of endlessly quotable characters. It is also a joy to see Jack Lemmon and Pacino on the screen together; in probably his last great performance, Lemmon is at his best, and would have stolen the film had it not been for the charismatic performances of Pacino and Baldwin. But watching the master at work, especially in his scene with Pacino, make the film essential for any film fan; their interchanges seem so easy that they could be set as required viewing for acting classes.Glengarry Glen Ross makes an intriguing insight into what drives estate agents and how they conduct their business, and also the dynamics of office life in general, especially in times of crisis. The acting on display is almost universally superb (athough Ed Harris is perhaps guilty of slightly overacting \u0096 but that is something easy to do when working opposite Pacino) and the script is endlessly quotable. However the plot is rather slow to develop, and the opening forty-five minutes set at night make rather turgid viewing, and it is not until the morning after, in the light of an overnight office robbery, that the story comes to life. However, it then becomes fascinating to see the characters bounce off each other, and how sales incentives have driven them not only into more aggressive pursuit of clients but also in competing just as aggressively with co-workers in order to be number one.Definitely a fascinating film to watch, and a fitting swansong for the terrific career of Jack Lemmon, which on its own makes Glengarry Glen Ross essential viewing.",

All of them are a part of an average real estate organization which in order to maximize sales give their salesmen a week to increase their closes. The leads they get for this task are very mediocre and thus will test their salesmen capabilities. But frustration and failures make them take some drastic steps whose consequences they have to face for good.About the actors, Pacino plays an intelligent and opportunistic guy who is the salesman with the best record currently. Lemmon is the old and experienced guy whose sales record is not that good at the moment but is a big mouth. Harris plays the rebellious and short-tempered guy who has many ideas jumping inside him to make it big. Arkin is the soft-spoken, least confident guy who could not even talk properly to the customers on the phone. Baldwin has a very short scene in the movie but according to me that is the highlight. Spacey is the head of the branch and is the person who receives the most abuses in the movie. Another feature of this movie is the free usage of the 'F' word throughout (Especially directed towards Spacey).

That said I never had to make the intrusive and deceptive calls made here, the guys throwing any devious line to try to get themselves in front of the target investor and then use every other trick in the book to extract their money in exchange for dubiously profitable areas of land. That's not to say I can't relate to a lot of what goes on here, from the can't- sell-so-I'll-supervise office boss Kevin Spacey, to the high-flying, top-dog salesman Al Pacino and desperate veteran seller Jack Lemmon. In this hard day's night of this particular office, no emotion is left unspared in this frank exposure of the sales culture endemic in the \"Greed is Good\" 80's and early 90's.Did they have to swear so much and use such appalling language throughout the film. I know it's part of writer David Mamet's M.O. to embrace profanity and use it as part of the rhythmic language he puts in the mouths of his characters, but it is excessive in the extreme and even in this man's man's man's world, (there are no female leads here), goes too far over the top for my taste, plus I can't imagine any office manager tolerating the abuse Specey's character cos here. The plot seems contrived too at times, especially the theft of the \"golden-ticket\" leads and the minor whodunit surprise left to the end. I'd also argue that characters like Ed Harris's rebellious salesman and Alex Baldwin's ferocious sales manager are underused in the narrative, plus I certainly didn't follow every vernacular phrase banded about by theses fast (I won't call them sweet) - talkers.Better then to comment on the superb ensemble acting, with only Pacino guilty of his traditional sin of overacting. The rest, familiar faces though they are, I got as desperate, hard-pressed salesman but Pacino's florid, mannered performance is at odds with the gun-barrel down-to-earth acting of everyone else, with the director not having too much more to do than point the camera at the actors and stand back.Intense, compulsive and believable, if slightly flawed, this is a fine modern day parable of the self-self-self generation . I understand that clips of the film are still shown as examples of usually how not to carry out an interview with.the general public",

Set in the era of the real estate period in American history so basically 80's onwards to the 00's before finance became coolish at the turn of century, a boring industry full of con artists and aggressive personalities.

            "content": "This is a brief review of \"Edmond\" and \"Glengarry Glen Ross\", two films written by David Mamet.The lesser of the two, \"Edmond\" revolves around a businessman (William H. Macy) who has grown tired of the stresses and pressures of modern life. Trapped in an existential rut, and finding no love, purpose or satisfaction at work or at home, he breaks up with his wife and sets off for a night on the town. Here he hopes to hire a prostitute, but things don't go as planned, and pretty soon he's being arrested for a violent murder. The film is remarkably brisk (79 minutes), Mamet obsessed with modern emasculation and violent resentment, but weak direction by Stuart Gordon undermines his screenplay's better qualities.Capitalism as a slow train to hell, \"Glangarry Glen Ross\" is merely an ensemble version of \"Edmond\". Here the businessmen are a group of real estate agents who struggle to cope with deadlines and targets. They're fired by their company and given a ruthless ultimatum: sell or you won't be rehired. Eventually the pressure of meeting targets proves too much and one salesman commits a shocking crime.Filled with meaty dialogue and lengthy monologues, \"Glengarry\" is elevated by several bombastic moments by actors Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin and Jack Lemmon. It's a joy to watch these actors chew scenery, even if the film ultimately amounts to a group of middle class, middle aged men, moaning about the drudgery of their 9 to 5 lives.8/10 - Worth one viewing.",

An 100% actors movie and it doesn't show anything more than what the play that it is based on intended, which means it only relies on the script, dialog and the acting. And it delivers big time, even with those constraints. Imagine somebody trying to play a symphony with an acoustic guitar and succeeding. This movie doesn't use anything but the very essence of storytelling but it roars like a lion, it literally glues your eyes to the screen. What's more, the story is not that interesting, it is the blunt frankness with which a day in the life of a group of real estate salesmen is presented to the audience. And the dialog is something else.... When I discussed this movie with people, I noticed that the ones who really identify are the ones who worked in a sales team of some sort. Of course, to my horror, some of my fellow \"critics\" were \"getting it\" but they...guess what...AGREED with ALEC BALDWIN and the whole \"f***'em up and get them selling\" routine. Can you get any yuppier than that? Holy smokes! Not much to say about the actors, except they were BLOODY MARVELOUS. The Baldwin speech is in my top 10 of memorable quotes, the over-the-top swearing and quarrel in the end between Lemmon, Spacey, Pacino and Harris is hilarious (not necessarily in a positive way) and the whole Jack Lemmon character is pure genius. In case you never worked in a sales team that promotes a hard-to-sell product and you're wondering how realistic this film is, IT IS REALISTIC. And by the way, stop writing comments on IMDb.

And by big boys, I mean audience members who can stand tons of shouting, even more cursing, and an upsetting storyline that will hurt. There's a reason Death of a Salesman is such a tearjerker: it hits home for a lot of people. Glengarry Glen Ross has often been compared to that story, and with good reason. It's about four salesmen of varying ages and experiences who are faced with an ultimatum: close the sale or lose his job.I'm not really sure who the target audience is for this movie, or for the Pulitzer Prize winning play by David Mamet. Men who have any experience in the sales force will find this movie too painful to watch. Women who have been married to salesman will find it too painful. Children whose fathers were salesmen will find it too painful. So, you're left with people who have no idea what it's like to be a salesman or the living hell they suffer through every day-why would they want to watch it? The answer, I suppose, is the cast. Alec Baldwin gives the so-called, curse-filled pep talk that threatens everyone's jobs, Kevin Spacey is the cold, smarmy office manager, Jack Lemmon is the veteran salesman you feel sorry for because he doesn't have what it takes anymore, Al Pacino says more curse words than clean words in his monologues, Ed Harris is the young hotshot who's only out for himself, and Alan Arkin personifies \"that guy\" in the office that makes you wonder why he decided to become a salesman in the first place. As you can tell, the film is perfectly cast, and everyone delivers the performance they're supposed to deliver. However, it's still an upsetting movie that would really only appeal to members of the \"Greed Is Good\" club who can detach from the characters and think about all the schemes they'd pull in order to put other people out of work and save themselves. If you're a good person, you won't like it.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to language, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",

It's easily in my all time top 20 films I've ever seen, and it gets everything right. It has a dream cast and a level of intelligence that's unheard of in movies these days. Need lots of action and cheap thrills? You'll most certainly hate it. Do you enjoy high quality dialogue in your movies? Then it's like porn. Better than porn actually, seeing how you can watch Glengarry Glen Ross over and over and it will always be just as great.This awkwardly titled classic comes from a play by David Mamet, who also wrote the script. It's a dark, profane, bitter, and cynical story about an office full of sleazy, lowlife salesmen (Pacino, Lemmon, Harris, and Arkin) who's job is to get in contact with cold potential customers (leads), and pass off what's essentially uninhabitable swampland as prime real estate. The job is naturally an exercise in futility, as most of the men are performing very below average, despite their most desperate efforts. The fact that the good leads are being held back by their boss (Spacey) until management sees some results isn't helping either. The situation is a humiliating paradox, that becomes outright desperate when a manager (Alec Baldwin) comes to the office from headquarters and announces a motivational sales contest that will mean prizes for the winners and unemployment for everyone else.The characters are developed to perfection, and it is their words and reactions to the situation at hand that make this film such a work of genius. Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), has nothing to worry about. He's pretty much always been the top salesman at the office, treating his sales more like tangent-laced seductions, one of which we see working effortlessly. Unfortunately for everyone else, Roma's guaranteed victory narrows down the potential winners. The other guys have varying, but equally desperate reactions to this.Shelley Levine (Jack Lemmon) is the oldest of the salesmen, and while he was once Roma's equal, he has been seriously slipping in his age and hasn't closed a sale in a very long time. He's in a desperate family situation, which is unspecified, but clearly severe enough that he can't afford to lose his job. He starts by trying to bribe their boss, Williamson (Kevin Spacey), and when that doesn't work, he tries to worm his way into the home of a family who are just as set on buying nothing as he is on selling anything. It's painful to watch, even though the character is unlikeable in many ways.And then there's Dave Moss (Ed Harris) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin). These guys have never been near the top, and now their expendability is here to haunt them. George spends the night listening passively as Moss pontificates on everything wrong with their office, which may or may not turn out to be justifying a robbery. Because the next morning, the office is found burglarized. And although Moss was the only one to verbalize his desire to do so, everyone has a reason to. The morning after the robbery, these situations all come to a head and the men are all exposed for the backstabbing scumbags they really are, particularly when Roma's customer from the night before shows up intent on canceling the sale.The dialogue sizzles. It is some of the best dialogue Mamet ever wrote, which is saying a lot. Every actor sinks into their role, and it's hard to single out a stand-out performance aside from Alec Baldwin's ten minute appearance delivering an unforgettably cruel and venomous speech. Jack Lemmon, most well-known from classic movies like The Apartment and Some Like it Hot, is hard to forget in this movie with a character who is incredibly unlikable, yet still sympathetic. Everyone plays a shade of unlikable in this film, but as far as characters you'll love to hate goes, Kevin Spacey's Williamson takes the cake. He has the easiest job in the office, and he treats his employees like his position makes him more important to the company. He is a complete tool in every way, and when he screws over Roma, you can bet that Al Pacino will dish out the verbal assault to end all verbal assaults (\"Who told you that you could work with MEN?!\"). It's a completely satisfying moment, as memorable as any of Pacino's best moments from The Godfather, and it's all the better since you totally feel that Spacey's character deserves it.I could gush over this movie scene after scene all day. It's not so much a movie that appeals to me on a personal level as it is one that plays like a great piece of music. The dialogue is as pleasurable to the ears as great music, and the movie has a stagy yet lyrical quality that sucks you in and doesn't let go. It's one of the most fast-paced films you'll ever see, with two very distinct acts. The movie is over before you know it. Even if it bores you to tears, it'll be over before you realized you were bored. Overall, give the movie a chance. It's the best compilation of writing and acting since 1976's Network.",

Here, however, those handicaps are avoided: sure, the sets and action are still poor but we alternate a rainy night and a sunny day thus the atmosphere is gripping. Then, it's not about the usual sentimental relationships but about the working place.At last, a movie that says that working, for a lot of people, is a bit like slavery. And in that view, the casting is indeed perfect: as it's an opposition between human, kind workers and robotic, cold, capitalist bosses, the production has chosen well: my long time despised, unpleasant actors are among the boss (Baldwin, Spacey) while compassionate, kind and rebellious actors are among the abused workers (Pacino, Lemon, Harris). Even, the fragile client is good with Price having the part.Their occupation is also wisely chosen as commercial sellers are part con men, having to sell what we don't need: This dirty trick of the job is well played as each seller has its own way: Lemon is old school, very kind but with boring speech, Harris is like the fox and Pacino is the wise man, disillusioned but also helpful. The bosses are what they are expected to be: without heart and only interested in profits. The opening speech by Baldwin is totally violent and the worst is that's the speech of today bosses: you get me more money or you are fired; I'm the boss with unimaginable money because I'm worth it! Sure, it's totally crap and it was good to see the sellers strikes back. If I have a disappointment, it's maybe with the ending that refuses any outcome: as Lemon is finally caught red-handed and looked like a bit desperate and neurotic all along the movie, the shameful situation he has reached should have been unbearable: thus, I would have written the finale as Lemon going the office with the boss and police and then, we would have heard a gunshot: doors open: Lemon lies on the floor covered with blood as he took the gun from a policeman and killed himself. On the movie, the door closes and nothing happened\u0085 it's a pity.In all cases, it's a recommendation as it's not usual to have an American movie that glorifies the simple workers and it's also brilliantly played. NB: De Palma would have been inspired to took a look at this movie before filming \"Passion\" as his vision of a firm is so totally silly that it hurts the movie!",

He was a good bloody salesman, in one job that's bloody hard, where patience and perseverance are tested. You get this vibe, of such such utter desperation, all through this film, set in a rundown real estate office, a perfect set piece, where across the street is their watering hole/Chinese restaurant, which took me back to Cadillac Man. At the moment, things are pretty down at Mitch and Murray, this downtown real estate office, in lower area of New York, where jobs are on the line, and it's employees are given an ear bashing and a hard and nasty word from a boss (Baldwin-explosive and intense) outside of this office. He makes a meal of the role, savoring every moment of his screen time. This cameo, we thanks him as much as we did, Matthew McConaughey's in The Wolf Of Wall Street. Yes, it's harder to sell that great sell and speech. The real thing that works here is the utter desperation of these guys, trying to make a buck, where their potential clients, and no so potential ones, who are sucking them dry, especially Lemmon's wonderfully played character, where one feels his desperation, most. He's acting is top pro, done to such perfection and solid conviction, you don't want to tamper with it, in any way. This character has a lot to worry about. That scene with him, sweet talking the husband of a woman client, where minutes later, he practically shoves the door on him, was so sincere and believable, you would see this scenario happening right in front of you. We have a couple of potentials who turn out to be cuckoo. Things have got so bad, some of our employees, hungry for these new leads, these \"Glengarry leads\" and are willing to steal, where one resorts to just this, but who could it be. Bring on the thriller element. GGR is compelling viewing all the way through, as are the actors brilliant performances, Al Pacino's character, of course, as hotshot Richard Roma, stealing the limelight, where I too, loved Spacey, as the weak minded galah, running the place, where evidently, this guy shouldn't be. You learn too, salesmen can be such backstabbers, towards their colleague's backs. I was much fascinated by Harris's character, as the much angry and jealous, hotheaded employee, with a sort of bullying nature, his great performance was stacked up beside the others. GGR is driven excitedly by dialogue and commanding acting, where the actual movie script, is almost description non existent, but we know we're safe here, when we're in the hands of David Mamet. You'll love the film as much as Pacino's voracious moments, and outbursts. The film has been done solid, thanks to the acting and script, and too done under the wonderful direction and watchful eye of a versatile director, who makes movies, that I like. If you're a talk show host, you should see Talk Radio, if you're in real estate, you should see Glengarry Glen Ross.",

It's just another plot device to try to ratchet up the heat, and frankly, I prefer air-conditioning.

The casting is unusual in having no women in the sales office (since female real estate agents far outnumbered male real estate agents back when the screenplay was written). For the movie Mamet added the Baldwin character, so theoretically he could have added a hard, aggressive bitch to the sales team to spice things up. The dialog is typical Mamet fare, it adds punch and pizazz but in real life I've never ever witnessed people verbally exchange like that! There are some plot events that simply don't make sense. The hapless Jack Lemon thinks he's hit the sales jackpot only to be deflated when told that the couple who signed his $80,000 sales contract have a history of being insolvent wackos; office manager Williamson (Spacey) already knew all about this, yet he assigned Shelley a complete time-waster. Why? managers are supposed to optimize business efficiency not sabotage it. Did Williamson do it out of malice or carelessness? We later learn he and Shelly intensely disliked one another? Most people (myself included) would rather clean toilets for a living than face that bleak future of endless sleaze, stress and abuse on all sides, but as this DVD's supplementary piece \"Always Be Closing\" showed, there are real-life real estate saleswomen who actually love cold-calling!

What you will find is a marvelously constructed film that will be appreciated and admired by a mature and serious audience, particularly those who are hungry for a substantial gourmet meal in a sea of cheap, seemingly endless junk food. This is one of those rare moments in a production when every role, from actor to editor, was filled by just the right person. If anyone is a serious student of acting, film making, or play production you can't ask for a better study tool than this film. Every actor was perfect for his role, even Kevin Spacey, who I always find has a contrived \"acting\" undertone to his work but that quality is perfect for the tight a*sed character he plays. And what can you say about the other roles other than brilliant, certainly these performances all rank among the top of each actor's resume. This is also David Mamet's best play, the most tightly written, polished and textured. He is certainly the serious actor's writer, no one writes more textured and honest characters using real dialog that fits together like an intricate, well oiled machine. My only complaint with him, though, is when he directs. He has said that the actor is only there to \"read the lines as written\", claiming all the emphasis of any production should be based on the writing. Well as you can clearly see elsewhere, great writing can get butchered by a bad production and many a so-called great films have just been great executions of mediocre scripts. Overvaluing the writing (or any specific element) can be a big disservice to other aspects of a production, in this case the acting. James Foley did a marvelous job, rehearsing over and over again until the end result was the beautifully polished performances you see here. It's really a disappointment to not see him do any other film adaptations of Mamet's work to date, clearly this is his best work and the best adaptation of Mamet's as well. What a shame there has been no more further films with this paring. The editing and soundtrack are also brilliant, giving us a rare treat, a masterpiece that stands up under repeated viewings and clearly will over the years to come.

            "content": "\"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is a film about a seedy real estate agency selling people worthless pieces of land and robbing them of their savings. The seedy character is symbolized in the film by the fact that the agency keeps office in a poor part of town and that it always rains.There are three important characters in the movie. Blake (the manager) played by Alec Baldwin, Ricky Roma (the young upcoming sales) played by Al Pacino and Shelley Levene (the old sales in the downward phase of his career) played by Jack Lemmon.Blake is a typical American and in my opinion rather uninteresting character. In his opinion the value of a human being can be measured by his wealth or the revenue he generates (My watch is more expensive then your car). His role in this film is to trigger the competition between te sales. Because business is not going well for the agency, the sales with the lowest weakly revenue will be fired.The film is about the competition between the sales, and especially about the underdog sales Shelley Levene. His character (played brilliantly by Jack Lemmon) is the only one we that we get to know personally. The strange thing is that we even begin to care for him, although in fact he is a crook. The reasons are in the first place that he is the underdog and in the second place that he has a sick daughter to care for. Losing his job is losing his health insurance. So we hope he is not losing his job, even if his job is stealing the savings from innocent people. I recently reviewed \"The insider\" (1999, Michael Mann) and also in this film the risk of losing health insurance that is badly needed played a role in generating sympathy for the lead character.There is another remarkable fact in this film. Although most of the spectators will see the sales as scammers, that is not the way they look at themselves. In one of the best scenes of the movie Ricky Roma and Shelley Levene are evaluating a sales conversation they recently had. From the way they talk about it is clear that they view their profession nearly as an art form.The story is situated in the 80's. In my opinion it is however of all times. Replace \"worthless peace of land\" with \"toxic financial derivative\" and you do have the financial crisis at the beginning of the new century.",

Jack Lemmon's performance is heartbreaking as the desperate salesman trying to close a sale. It's an Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. Al Pacino is great as always. Jonathan Pryce is wonderful in the later scenes. The other salesmen read like the A-list of great actors, Oscar Nominee Ed Harris, Oscar Nominee Alec Baldwin, Oscar winner, Alan Arkin, and two-time Oscar winner, Kevin Spacey too. The story about real estate salesmen is brutal just like business. They are war with each other and the world. Unless they close their deals, they'll be fired by their bosses. I thought Jack Lemmon was the best performance of all. You loved him one minute, pitied him in another minute, and was rooting for him all the time.",

And this isn't a good film...It's a GREAT and GRAND film! And I hope that no one else thinks otherwise. Along with the incredible dialogue, I also think that the cast is brilliant. Not for a second, am I thinking that these men are actors (Well, except for Alec Baldwin). And that is a good trait of a good actor.There's two particular characters that stick out the most in my mind: Jack Lemmon and Kevin Spacey. Boy, do these men ever play the roles well! I really admire some of the actors like Pacino and Harris, but I couldn't believe, when I finished the movie, what an amazing job Lemmon and Spacey did. And one last thing that I'd like to mention, that ties into both the dialogue and the acting...the setting. The reason this fits in with both dialogue and acting is because you're so involved with the characters interactions that you don't need any actions or change of scenery. It fits and works well. And perhaps if the setting had change it might of taken away from the scene. And as far as acting is concerned, I think that if you don't have good acting within the scene, you get bored and do focus on the facts (like setting), that you shouldn't.So, all these elements get thrown into one story, one film, that makes it both great and grand, and this work of art is known as \"Glengarry Glen Ross\".",

Now, that's not far from the truth, but it's precisely in the talking where the beauty is.Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), Shelley \"The Machine\" Levene (Jack Lemmon), David Moss (Ed Harris), John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin) are characters brilliantly written and masterfully played. I have to include Blake (Alec Baldwin) whose only scene in the movie is one of the most memorable and many people's favorite. Oh, and James Lingk (Jonathan Pryce) who also has a small but equally masterfully played role.Every actor gives a stellar performance playing these salesmen. Just to watch them walk around the office and sitting at their desks talking to each other and yelling at each other is a pleasure. It's amazing how much entertainment can be achieved with just words and a regular setting like an office.The story is good, but I'm gonna be honest, this film is all about the characters.The dialogue is top notch. Some of the best dialogue I've heard in any movie. Absolutely quotable not only because of the way it's written (by David Mamet) but also because of the way the actors say it. If you want perfect delivery and timing, this is the movie.Glengarry Glen Ross is one of my top ten films of all time. A film with characters that make a day in the office seem like the most entertaining thing.",

The plot gets going before you realize, going from an introduction to the characters to the main conflict of the movie smoothly, showing nuances of the same characters in a human and recurrent way.And then, it's over. It's not like it is a short movie: it's pretty standard feature length. But it pulls you in so strongly, it puts you in the shoes of desperate men in a way that makes the one and a half hour feel like a couple of minutes. It isn't a sit, it is a passing moment, just like the night of the movie for the characters. It is a masterclass about storytelling, even a arguably boring one.",

            "content": "One of the greatest cons of all time is the sale. Convincing someone to buy a product, even if they are just looking or vaguely interested. The art of the sale. I admire my Son cause he has the gift of selling. Starting out as a young car salesman in Rhode Island My son learned his trade by studying body gestures and facial expressions. Went to seminars just to learn how to win over someone's confidence implementing empathy with the customer, staying focused on your goals with a certain responsibility supplementing persistence and optimism despite the numerous rejections. Many intricate parts to the art of the sale but what it takes to sell real estate? \"BRASS BALLS\". Glengarry Glen Ross is such a picture as it takes a look at the underbelly world of sales, Following the lives of four real estate salesmen. Unscrupulous, cunning and crafty but reaching a dead end with empty leads dispensed by the office manager Williamson (Kevin Spacey). The story draws the initial attention to a slumping,over the hill salesman Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon) who is on the phone discussing a medical issue about his ailing daughter. Shelley's daughter's illness never goes any further in detail but Shelly needs to close an account for her medical care. Now, in his early Sixties, Shelley Levene was once a dominant force in the real estate game. Shelly, has fallen on hard times and Williamson lets him know it. A meeting is held in the home office as a brash well dressed man enters the Room as he see Shelly pouring coffee and orders him to put the coffee down. \"Coffee is for closer!\" exhorts the tall stranger who's name is Blake (Alec Baldwin). This scene is worth watching as the revolting Blake tells the dyer realities of not closing a customer with the consequences of losing their jobs. Blake continues his sermon to these frustrated salesmen telling them either they sell these properties and use the leads you already have.Alec Baldwin gives a speech that reminds me of the movie Patton starring George C, Scott with strength and conviction yet arrogant to his audience as Dave Moss (Ed Harris) questions why he wastes his time preaching how great salesman he is to us losers. Blake's brash reply, \"Cause Mitch and Murray,(The owners) asks me to.\" In Blake's hands are the New Leads but he indicates you don't get them. Shelley insists the existing leads are a dead end. Blake drives into high gear as he tells them their wimps and that he could close them himself and make $15,000 dollars tonight on those leads. Meanwhile Rick Roma (Al Pacino) is in a local restaurant/bar trying to sell properties to an unsure, indecisive buyer James Lingk (Jonathan Pryce). Roma does a fine job playing on Lingk's insecurities. Making the sale sound like more of an opportunity than a purchase and done quite eloquently. Shelley desperate due to his daughter's health tries to meet with Williamson to get the new leads Bribing Williamson with money he doesn't have. Williamson tells Shelly forget it; no chance as he leaves Shelley in the rain. In an another car Moss meets with another salesman George Aaronow (Alan Arkin) who seems a bit inexperienced at this sales job as Moss has a plan to have George break in the office and steel the new leads and sells them to a competitor. George wants no part of that scheme. We follow Shelley to one of his potential sales but the persons isn't interested in buying. I felt that scene was important to show the frustration and hopeless downward spiral salesmanship can become. The authenticity of the scene shows a last ditch effort for a sale vanquish in failure. Poor over-the- hill Shelley wearing his Fishing hat and raincoat gives you empathy in the Shelley character as the next morning's events will show. Desperation can drive a man to do anything. Alan Arkin's Character shows a believable lack of confidence and tremendous helpings of paranoia. Pacino and Lemmon work well together in the office scenes as authorities close in on the suspect. Spoiler Alert!!! but worth seeing The climactic ending. Lemmon is verbally pounding Spacey against the ropes and this leads to a dramatic turnabout as the Levene character incriminates himself and Spacey has the upper hand. Shelley breaks down in shame would make Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman look minor by comparison. I felt that Spacey had the best lines in the movie among this all-star cast. This reminds me of the Ray Charles song entitled \"BUSTED\" as one of the lines was ,\"I am no thief but a man could go wrong when he's busted. Shelley's desperation lead him down the wrong path as his best years are behind him in many ways . Sorry realistic commentary by screen writer David Mamet.I give this classic movie 7 sets of steak knives.",

            "content": "Welcome to the wonderful world of real estate, where the golden rule is \"A.B.C., Always Be Closing (Glengarry Glen Ross).\" This means lie, cheat, steal and do whatever it takes to \"get them to sign on the line which is dotted (Glengarry Glen Ross).\" A highly competitive group of real estate salesmen struggle to close deals in a tough market with weak leads. In an effort to motivate the team, corporate bigwigs raise the stakes of the monthly sales contest. Blake (Alec Baldwin), the corporate henchman on a mission to enforce the rules, announces the prize: \"First prize is a Cadillac Eldorado. Second prize is a set of steak knives. Third prize is you're fired (Glengarry Glen Ross).\" The intense ultimatum is music to the ears of Ricky Roma (Al Pacino) who is the office superstar. However, rivalries erupt under pressure and the office becomes a breeding ground of anxiety, tension and desperation. Shelly Levine (Jack Lemon) clings to his faded glory while the other agents, Dave Moss (Ed Harris) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin) concoct a profitable scheme to get them back on their feet. When John Williamson (Kevin Spacey), the snide office manager, announces the good leads were taken during a robbery, everyone is a suspect.Glengarry Glen Ross is a splendid film adaptation of David Mamet's 1984 Broadway play, directed by James Foley. This is an exceptionally well-written script with a phenomenal cast that transforms material, which is not inherently cinematic, into an interesting and intriguing film. The film does not rely on special effects to hold the attention of the audience; it achieves this with a natural dialogue that realistically portrays multi-dimensional characters. The characters are complicated with a mix of good and bad in each of them. They banter back and forth, interrupt each other and at times it's hard to tell who's right and who's wrong. These conversations add interest and enhance the reality of the film.Glengarry Glen Ross is not what anyone would consider a feel-good movie, but there is appeal in the testosterone driven behavior of these characters that use memorable lines like razor ribbon to cut each other down. I find it interesting that some have claimed Glengarry Glen Ross is about the \"evils of the free-enterprise system.\" I feel it is more about basic human evolution and survival of the fittest in a cut-throat world. This is evident in the fact that Ricky evolves to be the top-dog and consequently leads his mentor, Shelly, into proverbial extinction. They are all like animals struggling to survive in their environment.David Mamet contributes greatly to the film's success with an exquisite script. However, the attention to detail within the set design is noteworthy because it adds irony and reality to the film. A majority of the film is set within the walls of a drab, depressing office which is filled with inspirational wall hangings containing messages that seem to daunt more than inspire. Additionally, a picture of Shelly Levine's daughter sits on his desk in serene contrast to the all-male cast and surrounding chaos. The irony continues throughout the film and enhances the empathic feeling at the end.Although some feel the performances of Al Pacino and Jack Lemmon stand out among the cast of equals, I disagree. I feel each performance stands out individually without overshadowing the other and allows us to view into each of the character's psyche. Some characters have more time on screen and are more likable than others which may influence opinions. Oddly enough my favorite character is Blake. Blake does not appear in the play, but was added by David Mamet in the film adaptation. He is a heartless narcissist who takes great pleasure in his nefarious behavior and even goes so far as to show everyone his \"brass balls\". Even though Blake is a man I love to hate, he has some of the most memorable lines in the movie which I have been quoting for years. As I reach for a cup of coffee, I can hear Blake's voice saying: \"Coffee is for closers (Glengarry Glen Ross).\" The collaborative effort of David Mamet and James Foley produced a film which successfully transitioned a theatrical performance to the screen without losing any of its integrity. The effective use of close-ups keeps the focus on the dialog which is the quintessential element of the film's success.Glengarry Glen Ross. Dir. James Foley. Perf.

This film shows you some of the darkly humorous parts of it: Representatives flat-out lying to customers to make sales, coworkers and management impersonating all sorts of company officials and high-rollers, leads being recycled ad nauseum... the list goes on.Perhaps the funniest part is that the whole premise of this movie -- the reps' utter obsession with leads -- is, unfortunately, the one people who haven't worked in the industry aren't going to fully grasp. It really... is... that... bad.One thing to watch for that's understated a bit is the whole idea of 'defection' from one office to another.

The cut-throat competitive dog-eat-dog environment, the pompous slick-tongued swindling salespeople, the tense atmosphere, the wise-ass barbs being heaved back and forth.. it's all so over-the-top, but it's all so real. You can point to every single individual in this movie and say 'hey, I know I guy like that!'. From the smooth-talking salesman who would say anything to get a deal, to the once-successful burnt out guy trying to maintain his job and his sanity, to the inept no-so-bright kind who doesn't really belong in the business to begin with, to the goody-goody kiss-ass office manager, to the arrogant schmuck of a boss... it is all so perfectly placed.The acting in this film is right-on, not overacted and not underacted, and it has the feel of a real sales office, and how ugly things can get after something has gone awry. When everyone is trying to save their own skin, all of a sudden, old allegiances become murky, all the dirty laundry is aired, and people will say or do almost anything to get themselves out of trouble.But in the end, it is really the incredible performances of this star-studded cast that save this film, which has a great script but a very weak plot. This is very much a character-driven piece, with superb scenes created out of great dialouges and confrontations, skillfully acted out with subtle body language. This is definitely not an action-driven piece, and as mentioned, not much of a story per se.

Although, I have to say, when I heard that this was a movie about selling real estate I thought it'd be a boring, uninteresting film.  I was wrong.\"Glengarry Glen Ross\" starts with the loud, obnoxious Blake (Alec Baldwin) arriving at Williamson's (Kevin Spacey) firm and telling the sellers (Lemmon, Pacino, Harris and Arkin) about a new contest.  Whoever of the four sells the most real estate in the next week will get the \"new leads\", the leads that will almost certainly sell.  The next morning they find that the leads are stolen and they must find out who did it.First off, the acting in this film is perfect.  Baldwin may only be in the film for ten minutes, but he steals the show (and your attention) for every frame that he is on screen.  Lemmon's \"Shelley Levene\" is sadly pathetic, you really feel sorry for him.  Pacino's Ricky Roma is an interesting character, and Harris and Arkin play off each other perfectly.Best Mamet thriller out there, 9/10.",

It doesn't happen every day that you get to see a movie about your own profession (except for when you are a drugs dealer, a spy or a lawyer of course) and I really wanted to see how Hollywood sees it and what they make of it. But \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is more than just a movie about salesmen, it's also a movie about deception, theft, anxiety, rage,... for every human feeling, except perhaps for love, there is place in this movie.Business isn't going well at John Williamson's real estate office. The sales numbers are too low and the salesmen aren't very motivated, because they believe they haven't received any good leads (the addresses of potential buyers). But than Blake comes in, one of the founders of the firm, and he has a proposition to make. He'll give an incentive to succeed in a sales contest that will last for only one week. The first price is a luxurious car and the \"golden\" Glengarry leads that he brought in with him, the second price a set of steak knives, the third or fourth price means that you'll get fired. Because there is no place for losers and because only the man who is able to close the most deals will get better leads, the competition and the tension raise to a boiling point. Immediately after Blake has left the office, propositions for deals and robbery arise, but all behind Ricky Roma's back, the very best salesman in the office. When the next morning the four employees show up at the firm, they find out that the Glengarry leads have been stolen. Williamson is desperate to find out who did it and now all salesmen face even more tension and difficulties...Even though this isn't always exactly the way how life as a salesman is (at least not where I work, but I admit that there are places where it does get very close to the situations in the movie), this movie gives an excellent idea of the stress and the tension that we have to go through from time to time. Especially at the end of the month when you haven't reached your target yet, life can be pretty hectic. And the incentive program is common practice as well, although I've never heard of a place where the third or the fourth would get fired.But those are just minor details, what is more important is the fact that this is a very suspenseful drama with some powerful acting. That's exactly what everybody expects with a cast like this one of course, but it isn't automatically true that when you have people like Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey and Alec Baldwin in your cast, that everything will work out perfectly. In this case it did, but that's also thanks to the story that has been well-written. David Mamet sure knows how to build up tension, how to give enough depth to the different characters and how to keep the viewer's attention.Even when you aren't in sales, I think this movie deserves a try. If it isn't for the fine story, than you should definitely give it a try for the top cast that gives away a very good performance. I give this movie a 7.5/10.",

The life of a salesman has never looked so grimy unappealing and unrewarded. The dialogue is snappy and hard and almost every exchange is loaded with bitterness and cynicism. There is a lot of humour but there is no hope to be seen anywhere except the futile dream of one day accessing the \"good leads\".

Apparently, the big bosses aren't happy with sales and have sent a hot shot salesman to try to motivate the sales staff. But Blake (Alec Baldwin) is an abusive monster and instead of encouraging them with positive reinforcement, he thinks fear and nastiness are the best motivators. He promises the sales staff a brand new Cadillac for the month's top salesman, a rinky dink prize for the second best...and termination for everyone else! He also manages to treat the employees like garbage at every opportunity and induces a climate of fear. What's next? See the story and see how each man reacts...and how they lie, cheat and steal in order to keep their miserable jobs.\"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is NOT a film for everyone.

David Mamet is one of them. Even to someone who has never seen a Mamet movie or play, it will most definitely be clear that there's something about the dialogue in this movie that separates it from everything else.While I certainly won't say that Mamet is a bad writer (in fact, he has a tremendous gift with the written word), I can't say that I am a fan. Particularly in this movie, he's very wordy, and that can make the story hard to follow. While the dialogue is crisp and poetic, the strands of dialogue are so long and colorful that it can make the plot hard to follow. I guess that many will find that okay since plot is really inconsequential in a movie like this.It's basically about a group of salesman who are trying to sell the most real estate to save their jobs. The bottom two salesmen by the end of the week will be fired. Immediately after the men find out about their predicament, the new leads, which are key to making a sale, have been stolen. Here it turns into a mixture of subtle whodunit and \"Death of a Salesman.\" It's got to be amazing to see such a high profile cast in one movie where they all get to create new and original characters without having to resort to 90% of the roles being cameos (Alec Baldwin being an exception). While the acting is terrific (Jack Lemmon and Alan Arkin are especially good), it's not what it aspires to be. Still, I'm not going to stop someone from checking it out if they want to.",

He plays Shelley 'The Machine' Levene, an arguing salesman in a bad streak, whose sales technique is slipping. He is desperate and needs good leads from his boss, Williamson (Kevin Spacey). Some of the scenes where he has to beg in the rain to him, and the final scene, make us feel sympathetic to him. The hot shot in the office is Ricky Roma, played by Al Pacino (who was Oscar nominated for his performance), he's a guy on a hot streak and can do no wrong, it seems. There's a great scene where Williamson reveals a secret to one of Roma's customers, then when the customer leaves the room Roma lets off one of the great tirades in cinema history. The other guys in the office are played by an acerbic Ed Harris as Dave Moss, who's in a bad streak, and laconic Alan Arkin as George.

A film should never ever ever do that to the viewer. Which to me is interesting only from the standpoint that any Mamet film I've ever watched has never done that. Not House of Games, not Heist, not even Spartan. So why this film? I suppose it's due to the fact that the audience wants some kind of justice for these dreary souls and they don't get any. Even Spacey's character, who is a jackass by the way, isn't taken down for his bad managing skills and complete lack of salesmanship knowledge. At least give us Baldwin's character's head or somebody halfway important. The feeling that all of these guys were monumental losers with the possible exception of Pacino's Romo just weighed you down and gave you a mixed feeling of disgust and shame.

            "content": "I recently took the time to watch GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS and remembered how when the movie came out in 1992, much was said about the constant profanity used in the film, especially the \"F\" word. I have read other sources and I would find it believable that in real life, people like the characters depicted would constantly be swearing. That aside, I found the movie to be very thought provoking as it basically shows what happens to people when they are desperate. For a little background, this film was originally a play by David Mamet and frankly, I essentially found this movie to be a play that was filmed. Also, this was an all-star cast with Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey and Alec Baldwin among others. For those readers who have not seen the film, the basic premise is that Alec Baldwin plays a hotshot in the company who tells all the workers that if they don't begin to close any new deals soon, they will be out of a job. For the most part, the office workers find the new leads to be worthless. Therefore, they become desperate and will do whatever they can to get ahead even if it means lie, cheat and steal. What impressed me about the film is how it showed that nobody cares how much experience one might have; all that matters is \"Can one get the results?\" To show an example of this, Jack Lemmon played Shelley \"The Machine\" Levine who was an experienced sales man and had gotten results in the past. However, it did not seem to matter since he did not seem to be getting the same results now. Also, the film showed other \"typical\" type of workers that people could relate to such as Al Pacino's Ricky Roma who was the hotshot in the office and felt he was the one to win all the rewards. To me, Ed Harris's character came across to me as someone who was not really a bad person but turned to less than honest means because he was desperate. Kevin Spacey's character (the office manager John Williams) seemed to me like the person trying to keep order in the office and did not have too much sympathy towards anyone. Alec Baldwin's role was very effective as the big shot who wanted to scare everyone. Just about anyone can say they have had an employer at one point or another who acted that way. In conclusion, I might suggest that the viewer might want to watch this film a second time because even though it is not very long, there is a lot that goes on. Personally, I felt the movie made more sense to me on my second viewing of it.",

Though this movie concentrates on selling real estate, I hope some one makes a movie how only 'connections' not the real talent can advance you in the corporate world. It also proves how you should be conscience free and should forget about your family if you want to really grow. Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris , Alec Baldwin all give a very powerful performance as conscience free salesmen and motivators. Alec Baldwin provides a very powerful performance of a ruthless motivator. On one hand whether you feel sorry for the plight of these salesmen. I almost yelled \"common man quit the f***ing job\" to Ed Harris during Alec Baldwin's motivating speech. Sorry for the profanity but you automatically get into that kind of language as you watch this movie. This is another example how powerful this movie is. On the other hand you feel angry the way they cheat common men of their hard earned money.I completely agree with other members comment that this should be in one of the top 200 films.

            "content": "In reading IMDd comments on the Sydney Lumet film \"12 Angry Men,\" I saw a comment or two about how such films are not made much anymore.  This referred to films that are character-driven, plot-driven, require no special effects, and feature no heavy armament.  It occurred to me that \"Glengarry Glen Ross,\" a recent favorite of mine, could be considered such a film. While the level of testosterone, vitriol, and profanity not only rivals, but outdoes the average modern action film, it is a completely different animal. I only knew the title from a rather old-fashioned friend of mine who had been to see the original play in Chicago.  His only reaction was to complain about the foul language.  I was not particularly interested in seeing this movie until I was in a video store and the clerk started playing it.  Just listening to (not even seeing) the scene with Alec Baldwin made it impossible for me to concentrate on browsing until the scene was over, and I immediately bought a copy of the video.  There's not much I can add to the other comments on how uniformly superb the cast is, but that brief performance by Baldwin (whom I've always been rather indifferent to) is really riveting, even shocking.  Every time I complain about my job I think of this scene, and try to put it in perspective.  Also, nobody is better than Jack Lemmon at playing desperate characters, and this performance is a knockout.  Is the foul language realistic?  I really don't know.  My experience in the business world is limited to zilch.  I don't care much for gratuitous profanity in films (for instance, I think Kathy Bates' character's frequent use of it in \"Primary Colors\" was a bit tiresome), but I don't mind it if it's valid, and in GGR it struck me as entirely believable.  This verbal violence is every bit as intense as the blood and guts you see splattered on the modern movie screen.  Whether or not it really happens in the business world, for me it rang true in the context of this film, and hasn't language always been manipulated and stylized in drama with the aim of achieving the right effect?  I doubt that the average Elizabethan age individual spoke in Shakespearean verse.",

To see this film is to see the death of us all as we slowly degrade from smart ass young men into middle aged denial and finally , fossilized fools. Regardless of whether you are an actual 'used vacuum ' salesmen or we work in a hospital, we are all salespeople to someone and something. All of us play angles and shovel small talk each and every day. As we see the bull crap flying out of these guys mouths, we comfort ourselves that the vulgarity separates us from them and thus we aren't as bad as these guys. Its not about vulgarity or being a salesman. Its about stress. The film holds up a mirror of ourselves under enormous stress and we thank god we very rarely are. The plot in this script is the weakest part. Its too simplistic and shouldn't be able to carry an entire film. Its basically a bunch of guys in a lousy job whose life gets worse to the point of desperation. Each man deals with it in their own way. Just like each on of us deals with our own world , in our own version of heaven or hell, depending on how we view our lives.In this case, these men's lives are versions of hell. Each one is at loathe with themselves and therefore blames everyone and everything around them for their plight. One of them states he wont live in hell of earth, but even he disintegrates into a childish brat whose personal character is nothing like the image he tries to portray. The acting is the movie. It is unbelievably good. Both Alex Baldwin and Jack Lemmon give scenes that rival any they have had in their careers. Al Pacino has been so good in so many movies I cannot tell how good he was in this movie. He was good but by his standards I don't know. Alan Arkin drew the short straw when it came to casting. He had the part of a lovable loser who everyone likes but nobody respects. The most despicable character (besides Baldwin) belongs to Ed Harris. He is brilliant but a bit too loud as David Moss , who is ambitious , frustrated and fed up. But he is no fool. The lucky part goes to Kevin Spacey, who was jumping up and down with utter delight to be selected to be on the same screen as his hero Lemmon , and be considered at such a young age to be able to hold his own with some of the greatest character actors in Hollywood history. It must of rubbed off on young Spacey, as his mediocre performance in this film would springboard into academy award winning roles in several films after wards, making himself into an acting legend in his own right. Unlike most of Hollywood, this film has no hero, no real villain and no justice in the end. Its what we see every day. Ordinary people wishing they were somewhere else and someone else. Regular folks making bad decisions, and wallowing in the consequences. The movie left me feeling so much gratitude for the little integrity I was lucky enough to maintain in my own life.",

Blake gives the manager of the office John Williamson, Kevin Spacey,a list of valuable live leads, people who are very likely to buy, and tells him to give them out to the most productive salesman who's on top of the blackboard, in money earned, by the end of the day. with that the men who are drowning see a lifeline and will do anything that they can, right or wrong, to grab it. Explosive performances all around with everyone in the cast giving it all they've got in a great movie about salesmen on par with \"Death of a Salesman\". Al Pacino, Ricky Roma, as the hot shot salesman of the office who ran into a stroke of luck and seemed to be coasting along until he found out that it takes more then talk and buying drinks for a client to get the check to clear. There's Jack Lemmon, Shelley Levene, the offices former #1 salesman who's hit on hard times and is up the creek with bills piling up and his sick daughter in danger of being discharged from the hospital because Shelley can't pay the expenses.There's Alan Arkin, George Aaronow, who's been so battered and beaten over the last few grueling weeks trying to sell real-estate over the phone that he's taken on a defeatist posture about the whole real-estate business and seems to be just waiting for the ax to fall. There's Ed Harris, Dave Moss, who's brash and aggressive and willing to do anything that he can to keep his job even if it's of the criminal nature. And last but not least, Kevin Stacey, John Williamson, the office manager who's in charge of those men but you won't know it by the abuse that he takes from them, especially Mr. Roma, and wounder why he would want a job like that in the first place. Intelligent baiting and realistic that doesn't let up for a moment with a stunning and heart wrenching ending that guarantees not to disappoint the audience.

But surely one commonality to all great movies is that we are able to forget that we are watching a movie at all. In Glengarry Glen Ross, we are able to do this very quickly. You are not watching some very big name actors playing pretend, reciting memorized lines from a script, taking direction from someone off screen. You are looking at and listening to road weary, flat footed, brow beaten salesmen. More than that even, you are living the life of a real-estate salesman with them. You're not in some crowded theater, staring up at a screen, your actually in that cramped little office, with a mean boss, a gnawing fear for the next dollar,and some intangible loneliness.

I understand that if you make many movies too realistic they can get a little boring, but this was just way over the top. If they wanted to hire the best actors and get some amazing performances out of everyone, at least make it in a setting where screaming insults back and fourth and people freaking the h*ll out is a little more realistic.I also found it interesting that there isn't a female character in the entire movie except perhaps \"coat check girl\" who I saw listed in the credits. This was obviously intended to be a man's movie.The only good thing about this movie is how they portray salesmen trying to get deals, lying to their clients and acting very desperate, etc. If it weren't for the fact that I found this movie to be so mediocre, I probably would have enjoyed the actual plot a little more.

As many comments on IMDb state this film is totally led by pacino & lemmon who literally sucked me into there characters lives as did the other supporting character such as the cold mr. Williamson (played by Kevin spacey).This film is the most memorable pacino film I've ever seen & is highly underrated.I believe pacino was in his prime at the time he was filming this movie (he had that rugged gangster look but with a profane youthful mouth to go with it!) as well as jack lemmon (R.I.P).I don't know what else to say but don't be fooled by the slow, dark pace of the early part of this movie, it is meant to be that way with events taking place over one night & one morning. You will love the transition of pacino one night,from philosophical smoothe talking salesmen to the ruff around the edges, frustrated comedic salesmen that he is in the reality of the film.A true mens film that has you watching it over and over again with friends.

            "content": "Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) is the perfect film about the world of sales and boiler room environments. A group of salesmen are given a choice. Either sell or hit the bricks. Three salesmen (Ed Harris, Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin) and the company's hot shot seller are all involved in a shady land deal scheme. Their prize for making the most sales are a car, a set of steak knives and employment. To motivate the office, a \"motivational\" speaker (Alec Baldwin) is sent to their office to dangle new \"leads\" and to try and light a fire under their tails. Can the new leads and the speech revitalize the company or will desperate men do desperate things to stay ahead?A great film filled with a plethora of quotable lines and unforgettable characters (Lemmon and Baldwin's for example have been spoofed on the Simpsons, especially Shelly Levene). A highly underrated film featuring one of Al Pacino's last real acting performance. If you see this film on the rental shelves don't pass it by. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "The next time your best friend whines about his job, slap on a DVD of \"Glengarry Glen Ross.\" Believe me, he'll shut up fast.The script's stage origins are obvious (David Mamet wrote the play and adapted it for the movie), but nobody will mistake this for just a photographed stage play. It involves some of the sorriest real-estate salesmen in Chicago, fully embodied by Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, and Kevin Spacey as the office manager. In a bravura opening sequence, Alec Baldwin, the downtown higher-up, brusquely issues the latest sales challenge for the month. First prize gets a Cadillac, second prize gets a set of steak knives, and third prize gets a pink slip.As if that wasn't incentive enough, the sales guys are given \"leads\" (potential customers to call) that are like \"I Love Lucy\" reruns: decades old, and seen a thousand times before. With this minimum of exposition, we watch the guys at what could be called work--their suit coats dripping with flop sweat, varying their phone calls between telling loved ones that they'll be late again and pursuing old leads to share a \"marvelous opportunity\" with them.Compounding the frustration are the \"good leads\" that Spacey keeps locked in his office, \"for the sellers.\" Suddenly it dawns on a couple of the guys: What if the office was burglarized and the good leads stolen? Of course, the stupidity of this situation could be argued in a second: Wouldn't anyone who made a sale from the good leads be caught red-handed? But then again, the leads, like the MacGuffin in Hitchcock movies, are beside the point. It's really an excuse for David Mamet to throw a bunch of frantic old men together like cattle heading for slaughter, each not listening to the other guy, but waiting for that other guy to stop talking so that he can be heard. None of them exhibits the slightest joy in life. Even Spacey, the office manager with a loving family at home and an office full of great leads, can't even find it in himself to wallow in his superiority.As simplistic as the movie's set-up is, it's some kind of career high point for everyone involved. (My only warning is to watch out for this R-rated movie's generous use of the F-word--when asked, Baldwin even claims it's his first name.) \"Weepie\" movies come with the advice to have your handkerchiefs ready. Anyone who watches \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" should be prepared with a good stiff drink in front of him.",

            "content": "You've read the synopsis. Slippery salesmen in a real estate office use every half-truth, bait-and-switch, and outright lie at their disposal to dupe hapless customers into buying worthless real estate.Each character in the sales office, Pacino, Arkin, Lemmon, Spacey, all show us unbelievable lack of morality, each in a different way: Pacino with the impunity of Satan, Arkin with the desperation of Willie Loman, Lemmon with the glad-handed deceit of a used car salesman, and Spacey with the cold-blooded self-preservation of a rattlesnake.I don't see this story as one about the \"plight of the working man.\" These working men are not likable, respectable, or hard-working. They are willing to trade lies for income. They are willing to destroy and hoodwink unsuspecting and even mentally ill customers out of their money just to make a commission. No, this is no sad story about working men down on their luck. These men made a career out of selling junk and stealing peoples' life savings. The acting is spectacular from everyone. You can see, indirectly from their remarks, gestures (and of course, story-telling) that they KNOW what they are. For some of them (like Pacino), they don't care. For others, like Arkin or Lemmon, they've somehow convinced themselves that it's okay, that the sale is all that matters.The language is harsh at times, but always completely believable and appropriate. I deeply respect the work of all these actors, and to put them together in one film created magic. They never \"compete\" with each other on screen. Rather, they augment each other. Arkin plays wonderful scenes crying on the shoulder of Lemmon. Lemmon plays great boastful scenes, crowing like a rooster about what he once was to Pacino, who kowtows to him, while you can see that he doesn't really care or believe him and is only thinking about who he can fleece next.It's bitter, it's human, it's believable, and it is a GREAT film.",

The director, James Foley, in the DVD commentary describes the film as \"animalistic\" and states that the characters are merely doing what it takes to survive. \"Morality is a secondary issue.\" This is most certainly true in the world of Glengarry Glen Ross. We see the characters compete for money and the length they will go to to provide for themselves and their families. We do not, however, see the characters in their personal lives.The one glimpse we get of family is via Levene's reference to his daughter. After Blake leaves the office, the other salesmen leave. Levene stays to make more sales calls. He first, though, calls his family to let them know he will be working late. Not for love of money or career, but for necessity.Moss schemes, trying to sell his plan to the others in the office to steal the good leads. He suckers one of the salesmen into doing his dirty work for him.The acting is thrilling; the whodunit aspect is intriguing; the dialogue is intense. The underlying observation is lost on many viewers. What are we willing to do? Will we cross moral boundaries to further our careers? Is this okay, as long as it is only for money - to provide for our families? To what degree do our jobs define us? Can we morally compartmentalize our actions in our careers from our behavior in our private lives? Not easy questions to answer. Foley was right. We are animals competing to survive in a fierce world. What you are willing to do to that end is up to you.10/10 JEM",

Somewhat unbelievable script, but solid acting all around.Here are some of the film's inconsistencies:1. 'Blake' (Alic Baldin) asks if all those required to be at the meeting are present. Office manager Williamson (Kevin Spacy) says one guy, Roma (Al Pastinko), is absent, but Roma is the top salesman and he does not need to be there. Still, Blake says \"Well, I'm starting with the meeting anyway\". Later, Moss (Ed Haris) questions Williamson, \"Roma doesn't have to be here because he's the top man on the board?\", to which Williamson answers, \"That's correct!\").2. 'Blake' boasts of being a great salesman, but the 'leads' (prospective clients) which he speaks highly of, are, in fact, worthless, as Williamson states later (\"Those clients are insane.... would you like to see the memo from the main office?\").3. Roma goes to the barfly's private home to meet the loser's wife. It makes sense that Roma would get the inebriated loser in the bar to sign a contract to buy unseen land, but the loser's wife is the smart one, as she sends the barfly to see Roma the next day to cancel the contract, therefore, why would the barfly's wife sign the contract, too?4. Roma accuses Williamson of losing him his bonus Cadillac for being 'Number 1' in sales for the month, and of ruining a deal Roma was working on which cost him his 10% cut from the deal, which is true... Roma would have lost that, but the bonus Cadillac Roma would get for being the top salesman in the office would still be his.5. How could the competition (developer Jerry Graff who works \"across the street\"), be so stupid as to risk his business reputation and personal welfare by purchasing the stolen 'Glengarry Leads'?Also featured is the competent Jack Lemon and Alan Arken portraying a down-trodden soul. If Al Pastinko had any balls, he would have wanted to play the part of the loser, Levine (Lemon's character), instead of the 'top salesman', Roma, who is 'respected' while he walks around with a wad of money in his pocket. And of course, Roma doesn't have to be around for Blake's caustic verbal tirade, which is part of the reason Pastinko opted to play Roma).One question over-rides the entire proceedings: Why would these idiots stay with this terrible excuse for a job in the first place?",

There is no action in this film that resembles anything in the aforementioned list. However, it does involve a clash between egos and shows what men are capable of when oppressed and ridiculed. The story is set in the sales office of a time-share property company. The conflict is between management, portrayed by Kevin Spacey and Alec Baldwin, and the sales force played by Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Al Pacino and Alan Arkin. Sales are down and the executives are not happy in the least. Baldwin's character comes in to try to light a fire under the salesmen. He is brutal, unflinching and merciless. In a speech of around five to ten minutes he chews the men up and spits them out. He hurls expletives and inflammatories at them as if he has an endless supply. The scene takes place in the dingy, cramped quarters of the sales office. The staff is seated at their desks at various places around the room. Baldwin is on his feet and freely moves about. Much of the scene is shot from a low angle, emphasizing management's position over the workers. Also the fact that Baldwin is up and moving contrasts his position of freedom, power and control with the plight of the sales force which is anything but. They must produce or else be fired. This brilliant speech is some of Baldwin's best work ever. He is playing a cold-hearted son-of-a-bitch, and his \"f--- this! f--- that! I don't give a f---!\" tirade sets the tone for the whole movie. Baldwin's character has the fireworks, but the best performance - among all the great work by others - is by Jack Lemmon. He plays washed-up, over the hill, delusional and desperate salesman Shelley Levene. This character is so pitiful I found him difficult to watch at times. He begs and pleads with his sales manager (Spacey) for the good leads; even offers him a cut of the sales commission. He pretends to not hear the objections of potential clients, when the viewer can clearly see he has no chance to make a sale. Finally, he is pushed to his breaking point - and he breaks. In the end he is still pleading and deal-making; pitiful all the way to the finish. Director James Foley does a great job with the set and camera work, shooting in small cramped areas - car, phone booth, office, etc. - which symbolize the restrictive and oppressive atmosphere the men are trying to survive in. David Mamet wrote the play the movie is based upon, as well as the screenplay for the film. His words, delivered so flawlessly by this talented ensemble, are powerful and gripping.",

You cannot help but feel both bad and angry at Lemmon, as he attempts to grift his way back up the \"leader board\" so he can reclaim his top spot and job. This film also has wonderful performances by Pacino (Ricky Roma),Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris , Alec Baldwin and Alan Arkin. If you want a realistic slice of the \"kill or be killed\" nature of the salesman game, this is it. Now mind you, these characters are not saints, but they are real and their actions are more understandable as we see the events that motivate their behaviors. One hell of a film!",

            "content": "This film is undoubtedly one of my favourites of all time and that's because of it's brilliant portrayal of salesmen, it's stellar, sorry interstellar cast and its driving plot.One thing I really liked about this film (and it's Pulitzer prize winning source) is its 100 minute run-time. In that short 100 minutes, the film expressed to me more about the sales business did than Wall Street did in 126 minutes.Unfamiliarity - In this film, we're given an unfamiliar situation. There's no other film like this, so this is the first time we're actually being placed in this sort of situation. That's what gets us intrigued.Familiarity - Majority of the film takes place in one room. That gives us familiarity in terms of setting. We feel like home in that room, in a sense that we know how the characters move inside. The same is with 12 Angry Men and Reservoir Dogs. If unfamiliarity got us started, familiarity keeps us going.Next, the performances. Can we change that Best Actor to Denzel Washington for Malcolm X and that Best Supporting Actor to Al Pacino for Glengarry Glen Ross? Al Pacino is fantastic in this film. Kevin Spacey's performance makes you sympathise with him and hate him at the same time. Jack Lemmon makes you love him. Alan Arkin and Ed Harris are equally great. Alec Baldwin really has \"brass balls\".On a last note, I cannot talk about this film without commenting on it's fantastic editing. The editing is just marvellous. We cut back and forth and back and forth really fast when the conversation keeps rambling. We feel the conversation's tension and its rhythm when the actors and editors do what they do best.",

It's no surprise as there is half a dozen of the best actors in the last 20 years! All of the guys were legends before (Jack Lemmon), at the same time (Al Pacino)_ or a little bit later (Kevin Spacey). So it's no doubt full of energy and a masterpiece from acting point of view.The direction is unbelievably strong. Some ordinary subject, some losers and NO WOMAN!. And after all as it goes through you are tied to your chair harder. BUT....What's it all about? were's the moral? Isn't that necessary to obtain something from it? What you can obtain? That Jack Lemmon - the most positive character in all the movie - is the worst? That the cutest guy ( Al Pacino ) is a loser too? That Kevin Spacey is what ? Negative or positive? ANd after all .... so what?I do not think that putting the audience in some wrong idea and then give them a shock is always a good trick. You should think about the after wards and what will you give them after that...My best reason is IMDb itself. The movie which has about 7.2 points and many comments with 10 stars is not a favorite today (2007) at all!No one nowadays has heard about this movie and no one will. They just will be shocked when they see the list of actors and will try their best to watch this movie and enjoy during watching .... and finally feel sorry....just like me!",

            "content": "A set of tricky-dicky land salesman are put under extra pressure to sell-sell-sell. To encourage them further a set of prizes are put on offer by the \"down town\" office. They are - in descending order - a car, a set of steak knives, being fired!Transferring plays to the screen has long been a staple of Hollywood. Stating the very obvious, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. However when they don't work critics will often say \"they didn't do enough to open it up.\"Well here they haven't sought to open up an obvious play and thank god they haven't because this is a mini-masterpiece and it could have been ruined. The sets may be limited, but there isn't a single scene that rings false or has no part in forwarding the story.What makes this extra special that there are no parts played by anything other than major acting talent: Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin and Jonathon Price all together in one place at one time. (I am not being sexist - there really are no speaking parts for women!)Lemmon gives his swansong performance as an ageing salesman (Shelley \"The Machine\" Levene) that is going through a period of either \"bad luck\" or \"bad leads.\" Thank heavens the bad language didn't cause he to turn down the role of a lifetime.We linger to see his crooked sales technique. Firstly he isn't selling anything, merely a man out to do another human being a favour out of the goodness of his heart! To the client he is not even a real salesman, but a fictional President (or other high-up) that just so happens to be passing through town and wants to drop by to discuss an \"exciting opportunity.\"He is so hardened to the door-slam that he hardly notices it anymore - merely moving on to the next mark with the same zest and enthusiasm. The sight of a client signing the dotted line is his orgasm. Like real sexual conquest it is relished and described in blow-by-blow detail to whoever will listen.Al Pacino could have been a salesman or a con man (here the line is blurred) in real life. Although he has a script to work with he really does have that kind of brain and the ability to drag people in via attitude, voice and charisma: You have to be a raconteur, get people's attention, lure them, soften them up. Then without the client knowing a thing about it, in comes the \"soft sell\" sales pitch!Here a \"closed\" deal goes wrong and he goes from sleep mode to a 100 miles an hour in seconds: Playing for time, being confused by the obvious, trying to make for the door, trying the sales patter one more time, he tries every crooked trick in the book to keep his percentage. But he's a loser, because there are people that know a scam when they see one - if not the client themselves.(There may be \"one born every minute\", but they often marry the less gullible.)Kevin Spacey wasn't a star when this came out and paradoxically probably wouldn't have been cast had he been one. His character - while key - is background.He is the bookkeeper and the clerk and doesn't have to knock on doors and sell things on cold raining nights. He is free from the highs and lows of sales - a family man that puts up with the flack like the punch bag he undoubtedly is. But don't write him off too early - he has some of the best and most telling lines in the whole piece.What we have here is acting. Pure and simple. Nothing to hide behind bar a hat, a raincoat or a shinny suit. Writer Mamet has obviously been there and done it for real. Although some of the swearing and going from calm to frantic (and back again) is a bit over-the-top.The subject itself is an unexplored part of Western culture. People that are professional liars. People that say the truth only when it suits their cause - which means rarely. To win-at-all-cost means to sell-at-all-cost. Stop at nothing and let nothing stop you.There is a plot - of sorts - about golden sales leads that are being stored in the office. Through this we have the needed drama, revelation and downfall. In the end we see the professional gambler (I won't say which character) who has seen his last horse lose and has no more money left in his pocket and no more hope in his heart. The saddest sight in the whole world...",

I know those empty dialogues are supposed to open the characters up a bit more, show us they're real people and they talk how we talk in real life but the thing is they don't actually have a lot of interesting stuff to say so you just get lost in all the nonsense the characters exchange back and forth.Jack Lemmon is the only main character because only he has got a background story for his character, all the rest are underdeveloped therefore are playing around him but to their own benefit as well. I especially liked Alec Baldwin's short but memorable performance and I'm sure his (mostly) monologue has influenced a lot of actors since then.Overall this is a good piece of theater played out on the screen, with fantastic cast where each actor delivered one of the best performances in their respective careers and a fine script to back them up but the movie has too many incoherent dialogues and lacks flesh and blood supporting characters but other than that Glengarry Glen Ross is near perfection.",

Maybe it's a very clever piece of casting but the actors are clearly competing with each other in the same way their characters are in the story. Instead of an ensemble piece we get a series of encounters where the actors attempt to out act each other. The dialogue is unrealistic, no one really speaks this way. It's like watching Shakespeare, you are always painfully aware the presentation is a piece of art rather than entertainment. Despite the stage play receiving a Pulitzer prize the movie didn't win many awards but was a critical hit.

Among the impressive cast that includes the likes of Al Pacino, Kevin Spacy, Jonathan Pryce & Ed Harris, the surprising winner is Jack Lemmon. He plays his character to perfection. He lets the pathos of it to shine subtly through his performance. & About direction, the perceptive Roger Ebert made a wonderful observation that seemed to me very true in hindsight: 'The film was directed by James Foley (\"At Close Range\"), whose timing and camera help underline the humor; a line of dialogue will end with a reaction shot that mirrors our own reaction - surprised, blind-sided, maybe a little stunned, but entertained by the zing of anger and ego in the words.'",

Alec Baldwin starts out with a bravura speech that is the best he has ever done to this date, one that was specifically written for the movie by the way.Then there is Jack Lemmon who should have been nominated for an Academy Award because his nervous energy is visible in every scene he's in and check out his final scene where he finds out that he's been had. He just nails that moment. After being totally ecstatic for 10 minutes he becomes a complete blank. His character also has the best motivation to sell - he wants his wife to be proud of him and his downfall is therefore all the more poignant.Kevin Spacey, pre Oscar, is terrific. He is the pencil pusher that nobody likes but still remains somehow dignified and doesn't lose his cool at all. It is fun to see him take abuse without even flinching.There is a lot more to say about this excellent film but to those who are unfamiliar with the playwright, David Mamet, you can bet on hearing some of the most colorful dialog ever written and it is amazing that with a movie that is basically all talk and very little action, it is a most riveting experience. Just check out the later Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito movie with the same basic theme and compare. That doesn't even come close to a 5 on my list of best but this is the triumphant filmed play and there are not many.",

            "content": "...so here are my remarks, well-deserved & long overdue for this magnificent film. Too often film-makers blow their budgets on SFX then seem to penny pinch by employing students to write the script. Thankfully that is not the case here. It is based around the daily torments & dubious sales practices of a fictitious Real Estate sales company.This movie rests on the strength of its actors and the scripts crafted by excellent writers for their characters. With Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin & more there would be no excuse for turning out anything less than A class. I think it says a lot for the actors that they had the foresight to take roles in what must have at first look seemed like a low impact movie compared to much that is Hollywood.I loved Glengarry Glen Ross, even though at times it can be hard to watch because you empathise so strongly with the characters. It can make you squirm. As a former sometime Real Estate Agent here in Australia I'm glad to report that it in now way even slightly reflects the truth about most Real Estate Agents' techniques & ethics here. What it does do is dramatically show the tension of always being on the edge, of always needing the next sale to stay in the race. And it is a race. It isn't on Free-To-Air often even though here the strong language wouldn't cause any legal problems, unlike some other places. I strongly recommend it to pretty much anyone who considers themselves drawn to script based movies. 9/10 (PS: Why doesn't IMDb include Aust/UK/NZ etc spelling?)",

Two astonishingly bad directorial choices: Al Pacino's monologue (technically a dialogue with Jonathan Pryce) that caps Act I of the play, a piece of freeform jazz-like brilliance that wanders all over until circling back in for the kill - one of those pieces you read on paper and can't imagine how anyone could pull it off. Instead of letting Pacino's astonishing performance appear as one piece (as written) - the director chops it up, intercutting it with completely superfluous material from another scene. It's like listening to Coltrane's \"My Favorite Things\" in 52-second intervals intercut with 30-second snippets of beer commercials. I have been tempted too many times to get the DVD and recut the scene the way it should have appeared - one long incredible take.And speaking of one incredible take, the scene toward the end where Lemmon confesses...I'm sorry, but why in God's name does the director decide to dolly back, rather than in? The absolute dramatic climax of the piece, and rather than heightening the drama by pulling us in, he completely deflates it by pulling us away.The director has done a disservice to this great work.

            "content": "by Dane YoussefWell-played, well-written look at the bottom rung on society--salesman. Real-estate, exactly.Yes, it's a \"photographed play.\" Like just about every other play adaptation to the big screen... but it's so well done, you don't care. Like \"The Odd Couple\" or... \"Lost In Yonkers...\"The actors thankfully move outside the office a bit (outside the building, in cars, phone booths, restaurants... and at one point, over to someone's house)This could have been called \"Life of A Salesman.\" Men who dedicate their lives to selling real estate. Land and so forth. Not as easy and as coast-worthy as it all seems.God, what a racket. These people are all so cynical, bitter and desperate. They're claustrophobic and turning on each other. Their whole source of income and life rely on these little cards. \"Leads.\" Little cards with names, numbers and addresses of people who want to buy land. But some of them are so old...A red-hot salesman from downtown (Alec Baldwin, in a role written especially for him) comes down to motivate, drill and berate everyone into bringing their numbers up. When another salesman makes the mistake of protesting against all the abuse and calling Blake on his rant, Blake decides to put him in his place.He flashes his watch. He shows off his car. \"I made $970,000 last year. How much you make? Mitch & Murray asked me to come down. To help get the numbers up. As a favor. I told them that the real favor would be to take my advice and fire you. Because a loser is a loser.\"Then Baldwin shows the 'Glengarry Glen' leads. He holds them and shows them off to the other salesman like he's holding the royal crown jewels. The hope diamond. The holiest of holy grails. Well, to these guys... they are. Baldwin remarks smugly, \"These are the new leads. These are the Glengarry leads. To you, these are gold... and you don't get them. Why? Because to give them to you is just throwing them away.\" I like when Ed Harris starts to protest of this guy's dressing-down and Baldwin snaps back. He shows no mercy. Drills right through him. This is some of the best Baldwin has ever done.\"You see this watch? You see this watch? That watch costs more than you car. I made $970,000 last year. How much you make? You see pal, that's who I am, and you're nothing.\"Then he FINALLY drops the bombshell. \"We're adding a little something to this month's sales contest. As you all know, first prize is a Cadillac Eldorado. Anybody want to see second prize? Second prize is a set of steak knives. Third prize is you're fired.\"And there are more than three salesman in the office. One way or another, a lot is going to be trimmed. Not necessarily fat. Just... trimmed. A lot. To save money.The characters are sharply drawn and in a story that is intertwined and sown together with skill and surprise. The all-star cast does the best with Mamet's angry, fierce and realistic speak (the adaptation is by Mamet himself, from his Pulitzer-Prize winning play). Pacino is (as always, blistering) as the star salesman who's landed the top of the board with his fresh catch James Linsk (Alan Arkin).Ed Harris as Dave Moss is good as an angry, self-righteous salesman who's just such a jerk. An arrogant S.O.B. A great moment is when someone finally deflates him. Pops the big bag of hot air. Shows him to be scared and insecure underneath it all. His repeated cries of \"F-ck you!\" just reveal how truly desperate and insecure he truly is...The buttoned-down office manager John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) who's \"by the books to the core\" and has never been out there, selling it, in the sh*t a day in his life. He's just a company man. \"A secretary... and white bread\" as some of the salesman in the office call him.But the true breadwinner is the touching elderly Jack Lemmon as Sheldon \"The Machine\" Levene. Once the office golden boy, he was ahead and selling big week after week after week... reigning the very top of the board. The owners used to say things like \"That car, that trip to Bermuda... you bought that for me...\" Now he just can't sell. He sounds so grandfatherly and princely on the phone... you want to trust him so much. He's like Santa Claus.But Shelley cannot find anyone who wants to buy. All the name and address cards (\"leads,\" they're called) are older than Lemmon. Many have moved on and found better service elsewhere. The machine is longer up and running and Lemmon does a magnificent job of painting him a portrait of a burned-out star. A has-been. It's painful to look into those big sad dog-eyes of his...He at one point goes to the house of someone who just doesn't want to buy. That's understandable, isn't it? Hey, how many times have you met a salesman who just won't get it. But Shelley's desperate. He bargains. He pleads. He drops his price. No sale. His heart seems to be breaking when...There are many a great moment in \"GGL.\" Where Baldwin drills the troops, when Harris is hoisted on his own petard, when Lemmon works his old time magic with potential customers... and when a salesman pulls a hustling con on a customer... all to have one misunderstanding--a split second blow the deal.It would be unfair to go on with how the rest plays out. Suffice to say that it is worth watching again and again and again. The whole movie. It's a hard-boiled classic. Look for it wherever you can. Ask for it by name: \"Glengarry Glen Ross.\"--Personally Believing In The Mantra: \"Always Be Closing,\" Dane Youssef",

            "content": "Glengarry Glen Ross is based on David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning play about a group of struggling real estate salespeople who are under the gun. They have to make significant headway closing sales on investment properties or be fired. The men scramble, and as time starts running out, they grow increasingly desperate, turning on each other and considering more drastic measures to break out of their situation.This is a movie about what happens to people trying to survive in a corporate environment that doesn't respect them or provide them opportunity to succeed. More specifically, it's about what happens to people \u2014 men in particular, here \u2014 in that situation. In other words, this movie is about angry, lying, arrogant, weak, small-minded people with loud voices that they use a lot with many, many swear words.True to its roots as a play, Glengarry Glen Ross is all talking. That might sound boring, but it's impossible to find lots of dialogue dull when it's written this well and delivered by a cast of Oscar winners or nominees \u2014 Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, and Alec Baldwin. This may be one of the best acting ensembles in a movie ever. The actors all give tour-de-force performances that leave you unable to look away. It's a reminder that energetic, action-packed dialogue can be just as thrilling as the most elaborate special effects.The actors let you, at various points, sympathize with the real estate characters, dislike them, or laugh at them. (This is in a lot of ways a very black comedy.) That's because the characters are always shifting, as are the power dynamics between them as they reach the end of their strings \u2014 with their company, with each other, and with themselves. And the result is that by the end of the film, you realize these are people you'd never want to meet in real life.In other words, none of these characters is a particularly nice representation of real estate people. That's partially the point of the film, but it'd be easy to imagine someone watching this movie and developing all sorts of bad impressions about the real estate business and its agents. They don't care about each other as a team, nor do the salespeople in Glengarry Glen Ross care about the people they're selling to. They aren't looking to help customers find their dream homes \u2014 they're just looking to meet their quota. They're interested in the money they get from people, not the people themselves. As Alec Baldwin says in his infamous, scorching monologue, their goal is simply to \"always be closing.\"The men of Glengarry Glen Ross don't care about making a difference in someone's life. They only care about the difference peoples' money will make in their own lives.That's all not to say I don't recommend the film. Glengarry Glen Ross is a fantastic, thrilling film with breathtaking performance and great dialogue.http://juliekinnear.com/blogs/glengarry-glen-ross",

            "content": "The plight of the salesman has been a recurrent theme in American drama (Death of a Salesman, The Iceman Cometh-- ). Suspended in the feeding chain between the insatiable material lusts of the American dream and the voracious appetite for profit of  American industry, his predicament as martinet and professional huckster seems custom made to produce exploited and tragically deluded individuals, preyed on and preying on others. They can become  constructs out of touch with any grace or meaning in their roles and their lives.Into this pathos-laden environment David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross places a coterie of superb actors in a brilliant bit of melodrama. The context of the planning of a robbery to get the 'leads', reserved for 'closers', provides a touch of mystery that  works to alleviate the atmosphere of exhausted purpose and the claustrophobic entanglement of the characters with a manipulative sales promotion. The sales group is  forced into a bitter struggle for survival at the behest of some anonymous corporation whose only face is that of their top salesman, a vicious, sneering, greasy character played with cool malevolence by Alec Baldwin. Juxtaposed against this is the human element of these small fish in this small pond, afflicted with personal aspirations and tragedies.It is this dialogue between the all too  human and the inhuman,  among and within all of the players,  that gives this movie its force. Jack Lemon and Baldwin  are outstanding representing the opposing ideals.  Kevin Spacey as the cynical go between sales manager and  Al Pacino as the one salesman who seems destined to succeed by rejecting all ethical standards are also great. Ed Harris, Alan Arkin and  Jonathan Pryce play their character parts to perfection. I doubt you could have made this film work at this depth and to this effect without this ensemble of some of the finest actors in today's cinema.

            "content": "\"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is a movie that seems to get better and better as years go on.  Made 5 or 6 years before telemarketing call centers begun littering practically every urban center in North America, the film is actually much more relevant today than it was in 1992.The film is about a seedy, underlying real estate branch-office in a bad end of Chicago during a period of slow sales and salesmen that work there. After the honcho's at the head office decide that this particular branch was not performing up to expectations, they send one of their guys down to the office to tell them, in no uncertain terms, that only the two top salesmen this month will be kept, while the rest will be fired.  The big problem here though is that the particular salesmen caught in a rut at the moment are running on \"leads\" (an industry term for cards with the names, addresses, telephone numbers and personal information of people whom are potential sales) that are tremendously outdated (meaning they've been used at least once before) and the coveted new leads (newer, better leads almost assure you better sales) are given to those only who have made enough recent sales to qualify.While this film (and the David Mamet play) was made in relation to that particular form of real estate sales, anyone who has ever worked a job in the telemarketing industry will be able to easily relate to this movie.  As a student, I did telemarketing for 6 months for 2 different companies and saw this film a few months later and was shocked at how much unintentional relevance this film had on telemarketing viewed in the later stages of the 90's.  The system of leads, sales pitches and corporate policy is nearly identical to what I saw when I worked as a telemarketing sales rep.  You had the seedy, conning sales pitch that we all had to memorize and act out on a daily basis, the office managers who circled around the call center, hammering on people with slow sales with their only form of motivation being for you to win the monthly \"office prize\", you had the first class sales people, who got all of the golden leads, naturally, and then you had guys like me, people clamming onto stale, outdated leads, lucky enough to make one sale for every 200 calls we made, all while trying to score some of the Golden leads that the so-called top sales people were only allowed to land. Like the tagline of this film says:  \"Lie, Cheat, Steal:  All in a day's work\".The acting itself in the film is what gives it it's bite, though.  Jack Lemmon gives easily the best performance in his entire career as aging, former top-flight salesman stuck in a prolonged rut.  Alec Baldwin's highly praised performance in this film as the ruthless mouthpiece of the head-office is among the best of his career as well, but the real gem of this film in a film with a lot of gem performances comes from Al Pacino, in my opinion.  Pacino plays the current top-sales guy at the office and the speech he gives to a client he's trying desperately not to lose nearing the end of the film is one of the most utterly believable and real performances I have ever seen captured on film.  I was blown away.All in all, one of the best and most underrated films of the 90's.  I give it a 10 out of 10.",

Like 2001, if you sit and think about the character's motives, what their lives must be like, and so forth, you get a pretty complex puzzle.  Does Williamson really know what he was doing when he made up the story?  Could the check really be good?  Why did Williamson give Shelley a bad lead when he knew it was bad?  When did Shelly talk to Moss about the robbery?  How did Roma get the Jim Lingk lead?  What could Shelley have said to John to save himself?  How does John get away with all his broken deals (\"If you tell me who you sold them to, I won't turn you in\")?  All these questions and more... heck I'm going to go pop my copy in the VCR right now and watch it again!",

No office, no group of people working together, are that frank, that open with their hostility to each other. Quite the contrary, some people can work together for years and never know they hate each other.It is honest in that salesmen, to be good, must be amoral predators. But they are also professional phonies. This is where the film fails, for salesmen are phony with everyone, even each other. The frank, unvarnished honesty these men displayed to each other, the naked hatred and contempt, is the part I don't buy. Any group of men who worked together like that would soon kill each other.No, this script would have been far more superb if it had found someway to reveal all the hostility behind all the phony masks we wear. As it was, it is only half honest, so it is only half successful.The great cast and performances redeem it.",

            "content": "Very much a film adapted from the theatre but don't let that put you off for this is an excellent film from start to finish and the top notch actors seem to be enjoying themselves hugely in this male-only, testerone-filled screenplay.I can't say I'm much of a David Mamet fan. He is a very tedious and lazy author when it comes to adding more than the basic one dimension to a character or scene. And this isn't helped by his lack of imagination on the intellectual front, often resorting to vulgar language & confrontation.Having said that Director James Foley fleshes out the characters on Mament's behalf, although to be fair the casting for this film is exceptional when one considers the high quality of acting made available to him and thus making his job far more easier in the rather constrained & shallow Mamet screenplay.Foley really didn't have to get his message across too hard with people like Pacino, Lemmon, Arkin, Baldwin, Harris & Kevin Spacey at  his service. Most of these actors learnt their trade walking the boards in their pre-Hollywood days, so this film often a gentle return to the confines of a pseudo-theatre environment.The tension & claustrophobia that eminates from this film is really evident and only makes the story even more finely tuned & edgy. You almost feel as if you're watching some kind of reality-show or docudrama as these men fight for their lives getting people to buy their real estate and sign on the dotted line and finish king of the castle at the expense of his colleagues.Lemmon is the old hand, who more or less invented the art of cold-calling and knows all the scams like the back of his hand. And yet for all his success in the past it means nothing now, as he finds himself deeply in debt with medical bills, a more cynical public who are no longer interested in what he as got to sell, coupled with a more brutal and hardnosed management team that don't really care for his personal problems & frailties but demand more from him in better sales revenue.Pacino is the relatively young turk in the sales tea: succesful, cocky, self assured, confident, crafty and a person with an experienced eye & gift of the gab at spotting vulnerable members of the public in getting them to sign on the dotted line of a real estate contract the mug never really wanted in the first place.Ed Harris as the arrogant and scheming salesman, who feels very aggrieved at having to work for other people. He doesn't like the idea of his bosses taking away huge slices of his commission for themselves while he works himself into an early grave. He doesn't have many friends in the office and remain aloof & vulgar in his speech. He is frustrated, childish and ever closer to his first heart attack.Spacey as the young, relatively inexperienced, sales manager. He is clearly out of his depth at trying to \"marshall\" his sales force. Lemmon & Pacino in particular ridicule him & show him little or no respect because he has never done the kind of footwork they did when he was younger.And then there is the cameo from Alec Baldwin, as the champion salesman invited by  the chairmen of the company to give the office a bit of a shakedown and reality check in the arts of being a good salesman and getting people to sign those contracts.The story is excellent, the acting right across the board is a treat, although it could be argued that Pacino went a little over the top during times of anger and resorted back to his usual Pacino traits of lots of swearing, barging and confrontation but don't let that put you off.A very rewarding & absorbing film, that comes highly recommended*****/*****",

If there was ever a \"guy\" movie that had no shooting, explosions, exotic women, or car chases, then this is it because the tension is thick the whole way through. I think anyone studying to be an actor needs to look at this, and start rehearsing becase watching a movie like this should motivate any thespian. The scene with Alec Baldwin is the kind that will have you pumping your fist at just how tough he is. Pacino is great, with a delivery that is just masterful. Ed Harris as the high pressured guy about to snap, and Alan Arkin as the neurotic type who can't get a word in edgewise put in fine performances. And the desperation portrayed by Jack Lemmon as a the salesman who's seen his better days is the center of the film. Kevin Spacey also shows, in a low key way, where he was heading as an actor. The most amazing thing is that these guys practically say NOTHING. Words come out of their mouths that are strung together so haphazardly that any lesser actor would fail miserably. But these guys find it, go in the zone, and do it. Bravo!",

They remind me of the kind of people, who would attempt to lighten the burden of a holiday bell ringers charity kettle.   The acting is top-notch, and manages to generate interest in the story, as one would expect with the amount of star power concerned. Alec Baldwin chews up the scenery with his five minute on-screen role. To see these neutered men quiver in their patent-leather shoes at the abuse that's thrown at them; has got to be one of the most affecting, unpleasant and memorable butt-chewings on film. This is, alas, the high point of the movie. The rest lulls around the depressing task of watching these dignity-deficient, desperate men sink even lower into the abyss.",

Al Pacino and Jack Lemmon stand above the rest, but the rest are no slouches either...Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Jonathan Pryce and Alec Baldwin (in a scene-stealing role that's the best thing he's ever done) are all wonderful. The film has a limited amount of sets and is largely dialogue-driven -- it's basically a filmed play -- but that's what makes it so great. It's raw, no-holds-barred acting, full of Mamet's usual over-the-top yelling and screaming (and I mean this in the best way). The soundtrack is moody and gorgeous. The film captures perfectly the feeling of desperation that drives these salesmen. The fact that Al Pacino did not win the Oscar for this role (he instead received the award for his hammy overacting in \"Scent of a Woman\") and the fact that Jack Lemmon was not even NOMINATED are both nothing short of criminal.

At first, it's confusing for some minutes until you figure out the real estate lingo, but once you get past the ordinary phrases used by the businessmen, you love it. Basically the movie takes place in a real estate company on its last leg. During the night, someone breaks into the building to steal the Glengarry Leads. The good leads.Lemmon as Shelly gives an emotional and stirring performance. His facial expressions and his movements add to the whole effect of his character and it showed he could still act in major motion pictures.Arkin as George may have the hardest character to play as he plays a shaky and often on-his-toes salesmen, a good performance.Harris as Moss gets to do most of the screaming in the movie and that's always easy for Harris, he always does a good job.Baldwin as Blake has a short scene but makes an impact and it lasts. You just listen and stay attentive when Baldwin is speaking. It's that good.Spacey as Williamson has to play an embarrassed and often ridiculed office manager but Spacey's performances are always electric.Finally, the Oscar nominated performance of Al Pacino as Ricky Roma is quite possibly my favorite movie character ever. Pacino's usual swagger is there but this time it's there with an attitude. His screen impact is matched by no one in this movie and you'll love this character. With the exception of possibly Serpico, this is Pacino's best performance of his career and should've won the Oscar and probably would've if he didn't win for Best Actor that year.If you don't mind STRONG language and you love pure acting and dialouge and possibly the greatest cast ever assembled, you'll love this movie. If you like explosions every 10 minutes, leave this one on the shelf at the store. I give my recommendation to anyone who likes Lemmon, Pacino or just fantastic acting in general. This movie should be considered one of the greatest ever but it always gets passed up. Watch it and you'll see why you shouldn't have ever passed it up.10/10",

It reminded me a lot of Quentin Tarintino's writing. Although Tarintino does use violence, he also uses wonderful dialouge to get his point across, just as Mammet did.I don't think any other actors could've pulled off such great roles and I believe that these roles were created for Pacino, Lemon, and the others. This movie only takes place in limited settings, yet, due to the wonderful acting, I felt myself drawn into it so much, that I didn't even care that it took place mainly in the Real Estate Office.My favorite part of the whole movie though, and I don't think I'm alone here, is when Alec Baldwin gives his wonderful monolouge.

These are fascinating and emotional scenes.The movie moves along well, as these guys scheme and schmooze their way through whatever life puts in front of them. Utter and classic B.S. artists who know they have spent their lives lying and rationalizing themselves, but resigned to not knowing any other way.The only purely honest, human conversations these guys have is with each other, complaining about each other and the conditions that they must work in.

Maybe there are more salesmen in America than in Europe and that could be why many people think this film is about 'anyone' who works for a living.  It is NOT about working men (as the tagline might suggest erroneously, read: commercially), it's about slick tricks and misdemeanors by some guys who are in a tight spot and just happen to be salesmen.  The story is not about real estate that has to be sold, but about the behaviour of people in severe competition.  In order to create such a convincing characterstudy you need a good cast and that's what you'll find here!  Every word and every movement by any of the actors is important and creates an opportunistic hell that you might expect from guys in a tight spot.  The only performance in this film that I feel was only interesting because it was HIS best, was from Baldwin.  Fortunately, he has only five minutes of screentime.  The rest of the cast are stunningly subtle and contribute brilliantly to a tense mood.  Cinematographer Juan Ruiz Anchia (Liebestraum, At Close Range) created a film-noir look that adds to that tense mood.  After seeing it I had the feeling that competition must have always been like this and will never change, because people will always try anything to sell anything to anyone.  Oh, and, yeah, don't pay attention to the terrible cheapo cover: it's not representative for the content.  This must be Foley/Mamet's masterpiece so far.10 points out of 10 :-)",

I don't think there's one scene wasted or one scene where you can see them acting. Lemmon, Pacino, Arkin, Harris play their roles to perfection. Alec Baldwin is so incredibly good as Blake, the brutally honest sales motivator. The tension is thick as tree sap, and Lemmon's depiction of a salesman desperate for a sale comes through the screen like 3D emotion. Each captures nuances of salesman I have dealt with in my life. Lemmon reminds me of the salesman in The Simpsons with his folksy, but anxious attitude. (It's very surprising to hear him swear, which he does, alot). This movie isn't perfect. I didn't think Spacey's character was totally consistent (although I think he played it flawlessly, as they all did) and some scenes had a feeling of lag. But the acting is on a couple levels higher than just good acting. It's a movie that absorbs you and can watch over and over without it becomming tired. The acting is the real lure of the movie and it does not disappoint. 9/10",

            "content": "Glengarry Glen Ross has to have the greatest cast that I have ever seen in a film. Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Alec Baldwin, Kevin Spacey, and Jonathan Pryce all give brilliantly riveting performances. Seven of some of the greatest actors of our time.This film has some of the greatest acting I have ever seen, you'll swear you'ld think the characters are real if you didn't know any better. You can't pray for a better cast, or a better screenplay, based on David Mamet's own Pulitzer Prize winning Broadway stage play. Glengarry Glen Ross is also one of my top 20 favorite films of all time. I've seen this film numerous times and it never seems boring at all. This is certainly a film that deserved a lot of recognition at the Academy Awards, but like most of the other good films of the year, it didn't. This certainly deserved to be named the best film of 1992, it was so far superior to Unforgiven, and it mystifies me as to why this is not on the top films list.Another added bonus is a cool musical score by James Newton Howard. It seems to blend perfectly with the nighttime drama in the film. Wayne Shorter's sax solo during the credits is also a plus.Also, it is the little things in the film which make it all the more excellent, such as an el train roaring by each time one of the characters start to explode, the effect of the phone conversations which truly show the desperation of the men trying to improve their sales figures before they get bounced out of a job. After all of this praise, I won't go into the plot, but it is one of the most powerful screenplays that I have ever seen, which pits every man for himself against the harsh world of real estate. There is so much hatred and angst against the characters, which also contains excessive amounts of the f-word. This is probably why I love this film so much. To be honest, I would not have seen this film at all if it were not for its all star cast, but I'm certainly glad I did. I agree with most of you who said that all of the profanity made this film tough to watch, but each and every actor put so much life into their characters that it made me forget about that roughness and just enjoy this film. Glengarry Glen Ross deserves a 5-star rating. You have to see this film.",

Anybody who wants a film about what it's really like to struggle for dignity in the 90s, to deal with a ruthless, senseless capitalist system run by clockwatchers, and, instead of sympathizing with Annette Bening, to REALLY discover what a mindjob it is to work in real estate, look no further than Mamet's brilliantly adapted stage play.\"These are the new leads.  These are the Glengarry leads. To you they're gold, and you...don't get them. Why?  Because giving them to you would just be throwing them away...They're for closers.\"\nWith these lines, Baldwin's no-name hatchet-man intimidates, infuriates, and inspires three down-on-their luck salesmen (Lemmon, Harris, and Arkin) to desperate measures in order to insure their future as salesmen.  Pacino stands apart from these losers as master salesman Ricky Roma, a master after a mouse of a client (Jonathan Price), whose life perhaps seems redeemable in the chance to buy property from Roma.  The plot is tight, the editing and cinematography in your-face (and good enough not to draw attention), the direction and acting superb, and the words...\nSometimes, I wonder which is more marvelous in this picture- the monologues or the silences.  Of course, Baldwin is a friggin' miracle in his ten minutes, Pacino is by turns both philosophical and furious when his time comes, and Harris is able to use the English language like a noose in convincing Arkin.  However, it is Arkin and Lemmon's sad-sack faces that really hit me- Arkin's look of utter loss, vain frustration, and pain as he realizes at the end that no one respects or even hears him is truly precious, and Lemmon's reactions throughout the film, whether to Pacino's admiration, Baldwin's intimidation, or Kevin Spacey's menace are a gift to the art of the close-up.\nHow can you say American Beauty's the best film of the decade?  C'mon, people, look in your video stores and see the real deal! \"Stocks, bonds, pieces of real estate, objects of art.  What are they?  An opportunity.  To what?  To gain money?  Perhaps.  To LOSE money?  Perhaps. To LEARN about and INDULGE ourselves.  Perhaps.  So...So what?  They're an opportunity- that's all they are.\"  In the case of Glengarry Glen Ross, I highly disagree- this particular object is a wonder and a rare gift to cinema.",

Of course not. Is Alec Balwin typical of a main stream Vice President of Sales? No. My gosh, it would be near impossible to keep anyone of quality in such an environment.But what the movie does is make you appreciate what you have. Whenever the \"boss\" gets on your case about a bad sales month, think about Alec Baldwin and you will quickly realize he/she is not such an unreasonable boss after all.And when sales get tough, and they inevitably do from time to time, think about how tough they were for Jack Lemmon ALL the time: selling a bad product to unsuspecting people inside their home at 8pm. Ouch, talk about a tough way to make a buck.This movie keeps you grounded, that's for sure. But what I have noticed with this movie is non-salespeople typically cannot appreciate the film's greatness. They do not know the thrill of making a sale or the rejection one feels when they lose one, so they cannot relate. And that's fine, because unless you have been in the trenches, fighting it out against the competition, this movie probably cannot be comprehended.But for a sales veteran like myself, this movie is like an old friend.",

The movie casts Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Kevin Spacey (who won 2 Academy Awards in the following years), Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin and Alan Arkin all of whom put out impeccable performances that literally blaze across the screen. The story takes place in a real estate sales office where the salesmen face the fact that they are going to have to close more deals to reach their targets or they will lose their job after given a lecture by the tough top executive, Blake (Alec Baldwin). The problem is that they believe the leads given to them are no good, meaning that the customer list delivered to them to make the deals is dead-ends. One thing they know though is that John Williamson (Kevin Spacey), the manager of the office, has the leads to famous Glengarry Leads, which is a list of customers who are much more potential than the ones they currently have. However John is only allowed -by the company policy- to give the Glengarry leads to the salesmen who succeed in closing the deals. Next thing you know all the salesmen are thinking of ways to get their hands on the Glengarry leads, except for Ricky Roma (Al Pacino) who is not so concerned because he is the best salesman in the office anyways. This is a must see for all the movie lovers, a chance for them to appreciate the actors like Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey and Ed Harris. The story takes place in one or two locations and revolve around only a couple of characters almost to the point of making the movie look like as it would have better been a play but the performances of the actors are so splendid that this drawback is redeemed easily. All of the actors here -not just Al Pacino-could have been nominated for an Oscar very easily, including Jonathan Pryce, who plays Roma's client, Mr. Lingk; even though his time is very short, his acting is splendid. For reminder, Al Pacino was nominated for a \"The Best Supporting Actor\" for his performance in this movie in the same year he won \"The Best Leading Actor\" award for his performance in \"Scent Of Woman\".",

It's about survival in the business world in general, and how its cutthroat nature drives men to deception. I had loved Oleanna's ability to hold an audience's attention with a dialogue-driven script, and this holds true for Glengarry Glen Ross. The performances are high-energy and suit the parts well, as expected from such a high-caliber group of actors, although some are better than others. Alec Baldwin, for example, steals the show and sets the tone in his brief appearance, whereas I found Kevin Spacey's performance a bit one-note.

Not to mention the razor sharp dialog with some of the finest lines ever written!The film begins with a scene on one rainy night, when some real estate salesmen are subjected to a very harsh speech by Blake (Alec Baldwin) on how to make the right sales. They have to work much harder now (for which he announces three prizes), or they lose their jobs (that's the third prize!)! The film catches on from there, and we immediately start relating to the desperate situation these guys are in.Al Pacino had an Oscar nomination, and he was great, but I think Jack Lemmon deserves kudos for his portrayal of Shelley Levene. He breathes so much life in his character, it just goes to show the amount of importance there is to casting the right man to portray the right character! An all-male cast, the choice of actors is perfect: Kevin Spacey, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Al Pacino, Alan Arkin....Alec Baldwin makes a brief appearance but he practically rules the screen in that one scene. His dialog with the others present in the office is priceless!Even Jonathan Pryce appears very convincing in his short role.This one is highly recommended. Do watch this film at least once!",

This film focuses on the lives of a bunch of real estate salesmen facing tough times.We have: Jack Lemmon, a fast talking salesman on a losing streak. Desperate to make a sale to feed his family, he tries everything he can to get the loot. Visiting a potential customer late at night. Trying to bribe the office manager to give him some good leads. And eventually robbery.Ed Harris, a sharp-tongued loud-mouthed yob of a salesman who's at the end of his tether and ready to jump ship, with the leads in hand.Alan Arkin, another moaning salesman trying to quietly make himself some money. The most sombre of the group, but still obviously frustrated by the whole sorry state of affairs.Al Pacino as the hotshot salesman on a good streak. Trying to close a deal with a client he has dug his claws into.Jonathan Pryce as Pacino's client, who's dubious about buying.Kevin Spacey (amazing performance) as the manager, who doesn't quite no the score.and Alec Baldwin, as the company exec. who's getting tough on his salesman to get them to do their job.\"Make a sale, or you hit the bricks...\" --- Basically the story is a follow round. We just watch these men go about their business, and it's so well done you think you're shadowing them or something, for real.The acting talent is obviously good, and the story is even better.On the hot night, themes of desperation, egotism and ruthlessness comes to hand as these men try to make the sales, and then resort to more dangerous means of survival.It's hard to find a film quite like it, a slick moving tale that is absolutely amazing. And one of the best films of the nineties. I recommend this highly. It is fantastic.",

I didn't enjoy the experience, which makes me wish I saw the play instead.Overall, the movie was balancing on the borderline of boredom the whole time. The plot (if there is one to be found) is rather difficult to follow, as everything is scripted into the dialog, which itself is unbelievably repetitive (\"we can't work with these leads,\" \"yes we can't,\" \"we need the good leads\" and again again). I even resorted to read a wikipedia transcript of the plot in order to see whether I was missing something.-MINOR SPOILERS- Actually, the movie felt like it was deliberately made with the intent to throw the viewer into the movie and expect him/her to pick up details from the dialog. I appreciate the fact that it is based on a Broadway play, but as a movie, some background to the characters and main plot points would have made it easier to digest. For instance, how was I supposed to know the property they were selling was worthless? I wasn't mentioned anywhere, so how was I supposed to feel sympathetic to the buyers? No, I don't need a narrator to walk me through the problem holding my hand, no just one line somewhere would have done the trick.Also, I didn't understand the hostility of the salesman towards their branch manager. If they were such good salesmen, and hated their branch/manager/product/leads so much, why didn't they just pack their stuff and move on to another company? Their constant nagging and complaining made up 80% of the screen time.On the upside, the acting was really good and intense, and as a result it represents three out of my four stars. Check it out, if you feel like watching a handful of angry men argue for two hours, you won't miss out much if you don't.",

When I saw this film, freshly out of IBM when AKERS damn near drove the firm into the ground, it was horrific for me. I remember the Akers \"water cooler\" memo, that all the salesman were standing AROUND THE WATER COOLER. \"PUT THAT COFFEE DOWN\" had real effect and, watching it again, it still is -to anybody in sales- a horror film of the first order. Monster? Blake fills that role perfectly. It is the group sales meeting from hell, and the rest of the film is watching elderly salesmen, every one a WILLY LOMHMAN have a pity party. It strikes FEAR into anybody who has summed up monthly quotas, justified meetings. A unique horror film indeed. 10 out of 10 IF you can stand it and NOT get some coffee during the show.",

            "content": "When first viewing GLENGARRY...., I couldn't help but think of Thoreau's line \"The mass of men live lives of quiet desperation.\" Except, in this version, it's more like loud desperation.    The theme of the movie is real simple and potent, all human power grows out of a person's ability to make money now. Who you were, who you know, how long you been doing it don't matter much.    There are no women in the movie, and the only woman mentioned is Lemmon's daughter, who's dying in the hospital. So, the maternal life force of creation is ripped away, leaving only the death force of men destroying one another.    Jack Lemmon's character is a guy who would like to believe that he was more like Al Pacino, a man he admires and not like Moss, the loud mouth loser. But, Pacino can make a sale in a bar to a total stranger, and doesn't have to show up to meetings, while Lemmon is stuck begging for lead cards.   They say that the saleman is drama's most tragic character, because their jobs are so intertwined with their human worth. As someone who occasionally worked in cold sales, there's nothing greater than that feeling of conquering a lead. But, if you fail, your soul is emptier than your wallet.   Favorite piece of dialogue: \"What's your name?\" \"F**k you, that's my name! You drove a Hundai to get to work! I drove an $80,000 BMW! That's my name!\"",

This movie is entirely 100% dialogue, so if that's not your thing then you may not like this movie but I honestly did not have an issue with that.

Glengary Glen Ross is totally absorbing in the verbal exchange between the characters. It is so true to life. You end up despising all of the real estate salesmen because they toy and play with the truth and are all downright dishonest. Each has a price.

In the theatre, the setting includes the whole scene, with the keypoints all moving along simultaneously without needing to switch from one to the other. When it comes to a film, the director and screenwriter have to be able to reverse engineer the script, in order to find all the key points, give them the structure of sequential shots and edit them together in order to create the feel of the scene progressing. Very few have done it so brilliantly as Glengarry Glen Ross. Performances aside, the very best thing about the movie, for sure has to be the script. Entirely revolved around dialogue, it manages to suck in the audience and keeps them on point right untill the end. There is barely one moment throughout the movie where one can stop and collect one's thoughts.\nThe primary subject is the working class in a land ruled by capitalism, pushed to the bone and always sharp and focused when it comes to the job. What happens when they're backed into a corner? They have no choice but to fight in order to keep their job and sure as one can be they will fight, for no matter how much they argue and critique the capitalistic system, they are a product of it. And being a product of it, they have a sense of how to move in it and turn it's tables.\nJust as the movie shows, friendships do not last long in such a society, for they are all dealt with in machiavellian fashion: if need be they are formed, but as soon as the task at hand is accomplished, they are erased before they can backfire. All that being said, Glengarry Glen Ross is a truly wonderful movie, not only is it gifted with wonderful performances, it works around the subject of the victims of capitalism, a subject not easily portrayable in a realistic and convincing fashion.",

I'd never seen it before--wasn't interested when it first came out in theatres, had never even seen the play on stage--but I'd heard Baldwin was brilliant in it, so I bought it.Now I'm kicking myself for never having seen it on the big screen. And I've seen it at least a dozen times since buying it.The story, if you've read any reviews, you already know: Four guys in a real estate office (Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, and Al Pacino) are in a sales contest from \"Mitch and Murray\", the big bosses from downtown. As the slick-suited real estate millionaire sent to motivate the sales force (Baldwin, in a role written expressly for the film) explains, \"First prize is a Cadillac.[...]Second prize is a set of steak knives. Third prize is you're fired.\" With such motivation complete, Office Manager Williamson (Kevin Spacey, in his first big role) hands out the night's allotment sales leads, and they're pure drek...driving the men to various stages of desperation to ensure they don't fall off the sales board.That's the story. What makes this movie work is the outstanding performances. Pacino as office hot-shot Ricky Roma got the film's only Oscar nod for acting, but the late, great Jack Lemmon's performance as Shelley \"The Machine\" Levine would have been a better choice. Levine hasn't had a sale in months, and has lost his edge; his scene bargaining with Williamson for a better lead capsulizes Levine's frustration and fears perfectly. Just to watch Lemmon, a wondrous actor, bring every nuance of this character to life is fascinating; it is truly one of the best performances of Lemmon's career, and one of the most underrated.As for the reason I bought this in the first place, Alec Baldwin? He's magnificent. You'll forget he's only in one scene; his character's threats and emotional manipulation swirl through every scene in the film. His profanity-laced motivational speech is searing; you can feel every man in the room cringe as he verbally emasculates them in the name of generating more sales for the unseen Mitch and Murray. And the film's most quotable lines come from him: \"Put that coffee down! Coffee is for closers.\" \"What's my name? F--k you, that's my name! You know why? Because you drove a Hyundai to get here, and I drove a $80,000 BMW. THAT'S my name.\" \"A-B-C--Always Be Closing. Always Be Closing. ALWAYS BE CLOSING!\"Enough talking. See the movie.",

It was Pacino who was nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar, but the most vibrantly desperate actor in this film full of end-of-their-rope flunkies is Jack Lemmon, never better than here, as a true Willy Loman type driven to contemplate serious crimes by his desire to move up the sales ladder at cost-cutting real estate brokerage. He must fend off Pacino, an intense Ed Harris and a cowering Alan Arkin. The winner gets a car, the runner up a set of steak knives. \"Third place is your fired,\" shouts Alec Baldwin, in his most intense screen performance, as part of a brilliant diatribe in which he eviscerates and emasculates the underachieving salesmen.Add Kevin Spacey and David Pryce to this marvelous cast, who get to speak some of the best lines David Mamet ever committed to paper, and you've got an intensely satisfying tour-de-force that's constantly riveting, despite the fact that the locale rarely shifts from the office and a nearby bar. Some movies written by Mamet are stultifying, since all the parts must perfectly blend for an audience to appreciate a filmed play. (\"American Buffalo,\" despite the presence of Dustin Hoffman and Dennis Franz, is one of the worst sleep-inducers out there).But \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is not for a moment dull, so colorful are the ideas of alienation and desperation, and so verdant is the dialogue, chock-full of perfectly intoned f-words. Baldwin's 15-minute monologue -- his only scene -- is the stand-out sequence, but Pacino also does a so-smooth-it's-chilling monologue with Pryce, the sweating potential customer wooed by Pacino's Ricky Roma, the current sales leader. Spacey, in one of his first prominent roles, plays a rule-enforcing office manager who absorbs insults like a battered sponge; Harris and Arkin sweat and kvetch aggressively and passively, respectively; and Lemmon is simply transcendent as he stammers toward his inevitable fate.The ensemble effect is simply smoldering. Go rent \"Glengarry Glen Ross.\"",

A small group of salesman, who have struggled to close any deals recently are given an ultimatum: close your next few deals of else lose your job. For a little added incentive, the man who makes the most sales will win a Cadillac.  Simple enough storyline, you might think but the magnificent ensemble acting is a joy to behold and makes the film truly great.  Al Pacino, as always, stands out as hotshot salesman Roma and the supporting players are just as impressive, including Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey and a particularly fiery Ed Harris.  Even Alec Baldwin turns up in a memorable cameo early on.  However, for me, the real star of the show was the late Jack Lemmon who played the frustrated loser to perfection and really made you feel pity for his character. An extraordinary achievement, \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is one of the best films I have seen recently and all involved deserve credit for making it so hugely enjoyable.  Great stuff.",

I have always seen David Mamet as an excellent screenwriter and director, and I look forward to seeing what he has done for the upcoming \"Hannibal\".  However, this film didn't seem to be one that would hold my interest.After finally viewing it, nothing could be further from the truth.  This is another of Mamet's excellent efforts.  I have always found Mamet's characters to be his strong point, and this is no exception.  His representation of the average working man is right on par.  This movie centers mainly on the characters, and not on outside events which they cannot control.  Each of the main characters in this film are responsible for their own actions, and they each decide their fate.  An excellent character study.Jack Lemmon shines in his role, as do Al Pacino and Kevin Spacey.  (In fact, Al Pacino was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.) Of course, we can't expect anything else from these actors, as all have shown themselves to be highly regarded in dramatic roles.  Ed Harris makes a good showing, and Alec Baldwin is surprisingly effective as well.As I have mentioned in other reviews, I often like to be entertained while having to think about a film at the same time.  This film allows for this. However, while this is an excellent Mamet film, it's not his best.  For one of his best in my opinion, have a look at \"Homicide\", but don't let young children watch it because of the excessive (but still not overdone) coarse language.My Rating:  8/10",

And Jack Lemmon proves why he truly is one of the Great Ones.Alec Baldwin has probably the best 4 minutes in his acting repertoire.  To me, Baldwin is a great character actor who needs to get himself some really challenging roles, and not try to be a movie star so much.  But lines like \"See this watch?  This watch cost more than your car!\" and \"Coffee's for closers only.\" are given with malice and loathing.Al Pacino is terrific as usual, and Ed Harris takes griping to a new level. But Jack Lemmon's performance, as a man really on the end of his rope, is breathtaking.  This man should have gotten an Oscar for this, no doubt about it.  I'd like to think that Ving Rhames saw this movie just before he gave Mr. Lemmon that Golden Globe a year or so back.Finally, props have to be given to Kevin Spacey, who, like a spider, studies the web that is his office, looks for the first one to be trapped in it, and sucks them dry.

The only two women in the movie are seen for about \u00bd a second in a hat check room and putting two unappetizing donuts on a table, that's it. What the movie does have are half-dozen GREAT actors, working in perfect sync, and one of the greatest scripts ever written.Glengarry Glen Ross is about the stomach-churning world of hard sales, ruthless predators and their prey. This movie is about fear and survival on an almost primitive level and these actors deliver\u0085.boy do they deliver! This stable of actors portrays perfectly the cameo of the salesman with all of the associated despair, uncertainty and FEAR. For these salesmen, furnaces-stokers in a boiler room, when times are bad, they are very, very bad, and when times are good, they are not much better. 'What have you done for me lately' is the operative phrase delivered by the company lackey Sales Manager John Williamson, who is parenthetically verbally abused by all his salesmen. Jack Lemmon gives an all-world performance as an aging former top-performing salesman that has lost his edge and is rapidly burying himself in to the heap of has-beens. Ed Harris plays the very essence of a typical salesman, always bitching and never quite realizing his potential, mostly because of his own soured attitude. Alan Arkin as George is the most eviscerated salesman, having lost all of his confidence and the ability to close the deal. Finally, Al Pacino is the most successful and competent of the bunch, a swaggering bullshit machine that gives s the performance that should have won him the Oscar that year. The Salesmen are caught in a vicious Catch-22. The leads are tepid and stale and they cannot close them. Ironically, the often-dissed Sales Manager will not let loose of the Glengarry leads (genuine leads that they COULD close) until this rag-tag bunch demonstrates that then can close the unclosable ones. The anguish, anger and fear are ratcheted up a few notches by a \"motivational\" speech given by Blake (Alex Baldwin) at an impromptu Sales Meeting. Baldwin gives a brilliant performance and anyone who has been in Sales KNOWS and recognizes this type of speech. Motivation by extreme intimidation and threats, not unlike the \"motivational\" speech given by Gunnery Sgt. Hartman in Full Metal Jacket. Berating the Salesmen in the most inhuman fashion, Blake lowers the boom, telling them that the 1st price for the Sales Contest is a new Cadillac, 2nd prize is a cheap set of steak knives, and the 3rd prize? YOU'RE FIRED!Mamet is one of the finest writers of our time and the dialogue is crisp and filled with vitriol. The \"fuck you!\"' is spat out vehemently and often as the Salesmen lash out at a situation that grows more and more intolerable. There is not much of a plot, but not much of one is needed, as the character development is intense and spellbinding. The dialogue is breathtaking as the men struggle for survival with animal like desperation and intensity, not unlike starving predators on the Serengeti Plain, looking for a kill. Shelly Levene's performance and plight are awesome and heartbreaking, as he will try any tact, legal, moral or otherwise, to make a sale. His Sales Manager is about as much help as a anvil in a life jacket, refusing to do anything to help his men do what they desperately need to do....Sell, Sell, Sell!The DVD set contains some great extras, including a wonderful 30-minute tribute to Jack Lemmon, one of the greatest of the greats. We'll miss him and miss performances like he gave in Glengarry Glenn Ross.10.0/10.0 \u0096Top Pick!",

            "content": "Admittedly, this film does not have the most labrynthine story line that's every been created, but David Mamet -- one of the great writers of this quarter of the century -- has written one of the most interesting, depressing, hilarious and thought-provoking screenplays of this decade. Based on his Pulitzer Prize-winning 1984 stage play, \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" excels in it's added scenes (including Alec Baldwin's best performance, albeit 4 minutes and sans the \"I am God\" whisper) and incredible dialogue. If you don't think it's going anywhere, maybe you aren't paying attention. Even without the swearing, the tension that the dialogue creates gives us more of an insight of what's going on than who-broke-into-the-office? would. And even if the dialogue doesn't grab you, how can you not be excited by 6 of film's best actors in arguably the best performance each has done. Pacino is a fireplug whose arrogance you actually grow to love.  Arkin is the only redeeming character.  Lemmon is alternately annoyingly-brazen and pathetic.  Spacey is the louse that we've all met somewhere and Ed Harris is magnificent with jealous rage.  And don't forget Jonathan Pryce (from \"Brazil\" and the Infiniti commercials) playing a guy who's too smitten with Pacino to say no to him.   Foley's direction is terrific, with little touches like the Wayne Shorter soundtrack, the chugging subway every time a character goes on a rage, the gloom of the rain, all adding up to one hell of a depressing and exhilarating film.  You may feel a little uncomfortable watching it, but you're supposed to.",

The only part of this I find remotely entertaining was the acting, which was good, unlike anything else in this movie. That's why I gave it a 2 instead of what it just about managed to avoid, a 1. Would this movie be anywhere if it did not include Al Pacino? I doubt it.The big investigation and mystery was 'Who broke into the the office', and 'Who stole the list of people who want to buy houses'... Can it get any more boring? I won't tell you who it was, but I really think jamming forks into your eyes would be a lot more interesting, but either would put you unconscious.Even The Simpsons made fun of it with Gill. I'm not sure if they think that the obsessive use of bad language adds to the excitement or suspense of it, but I really think that it doesn't. Al Pacino is a great actor... I mean Godfather II, Amazing... But he hit a low that I thought no one person could reach. Anyone involved with the making of this movie should be shot. I have never seen the play, so I will not comment on it, but it couldn't possibly be worse than the movie. So if you want to subject yourself to such torture, watch the unrated by me-play.It isn't the no.1 worst movie, let's leave that with Superman Returns. So instead of watching this, watch The Truman Show... That is the No.1 best movie, and is rated .1 out of 10 better than this terrible, dull movie which is rated completely wrong.

No boss would tolerate his subordinates to talk him with such blatant disrespect. I also don't believe that level of cursing would occur because it is unprofessional. However, the company executive (Alec Baldwin) coming over and acting the way he did, that I believe.Mamet is an excellent playwright, but he goes overboard in this case.

He is a good craftsman but where, pray, is his so-called original and exciting talent ? As far as I can see he is a poor American version of Pinter. No doubt his knowing style over content post-post-modernism is the best our particularly lackluster generation can achieve, but those who fete him could do well to imbibe pre-Star Wars culture and get some perspective. Pacino and Lemmon are some of my favourite actors and they have done some fabulous work.

A team of salesmen are assembled to make the sales. An unknown group of buyers (the leads) are out there for the salesmen to lock onto and talk into buying the parcels. Are the parcels of any value? We do not know, it is not important. What we do know is that the company has an incentive scheme to encourage more and more sales. The person with most sales in a given period gets a reward. But it isn't enough. The \"boys downtown\" are unhappy with the level of sales, a \"cleaner\" is sent in motivate the salesmen. It is a new motivation: the \"closers\" of contracts get their names on the board, a chance to win \"first prize, a Cadillac Eldorado, second prize, a set of steak knifes, third prize, you're fired.\" Who is the motivator? A new kid on the block (Alec Baldwin) with a watch that cost more than the salesmen's cars, who drove to the meeting in a $80,000 BMW, and who earned $970,000 last year. And the salesmen? One of them was Shelley Levene (an outstanding Jack Lemmon). We gather that he needs money desperately, his daughter is in hospital, there are bills to pay. And he \"hits\" the script running - a man so deep into despair, his situation so hopeless that you can almost touch it, and his attempts to disguise this, to remain upbeat, above all to sell, sell, sell. This was a cruel film. The company wants to get rich and doesn't care what depths the salesmen go to, the salesmen want to make a living, and we assume that buyers buy because they see this as some get rich quick scheme. Greed, greed, greed. And then there's Shelley Levene who cannot speak to his daughter because the phone company disconnected her phone because the bill wasn't paid. And he needs the money! If it wasn't a film you would try and make contact so you could give it to him. It was that kind of film. It was very uncomfortable viewing.",

In fact, the entire cast makes it rain with stellar, career performances. But the Cadillac prize goes to Mr. Lemon's sacred personification of Shelley \"The Machine\" Levene. It was solemn, effing solemn. The tears in his eyes at the end still gets me. Only a true master could close a performance like that.Mamet's writing is gold, the old stuff. The educational value alone is priceless, let alone the immortal monologue, commiserations, tell offs, colloquies, smooth talks and gut splitting one-liners. GGR is as much a documentary on the hard knock life of real working people as it is an ensemble character film. Mamet's beleaguered salesforce survives on its wits and its minerals alone. Their struggles, ambitions, fears, envies and responsibilities could only have been written by someone with a bit of hard knock life experience to draw from. Experience today's company writers in hollywood are utterly lacking. GGR's 2 hr struggle session of hard-boiled, atavistic street philosophy yields far more enlightenment and edification found in current day media and academic echo chambers. This little peach should be required viewing for graduating high school students heading out to the workforce.And remember - you never open your mouth till you know what the shot is.",

Once the individual performance reaches its peak, and starts declining, the boss finds him no longer indispensable and treats him like a disposable money machine, reflecting the dark side of capitalism.Dave Moss (Ed Harris) said it as a subliminal introduction: \"they don't give us the leads, they don't give us the support, they don't give us ... \" And that is reflected, first from Alec Baldwin's monologue, and then, by the boss who does not advice his staff that there are customers with dubious reputation, and they should be avoided.This movie is not far from reality.

I remember some of the hubbub which surrounded this film when it was first screened back in the early 90's.And there's the rub - it was made in the early 90's, when yuppies were a thing, and while one can read some social conscience into this piece, it is nonetheless firmly focused on greedy, grubby capitalism at its worst. A world in which a man's worth is measured by how much he paid for his wrist watch, and even the guy who opens his mouth to protest goes quiet when attention is drawn to his own humble timepiece, indicating a sharing of these values.Something about it reminded me of \"His Girl Friday\" - another film which looked great on paper but in practice turned into a joyless couple of hours of shouting inspired by the American Dream of cold, hard dollars.I'm sorry, but it's just not entertaining or enjoyable to a normal, balanced European - unless perhaps you lump yourself with Yeats when he wrote \"we who seven years ago talked of honour and of truth, shriek with pleasure if we show the weasel's twist, the weasel's tooth\".What a shame something more enduring, inspiring, uplifting or simply enjoyable could not have been made with such a tremendous cast.

The story is very small in terms of where it takes the viewer (quite literally the street, the office, a bar, a some doorsteps) but the broadness of the characters and the skill on show more than make the picture enjoyable.Its not action packed in the traditional sense, but watching such a fine cast work their magic is more than enough reason to watch it.8/10",

But as mentioned by another reviewer, a great deal of gratuitous swearing. No matter, I would endure that to see the great drama portrayed by great actors.But as the play wore on, I lost any affection for the characters, largely because of their swearing. Only Kevin Spacey was 'nice' and went home to spend time with the family.Lo and behold, the climax and denouement arrive (don't blink, amidst all the shouting and swearing you might not notice it) and the whole issue turns on a fact blurted out during yet another tirade of swearing.Mr foul-mouth gets his come-uppance, Mr nice guy wins, and does it all without swearing or being nasty, and still gets to go home to his family.I'm all in approval of Nice Guys finishing first, but is that it???? Is that all David Mamet, the playwright, can make out of this????How much better is this than the old Western formula of Black Hat=Bad Guy, you always miss, White Hat=Good Guy, whose gun always hits the target and who always gets the girl? Not much better, for my money.To sum up, GREAT actors wasted on a dramatic yawn. Three out of ten.",

Check out Kevin Spacey as the harried office manager who has to protect the good Glengarry leads, to Alec Baldwin as the sales manager from \"downtown\", who initiates a sales conference that is little more than an exercise in abuse. From Jack Lemmon as Shelley \"the machine\" Levene the old pro who's lost his stuff, to Al Pacino as Ricky Roma, the flavor of the month, who is well on his way to winning the Cadillac Eldorado. This is some of the best acting you will ever see, and its definitely worth the price of admission.

It was great. Spacey's character was a real a**hole. He had some great lines in there too. \"Will you go to lunch, go to lunch, WILL YOU GO TO LUNCH!!\" LOL, it was out of control. Finally, the dude that stole the show was Pacino. The scene where he tells off Spacey's character was the greatest scene in the movie. Everybody told off Spacey in that movie but Pacino walked away with it. \"You never open your mouth until you know what the shot is, YOU F****N' CHILD!\" or \"what you're hired for is to help us, not to F**K US UP!!\" That s**t was the craziest s**t in the world LOL LOL LOL.

The dialogue is really fantastic though, and the repetition of some words just seems to add to that. Of course they keep ranting about \"leads\" -- their entire lives are defined by the damn things. The acting is also really good, and I'm disappointed Baldwin only had one scene (which was by far my favorite one). All in all, it really got under the skin of the problems faced by these salesmen, from a useless and annoying boss to customers who just aren't interested. The desperation caused by threats of job losses is really sold here, which is a really relevant theme at the moment (and probably always is). It wasn't really perfect for me though... I sometimes got annoyed with how a character would go from a huge loudmouth to mute, almost as if they were waiting for the next (admittedly entertaining) rant to reach its climax. It also had a plot twist I didn't see coming, which was nice.My rating for it may actually go up an entire point at some point, depending on if I ever get the notion to rewatch it.

The set up is that it is an exploration of the machinations behind the scenes of a real estate sales firm. Now right there I can sense a starting point for some serious moral conflicts, the lying, deceit, double crossing, double talking, and flat out inhumanity of the salesmen against their clients, and also against each other... And yet there was very little of that... Then came the *spoilers* robbery plot... a 10 minute discussion Moss and Aaronow, only to have Levine get in on it in the end, sure it was a nice little surprise, but where was the development of his character to that point? The phone calls, I guess, were supposed to accomplish that, and yet I had to watch it twice to figure out that his daughter was in the hospital and he needed money for something... that should have been more fleshed out. Then Moss's character, high impact from the start, stealing whatever scene he is in, and there's nothing with him...Lastly, was Roma... his deal with Lingk had everything, the intro, the sell, the gradual luring in of Lingk, Roma slowly attaching one claw after another onto Lingk until he falls hook line and sinker, only to have a crisis of conscience, which opens the door for Roma's double talking, lying, word-twisting, misdirection, sell his mother to avoid losing the sale situation, and what... it's crammed right into the middle of the police investigation sequence... It should have become the only thing going on on the screen, but no, it shared the screen with the po-po... and thus its impact was lost.All in all, it had a lot of potential. If they had opened up the film, explored Moss and Levine's characters more, and then put Roma's situation front and center when it was happening, the film could have been truly great... and yet it wasn't. Boiler Room, while about the same in quality, showcased the evilness of the sales industry much better. GGR had slightly better writing and performances, BR had better plot development.",

What I find most amazing (besides the acting, which is nearly flawless throughout) is how much of the dialogue is really trite and meaningless: cursing, shop-talk, complaining, boasting, avoiding the subject, and YET it is still so engrossing-- a testament to the talented actors who breathe life into it. Pacino's final scene with Pryce is perhaps my favorite-- he is desperately trying to keep Pryce on the hook, to the point of playing dumb, and makes Pryce's character look like an idiot.I find NONE of the characters at all admirable; they all have a layer of slime on them, even Lemon's Shel \"The Machine\" Levene, who has a certain humanity to him (desprately trying to help his sick daughter) becomes nothing more than a greasy salesman/con man once he picks up the phone (note how his tone of voice immediately changes-- no wonder people hate salesmen so much).My favorite line is one most people won't notice or remember (most people focus on Baldwin's haranguing or Pacino's curse-fest)-- towards the end, Arkin picks up the phone, mutter's \"God, I hate this job\" and dial's up a potential customer-- priceless, that says it all.\"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\"-- Thoreau (although in this case, they're not so quiet about it).",

            "content": "Sure, David Mamet's screen adaptation of his own Pulitzer-winning play is extremely well-written, but let's face it: Glengarry Glen Ross is nothing but a showcase for great performances. But then again, what's wrong with that? Especially when the performers involved are this talented (e.g. Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, and Jack Lemmon -- and yes, I did write Jack Lemmon twice). Afterall, there's nothing quite like watching Kevin Spacey ask Ed Harris to go to lunch... six times. In actuality, however, almost every single performance in this film -- INCLUDING Alec Baldwin, if you can believe it -- is Oscar-caliber. And at the end of the day, that's the only thing that makes it possible for such an ordinary concept to become such an extraordinary film. The story of Glengarry is rather bland: four real estate businessmen have to improve their sales or find a new job, and in order to accomplish this, one of them breaks into his office building and heists the \"golden leads\" his boss refuses to give out. Sure, there are a few surprising twists and turns, but the real treat of the movie is the chemistry between the characters. In an interview, director James Foley stated that when Alec Baldwin arrived on the set, the other lead actors treated him -- and I quote -- \"like s**t,\" making his performance (which basically consists of yelling at the four realtors and telling them to \"f**k off\") even more realistic. Al Pacino -- who earned the only Oscar nomination for the film -- is equally phenomenal, but as I hinted earlier, the true star here is Jack Lemmon (and I'm not just saying that because he's six feet under). Jack has always been one of my favorite actors, and to watch him play such a different role -- which would later be spoofed on The Simpsons as a down-on-his-luck businessman named Gil -- was a sheer treat. The other thing that I really loved about Glengarry was the mood: film-noir has always been my favorite genre, and it really takes over the first act of this film, made evident through the constant rain, the dark bars, and the desperate characters. Overall, Glengarry Glen Ross is a thoroughly satisfying drama worth being watched more than once.Grade: A",

They are having trouble making ends meet, and with good reason - they have themselves to blame! Approximately half the movie is spent with someone moaning about their poor leads. If they were any good they would suck it up and get to work.I'm surprised that they get any sales at all when they have such a negative attitude in the office.Another thing to note is that this movie depicts old-school, high pressure sales. This movie continues to perpetuate the myth that in order to do well at sales you must be a good talker. You notice that the salesmen are speaking most of the time, instead of the client in every situation in this movie. Perhaps if they were to ask the prospects some questions and listen to them attentively, they might actually find out what the prospect needs. Then they might have a clue how to sell them!Lastly, these salesmen all are shown lying to prospects. If you are going to have any long term success in sales you are shooting yourself in the foot by lying! It always comes back to haunt you.Watch Boiler Room instead.",

I am always surprised at how few people I know have seen this movie, given how incredible it is and the fact that there are take-offs of GGR moments and characters found in so many TV shows. Those in the know usually put this film in their top 25.Obviously, this is no \"action movie\" that drags in the unwashed masses. Instead, the popularity is due to the characters and the acting. This, in spite of the solid story that provides a framework. This dark tale is sort of depressing if you're in sales! The performance of Jack Lemmon in this movie literally brings a tear to my eye. He was so incredible that I immediately started digging up and watching (or re-watching) every movie with him in it. What a genius he was.As for the others, there is no debate that this star-studded cast gave performances that would be expected of actors with their significant credentials. That said, I do part company with many of my fellow reviewers. Kevin Spacey and Ed Harris (and of course Jack Lemmon) were convincing in their roles, and their characters made sense. I did not feel the same about the others.One of my all-time favorites, Al Pacino, undoubtedly brought his own flavor to the Ricky Roma character, and it didn't work for me. He was simply too, well, \"weird\" in sort of a \"Scent of a Woman\" way, and his bizarre vocal inflections and body movements were an unwelcome distraction.Alan Arkin's character, George, (as opposed to his portrayal of it) was not believable. He came across as so dependent and mentally challenged that success in sales, or any field, would be unlikely and he would have starved to death long ago.Alec Baldwin is in the same boat, in that while he powerfully played a character that was already established in the writing and the play, his character was not believable. I don't see how \"Mitch and Murray\" would have let their operation get to the point it was and then send this pit bull in there. Or maybe, they were just bad enough managers to have done that, which I guess WOULD make sense. In any case, it is over the top. That said, it was very important to establish early in the story that one COULD be wildly successful in that business, so you would have a context for the other characters.Some have commented about the film's geographical setting, and it is ambiguous enough that it is almost distracting. People seem to believe that the setting was New York. After all, it was filmed there. I was certain that it was set in Chicago and that the outside shot with NYPD-colored police cars was an uncharacteristic affront to a viewer's intelligence. Not only does every city mentioned exist around the Chicago area (as well as NYC - with the exception of \"Batavia\" which is a suburb of Chicago but hundreds of miles from NYC), but I have a hard time believing that when people in NYC need to get away, they \"go to Wisconsin\", as Dave Moss said he was going to. I think that debate is settled right there. They were just too lazy to truck a few Chicago Police units to Brooklyn.",

An agency full of realtors that have to break all the rules to keep their jobs is a bad start as it is. I think it's dream of actors sometimes to find a roll where they can talk like sailors and get it out of their system. It's so melodramatic that it's not funny and you wonder just how much more vulgar these guys can get.",

I have to say this is rare since usually by now I would have turned it off and left it somewhere in dirt and might or might not come back to give it another try ages later which lead us back to the point I am trying to make: it's really really good!!! And pay attention to Alec Baldwin damn he's hot as a J@ck@$$, I can't believe I missed it the first round. I am not an expert myself to write a full length review with all the fancy words but I highly recommend it to everybody to give it a try. This is one heck of a movie that doesn't require steamy cleavage or luxury cars and impressive explosions (yeah i'm talking' about u Mr. Bond) to create the WOW factor. It's one of those that you either love it or hate it (seeing it was rated below 8 probably helps proving my case), plus in my experience with friends of mine, it might be a bit too \"masculine\" for female audiences since I have not met one with the same gender that enjoys it but hey I am a girl and I LOVE IT.",

Spacey, as the office boss is at his usual high standard as he refuses to cut his staff any slack.  Pacino, well what can be said about this man, his deliverance of lines makes any films he's in, addictive. Pryce, as Pacino's prey is also perfect.  And Baldwin, never has he been given the opportunity to express his talent in such a way.  His motivational speech is enthralling and proves just how good David Mamet is. Arguably one of the greatest scripts I've witnessed and proof that you dont need special FX to create a thoroughly entertaining hour and a half's worth of movie making! A well deserved 10/10",

The rapidly deteriorating world of Harry Stoner is turned, in a sense, inside out by Lemmon in this film.  Is Lemmon Glengarry Glen Ross's central actor? Perhaps not, but Lemmon's characterization of Shelley Levene is surely central to the film's power, terror, and madness.  Lemmon's Levene is a volcano pushing the other brilliant actors into some of their best performances.It is astonishing to me what Lemmon was able to draw out of Stoner and Levene turning, in his extraordinary talent, miserable, small men into lugubrious everymen which, at once, we justifiably revile and pity.  Harry Stoner, Shelley Levene, and Willy Loman, the \"other side\" of post-World War II striving.And, of course, every cycle of tragedy needs its comedy ... for me, in the Lemmon oeuvre, its \"Some Like it Hot.\"  But then, \"nobody's perfect.\"",

Lemmon, Pacino, Harris, Spacey and Arkin are all brilliant and the support of actors like Baldwin and Pryce are icing on the cake.

That is where this movie is about: closing (in a time of recession). Glengary glen ross makes you wonder whether a life as a salesman is a privilege or a disaster. Next to Alec Baldwin there are many famous actors playing an important role: Kevin Spacey, as an ass-kissing manager, Al Pacino as the salesman with the smooth-talk, Alec Baldwin as the harsh-super-salesman, and many more.The language which is used is very bad, therefore I would recommend this movie only to people who aren't offended easily.",

It's not even 90 minutes and set mostly on the same soundstage--so much more could have been done.

He shows all the desperation of a salesman on the decline better than anyone I've ever seen.  Pacino has a sense of dynamics that also ranks with his best work (the scene where he is selling the Lingk guy at the Chinese restaurant is one of his finest performances).  Alec Baldwin has an explosive cameo that may only be bested by Robert Duvall's Col. Kilgore in Apocalypse Now (yes, he has THAT much of an impact).  You also get to see Kevin Spacey in an early work that has all of his coldness in tact.

I only worked under that kind pressure for a little while, until my \"real\" job opened, but it was an experience, perhaps that's why I appreciate the tremendous acting done by these \"pros.\" A lady friend was quite adamant bout there not being women in this play and after I explained to her that what was happening on the screen was quite real and that women would \"never\" put up with the abuse offered she relented and saw the light, as it were. Al Pacino is my very favorite actor outpacing even the great Marlon Brando, in my book, also, Ed Harris and the rest were every bit up to par with Pacino, even the obnoxious Jack Lemon.

Like the play, the movie uses only seven or eight different sets, and the dialogue from the movie is identical, as far as I can tell, to the dialogue from the play. So it's basically a play that's been filmed.  Glengarry Glen Ross is a stunning play, and I think it adapts in a fairly straightforward manner to be a stunning movie, but my own bias, as a writer, is toward those films that have strong dialogue and show a powerful use of language.  Those of the more conventional Hollywood \"show-me-don't-tell-me\" persuasion may find it somewhat tedious.  But those who have an ear for the spoken word would be hard-pressed to find a better-written movie with better actors turning in better performances.  (Plus, if you're a Simpsons fan, you need to watch Glengarry Glen Ross so you can understand the origin of Gil, the pathetic salesman... :)",

It's hard to say who is the best among these great character actors, but Jack Lemmon is certainly the scene-stealer with his portrayal of a desperate but still persistent salesman on the brink of losing his job after a poor sales record. In one of his final roles, dear Jack is still the everyman we knew and loved but this time he brings a never-before-seen edge to his character. Kevin Spacey is superb for once more in a relatively small but powerful turn, as is Jonathan Pryce, while Ed Harris delivers one more energetic performance. Al Pacino is unbelievably loud - that's something he does pretty often in his films, but the catch is that he was nominated for an Oscar for this particular portrayal of the top-of-his-class salesman, untouched by the desperation and decay that surrounds him. The honorable mention goes to Alec Baldwin - much louder than Al Pacino, but seriously overrated. David Mamet's script is alarmingly accurate and realistic. A must-see.",

This film starts very strong with a great five minute performance from Alec Baldwin.  He makes you believe you have just sat down to witness true perfection.  Needless to say, that is all we see of Mr. Baldwin and everything that follows is a vast pool of nothingness.

This movie, based on David Mamet's celebrated play, follows the characters, through their daily grind of selling real estate, and pays witness to the fair and foul techniques, which, evolved through to the Eighties, previously the most fruitful techniques.The rhythm and atmosphere of the film, retains much of that of the play and our characters, for all their striking differences, are conjoined by the shared compulsion to \"make the deal\".This drive becomes incredibly exaggerated over the 18-or-so hours around which the plot revolves, as they have all been given a do-or-die ultimatum by their employer, with the top sellers being awarded the questionable prize of keeping their jobs.The harshness of this scenario and the way it draws the weaknesses and personality traits out of the respective combatants, demonstrates the futility and the tragedy of the working man betrayed. Its resonance is distinct and poignant to any individual, who has ever had their employment threatened.In true Darwinian style, the strong ultimately survive and the old and weak fall by the wayside, but not before we are offered a staggering insight into the selfish and uncaring cesspool that is the selling game.Quality of acting is undoubtedly the strongest element of the movie, with Lemmon, Pacino, Spacey, Harris and Arkin all at, or near, their best.

The dialogue was repetitive and masturbatory.  It seemed that it was simply meant to glorify these six wonderful actors. I thought the concept was mildly interesting, a study of men in a desperate situation, but it could have been developed in the length of an NBC sitcom.  The rest of the dialogue was simply meant to make the actors look good. In that respect, it was very successful. If you enjoy this film, check out \"The Big Kahuna\".

You see, the two are essentially the same, only the film has one extra character (Alec Baldwin's 'Blake')and a few extra scenes; however, I believe that the film is superior to the play (which the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1984) in several regards.The scene with Baldwin (in his best performance) truly adds a great deal of weight and importance to the drama these men are facing, where their jobs are all on the line.  Plus, the music really adds to the lightning fast pace already created by the dialogue.  The direction is tight; the acting is incredible; the script is first-rate.There are, on the other hand, people who would not enjoy this movie.  It's extremely masculine and extremely profane (females are generally regarded as \"broads\" or other such derogatory terms, and over 130 f-words are spoken). If this sounds like it wouldn't be your cup of tea, look elsewhere.As I've said before, though, this movie's real power is in the dialogue and in the acting.  Pacino is at his brash best, Lemmon plays a horrible man yet does so with a twinge of sympathy, Harris gives one of his best performances to date, as does Baldwin, and Kevin Spacey shows us shades of the future with one of his first appearances in film.  My favorite character, though, is definitely the one portrayed by Alan Arkin.  I've never cared much for his work before, but this is absolutely brilliant.So stop reading this.  Go rent the movie.",

From the opening of the movie, where the salespeople complain bitterly about the poor quality of the leads, to the sales manager from \"downtown\" tearing apart the losers on the team, this movie was my life for five long years.Glengarry Glen Ross was a worthless collection of real estate, but no matter what you sell, you come across the same types of salespeople.. the burned out old-timers like Jack Lemmon, the can-do-no-wrong hotshots like Al Pacino, the terminal complainers like Alan Arkin, and the constant cheaters like Ed Harris.Shortly after I attended an awards weekend for the top 5% of salespeople in my region (I was a hotshot and had the brass balls to go with it), I saw Glengarry Glen Ross at a matin\u00e9e between sales meetings. The movie, combined with recently closing a prospect who lived on a street named \"Devils Garden Road\" (I am not making this up!), convinced me I was through with the amoral, stretching the truth life of the salesman.You can see the loss of the soul in the characters in this movie. The business of sales will eventually destroy your soul, just as it did to Willy Loman or Shelly \"The Machine\" Levine. You have to choose between success and your soul if you go into sales.Having said all that, Alec Baldwin's 10 minute masterpiece of a sales motivation speech is the epitome of what sales is all about. \"Put the coffee down..coffee is for closers...\" A MASTERPIECE performance. Coffee IS only for closers, and 3rd place-you're fired is the American Way. Produce or get out. I'd rather be a salesman with no soul than some government bureaucrat any day.",

The film is based on the same-name play written by Mamet and, not surprisingly, this film is adapted by him. It is even filmed in an atmosphere that reeks of the stage, but that is not important. What is important is how easily it can be transferred from the stage to the screen. The story mostly takes place in a real-estate office located somewhere downtown, close to where the trains pass by. But the plot is not nearly as important as the aforementioned scenes between the actors. You see, the movie basically has no plot and the whole film takes place within 24 hours. The characters are real-estate salesmen/conmen/sad-sacks. Every moment in their lives seems to revolve around making that all important sale. They constantly lie and cheat to get the sale so that they won't be dumped on the street by their bosses, who are tiring of their employees slow accumulation of sales. And since nearly every one of the characters is currently in a slump, they become desperate. It doesn't help matters that the tips they receive for prospective buyers are either out of date, or filled with the addresses of crazy folks who just like talking to salesmen, but have no intention of buying from them. This desperation leads to more than one of the employees planning and conceiving a burglary of the office, as well as stealing the better tips and selling them to a man who is willing to pay ten large. Of course, each and every one of the salesmen are suspect and the police take the time to interview each and every one of them. The guilty parties won't be named here, as it doesn't matter. The plot is nothing more than a sounding board for great dialogue by one of the greatest casts in the history of cinema.",

It is not really aimed at the teen or younger age group, as its a very \"talky\" film. There is no laughs or violence, just some great dialogue and tight direction.And as for the cast, this is where the movie excels. Pacino is overpowering as Ricky, Lemmon is so good as an annoying salesman, and Alec Baldwin in little more than a cameo role easily gives the film's best performance.

With a stellar cast, David Mamet, in producing his finest screenplay to date, provides us a `Death of a Salesman' for the \u009190s.\nA day in the life of a group of underachieving real estate salesmen proves particularly challenging as they are forced, through a `sales contest,' to either earn more revenue or be fired. In the ensuing hours we witness how each man handles adversity when faced with dire consequences. The tension builds when a robbery is committed at the office \u0096 and everyone is a prime suspect. The ensuing investigation and the characters' individual response to the heightened tension create a dynamic inspection of the very ethos of man.The acting is simply superb. Alec Baldwin's role as the crass sales motivator is arguably his finest 12 minutes on film.  Kevin Spacey, in his first meaningful film role, hones his craft as the conniving, bureaucratic office manager. And Al Pacino's over-the-top portrayal of the hot salesman ranks among the finest of his career. The scenes between Ed Harris and Alan Arkin showcase some of the best dialogue ever written for the screen.The real engine of the film is, indeed, the writing. Mamet's use of language, frank description of office politics, greed, desperation and competition provides one final look back at a period of time notorious for these elements. Essential viewing.

Ed Harris is great as the angry salesman who is willing to do what it takes to save his own future. Kevin Spacey plays the tight -collared boss to a T, pushing people and not giving them the breaks they need. The two most quoted characters of any movie I know are those played by Pacino and Baldwin. Pacino always excels in parts where his anger and ability to create believable outbursts are showcased, as they are in this part. All that I can say about Baldwin is that this is definitely his best performance and the writing for his character is unbelievable. I can watch his 10 minute scene over and over again. This movie rules in every way possible. 10 out of 10. (I don't give that rating easily)",

Without these great actors, I believe the film would be just average...I will not repeat what the others have said, I only would like to disagree with some of the people above, on the issue of Spacey's performance:I am a big fan of Spacey, you have to see him in films like \"Negotiator\" or \"Usual suspects\". However, in this film, my impression is that his role is of secondary importance to the plot, and that might help explain why I was unimpressed by his performance. I'm not saying he didn't play his role well, just that his role didn't allow him to prove once again what a great actor he is... I don't understand why people were so impressed.Anyway, it's a great film, I'll give it9/10",

Lent a bemusing air of sophistication by a cool and dispassionate jazz score, the verbal outpourings of the ensemble cast reach heights that both stun and amuse, achieving the rare and impressive feat of intense melodrama that buoys the spirits instead of dampening them. We may have little affection for the sleazy and corrupt salesmen occupying center stage, but we marvel at the brutality of circumstances that might yield sympathy for even the most craven of con-artists. This sets up an engaging dynamic wherein we invest ourselves in the turbulent fortunes of scoundrels, ever delighting in the ongoing process of events regardless of eventual outcomes.

Early, we get teased Alec Baldwin (who delivers the famous \"Coffee is for closers only\" line) who then leaves us forever. I wanted more Alec Baldwin. Pacino stands out, but Spacey, Ed Harris, and Alan Arkin, all round out a solid cast. However, I felt like some of the scenes didn't transition well from the stage to the screen, especially some between Harris and Arkin. I won't spoil who the thief is, but I would've liked a hint or clue that it was going to be him. (If there was, then I missed it.)

            "content": "Chaos ensues when a bunch or salesman at a real estate agency are forced into a high-stakes game where they either become top closers or get fired.\n\nActing: 10\n\nBeginning: 10\nYou think the beginning is going to be weak\u00e2\u00a6until Blake (Alec Baldwin) walks in. He is filled with such passion and rage, but the one thing he is lacking is fucks. Blake has zero fucks to give about anyone\u00e2(TM)s feelings or their jobs. \u00e2Fuck you, that\u00e2(TM)s my name!\u00e2? he screams at someone thinking they will get the upperhand on him. Classic.\n\nCharacters: 10\nAside from Blake, the rest of the characters add depth to the movie. With their different personalities, each character has a distinctly different approach to the way that they sell and go about winning. Their choices and reactions hold sway over which direction the movie turns and what the audience thinks is going to happen next. As things unfold and they end up being questioned by the Detective (Jude Ciccolella), it\u00e2(TM)s interesting to watch them have different responses to the pressure.\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 9\nI love the cinematic work here. The entire film has a dreary feel, almost like there\u00e2(TM)s a fog being cast over the characters and their dilemma. The light comes in small glimpses and you mostly see rain throughout. It has a suffocating feel, adding even more certainty that the characters are resigned to their own fate.\n\nConflict: 10\nLook, I\u00e2(TM)m in sales and few things institute conflict like sales situations. Tell a bunch of guys that they either hit their numbers or they\u00e2(TM)re fired and there\u00e2(TM)s bound to be problems. As the film drags on, the desperation becomes even heavier. You feel for these guys, but not so much so that you don\u00e2(TM)t get the enjoyment of watching them crumble in high pressure situations. As douchey as it sounds, it\u00e2(TM)s actually kind of fun.\n\nGenre: 7\n\nMemorability: 7\n\nPace: 10\nOnce Blake enters the scene, the movie maintains its pace from start to finish. Fueled by conflict and desperation, the characters ultimately create a mystery that you want to get to the bottom of before the movie reaches its end. It\u00e2(TM)s refreshing when you watch a movie that doesn\u00e2(TM)t have any dead spots and director James Foley succeeded in making that a reality.\n\nPlot: 10\nWhat happens when you put a bunch of different personalities in a room and tell them they have a certain amount of time to complete a goal or else? The story is ultimately moved by how people respond to pressure situations. I can imagine when this was written, the direction may have changed directions a couple of times due to the personalities of the characters. Memorable characters can alter the direction of a plot for the sake of staying true to the characters.\n\nResolution: 4\n\nOverall: 87\nI hadn\u00e2(TM)t even heard of this movie until a couple of years ago. It\u00e2(TM)s funny, this movie was recommended to me by a Sales Manager who thought, \u00e2This is how the sales team should go after it!\u00e2? After watching it, I thought, \u00e2This isn\u00e2(TM)t how selling should be at all!\u00e2? Glengarry Glen Ross succeeds because it appeals to people for different reasons. Some see it as a cautionary tale while others view it as inspiration. I am in the camp of the former. I\u00e2(TM)m also in the popular majority that think the movie is awesome.",

I thought maybe we could get to the bottom of what this company really is, though we certainly can imagine along the way that they are crooks.  It would've been nice to see the police, after long enough exposure to this office, want to open an investigation on their business practices.\n\nAlan Arkin does a wonderful job as the benign George, who amenably reiterates whatever Dave (Ed Harris) says.  We get a sense he's been at this job a long time, hasn't ever gotten ahead, doesn't have enough wisdom to converse with the younger Dave, but is almost willing to blindly follow him for lack of his own direction.\n\nJack Lemmon as Shelley and Al Pacino as Ricky Roma are the two standout performances, and we are treated to a great interaction between them after Shelley finally gets off a big sale.  The interaction ups the ante when Roma's client comes in, the nervous pushover James Lingk (Jonathan Pryce), Shelley and Roma playing a faux client/salesman con to sell Roma as a busy important man.  Roma is trying to push Lingk out of the office to keep him from withdrawing his sale - Roma is held onto the lie that Lingk's check hasn't been cashed yet, is secure, and can be returned.  Kevin Spacey's young and ignorant John Williamson comes in and screws the whole thing up, misreading the situation, informing Lingk that his check has been cashed and all is well.  What follows is Roma's verbal beatdown of Williamson, making up the raw intensity aforementioned.  \n\nEverybody hates Williamson after he brings in the negatively charged motivational speaker Blake (Alec Baldwin) to threaten that the lowest earner will be fired.  Roma is the standard to meet, and he's got pull over Williamson.  His berating of Williamson is something everyone wants to see, especially since Williamson had been hard on the vet Shelley, giving him and everyone else poor leads.  \n\nThe plot develops when these top leads, which only Roma gets, become the target of everyone in the office, and since nobody will give them up, plans develop to steal them.  It starts with Dave trying to convince George to do it - they will sell them off to another company and make a profit for their efforts.  But even George is leery about this, second guessing it.  All we know is that the next day, the leads have been successfully stolen, and the police are investigating.  We suspect George based on the nervous way he acts, but he's nervous to begin with.  It's likely Dave is involved no matter what, the guy is always lit without a fill.  And then there's the way Shelley is acting, overly celebratory about his latest sale that gets him up on the board.\n\nThe scope is limited, but Foley handles it nicely.  I like the way this part of New York looks, has a studio backlot old Hollywood feel to it.  Blue light lands on several of the characters, Shelley in phone booths.  The Chinese restaurant, with it's red lining and open space, provides a hospitable habitat for these workers to relax and stretch.  I love the way the train passes in the rain as Shelley crosses the street, Dunkin' Donuts dull in the background.  We feel this is a deadbeat part of town, a perfect allusion to the lives of the people working in it.",

You somehow find yourself dying for a poor schmuck to get tricked into accepting a real estate deal that he probably can't afford and doesn't want in the first place, simply because we want to see the salesman get a win. The script gets some of the credit for that aspect, but I think even more of the credit has to go to the amazing cast of actors. Each one of these guys can pull off so much in their performances that you can simultaneously hate their actions and yet like them as people. I think the empathy is formed throughout the film, but it is amplified in the scene where Alec Baldwin outdoes himself with one of the most ridiculous and yet amazing speeches in movie history. This raises the stakes for the rest of the characters and does a great job of giving us a vision of who is the real bad guy. No matter how bad the other characters behave we understand because at least they aren't like Blake. Kevin Spacey was perfect as the manager who could be in over his head with all these salesmen that have more experience than him, and yet he holds his own and can give it back as easily as they dish the punishment out. Al Pacino, Alan Arkiin, Ed Harris, and Jonathan Pryce all crush their performances as well. I could just go on and on about every single person in the cast, but instead I'll just focus in on how totally awesome Jack Lemmon is in Glengarry Glen Ross. I don't have words for the perfection in his performance. In each conversation he shifts to the situation and perfectly shows us the quality of his sales skills, and yet we can always sense the underlying despair that drives him. There's not much else to talk about with this film because it is almost 100% character driven, and the plot is rather basic. I enjoyed the film, and can see why it is critically praised, I'd certainly recommend it to others for a good example of an acting tour-de-force.",

            "content": "Well hello boys and girls. \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. From beginning to end you are hooked to this movie because of it's sharp and quick paced dialogue that comes out of all these great actors in this movie. every single actor brings their A game in this movie and I mean every single actor. From Al Pacino who steals the spotlight, Jack Lemmon who i really need to start getting into, Alec Baldwin even though it's more of a cameo/small role, is the star of this movie. Ed Harris as always is a great force to not be messed with, Alan Arkin who is always a great presence in the movies and Kevin Spacey who is always on his A game no matter what as the man literally lives to act. The movie is directed by James Foley who directs all these actors with great force in this tense movie about the hard goings in the reel estate business. Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, and Alan Arkin are all the verge of losing their jobs as the leads they have been given by their boss Kevin Spacey and their employees Mitch & Murray even though you never see them or hear from them in the film, the name is enough to let you know they are not to be messed with. Alec Baldwin makes a big cameo role as the sales motivator who tells Pacino, Lemmon, Arkin and Harris that they all one week to reclaim their jobs and that they are worthless pieces of shit for the most part, but Pacino is not present during this famous scene in the film which is the best part of the movie, because he's across the street at the Chinese restaurant getting drunk with Jonathan Price during a sales pitch he's trying to wee on Price. But Baldwin nails his role as he literally breaks right into these guys and letting them know it take brass balls to sell reel estate and that if they can't sell with the leads they have been given, they are shit. He's awesome, just awesome. So awesome in fact I kind of which he came back into the movie just for a few more seconds just to see how the rest of the cast is making out after he literally breaks into them with his lecture, he's that good. Alec Baldwin is so extremely underrated as an actor that I feel at times besides his awesome turn in \"30 Rock\" that he doesn't get enough great roles like this one. Besides \"The Cooler\" which I say is his best performance which he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor as the casino manager with mob ties in Las Vegas, Baldwin definitely deserves more than he is given. But the man that literally keeps you watching the movie after Baldwin exits the screen is the great Al Pacino who makes acting look so easy that you yourself would want a crack at it. He really is one of the greatest actors that has ever lived as he just has such a natural flow to him as an actor that you just can't help but be automatically drawn to him because it's fucking Al Pacino. \"The Godfather Part 1 & 2,\" \"Serpico,\" \"Dog Day Afternoon,\" \"Heat,\" \"Carlito's Way,\" \"Scent of a Woman,\" you name it, it's a classic because of Al Pacino. Pacino was nominated best supporting actor for the movie and he rightfully deserved it as he is literally like I said the driving force that keeps the movie going, but really the credit is due to all the actors as they all have their awesome moments in the movie. Especially Jack Lemmon who I regret I have not seen enough of his movies, but I am definitely going to change that as of right now as he is literally a striving talent that all has such a passion for acting like Pacino that you just want to be right beside him with the director as your watching Lemmon act as he steps up to the plate and gets tough BIG time like Pacino, but in his own classic Lemmon way. Kevin Spacey too gives it right back as the boss of these guys as even though he is looked at as the young boss who doesn't know shit in this movie, he literally lets these guys know he is not to be fucked with. I love Kevin Spacey he is seriously growing as one of my favorite actors as I literally cannot get enough of him in \"House of Cards\" which he is just fantastic in that. Ed Harris and Alan Arkin also give exceptionally great performances as well as I believe everybody should have been nominated for an Oscar in this movie as they are all FUCKING AWESOME!!!! It takes great skill to command a bunch of power house actors like this and that is why I commend James Foley who literally deserves most of the credit, because if you can handle these guys...you can handle anyone.",

Sure, sales people often feel fake and sketchy and pushy in real life, but that sense of \"authenticity\" didn't feel authentic at all to me.

I missed seeing this film 23 years ago when it came out and maybe back then it would have meant something more to me. A disappointment that's now off my watch list.",

Baldwin is unexpectedly impressive as ruthless boardroom executive Blake, a corporate hatchet man sent in to cull the underachievers among the ranks. Spacey, Harris, Arkin and Lemmon are flawless, their interactions seamless and believable.\n\nThe script is superb, witty and sharp, and must rank as among the finest ever committed to celluloid.

The script from David Mamet, based on his stage play, sparkles with dialogue that needs to be heard to be believed.  It is profane, but in a way that brings the words to a more abrupt and deliberate uncomfortable level.\r\n\r\nThe film stars Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, and Jonathan Pryce.  These guys are spot on.  There isn't a bad moment amongst them.  The desparation and panic, as well as the gloating heighten each scene.\r\n\r\nThe story is pretty simple.  Several men, working for a real estate sales organization are dumped with a pile of good and bad leads.  Those leads could make or break them.  The one who sells the most before the next day continues to work there and wins a car.  The bottom in sales is fired.\r\n\r\nThe interaction between the characters and the actors is vital.  The film would not work otherwise.  It is those moments that drives the picture.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v48/Zeppo1/GlengarryGlenRoss_zps1b90762c.jpg[/IMG]",

To say this is star-studded would be an understatement; you look at the cast list, and you see nothing but heavyweights like Jonathan Pryce, Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Alec Baldwin, Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino.  They all manage to elevate an already tight script penned by David Mamet, whose writing really is the star here.  Abbreviated on paper, this is just 100 minutes of salesmen talking about leads, but when brought to life, it really is something special.  You can totally tell that this was a stage play previously, simply based on the parameters of how the story advances, but that is in no way a mark against it; some of the best stories can exist in both worlds, and you can always look at the classic 12 Angry Men if you need further proof.  It is a story that makes you feel disgusted about how sales work, but it is fascinating to get to know the character of Shelley Levene; Jack Lemmon plays him in such a way that you feel bad for him, all the while you're repulsed by his actions.  I would never want to be a salesman (or associate myself with one, for that matter) but Glengarry Glen Ross has a script that speaks for itself, and features dialogue with cadence and rhythm.",

What I liked the most about this movie, besides everything mentioned, is that if a character said they were going to go away, they did, that might not sound like much but the movie was realistic and just because a big named actor left the area in which this movie took place it doesn't mean we have to see them in the new area, a) because it isn't important, b) it doesn't play up to their egos and that's why only some characters are on screen total for a few minutes because they served their purpose and they had to leave or when a character says they're not going to show up for something, well, that's the last we hear from them in awhile. The movie tries to go for a realistic tone throughout the entire thing and I'd say the filmmakers accomplish this tremendously because even though throughout the film the levels of tension and anger increase exponentially there is still dark comedy thrown in every now and then, just like in real life, no matter how dark and sad a situation is, a funny thing will happen in life whether you're happy or not, that's just how things go. Besides all of that it's just fun to see big name actors just tear into each other for 2 hours; totally not the point of the movie but it's another point in it's favor.",

They work at Consolidated Real Estate in Arizona.  Their line manager is John; those above John brought in Blake to put a fire under these four.  So the re-working of their work life consists of a contest.  In two weeks, whoever comes in first in sales get a Cadillac.  Who comes in second gets a set of steak knives.  The other two get fired.\n\n    The common complaint is the availability of leads; that is, connections to a likely real estate sales that is worth a lot of money.  With Consolidated Real Estate, they get leads that are dubious and re-worked.  Shelley appeals directly to John for the premium leads, the 'Glengarry' leads.  He tries to construct a kickback scheme with John to get the Glengarry leads.\n\n    Dave and George do a lot of complaining, then consider robbing the office to get the Glengarry leads directly, then sell then to a competitor.  Ricky schmoozes James at length, and closes a deal.\n\n    The robbery does occur, and there is a great deal of consternation at the office.  The Detective is doing interviews.  Contracts and some of the leads have been stolen.  Ricky's deal with James got registered with the company and the bank, or at least that's what John tells Ricky.  Shelley comes in a little late and is so happy to have sold 8 units in a development.  Dave blows up and leaves after his interview with the Detective.  George gets interviewed next.  Ricky and Shelley swap war stories.\n\n    James tries to get out of his deal with Ricky.  Ricky and Shelley try to fast talk him out of this.  Ricky manages some quality talking time while the Detective interviews Shelley.  John manages to torpedo the deal.  Ricky is not happy with John.  Nobody does anything but abuse John.\n\n    Will the thief be discovered?  Will any of these four salesmen get their act together again?\n\n------Scores------\n\n    Cinematography: 10/10 No problems.  Nicely shot.\n\n    Sound: 10/10 Well-miked actors; no problems understanding the dialog with the sound at a reasonable volume.  Music is not a factor here, and the dialog is everything.\n\n    Acting: 10/10 Great performances: Ed Harris, Al Pacino, Alan Arkin, Jack Lemmon, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin.  The fine story is made better by the excellent acting.\n\n    Screenplay: 10/10 Mamet's story is riveting with these actors executing brilliantly.",

I missed it in the cinemas in the 90's - I was building a new house and there was a gap of few years regarding movies. \r\n\r\nThe film depicts two days in the lives of four real estate salesmen and how they become desperate when the corporate office sends a trainer to \"motivate\" them by announcing that, in one week, all except the top two salesmen will be fired. The film is notorious for its use of profanity, leading the cast to jokingly refer to the film as \"Death of a Fuc*in' Salesman\". The title of the film comes from the names of two of the real estate developments being peddled by the salesmen characters: Glengarry Highlands and Glen Ross Farms. The world premiere of Glengarry Glen Ross was held at the Venice Film Festival, where Jack Lemmon, one of the film's stars, was awarded the Volpi Cup for Best Actor. And I have to say his performance was a top act. I liked Al Pacino's work as well - he was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for his work in the film.\r\n\r\nBut, I have to ask - what else was a top act in this movie except acting? Directing? What was top there? Which scene can you remember as outstanding? What about the screenplay? There was some suspense and drama, but at the end it was mostly \"talk\" - without the actual \"walk\"! The film's photography relied on low lighting and shadows with a blues, greens, and reds colour scheme for the first part of the film, while the second half was monochromatic blue-grey colour scheme - and that's it. I have nothing against simplicity, completely opposite, but there must be something outstanding that I could rate a movie 100%! It was a good movie to watch... and I saw it... once is enough. Maybe I've seen too many movies, and even if I enjoyed this one in general, there was no \"special\" effect on me! The film was not a commercial success, making only $10.7 million in North America, just below its $12.5 million budget.",

However on the other hand I feel that this one really had the potential to be something extremely special but fell significantly short of that. Al Pacino can take no blame as he was he usual charismatic and engaging best. Kevin Spacey was also influential. It was a shame that Alec Baldwin had such a minor role as I think his character had extreme presence and its a mystery as to why he hardly featured. Worth a watch but don't be surprised to have a slight feeling of regret at the end, as to what could have been.",

Made with the budget of just $12.5 million - Al Pacino received Best Supporting Actor nominations at two different prestigious Academy Award, and Golden Globe. \r\n\r\nOn a rainy-day events occur inside the office of real-estate -occupied by salesmen Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, and upper-heads Kevin Spacey and AL PACINO. Kevin Spacey is the manager who runs the affair and makes sure to implement commands. Kevin also has to deal with worsening scenario after visiting downtown hotshot slick Alec Baldwin warns them (rather in threatening manner) to reach target of property-sale in time or else lose their job. Alec hands packet of leads (names of sure-purchasing-parties) to Kevin and for Pacino (not present in the screen, yet).\r\n\r\nIt is said, that movie was made just like stage-drama, even actors who were yet to appear in scene, voluntarily showed up during other actors' performances. The movie is famous for bringing on stage versatile actors of their times, all together - and important thing is that the movie contains powerful dialogues, from those who are quite experienced at doing so. Of all, only Al Pacino and Jack Lemmon appear to have honestly dedicated to bring justification to film's crucial subject. To me, Al Pacino's performance at near climax shook me up, during Pacino's confrontation with Kevin, taking marvelous use of dialogue-delivery and pace of timing. \r\n\r\nOliver Stone's Wall-Street, like films introduced us to greed at top-level, and here we are seeing the ground-realities as suffered by ordinary fellas - neither of who are immunized to plague of deception and greed.",

A group of aging real estate salesmen-sales leader Roma (Al Pacino), Levene (Jack Lemmon), Moss (Ed Harris), Aaranow (Alan Arkin)--are having trouble with closing deals, so young office manager Williamson (Kevin Spacey) has arranged for a meeting with self-involved higher-up (Alec Baldwin) to \"motivate\" the salesmen in solving their problems. The solution: the person with the greatest sales wins a car, while the two persons with the worst sales are fired. This meeting consists mostly of a biting monologue literally written for Baldwin that would put any worker in his place. This leads to a desperate hunt for leads, the most baffling attempt being a burglary of their own office for \"Glengarry leads,\" which are leads that are essentially guaranteed sales. The film acts as a canvas for the five stages of grief. Levene bargains for any opportunity that can feed his family, Moss spits on those higher in power for telling him that he cannot make a sale and is ready to fight back, Aaranow harshly doubts his ability to make a deal, and Roma simply continues with his business, worry-free. I have never seen the play on which this film is based, but some speeches seem improvised because of all of the fucks given. I bet I could re-watch many of the scenes in this film without getting sick of them. Every actor performs so engagingly for a story that, otherwise, could run dry for those not too interested in marketing. Such performances are so engaging partially because the film's respect for every character's despicably selfish acts committed for universally selfish reasons.",

How loud can you shout?  A script that calls for this kind of work is perfect for Al Pacino. He plays Romo, the office's top real estate salesman. Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, and Kevin Spacey are all vultures squawking at each other to determine who is going to get the biggest piece of meat. \"The Leads\" are what they are all after. Each man sits and stares in silent amazement as the boss Alec Baldwin shits on everyone in the office and hands the leads over to office supervisor Kevin Spacey. These office jerks obsess over these leads, plot to steal and kill over these leads, betray each other over these leads-all for the love of their job? How can that be? They behave like addicts scrapping to get that last pull from the pipe until they encounter real people, then its showtime and they have to front like they have no problems whatsoever. \nI just returned from a vacation that involved a few mandatory hours of sitting with a handful of real estate salesmen to listen to their pleas. After long hours of nonsense, they finally let us leave. This movie shows the true colors of some of these salesmen and heavily exaggerates what their behavior and relationships might be in the office. Grimy capitalist salesmen, trying to lie their way to the top ranks thinking about themselves and themselves only. \nIf your workplace is full of morons or you hate your boss and you just wish you could speak freely to their face, then watching this movie might do something for you. There is literally no holds barred in this script and people are humiliated. \nA few random mentions: \n\tAlec Baldwin appeared early and was great. I would have liked to see one more appearance towards the end but he never showed up ? \n\tJack Lemmon's character Shelly I believe was the motivation behind Simpsons' character \"Gill\". Poor ole Gill...\n\tKevin Spacey took the grunt of mostly everyone's shit. He is an easy target, as he gets shitted on in 75% of the movies he's in. \n\tEd Harris and Alan Arkin were (meh), and Al Pacino was hilarious! Very memorable performance for Pacino in his very longstanding acting career. \n\n4/5",

They're for closers.\n\n\"A Story For Everyone Who Works For A Living.\"\n\nGlengarry Glen Ross is one of those movies that has been on my need to see list for sometime now. Now, that I've finally got around to seeing it, I can fully understand why it's regarded as a classic. It is, without a doubt, a great film. It's a performance film and it's a workplace film, and both aspects are handled perfectly. I guess it always helps a movie that is so dependent on performances when you are able to assemble a cast as good as this one.\u00a0\n\nFour salesmen at a reality firm are given an ultimatum by some guy that comes in from downtown to fire them up. Either sell or get fired. But the employees don't believe they can sell because all the leads they are getting are old and worthless. The prized leads are only given out to those who can sell says the man. Then we follow those four through their night and morning.\u00a0\n\nAs I said, this movie is almost 100 percent based on the performances of its cast. The four salesman are played by: Al Pacino, Alan Arkin, Jack Lemmon, and Ed Harris. The man who runs the office is played by Kevin Spacey, and the man who comes into fire them up is played by Alec Baldwin. So the cast is pretty fucking good. There's no clear standout, as they are all amazing, but surprisingly my favorite performance was turned in by Alec Baldwin as Blake. He may have only been on screen for five to ten minutes, but it was my favorite part of the film.\n\nGlengarry Glen Ross is a movie every film buff should see. The dialogue is brilliant, as are the performances. It's a fun movie, with serious themes. I was completely entertained from start to finish by the actors. Sometimes conversation movies like this don't make the complete runtime entertaining. There's lows in most of these type of films. This one was all highs though.",

When I was quoted over 10K , or 50%+ higher than other contractors, I was told if I would sign the contract today he would knock $500 off the price, I told him I couldn't afford since I have dental work to do. Then he told me that by saving me those $500 I can afford to do my dental work. I sarcastically rebuked him that I could save so much money that't I'll go broke ! So if not technically a lie, it's definitely a manipulation, especially of those who are not good at personal finance. \n\n(3) The owner of a shabby modeling agency, disingenuously told me I am talented & presentable enough to have a 90% chance a year of getting a paid role. When I resisted to sing-up because I didn't have money at hand, and wanted to leave, he pressured me by personally driving to a bank & withdraw $300 for his service. Almost several years later, I was called only a couple of times for unsuccessful auditions (with dozens of other candidates present). Since 2011, I haven't been contacted even once for an audition. Had he been honest, he would have told my chances of getting a paid gig would have amounted to way less than a 90% chance a year. And/or he was not representing me diligently, since I've haven't heard from him since 2011. He also misrepresented that I can deduct the $300 agency fee from my taxes, when in fact that required me to have had income related to modeling, and that I wasn't simply able to deduct it from my regular income as he was suggesting.",

            "content": "With Al Pacino giving another Academy Award nominated performance, Glengarry Glen Ross sounded like it would be an entertaining feature.\n\nGlengarry Glen Ross maintains a lot of the strength that made the source material of the play terrific. Filmed and acted as if it is a stage production, Glengarry Glen Ross maintains the strength and drama of being a stage play and follows the appropriate style to do so. It has a few aspects which make it more technically valuable, but as a whole the approach that director James Foley takes to the material makes it seem largely like the play it is written as. It is filmed with simple cinematography techniques, shots which stand in one position and go on for an extensive period of time as they depict the conversations of the actors unfolding naturally as if the viewer is actually there to witness it. It gives the film a sense of realism and genuity which is where a lot of the effectiveness comes into play since there is little required aside from the acting and the natural material of the screenplay to create the drama. There are some slight moments involving a musical score, but they are not common as the drama in the film is consistently organic. Glengarry Glen Ross is strong because of its dramatic roots and due to the fact that its screenplay carries the material over easily to film thanks to the way that James Foley handles it as director. It is a prime example of a great film adaptation of a play, and it maintains a good style but never lets it get in the way of the more organically positive aspects of the material. Admittedly, Glengarry Glen Ross is not a film for everyone because it is a slow burning and simple story which is more relevant to its stage material than to being a film and so people looking for film more than simply a play could find it to be boring. There were many times that I felt this because it is difficult for me to be pleased by stage productions and I have a higher expectation for what films have to offer due to the fact that they offer increased potential and higher technical qualities, and since Glengarry Glen Ross stays so simplistic with its style I found that the affect of it was not as great as it could have been. To put it simply, Glengarry Glen Ross is a lot like a stage play filmed and put on screen as a feature film, and it maintains essentially all the aspects of a play, for better and for worse.\nIn terms of narrative, the other central flaw in Glengarry Glen Ross is the fact that it has so many characters. The most essential to the plot are Ricky Roma, Shelley \"The Machine\" Levene and John Williamson.  But as their stories are being told, there are so many others who come into play yet represent nothing but subplots in the story. There are only a select handful of characters in Glengarry Glen Ross, but the material gives them all very predominant roles in the film. They are all interesting to a certain extent and are well acted figures, but their actual relevance to the story proves to be nothing more than a distraction from the major premise at heart. So Glengarry Glen Ross remains a simple and small scaled film but has a surplus of characters to focus on. \nStill, Glengarry Glen Ross succeeds on the basis of the fact that its screenplay is full of well written language and complex plot dynamics, and the fact that Glengarry Glen Ross has a seriously talented cast lined up. The actors in Glengarry Glen Ross  are truly its most major benefit.\nAl Pacino pulls off another essential performance in Glengarry Glen Ross. The thing about him this time is that subtlety is key to his character in the way that he maintains a lot of inner wisdom which he projects without having to shout it. He delivers his lines with a lean strength which all comes from within as it is clear that his performance has a lot of depth to it. He plays games with all of the characters and interacts with the others in such a strong way which has viewers constantly intruiged as to who he is and what he is hiding. Al Pacino's supporting performance in Glengarry Glen Ross shows a lot of his understated talents and it is a role which is like none he has ever played before. Al Pacino is the screen stealer in Glengarry Glen Ross because he speaks his words in a way which makes his character so interesting and interacts with the other cast members so powerfully, including one defining scene where he comes to blows with Kevin Spacey towards the end of the film. Glengarry Glen Ross gives Al Pacino a chance to act mostly through the simple technique of his line delivery, and it is no surprise that he comes off well.\nJack Lemmon is terrific in Glengarry Glen Ross because he is such a likeable figure. He is swift in his abilities at line delivery and technique for character acting, and he defies the manipulative archetype of the salesman figure by playing one who struggles so much but remains constantly determined to succeed and having the audience believe that he is avoiding use of tricky tactics to make it happen. He uses some shady techniques, but in comparison to the many others he is in competition in, Jack Lemmon is able to maintain a naturally likable persona due to how he plays with the character. He has audiences sympathizing for him a lot of the time, even when he plays games with the audience and only tells half-truths. And in that sense, he is able to cleverly trick audiences into liking the facade he puts on and the actual person that he is playing. Jack Lemmon conveys the struggles of being in business very well and constantly delivers his lines with a want to draw the audience in, and it works because he captivates the interest of viewers and gives a performance which has a lot of steady power to it.\nKevin Spacey gives an excellent performance as well. From early on in his career from before he earned such worldwide recognition, Kevin Spacey gives a firm and cold-hearted supporting performance in Glengarry Glen Ross which further conveys the harsh reality of business. He is swift and merciless into ensuring that things move along according to his vision, and so his character development is essential to the progression of the narrative.\nAlec Baldwin doesn't get as much screen time as one might hope, but during his brief appearance he makes a memorable and effective impact. Ed Harris and Alan Arkin also deliver strong supporting performances.\n\nSo although Glengarry Glen Ross is a bit too much of a play to have the impact of a film, the strength of its screenplay and efforts of its incredible cast make it a difficult feature not to admire.",

From the personality-reflective directing, to the endlessly quotable lines, to the magnetic screen presence of every actor, this film is an ensemble gold standard. \r\n   \r\nWhen the higher-ups send Blake (played to sheer, aggressive perfection by Alec Baldwin) down to their office for a motivational speech/verbal beat-down, the property salesmen at Mitch & Murray find themselves desperately looking to climb up their sales board, or lose their jobs. If they manage to sell they're current contracts, they'll be rewarded with the prestigious Glengarry leads. Each man takes to the news in a different way: Sheldon \"The Machine\" Levene (the ever-slick Jack Lemmon), an old hand, who hasn't had a big break in months, becomes quietly desperate, pulling every trick he has out, in an attempt to plea with his leads. Dave Moss (the ever-underrated Ed Harris), a brash, impulsive type, who leaves with the complacent, unassuming George Aaronow (Alan Arkin, the noticeable black sheep of the cast). While driving, Moss conspires to rob the office of the Glengarry leads, putting Aaronow in a tough position. Finally, there is Ricky Roma (the legend that is Al Pacino), a hot-shot that isn't present for the revelation, as he is too busy wooing a client with his put-on philosophies, and slick charm. On top of that fantastic foursome, there is there young manager, John Williamson (Kevin Spacey, before either of his Oscar wins), the smarmy superior, who has the Glengarry leads. As the night, and following morning progress, we are treated to the different character arcs, relations, and revelations. Various characters reveal more about themselves, and the situation, through the brilliant, biting screenplay.\r\n\r\nPositives: So many. The film is dominated by five fantastic lead actors, each getting enough development, and moments to remain in the viewers minds, long after seeing the film. Al Pacino's portrayal of Ricky, as a slick, smooth salesman who can wrap any client around his finger, masks a desperation, that comes out when he finds himself in a corner. This multifaceted portrayal owes it's debt to the fantastic screenplay, and Pacino's absorption into the role. Then there is Moss. Ed Harris was one of the lesser well-known guys in the film, but he absolutely dominates every time he speaks. His brash, loudmouth persona serve to highlight the times where he can't walk the walk, or is unable to follow up a spur-of-the-moment comment, and ends up getting destroyed by the likes of Blake.  To contrast the big-mouthed Moss, we have the reserved, nervous Aaronow, who is unable to stand on his own two feet, and is taken in by Moss' smooth-talking. Arkin's portrayal of Aaronow is probably the least note-worthy performance in the film, but it is still an absolute masterclass, putting many actors today to shame. Moving onto the two supporting characters, we have Williamson, played by the at-the-time upcoming talent Kevin Spacey. Williamson is snide, bitter, and resentful of his employees, as they think themselves more experienced than him, after he left them behind for his current position. This bitterness comes out when he gets the Glengarry leads, and is able to milk the desperation of Sheldon, and the viewer can just feel the venom in their exchanges. Then there's Blake. Blake is an icon to many, both as a movie character, and as a business model. The rapidfire monologues, and searing verbal beatdown of the salesmen is as iconic as anything in cinema. Alec Baldwin is absolute perfection as Blake, playing him as a lecherous, unlikable character that has enough valid points (and intense charisma), to endear himself to the viewer. Finally, there is Jack Lemmon, as Sheldon \"The Machine\" Levene. I didn't expect it, but Lemmon just stole the show. His delivery, characterisation, from the voice, to the expressions, to the posture, everything was pitch-perfect. His desperation to save his job is nothing less than compelling, had me glued to every conversation he had, and certainly had me sympathising a lot more for him than any other character. With actors of this calibre, and a screenplay so brilliant to work off, anyone can see why it is so deserving of adoration.\r\n\r\nNegatives: I actually find myself struggling to think of flaws. Having been based on a play, the film's narrative is a bit different from what you'd expect, and  there is a much more noticeable lack of scenes and locations, with conversations serving for what a separate scene would be used for in more typical fashion. This lack of action can probably be seen as a flaw, as there are probably many who wouldn't take time to admire the brilliant unfolding of the tale. On top of that, if I were to bring up one, tiny (tiny) flaw that I have (and I'm being totally subjective here), it's that we didn't see quite enough of each character in the 100 minute running time. Pacino's Ricky Roma only becomes a major character in the second half, (where he absolutely eats every bit of dialogue he has). If he had more of a presence in the first half, this film would have an even higher standing in my mind than it does  now. Also, Spacey's character, John Williamson, is not quite given enough development, in my eyes. He has a very obvious dislike for those in his office, but I never feel we are quite given enough of a reason for it (save for Roma and Levene throwing insults his way, which could have easily come about, even without a previous bitterness. I feel, if there had been a bit of exposition regarding his relationship with the rest of the cast, it might have made him a stronger character. George and Moss are somewhat the same, as they have smaller roles than Levene, but I still feel that they served there purpose in the film very well, and  have no need to be extended. Of course, this is just me being greedy. This film is still an absolute masterpiece, with superb direction, acting, and writing. If it were up to me, I would have the film go on that little bit longer, just so I could see the electricity of these characters, and these actors, that little bit more.\r\n\r\nIn closing, you don't need to have a keen knowledge of real-estate to get into Glengarry Glen Ross (I know I don't). If you are in any way a fan of good writing, good directing, and above all, phenomenal acting, then you owe it to yourself to see this movie. I f you even consider yourself a fan of cinema, then you won't be making the wrong choice in seeing Glengarry Glen Ross. It serves as a reminder that the world is cruel place, that people will do desperate things when sufficiently motivated, and that life can be as cut throat as any job or business. Again, if you consider yourself a fan of cinema, or you simply like seeing actors give a masterclass in their profession, Glengarry Glen Ross will not disappoint.\r\n\r\nFinal Grade: A",

            "content": "I worked as a knife salesman during the winter break of my freshman year in college. It was one of the most interesting jobs I had ever been involved in. The product was high priced kitchen utilities with knives being the core of the company's prestige but, as this movie tries to convey, the product is not important. I could have been selling anything: the point was to sell and to convince yourself and your potential customer that your doing them a favor. Isn't that what sales is all about?\n\nThe movie was recommended to me by Netflix based on my interest in Scorcese's Taxi Driver and the Godfather trilogy. Netflix got it right, you'll like it if your a fan of the movies just mentioned.\n\nThe movie is based on an a Pulitzer winning play by Dave Mallet who also wrote the screenplay. This is important to note because the dialogue in the movie is epic. The cast spent weeks rehearsing their lines to get the cadence and flow just right and they pull it off magnificently.\n\nJack Lemon pulls off one of his greatest roles (remember Gil Gunderson from the Simpsons? He's a spoof of Lemon's Shelly \"The Machine\" Levene.) There's a scene with him and Al Pacino revolving around  crumb cakes. The dialogue looks mundane when read on paper but come alive with Lemon's execution. Damn incredible...scenes like that make me re-appreciate actors.\n\nAl Pacino got nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his supporting role as Ricky Roma. A monologue where he's in the midst of a sales pitch to a potential investor is beyond memorable. \n\nI hated my salesman job. I hated having to convince someone to do me a favor even though I actually thought the product was cool. The movie made you feel bad for the characters, especially Shelly Levene, who has a sick daughter to look after. Do the questionable tactics that he and his colleagues pull off make them bad people? I don't think so. But all I know is that I hate doing what they're doing. To befriend a stranger with the a goal for profit, even if the opportunity only comes once, is not something I can live with without making mental adjustments. So I guess, the underlining lesson in the movie is that there's no such thing as bad people, only bad salesmen.\n\nJust like Ricky Roma's great monologue.\n\nThe life you lead is worthless if its not yours. Make it yours and go with it. To Jonathan Pryce in the movie, going with it meant an investment and to Ricky Roma: a sale. It's all in the perspective. \n\nI recommend it if you're into dialogue heavy movies or good movies in general.",

The top two salesmen get to keep their jobs...everybody else gets canned.  Forced into desperation, one of the salesmen hatches a plan to rob the office, steal the best leads, and sell them to a rival company.

Alec Baldwin shines in a short, but effective and critical, role (he has only one wonderful and thoroughly quotable rant/monologue). Al Pacino is as good as always although he has been better (well, that's criticism on a very high level... his fellow 1992 role in Scent of a Woman is my all-time favourite acting job).\nJack Lemmon has incredible screen presence, I found his character annoying though. Ed Harris, Jonathan Pryce and Alan Arkin round out the excellent cast.\n\nThere's also a great script these Hollywood powerhouses could work with. Full of inspiring monologues and emotional meltdowns - this is also where you can see the theatrical roots of the film up to the point where you could imagine the whole set on a stage in front of you. I like such films (although I'm not a big theater-goer) and I'm perfectly fine with it, but also a bit curious how not more people acknowledge this.\n\nFor all fans of brilliant acting and great monologues who doesn't mind some theatrical values this is it!",

Naturally, given a cast so drenched with talent, the audience is going to want to see them flaunt their acting chops, and thankfully, that's the key to this entire production. Without a tight band of intense, versatile, believable characters at its core there's no chance a plot that revolves around sales calls and a bland office robbery would be anything more than a snoozer. But in this cast's hands, with this combination of sharp, passionate dialog and sleazy, self-serving lack of morality, it's totally entrancing. Like many play-to-film interpretations, there is a certain amount of stagnation in terms of the film's scenery. The vast majority of the action takes place in a sales office, with phone calls, police interviews and (de)motivational speakers providing the flavor. Those tame surroundings work in a variety of unusual ways, though: as a means to ground the story in reality, an exercise in diverting our attention solely to the acting, and a device to give the rare peeks outside the office's not-so-friendly confines an added dash of color. A master class in cadence and characterization, it's a deep, emphatic and intoxicating look at the gamut of techniques a desperate salesman can (and will) employ.",

Usually, films that are dialogue-ridden are boring (not including Quentin Tarantino), but Mamet just makes it so interesting. It's interesting to hear these characters talk.  \n\nSecond, the performances. Great acting all-around. It's all real emotional, all so true-to-life. I've never worked in the real-estate field (I'm 16!) but from what I saw, it's not pretty. The cast really captures the desperation of their characters. It's so fascinating to watch them turn on each other when something doesn't go their way.\n\nAnother great thing is that Glengarry Glen Ross just whizzes right on by.

The winner gets a cadillac, second place some steak knives, and the  others will be fired.  It's a devastating look at capitalism, lies and manipulation.  Not an entertaing movie due to the depressing theme but a damn good one.\r\n\r\nJack Lemmon as Shelley Levene is the main focus here and the actor was awarded the National Board of Review best actor award.  Inexplicably, Oscar ignored him but nominated Al Pacino as the fiery Roma in a supporting role.  Pacino is good but it's Lemmon who's the emotional nexus  of the story.  Also, outstanding is Alec Baldwin in a cameo and Kevin Spacey is well cast the office manager. The movie is based on a play so there's lots of talk.  However, the cinematography is excellent and the jazzy score is a reprieve from the \"fuck you\" dialogue.  It's reminiscent of movies like \"Elmer Gantry\"or \"Death of a Salesman\" but it will stand on it's own.  A movie filled with good actors and scorching dialogue.",

It's hard to choose who gives the best performance in this film, because all deserve huge amounts of praise; from Al Pacino's Ricky Roma, the leader on the board that uses his way of words to gain customers trust before getting their signature on the contract, to Jack Lemmon's Shelly \"Machine\" Levine, the oldest salesman in the firm who everyone else thinks has lost his thunder except himself. I like some of these men for obvious reasons, and hate others for obvious reasons, yet they all have one thing in common: the hate they share for their customers. And in suite, I hate the customers as well. And under the direction of Dave Foley, the camera glides with fluid precision during scenes, making me feel more at ease and comfortable with these men as they cheat, lie, and steal their ways into the corporate heart of real estate.

            "content": "\"Always Be Closing.\" -a quote encouraging a group of real-estate salesmen to go out and do their best, no matter what they are given. \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is an explosive drama, centered around the day in the life of four salesman who are faced with bad odds: close or be fired. Each salesman has his own unique personality, but the common thing all 4 have is their way of going about lying to the customer. It's a rather dishonest way to look at this particular field of work, but after a harsh lecture from the company's head (Mitch and Murray) the 4 salesman are given no choice but to use the \"ancient\" leads they are given, or do the unthinkable: rob the office of the new leads, the \"Glengarry\" leads where the potentilal clients are destined to make a close and the salesman is sure to strike it rich. Everyone knows the score, the heat is on, who's got what it takes?\r\n\r\n\"Glengarry Glen Ross\" takes one of the most interesting approaches to life in the work force that I've seen so far, it's reminiscent of \"12 Angry Men\" in the sense that everyone is, well, angry. But the dialogue here is not only far and pedantic  it's exceedingly crude and has a brutal demeanor. Each character doesn't hesitate to share his thoughts and in a movie like this it is not uncommon to have one man screaming his lungs out to another. Every character is tense and the performances showcase it brilliantly. Not one actor in this movie is outclasses by anybody else or not one is even a tad bit monotonous. Al Pacino plays Richard Roma-the cocky young salesman who's a natural at what he does and is on a roll to winning himself a Cadillac El dorado. Jack Lemmon as Shelley Levene, the desperate veteran salesman with a sick daughter and the 'charm' to turn customers on or off--mostly off as we see in a scene as he tries to sell a man real-estate through a phone booth. Lemmon's character was probably my favorite if I had to pick one. He has both the elements of a poor helpless father we feel sorry for, and yet the uselessness of an old retired hermit. Ed Harris is the angry David Moss who has bad work ethic and doesn't know when to stop complaining. Harris' character for me was what really sold the film at first, he has the screen most of the time in the beginning and it's his big mouth that starts so much \"what if\" scenarios that ultimately get carried out by the end of the film. Kevin Spacey and Alec Baldwin play natural corporate jerks who you know you can relate to in the work force as guys that just seem to be there to make you feel like dirt.\r\n\r\nThe story is catching but not delivered in an easy way. The film moves fast and if you don't pay attention you'll get lost. David Mamet's brilliant dialogue and explosive performances helps keep the tempo of the movie up so that there's never a dull moment when any of these all-star celebrities are onscreen. And it truly is great to see such remarkable actors all onscreen working together. The chemistry certain actors such as Harris and Alan Arkin have together is impeccable. Also Lemmon and Pacino, they play off of each other. \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is probably the best example of the greatest casting choices, where we know all the familiar star-studded faces, but we know they're not all there just to \"look good.\" \r\n\r\nBased on the Pulitzer Prize winning play, I could definitely see how \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" worked onstage, and the transfer over to film is gritty and entertaining. To me the whole concept of vulgarity and angst is not just be \"cool\" by getting away with using such foul language, but to enhance the stress that I know EVERY working man has felt in his office at one time or another. Taking all those emotions literally, it makes for one intense negative trip that ultimately has a positive meaning. \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is like Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\" without the violence. With all the actors playing off of each other and the next move completely unpredictable it's a great movie to watch to remember that what we go through on a regular basis at work can be documented and depicted in an interesting, almost exaggerative way. But remember the policy Baldwin's character Blake heeds, \"A, B, C...Always Be Closing...\"",

It's become a little dated, but it's still worth watching. I know just about every line of dialog. Maybe I shouldn't admit that. Jack Lemmon's Shelley Levine is a tragic character for the ages played with every ounce of dramatic tension Lemmon could muster; it was one of his last great roles. Pacino's Ricky Roma is hilarious and often over-the-top Pacino-style. I love his scenes with Ed Harris, who as Moss is the sinister heart of the plot, and Pacino's silent moments are great like when he's listening to Levine tell his sale. Kevin Spacey is a perfect Williamson, absorber of much abuse. Pacino shreds him repeatedly. Alec Baldwin's scene early in the film is the thing most people remember. It's darkly hilarious. And I can't forget Alan Arkin, the innocuous guy caught in between. The way Moss reels him in is fascinating. Anyways, if you're not into Mamet you probably won't like it and may even be bored, but as for me it's one of my favorite flicks. \"What's this toilet paper you're handing me?\"",

            "content": "A distinctly cynical but witty drama, that pokes fun at the world of professional sales, and features one of the best ensemble casts of the nineties.\r\n\r\nJames Foley takes a step up from directing Madonna videos to craft this entertaining drama that will speak to anyone who's ever had to work a job they've hated. Set in the office of a Chicago-based real estate agent, the film follows its floundering employees who are given an ultimatum of closing a deal or losing their job. It's a testosterone fuelled marketplace which sees some employees charm their way to success and others plummet to new lows in order to avoid the chopping block. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the cast, things really couldn't get better. Jack Lemmon leads the team with a sympathetic turn as down-on-his-luck Shelley Levene. Once the biggest man in the office, recent years have seen him fall to the bottom of the heap, overtaken by younger and more ruthless salesmen. His performance is one of the film's best, as Lemmon really captures the audience's sympathy with his desperate portrayal. Alongside him Alan Arkin and Ed Harris play less likeable but equally troubled salesmen, and both bring their A-game to the roles. Similarly Kevin Spacey stars as their inept office manager, while Alec Baldwin puts in a great supporting performance despite only appearing in one scene throughout the whole movie. His monologue here is one of the most memorable I think I've ever witnessed. British actor Jonathan Pryce also stars as an unsuspecting buyer, targeted by a slick salespitch made by Ricky Roma; the office's top dog. \r\n\r\nPlayed brilliantly by Al Pacino, the Roma character is a foul-mouthed hothead who knows how to make a sale. Pacino brings a huge amount of life to the role, standing out from the entire cast and showing once again just what a commanding screen presence he is. In 1993 Pacino received Oscar nominations for his work both here and in Scent of a Woman. Of course the Academy went for his baity role in the latter, but in terms of the better performance, I found his work here to be less contrived and simply more entertaining. This is a performance any who consider themselves a Pacino fan should see.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the film is quite dialogue heavy, and that may put some viewers off. However personally I feel the well-written albeit wordy screenplay acts as one of the film's strengths, filled with witty exchanges and providing great material for the talented cast to play with. That being said certain scenes have a tendency to drag, and though the film is generally well paced and by no means overstays its welcome at just 96 minutes, there are still one or two occasions where Foley could have tightened things up.\r\n\r\nOn the whole however, this is a very worthy drama featuring a host of fine performances, making it easily one of my favourite films of its year.",

            "content": "This is a great movie in particular respects. I think it should be required viewing for business-school freshmen. Its two great strengths are its writing and its acting. The screenplay by David Mamet is excellent, full of long angry monologues and venomous back and forth dialogue. The movie has little plot, but it's fascinating just to listen to the characters talk and insult each other. The movie has an unbelievably good cast, with some of the very best actors in the business at the time: Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Alan Arkin, and Alec Baldwin, and they all actually get adequate screen time and development. Only Pacino got an Oscar nomination when the movie was released, but I really think Lemmon and possibly Baldwin should have gotten nominations as well. It's particularly astonishing to see Lemmon throwing around curse words like it's nothing if you're acquainted with his nice-guy image from his 1950s and 1960s movies, but he does it just so well here; plus, his character goes through the most interesting transformations over the movie. Baldwin only has one scene at the beginning of the film, but it's an excellent scene; he's essentially playing the serious version of the funny character he now plays on 30 Rock, but he was just as convincing here as he is now on the show. Pacino gets some great showy monologue moments, the kind he's always been best with. Harris and Arkin have slightly smaller roles, but their conversations are really good while they last. This might be one of the best all-male ensemble casts I've ever seen. The movie's direction, by James Foley, is quite good, showing some visual flair without overdoing it. The only real flaw in the movie is the godawful soundtrack, which is cheesy jazz that does not fit the tone of the movie at all, sometimes is so loud as to nearly drown out the excellent dialogue, and seems to float in and out of the movie randomly. If ever there was a movie that had no need for a soundtrack, it was this one, and yet it got an absolutely terrible and obnoxious one. Other than the soundtrack, though, it's hard for me to find fault with this compelling multi-character-study.",

            "content": "A film that is drives, lives, and courses through your veins, David Mamet brings his stage play to the silver screen and discusses the world of the salesman. Mamet's words are so intricate and beautiful, filthy and philandering, and yet they sparkle with their brilliance. Most of the film contains these long, convoluted rants from different characters that contain subtle context about their livelihood. Their dialogue is full of the candor and realism of being a salesman in the cutthroat business of selling real estate. Mamet creates characters that are full of expectation, remorse, screaming at one another and anyone to let themselves finally become heard. These words come out of the mouths of a cast that is more impressively assembled than any ever before, including Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, and Kevin Spacey. Each performance has its own breadth, no matter how unknown some of the actors were at the time (Kevin Spacey, I'm looking at you) and always feels desperate. Whether you're the iron willed pro who is closing in on the deal of the century or the warbling old man on his last leg against the crushing pain of unemployment and ruin, they each are wailing for someone to listen to their plight. Though these performances are amazing, it's Jack Lemmon who steals the show on more than one occasion as the chatterbox Shelley Levene. His rants are usually the longest, spiteful, most epithet filled pieces of Americana you have ever heard. He speaks on the state of salesman, his own problems, and time and again begs for understanding from his manager. Al Pacino is also impressive as the only closing salesman, pulling punches and scams in order to get to the yes. Everyone is always lying to their customers, but Pacino is suave and charismatic to boot. The film is set in 24 hours and doesn't move around many sets, but it encases many lives and the consequences of irrational behavior. A classic of American theater as well as film, this is one film that must be seen in your lifetime.",

The all-star cast work well together, with each of the salesman making their marks on the film. Set almost interily in one or two rooms, and with a fairly basic plot, the film can be summarised as simple yet effective.

This one isUndeniably a very good film. Lots of things happening, though you do have to pay attention to pick up on them, but largely, this one is a character study of multiple different characters, which is a very interesting thing to see. This one is ultimately all about the script and the acting. David Mamet's script is brilliant and rife with brilliant dialogue and near perfect pacing. It feels as if we know every character by the end and everything they all say is pitch perfect. The acting from this star-studded cast of Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Alan Arkin, and Jonathan Pryce, is predictably good. No one expected anything less and they delivered a complete home run. It is rare to see so many good actors sharing the screen together, so it is a real treat when they do. Ultimately, Glengarry Glen Ross closes the deal.",
