            "content": "This is a masterpiece. Not because it follows Dickens' marvelous story to the letter, but because it uses the Muppets to take the story to a wonderfully creative level. Michael Caine is Scrooge and he plays him really well. He never flinches at the fact that his clerk is a frog, that Tiny Tim is also a frog, and so on. Jacob Marley is played by those two old guys who carry on a commentary on the Muppet Show. As Scrooges wades through the famous story, meeting the ghosts of past, present, and yet to come, we are starting to believe that what we see on the screen are real characters. There are some wonderful songs that move the plot nicely along. Of course, the Muppets are incredible jokester, punning and dropping one-liners at will. Of course, we have to accept that Scrooge was apprenticed by old Fozziwig at a rubber chicken factory. Make this an annual event at the holidays.",

            "content": "In terms of humor or songs, I can't honestly rank this was high as most of the other Muppet films BUT it may be the most touching version of the Dickens classic story I've ever seen on film.The lyrics to the last two songs are fantastic: very Christian-like and very profound. Scrooge (Michael Caine), meanwhile, is not portrayed as some screaming maniac as he so often is in other versions. His transformation from cold-hearted tightwad to caring, generous person is done more subtly, too, than in other films. However, to be fair, sometimes the slapstick humor in here gets in the way of the touching story.The last part of the movie is a lot sentimental drama than Muppet comedy and I found that refreshing. Not much offensive in here, either, making this a good film for little ones as well as older, sentimental folks.",

Michael Caine is perfect as Scrooge, and his chemistry with the muppets in tow are an amazing match. The movie is legitimately funny, spooky or touching all at the right moments\u2014it's one of those rare films that hits the right note every single second. There doesn't seem to be any pattern with the intermixing of humans and muppets, but regardless, it works just fine without any distractions. Perhaps the strongest point of all is the musical numbers composed by Miles Goodman and written by Paul Williams.**** (out of four)",

            "content": "The two best Muppet movies after Jim Henson's death are this and Muppets Treasure Island. The worst, I think is Muppets Wizard of Oz. Muppets Christmas Carol is wonderful, and deserves the high rating. I also think the rating for Treasure Island is too low, as I loved that film too.The Muppets are truly funny here, especially Gonzo and Rizzo, who have the funniest lines. Kermit and Miss Piggy were at their most touching here. Scrooge's encounter with the Marley Brothers was the highlight of the film for me. The high point of the movie is the performance of Michael Caine,(like Tim Curry in Treasure Island) who was the best he was in recent years, and his singing was passable. Very convincing! I personally think this is the funniest post Jim Henson Muppet movie, and was my favourite Christmas memory as a kid, and managed to stay true to the spirit of Christmas, and was heartwarming with the character of Tiny Tim. The songs, also, weren't that bad at all, but in comparison to the ones in Treasure Isaland, one or two of them are a little hit-and-miss, but that's just me, and that is my only negative! The incidental music was beautiful though.All in all, a wonderfully entertaining film, that has enough to satisfy Muppet fans. 9/10. Bethany Cox",

All the things which have made the Muppets appealing--charm, humor, tenderness--are very much in evidence in this adaption of Charles Dickens' much-retold classic.Michael Caine fills the central role of Ebeneezer Scrooge admirably, throwing himself into the part with much energy and gusto.  Familiar Muppet faces take up several roles--Kermit and Miss Piggy as Bob and Mrs. Cratchit, Robin as Tiny Tim, elderly hecklers Statler and Waldorf as the Marley brothers (Dickens' character Jacob and original creation Robert)--with new Muppets designed for the roles of the three Christmas ghosts.  The result is a somewhat fanciful 19th-century London where humans, animals, talking vegetables, and various undefinable creatures live side-by-side.  In spite of potential complications the concept works very well, thanks to the spirited performances by both actors and Muppet handlers.Gonzo (adopting the persona of Dickens himself) and Rizzo the Rat narrate the story and add a healthy dose of humor to the proceedings.  But the film knows when to be serious--the climactic scene focusing on Christmas Yet to Come is as eerie and touching as it should be.  And ultimately, the resolution leaves one with the warm, peaceful joy synonomous with the season.  Definitely a movie which deserves a place among the family classics of the holidays.",

If you can get past the fact that most of the cast are muppets, this is actually a terrific version of A Christmas Carol.  Michael Caine makes a fine Scrooge, one of the best I've ever seen in fact.  I usually hate musicals, but all of the songs in this film are great (and the girl who plays Belle - this girl can SING!)  The comedy is mostly provided by Gonzo, narrating as Charles Dickens, and his sidekick Rizzo the Rat.  The humor is truly funny and appropriately placed (notice how a very good reason is created for Gonzo and Rizzo to exit during the serious Christmas Yet to Come portion .)  This is truly one of those movies \"for young and old alike\", though it will probably go over the heads of very young children.

            "content": "Over the years, there have been countless tellings and re-tellings of Charles Dickens' classic tale \"A Christmas Carol\". Who would ever have thought, then, that a version staring the Muppets would be the best one ever produced!Basically, this version is narrated (quite comically) by The Great Gonzo and his sidekick Rizzo the Rat. They follow the story of curmudgeon Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine) on Christmas Eve night, when he is visited by three spirits that show him the meaning of Christmas. Central to Scrooge's emotional journey is Bob Cratchit (Kermit the Frog) and family (Miss Piggy), whose simple, hard-working lives prove quite inspirational.The reason why this version of the story works so well is because not only does it provide the humor that one would expect from a Muppet performance, but it also brings the heavy emotional drama as well. You wouldn't think you could get teary-eyed over a Muppet, but that is exactly what happens. The comedy is on the fringes (mostly provided by Gonzo/Rizzo), while the story plays out about as expected.The performance of Caine (now known for so many other projects!) is also a visual treat, again one of the best \"Scrooge portrayals\" ever put to screen! Caine is just such a great acting that he knows all the right beats to hit.Overall, then, \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" is a movie that will stand the test of time. Even if you don't particularly care for the Muppets in generally (this is, in all honesty, the only Muppet- based piece of media I have ever watched/owned in my entire life), the combination of comedy/emotion in this movie will boost it up near the top of your Xmas movie traditions.",

            "review_title": "The very best of all the Muppet Movies!",
            "content": "The Muppet Christmas Carol is my favourite of all the Muppet flicks. Jim Henson, of course, never lent his name to anything even remotely resembling 'bad', but nevertheless, there is a clear mark of sheer mastery and brilliance in this movie that is somehow less evident in most of the other muppet movies.In a way, I have to admit that I find this surprising. This was the first Muppet movie to be shot after Henson himself passed away; the voice of kermit, the most beloved and indeed inventive puppeteer ever to have lived was dead. Could Henson's magic touch ever be recreated? Did the Muppets have a future at all without their creator? The answer, of course we now know, is Yes they did.As is the secret to all truly great children's movies, The Muppet Christmas Carol does not pander to notions of anything being 'too scary'; nor does it shy away from the innate darkness of the material at hand. Dicken's tale is one that revolves almost uniformly around themes of corruption, poverty and death, and here it has most certainly not been diluted.\"There was the year we evicted the entire orphanage! I remember the little tykes all standing in the snowbank, with their little frostbitten teddy bears!\" hollers a ghostly apparition of Scrooge's dead business partner early in the film. We witness a heartbreaking lament from Scrooge's lover, who leaves him because he has become too money-hungry to love her. We watch as Bob Cratchett's family mourn the empty chair at their table where their beloved and selfless young son once sat. At the eleventh hour, scrooge even bends before his own tombstone and begs in tears of desperation to a grim reaper-like spirit to be allowed to live. So much for it being the season to be jolly.Where there is humour, it is frequently black, and where there is emotion, it is generally somewhat adult by todays standards. Of course, before you decide not to show this to your five year old son or daughter, you should consider that these dark themes by no means drag the film down; rather, they help to raise it up to become, just like the original story, a stirring and emotional story of triumph and redemption in the face of mortality. Whilst the script writers wisely keep the story pretty much identical to the original in all of it's major aspects, there is plenty mayhem and indeed magic here too which is 24 carat Henson Studios. I remember as a 5 year old simply adoring the spectacle of Kermit's Bob Cratchett taking part in a the Penguins of London Annual Christmas Skating party, or the delight of Gonzo and Rizzo's almost post-modernist presence as physical participants but also omnipotent narrators in the tale. Indeed, the translation from book to screen is almost peculiarly elegant; the Muppet characters all seem to open up to new ranges of poignancy and dramatic possibility when placed in the storyline. You will find yourself feeling immense pity for Miss Piggy's somewhat hysterical but ultimately warm Mrs Cratchett for example, and indeed a whole host of wonderful performances on show from the familiar Muppet Show Cast. Of course this review could not be complete without tribute to the simply brilliant performance from the great Michael Cane in the role of Ebeneezer Scrooge. he understands his role excellently and invests it with a moving, convincing and genius reality; always resisting the temptation, that must surely be strongly felt when one is the sole human among a cast of felt puppets, to play the role for laughs. One feels that his performance would not seem out of place if he were surrounded by the ranks of great British thespians and taking part in a 'straight' production of Dicken's tale as opposed to a Muppet movie. Upon recently viewing the Patrick Stewart film of this story, I was delighted to find that Cane quite simply out-acted Stewart in the role and clearly this makes his performance something special.The production values are high in this film as is to be expected in a Henson movie, and the film has a wonderful, almost Tim Burton-esquire look which is by turns wintry and quite breath-takingly beautiful or dark and positively scary. In terms of music it is filled with an array of wonderfully enduring and subtly written songs that fill me with a sense of child-like happiness and that allusive 'christmassey feeling' even after all these years. One recommendation I would make to anyone planning on purchasing the film is to if at all possible obtain a copy which contains the beautiful song \"When Love Is Gone\" which, in the recent DVD re-release, was sadly cut from the film. This decision to exclude the song from the film detracts hugely from the pathos of one of the film's central themes (past Mistakes and ultimate redemption) and definitely takes away some of the indescribably bitter-sweet overall mood of the film.I strongly recommend this film to people of any age or gender as a film that it is virtually impossible not to fall in love with.",

            "content": "While the 1951 Alistair Sim version of A Christmas Carol is the most faithful to the original Dickens story, A Muppet Christmas Carol possesses heart, whimsey, and a joy that is so very much lacking in our evermore commercialized holiday season.  Michael Caine's performance as Scrooge easily surpasses those of Reginald Owen (1938), George C. Scott (1984) and Patrick Stewart (2001).  There is a more genuine degree of transformation and redemption in his characterization than has often been portrayed. This makes the story a truly wonderful experience both for adults as well as for children.The use of the Muppets in the various roles makes for a lively film experience.  Statler and Waldorf as Jacob & Robert Marley are appropriately heckling as they seek to convince Scrooge to change his ways.  Kermit the Frog is a wonderfully sympathetic Bob Crachit just as Miss Piggy is appropriately and aggressively belligerent Mrs. Crachit.  Perhaps one of the better-inspired comedy bits comes with the arrival of Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past at Scrooge's former workplace, described as \"Fozziwig's Rubber Chicken Factory.\"  Such bits are frequent and help to keep the story fun.  Paul Williams' music score and songs are eminently singable and leave the viewer with a lasting memory.A Muppet Christmas Carol has joined the pantheon of classic holiday films, easily ranking alongside Holiday Inn, White Christmas and A Christmas Story. It is the opinion of this reviewer that for those whom holiday films have become a part of holiday celebration should make this a part of their seasonal experience.  One might even complete the film humming the tunes and thinking better of themselves as well as of their fellow humans.  In other words, Henson and company have made Dickens story as memorable as Dickens himself wished it to be.",

            "content": "That question pretty much sums up my reaction to \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\", a hilarious, yet touching film.What did I like about the movie?  Just about everything!  Michael Caine made a great Scrooge, and this film showed us, possibly better than just about any other version I've seen, just how Scrooge came to be such a miser (although that could partly be because the versions I saw which really go into Scrooge's childhood were clearly adult versions, which meant they could be more subtle in their explanations).  To Caine's eternal credit, he made Scrooge very believable, which is no small feat considering most of his fellow cast members were puppets.And what about the Muppets?  They were also brilliant!  Kermit made an excellent Bob Cratchit, loyal and humble, and he had a wonderful tribute to Tiny Tim which also served as a brilliant tribute to Jim Henson.  Miss Piggy was a great Mrs. Cratchit, feisty yet very loving toward Bob (the worst of her temper was thankfully muted by the story).  Fozzie the Bear was a hilarious Fozziwig, and The Great Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat made a great team, having some of the best lines out there (my favorite is Rizzo's \"Light the lamp, not the rat!  Light the lamp, not the rat!\").  The ghosts were definitely believable (and in the case of the two Marley Brothers, hilarious as well).  Incidentally, the original text had only one Marley -- Jacob, but to get the two comedians from the balcony in the story, Robert Marley was added.Finally, the songs were rather good, with the best one (in my humble opinion) being \"When Love is Gone\".So, I firmly recommend \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" to one and all.Belle Book",

            "content": "I resisted watching THE MUPPET Christmas CAROL for over two decades. Why? Because I don't like most versions of the Dickens film because it's been overdone so many times that the story has practically become a clich\u00e9. Heck, there have been 95 versions of A Christmas CAROL!!! And, among the many versions were even ones that starred Mr. Magoo and Scrooge McDuck! Talk about overdoing things!!! Some of these variations are quite clever--most are not and are just cheap ways to get past writing original material. My feeling about THE MUPPET Christmas CAROL is that if you must see one, this is better than most though not as good as, in my opinion, the best version which stars George C. Scott*.Now, despite all my Scrooge-like comments, I cannot fault the film too much since despite the familiarity of the story, it's actually one of the better Muppet films. I was particularly impressed by the sets. The scenes of rooftops of London and the forest were all created on the sound stage and must have taken a tremendous amount of time and effort--and they are beautiful. Additionally, some of the other sets are amazing--such as the Cratchit house. They are just lovely. Likewise, I just loved the puppets--especially the Ghost of Christmas present. The only negative were that there were perhaps a few songs too many. Otherwise, a lovely family film overall.*While it is a very, very, very different version, I strongly recommend you see BLACKADDER'S Christmas CAROL. It is a wonderful variation on the old story--one where sweet, generous and kind Mr. Blackadder is accidentally turned into a selfish jerk by the same ghosts!",

When Kermit the Frog sings the song \"One More Sleep 'Til Christmas\", we cuddle together and sing along, knowing that Santa's on his way and the next day is the most special day of the entire year. My parents told me that when this movie was released in the theaters, it didn't do well, but I can't seem to believe it. How can one of the most adorable versions of A Christmas Carol, one that remains one of our all-time favorites\u2014and we've seen every version known to man\u2014not be treasured by everyone in the world? Paul Williams wrote the memorable and lovely songs in the film, and when Miles Goodman's music flows during the opening credits, it instantly puts the audience in the mood for Christmas. The cast is announced, and as Kermit the Frog is listed as Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as Emily Cratchit, and other well-known Muppets and human actors are credited, the best is saved for last. Michael Caine gets the \"and\" in the credits; he plays Ebenezer Scrooge. He's truly heartwarming in the film, playing the iconic role as a sensitive man. While other versions of the story portray Scrooge as unwaveringly mean until the memorable ending, Jerry Juhl's fantastic script shows Scrooge affected by the early scenes.The Great Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat speak to the camera in the opening scene, introducing themselves and the story. They're the continuous narrators of the film, and the running commentary is absolutely hilarious. Too many of the lines from Juhl's screenplay have become household phrases in my family for me to list, but there is one part that is worth mentioning. When the Ghost of Christmas Future appears, there is the usual ominous setting. Gonzo and Rizzo remark how spooky it is and tell the little kids in the audience that they're going to leave and come back when it's not scary anymore, which is not only a considerate warning but is kind to the kids who choose to hide their eyes so they don't feel embarrassed. When the Muppets reappear, they say, \"We're back! We promised we would be!\" Every time I used to come home and greet my kitty, I said that phrase.There's really too much perfection in this movie to keep my review short, but I'll try to keep it relatively brief. The sets and costumes are beautiful and look very authentic. The smaller roles\u2014Steven Mackintosh as Nephew Fred, Meredith Braun as Belle, and the incredibly cast Raymond Coulthard as Young Scrooge\u2014are lovely and put just as much of their hearts in their performances as the main leads do. And the songs, which I've already praised, somehow make the listeners' hearts lighter and spirits brighter. In \"It Feels Like Christmas\", the production number started by the Ghost of Christmas Present and continued by the ensemble, Michael Caine actually dances along as his Christmas spirit is rekindled. The back-and-forth rocking is forever known in my house as \"doing the Michael Caine\" and it's a dance move we love to imitate. Speaking of the Ghost of Christmas Present\u2014have you noticed that sometimes this jolly spirit isn't always nice in other film versions? In The Muppet Christmas Carol, he's incredibly sweet and caring.If it's at all possible you haven't seen this version, buy a copy. I guarantee it'll become a staple in your household during the Christmas season. Whether you watch it the first night you put up the tree or wait until there's only one more sleep 'til Christmas, it'll be one of your favorite parts of the most wonderful time of the year.",

This is a well done version of the story, and it is the only Muppet movie I can look at as a real movie, rather than a movie starring Muppets.The way the story is told in this movie is done really well. Having Gonzo play Charles Dickens as he narrates the story was a smart move. It adds more humour to the story. The different characters that Muppets pop up as are genius, for instance, changing Fuzzywig to Fozziewig so Fozzie Bear could play him. Also, the movie manages to remain dark like the story should be, while also staying tame for kids.Micahel Caine is great as Ebenezer Scrooge. He's actually one of the best Scrooge's I've seen.

            "content": "The legendary Charles Dickens novel gets the irreverent (but still respectful) treatment from director Brian Henson and the rest of the Muppet performers, as bitter, miserly penny-pincher Ebenezer Scrooge (Sir Michael Caine) is visited by a succession of spirits on an eventful Christmas Eve. Their goal is to show the progression of events in his life that led to his current sour outlook on the world, how it is for the other citizens in whom he has little interest (unless they owe him money), and the possible outcome should he continue on this path.Certainly there have been a number of noteworthy adaptations of this Dickens perennial throughout the decades, especially the 1951 film with Alastair Sim. But this can stand head and shoulders with many of them, mainly because of the appeal of the Muppet characters and their cheerful spin on the material, and the effectiveness of Caines' under-stated performance. The Great Gonzo plays Dickens, on hand to narrate the story, and he's accompanied by the hilarious Rizzo the Rat, whose misfortunes are frequent. Kermit the Frog is Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy is Emily Cratchit, Fozzie the Bear is \"Fozziwig\", Statler and Waldorf the Marley Brothers, etc. There's room for many of the old favourites, including this viewers' personal favourite, the Swedish Chef, who has a brief bit. One interesting twist is that the spirits of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come are NOT filled out by familiar Muppet characters.However, despite the ample amount of humour, the appeal of the story, and its tale of redemption, are still solidly punched across. Screenwriter Jerry Juhl keeps a fair amount of the poetry of Dickens' words intact, while also including some great moments for Muppets fans. And Paul Williams composed a variety of songs that are both catchy and poignant.Whether you love Dickens, Caine, or the Muppets, or all three, you're guaranteed to find this pretty charming.Eight out of 10.",

            "content": "Fan rant first: No, unfortunately I'm here to report that the Ghost of Jeffrey Katzenberg (who demanded the song \"When Love is Gone\" to be edited out of most versions of the film) persists with the current theatrical re release. Reportedly, Quibi-Boy thought kids wouldn't stand for a song that was \"too sad\" and had it cut out, though why it stays out decades after his departure from the company baffles me (I mean, we've all evolved to the point where Inside Out works as practically a rebuke to his logic, but I digress).It's an extra shame because the time to just put it back in and not make a big deal of it is when it's in theaters again for a limited time and when only silly geese like myself who find the Muppets and Michael Caine in particular so darn special are trudging out to see it when I could as well pop it on my Disney+ thing and put up with the noisy ads neighbors (again, my patented digression). Point is, if you go thinking it'll be back, don't bother, and once again be jarred by the abrupt cut to a crying Rizzo to a thirty second scene and a *reprisal of the very song at the end of the film as a way of bringing the message of the song full circle that finding love is a really big deal* and so on.As for the rest of the film, it still mostly slaps because Henson and Juhl and company know how to balance the comedy and the rest of the pathos. The whole thing is tied together by Caine, who is my first Scrooge (in live action, no disrespect to the voice of McDuck), and still the one who gave the greatest and most deeply felt Scrooge I've still come across. The 1951 film may be superior overall, and watching this again the songs are hit or miss (the ones that work are lovely, but Williams's music is less memorable than the lyrics and I just don't see myself listening to these like I would his for the Muppet Movie, tall order but it's what it is for me).Caine gets it right, not just for playing it straight but for channeling the dark and miserly side with such dead poker-faced focus, and yet the warmth at the end feels completely earned and genuine. He... Makes this Scrooge likable to the extent that is possible, and especially the scene in the cemetery is as great as anything he ever did as an actor. And the movie around him doesn't go for anything at all topical in the humor and that helps to make its staying power solid (maybe there's one joke where Rizzo mentions New Jersey? That's about all, though), and that speaks to Henson and company's courage of their convictions.So... Third best Muppet movie? That's still a high as hell compliment. And yeah, Mr Dickens, I'll go read the book next.",

            "content": "The Muppet's Christmas Carol (1992) -Firstly I have to say that 'A Christmas Carol' is my favourite book, there was so much squeezed on to the pages of such a short story that it just made it a fantastic tale and one that is still very relevant today.What foresight Dickens had to focus on commercialism as a vice and love and kindness as the cure. And what a shame it is, that a lot of us, still pay no heed to the message, forging longer and longer chains each day.The Muppets captured the story very well here, they brought out all the humour that already existed and added to it. I firmly believe that if Charles were here today, this would be his favourite interpretation of his work.There were some things that weren't strictly in keeping with Britain in the 19th century, although I do believe that many businesses had a frog or two working as a clerk in their offices and Rabbits were renowned for Carolling at Christmas, but Penguins on the streets of London might have been stretching it a bit. However, if you have a sense of humour and can take a film at face value, you can't help but enjoy it, because this one really did make it easy to indulge yourself in a little bit of culture, without needing a dictionary to translate all the big words. It was as a story that will always be made again and again, but I don't think many will ever surpass this one.There were so many lovely touches thrown in, so many funny little things for children of all ages (1-150) to look out for and a magic feeling that could only come from this canny bunch of critters and all of the people behind the scenes who made it all possible.Although I thought that George C Scott was a great, more traditional version of the cantankerous old Ebenezer in the 1984 version, Michael Caine was perfect in this particular film opposite its varied and alternative cast. He couldn't sing and he his dancing was questionable, but he didn't care and actually I think that was how the real Scrooge would have reacted to ghosts who broke out in to song in the middle of the street. I would imagine Mr Micklewhite (Michael's real last name - Look for the shop names after him at the end) struggled to keep a straight face making this film and I bet he had the time of his life.And who could blame him? The thought and attention that went in to which muppet should be cast as what was obviously carefully done. The casting from the Henson universe was spot on, even if they had to add a second Marley (Robert or Bob to his friends), but who else could have played that part. I'm also glad that they didn't get too tricky and try to bring in too many new characters just for this film. Having said that, the 3 ghosts and in particular, The Ghost of Christmas Present, were superb. A couple of the humans were a bit dodgy though.When my Niece and Nephew were younger, we wore out our VHS copy of this film, watching it most Sunday's throughout the year, so I could probably recite the film to you word for word, I absolutely love it that much and I stand by it as the best interpretation of the original work out there today.The Muppets should come back with more like this, because, honestly I don't really get on with their other films, but this was comedy gold and a joy to watch. Let's see 'The Muppet's Romeo And Juliet' or 'The Muppets Miracle On 34th Street' please?954.91/1000.",

A lot of the irreverent humor of the Muppets gets toned down-notice how Gonzo and Rizzo are removed from the 3rd act entirely-to allow for the sentiment of the story to be present. At the same time the story isn't given the full pathos it deserves-I think Caine is a bit stiff as Scrooge as well-because Muppet gags in the background. This tension is never enough to ruin the film, or even really damage it, but it is annoying aspect of the film.This still ends up be quite enjoyable as a piece of entertainment; it is a wonderful introduction for young kids to both the Muppets and Dickens' tale. The song is singable to the point that I mostly sing along with it when I watch this each year.This is a heart warming film that does not quite stick the landing.",

The decision to take in Michael Caine's disciplined, down to earth doctrine in his approach to acting and toss it in with the lovably loopy, varied psychedelic muskrats we know as the muppets is a stroke off juxtaposed genius that make for quite the charming outing. Caine makes a slight Scrooge, relieving us by never being totally committed to the initial nastiness that hallmarks the character, and being especially upbeat when it comes time for the old codger to make his legendary mood swing and dive into the spirit of Christmas. I've only seen Caine in a single film where he played an outright son of a bitch, and it's downright jarring. He's such a pleasant fellow, and makes the perfect companion to the critters that populate the show. Highlights for me: the talking vegetable that audibly protests upon being poached from a local muppet market, and Caine's delightful original solo 'Thankful Heart.'",

            "content": "After certain people, that keep a business going, pass away, can be difficult to keep it moving because the person who left was main source of power and motivation. This usually leads to financial failure and an absence from the media. It could've been that way for The Muppets after Jim Henson passed away in 1990, but by that time, The Muppets were immortal as it was. Thankfully Henson's son, Brian Henson decided to take hold of the reigns and lead the way.And as of Mr. Henson's first theatrically released Muppet film, I must say, it is superb add-on to the franchise. The story of The Muppet Christmas Carol is exactly parallel to that of Charles Dickens' novel. The are no changes in the story, order wise, but there are a few little tidbits that will have the audience understand that this is a Muppet production and not just them retelling the story. For example, The Great Gonzo plays Charles Dickens in this film, the omniscient narrator of our story. And no he doesn't talk from out of the sky; he actively takes part in the story. And along side him is his pal Rizzo, who also provides us with some comedy relief.And that's just these two characters. You still have the rest of the Muppet crew. Because Jim Henson was no longer around, Steve Whitmire took over the role of Kermit the Frog, but unless you really have good ears, it's not easy to hear the difference, which is great. This is why these Muppet characters are immortal. As long as they have a voice actor who has a voice that closely matches their predecessor, no one will ever know. Playing Scrooge is English actor himself, Michael Caine. Caine gives an excellent performance as the grumpy old humbug moneylender. Caine is effective when he's tough and angry and when he's soft and emotional on screen.As for the rest of Muppets go, the usual voice actors perform their parts for their respective Muppets and they do a great job at it. Every Muppet you think that'll have a part will be in this film, no doubt. And it's great because you get to see every single one have a little screen time of their own. The special effects are good for their time; nothing looks overly edited or out of place. The score by Miles Goodman is a fun listening experience as well. In all aspects, it evokes the right tones and emotions all at the right moments. Some real good work here.This first theatrically released film starring The Muppets without Brian Henson's father on board is still just as great. Jim Henson may have left, but his spirit is still there.",

Despite some changes to fit the Muppets' unique traits, the story stays with the source material of the original novel from the real Charles Dickens.

It has its goofy moments when it needs to, but I was surprised by how earnestly this movie treats the subject matter. It's really about the spirit of Christmas; the time of year when everyone is just a little nicer, people a little more generous, the cold snow a welcome sight instead of a dreadful one. This movie gets what makes Christmas such a magical time.It also opts for Scrooge's hatred of Christmas being based on philosophy and not some personal tragedy; he genuinely doesn't understand why it matters. Convincing him is not buying into this saccharine version of the holiday, but the realization that if you can't be kind at Christmas, when can you?What can be said of the music? It's wondrous. Really inventive, catchy, beautifully written songs that never feel out of place. Even when delivered by Muppets, they're mostly taken seriously.Speaking of Henson's iconic creations, they're used at just the right amount. They feel a part of the world and not necessarily front and centre. It's truly incredible how many puppets show up in this movie and how wonderful they are; all of their different bodily movements, facial expressions, and voices add to the world's richness and depth. They're also done so well I honestly forgot they were inanimate objects at the time. The visual effects and movement are just amazing.I also loved the decision for the spirits of Christmas to be wholly different, a little ethereal and strange, and NOT Muppets playing each one. I didn't even mention Michael Caine, who delivers a truly incredible performance here, and never once looks at the Muppets as if they're puppets held by people.I love this movie, you should too.

            "content": "Due to other commitments, myself and partner were having a later \"Christmas Day\" together on something like the 27th or 28th and I was putting some things together to make it feel as festive as possible. I had borrowed some compilation CD's of festive music as well as some DVD's of various Christmas films that could just be run on the TV in the background on mute. Making an assumption I put this film on mute only to be told that my partner had never seen it and, not having seen it myself for several years, we stopped it as background and decided to watch it at the end of a day of cheer, relaxing, feeding ducks in the park, presents, food and, of course, wine. So it was we came to watch the Muppet Christmas Carol, perhaps with low demands but still unwilling to put up with anything that wasn't good or that dragged the mood down.I needn't have worried because, although it is not a perfect film, Muppet Christmas Carol is a real joy that delivers on several levels. Most surprisingly the focus is on the telling of the story \u0096 this has its own modifications but it is surprisingly faithful to the story we all know and it is only really the use of the narrator that changes how it flows. This doesn't matter though because the film is surprisingly engaging \u0096 it doesn't just TELL the events, it draws us into the characters \u0096 or rather \"character\". I make this distinction because that the film does this is almost entirely down to a performance from Michael Caine that is brilliant apart from one or two minor missteps that are more down to the material than him. It is not just that he plays it deadly straight the whole time despite being surrounded by puppets and people below him working them, it is that he plays it so very well \u0096 this is a performance that is way beyond the standard expected for such a film. He holds so much emotion in his eyes and face that minor changes tell of a softening or hardening of his heart. It is in this area that the film engages and it is almost a shame that it is a seasonal kids film because his performance deserves more praise than it gets.In support of him, the film shores up with other aspects that you expect it to deliver in. In terms of laughs there are plenty but no massive killer or sequences that are built around a joke \u0096 it is key that he humour never gets in the way of the plot or compromises Caine's part of the film. I say \"part\" because, although the narration device has its detractors, I did like it as an easy way of framing the story but more for the fact that it allowed for little comic moments that exist as part of the film without putting jokes into the actual Christmas Carol story so much as in the packaging thereof. The songs are rarely magical but are serviceable at worst and good at best \u0096 Caine's singing is not great but his performance bought him a pass on that as far as I was concerned and credit to him for doing it himself. The various Muppet characters are all well received as on paper it is \"their\" film, even if reality it is very much Caine's.It seems weird to be praising a children's Christmas film because as a genre they are rarely the place to go for entertainment as they can be obvious, sentimental and not really much good outside of the season. However, thanks to the core work of Caine, this is a good film in its own right and the well-delivered humour and songs around this core only help and don't detract.",

As for other things, there is of course Jacob Marley, but his brother has a most interesting name (hint: think reggae).

What I mean by retelling is that it takes place in the 1800s, and it features your favorite Muppets like Kermit the Frog; Miss Piggy; Gonzo; etc. Michael Caine is really good as Scrooge, and I thought his singing voice was fine at the film's finale. The movie does provide some good laughs, but they are not laugh out loud hilarious. The sets are well done as well as Brian Henson's direction. The songs in the movie are fun, but don't have much to say about. The movie is really not my favorite Muppet movie or my favorite Christmas movie, but it is still fun to watch. If you are a fan of the Muppets, then you will love this movie. Overall, \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" is a fun retelling of Charles Dickens' book and you will have a fun time watching this movie that really does have that Christmas joy, and seeing one of your favorite Muppets in this movie. Check it out! I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",

Plot In A Paragraph: In this adaptation of the Christmas story narrated by Charles Dickens himself (played by Gonzo the Great) , It is Christmas Eve in 19th century London. The merriment is not shared by Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine), a money-lender who is more interested in profit than celebration. He is so against it, that his staff, including loyal employee Bob Cratchit (Kermit the Frog), have to beg for Christmas Day off. Later that evening, Scrooge finds himself face to face with the still mean-spirited ghosts of his former business partners, Jacob and Robert Marley (Statler and Waldorf) who have been condemned to shackles in the afterlife as punishment for the horrible deeds they committed in life. They warn him that he will share the same fate, only worse, if he does not change his ways, and foretell the arrival of three spirits throughout the night. The Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.",

Michael Caine turns in a perfect performance as Ebenezer Scrooge.  I cry with him when his girlfriend Belle leaves him. This is a very touching story with a light dusting of comedic relief. Though most of the characters are muppets, the story flows beautifully with a minimum of nonsense.  The one exception is the perhaps too silly visitation by Jacob and Robert Marley.  Like Scrooge, I hate to see the end of The Spirit Of Christmas Present.  The effects for Christmas Future are great and will knock your socks off if you are lucky enough to see it on the big screen.

To be honest, I am not a fan of puppets - and these ones never worked for me on television when I was young. This film does, however, deliver well. A combination of very gentle comedy, a strong and emotional story and a star who was certainly up for joining in, all combine well to offer an engaging and colourful take on the story without descending into too much sentiment that ends, fittingly, outside the east London branch of Mickelwhite's. Paul Williams has composed some frequently poignant lyrics for the \"Scrooge\", \"Bless Us All\" and \"It Feels Like Christmas\" numbers and, mercifully, the more irritating \"Kermit\" and \"Miss Piggy\" characters actually feature quite sparingly as that huge turkey in the butcher in the next street gets ever closer to finding a generous buyer.

            "content": "Spoilers herein.Film allows so many different modes, that we depend on the first few minutes of a movie to tell us what world we are entering and something of the rules of that world.The first muppet movie was one of the most important of films because of the new dimension it added: highly self-referential annotation. It was about the making of itself. At one point there is a fight and Kermit gets tossed around into the piano. (The piano player is the film's composer.) Kermit looks directly at the camera and says ` I hope you appreciate that I am doing my own stunts!'Jim Henson did not invent folded realities in film, but he surely was a key innovator. He took this notion pretty far with his ambitious experiments in `Labyrinth' and `Dark Crystal,' both failures in the end. The high point was the `Muppet Movie' which was directed by a `real' director. Since Jim's death and the entrance of Disney, all the creative steam is gone and we are left with simple exploitation. The kind of folding Henson had in mind can never be repeated, so this project starts off with a structural handicap.Meanwhile, Charles Dickens. He invented much of what Modern Christmas is. (Santa Claus' appearance and importance would be invented later by Coke.) The magic of Dickens is that he is totally without irony in the story, or folding if you will. He creates characters and lets them bump up against each other on their own accord. The whole thing works because it is without folding.Now these two world-creating paths (folding and antifolding) meet and do a good job of temporarily merging. It is this merged world to which we are introduced in the first few minutes. The clever idea here is that a muppet portrays the writer, the creator of what we see. Gonzo is a fabricated actor who acts the writer of the story. He both creates the characters and intermingles with them as a created character himself. As a clever idea, is is a rehash of older muppetry, but it works at least so far as making a watchable film.As it develops, in addition to the muppet narrator, it folds several other layers: familiar muppets acting parts, humans acting parts (Scrooge and girlfriend, Nephew and wife), newly created puppets who are not muppets acting some parts (the ghosts). The oddness of Dickens characters as created by him smoothly meshes with the similar oddness of Henson's exaggerated characters. That alone makes this the second most successful project in the muppet world. `Treasure Island' for instance, tried a similar trick and failed because Stevenson built his characters a different way.There are three or four muppet jokes inserted that do not derive from the story. But because we have a real narrator, we can get more of the actual language of Dickens' written word. And oddly, that makes this one of the most successful `Carol's on film in spite of Caine's excesses.The songs are dreadful except for the appearance of Marley (here as brothers).Bottom line: it is neither good Dickens nor good Henson. But no stage or film drama is good Dickens anyway, so if all you want is a sentimental echo of the real thing, this will do better than most.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",

The music is just beautiful. The singing and musical elements in the movie make it the best musical version of a Christmas Carol. All of this comes together to create one of the most memorable Christmas movies of all time.",

            "content": "Imagine a world in which muppets and humans exist and live side by side; now imagine that scenario being used to present one of the most beloved stories in literature, and you have `The Muppet Christmas Carol,' directed by Brian Henson and starring Michael Caine as the inimitable Ebenezer Scrooge.  A movie for children, you say?  Absolutely.  Adults?  Most certainly.  All that's required of any audience is that you suspend disbelief for awhile and check your doubts at the door; do that and you're in for a thoroughly enjoyable ninety minutes or so as Caine, Kermit, Miss Piggy and all the rest bring you a unique and entertaining version of the Charles Dickens' classic, guaranteed to be unlike any you've seen before. For the younger set, the antics of the  muppets alone will be enthralling; for the rest of us there's some subtle humor (as can be found in all of the muppets outings), and of course the story itself which, when well crafted and delivered-- as this one is-- always seems fresh, especially when seeing a new version for the first time. \tHenson has done a tremendous job of melding the live actors with the animated and presenting them together in such a natural setting, and with such imagination, that it's easy to accept the world in which they live and thrive; so much so that if Gonzo came to your door while you were watching this one, you wouldn't think twice about it.  And there are so many clever bits sprinkled throughout, for instance, having the Marley `Brothers,' Jacob and `Robert.'  Things adults will pick up on, and which will be entertaining to kids who will take what they see and hear at face value. \tAs for the casting of Michael Caine as Scrooge, to land such a gifted actor to anchor the story was a coup indeed; and Caine more than delivers, creating an imposing figure of Scrooge that he makes quite his own.  And how gratifying to see yet another interpretation of one of the most well known figures in literature played so well.  Caine immerses himself in the part and performs opposite Kermit the Frog or Miss Piggy with the same dedication and eye for detail that he did opposite Olivier in `Sleuth,' or Connery in `The Man Who Would Be King.'  It's a performance that lends distinction to the film and illustrates what a consummate professional Caine is. \tEveryone's favorite muppets are on hand for this one, with Kermit in the role of Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as Mrs. Cratchit and The Great Gonzo in the role of Charles Dickens, who also narrates the story, along with the help of Rizzo the Rat.  The familiar tale remains intact under Henson's direction, and what a treat `The Muppet Christmas Carol' will be to the youngsters who are being introduced to it with this film.  And for the holiday season it's like a bright and sparkling decoration that will fit in nicely with the traditional festivities of every family, and will help to keep the spirit alive within all of us.  I rate this one 9/10.",

What more can you ask for from a Christmas film? It was a fitting tribute to the peerless Jim Henson, whose son Brian did a fantastic job directing the film.Michael Caine is excellent as Scrooge and he takes the role as seriously as if it was a more conventional adaptation of the Dickens classic. When it comes to family / children's films and TV series, some actors see it as an excuse to go over the top but Caine is too experienced and talented to make that mistake. It's a shame that my three favourite Muppets - Fozzie, Miss Piggy and Kermit - all had much less screen time than usual but they were all very well used. The Christmas Present and Christmas Yet to Come scenes in the Cratchit home were definitely my favourites. The latter could hardly have been more heartfelt if it had involved humans instead of pigs and frogs. Paul Williams wrote some fantastic songs for the film.

This film shouldn't really work, and certainly shouldn't still be so very watchable, but it does, and it is.Caine's Ebenezer Scrooge is perfection - not ever does Caine's characterization slip, and the very believability of Dickens' Yuletide creation is preserved. Never once does Caine misstep, and his Scrooge is one of the most memorable from the second half of the 20th Century film portrayals. What could - and almost certainly would - have been kitchy and campy and trite in another thespian's hands instead brings the genuine fear and discomfort of the original literary tale. Even with a musical number at the end that feels like it should be cringe-worthy, Caine's Scrooge never really is.The songs are, of course, as much characters in the film as the muppets themselves - memorable and catchy, these tunes are all a reminder of Dickens' purpose in writing 'A Christmas Carol': that ignoring the harsh realities of the lives of the less fortunate, particularly children, will result in inescapable moral corruption.At turns sad, funny, joyous, and genuinely moving, 'The Muppet Christmas Carol' is a family-friendly retelling of Dickens' classic cautionary Christmas tale that ticks all the right boxes, deserving to be watched year on year in the days leading up to Christmas.",

But before he died, he 'told' my father (he could barely speak at that time but his gestures meant enough) to buy us a Christmas present from the money he was clutching in his hand. With that money, my father bought us this video: The Muppet Christmas Carol.It would be the last time in seven years my family would celebrate Christmas (this year is the first time in all these years we are trying it again, and so far so good) But every year, I'd go through my closet and watch this movie. I didn't know this was the first Muppet feature since Jim Henson's death... but as this movie was a tribute to the genius, The Muppet Christmas Carol is for me a tribute to my grandpa.And still, after all these years, I still love this movie with all my heart. It's truly a classic, it's inventive, it's funny, it's moving, at times heart-wrenching, always entertaining and touching. I have loved Michael Caine since his portrayal of Scrooge and I still think it is one of his more phenomenal performances. The transformation his character goes through in the tale, he portrays masterfully, and in the beginning of the movie you hate him, during the movie and the journey he takes through his past, present and future you feel for him and at the end you love him, like everybody else. The Muppets are as adorable as always, and I LOVED the family Kermit and Miss Piggy formed together. I will always love Tiny Tim. I will always love this movie.Just my two cents worth: see The Muppet Christmas Carol with the entire movie. It's a great, classic tale for all ages.",

Those familiar with the original story as well as countless other versions known that the story itself is a pretty dark one with some extremely violent moments that would make one seem inappropriate for children. There's even a joke by one of the Muppet's about it being too dark for kids but we then get a funny bit on the importance of the story. I'm sure some might complain that the really dark moments have been tamed down way too much but I guess these people didn't realize the word \"Muppet\" when they hit play. Overall this is an extremely entertaining version of the story and you can't help but smile when you see someone like Caine playing with the Muppet's. There are many very good scenes including, of course, the ending where Scrooge finally makes good to Bob Cratchit who is played by Kermit here. Fans of the Muppets are going to get a real kick out of seeing their favorite characters getting to play the part of famous people from the story. Some of the highlights are of course Kermit but we also get Fozzie Bear doing Fozziewig and who better than Gonzo and Rizzo to play hosts? I think the film made the right choice in letting the Muppets work their way around Caine who is the main star here. I think Caine does a very good job with the part and especially when you consider this is a kids movie and he wasn't allowed to go as far or as dark as some of the previous versions. It appears that the actor is having fun with his fake friends and it also seems as if he's in on the joke and willing to substitute some of the darker moments for lighter ones. I think some of the music is forgettable and there's a tad bit too much slapstick that gets in the way of the story but overall this is a pleasant little film that's perfect for the holidays.",

            "content": "The Muppet Christmas Carol is an unlikely match made in Heaven; a strange little miracle of the kind that comes only at Yuletide.Who could've thought that the Muppets -- known, at the time, for summoning the goofiest sides of celebrity guests like Mark Hamill and Julie Andrews -- would be able to faithfully re-tell Charles Dickens' immortal tale (even making improvements and welcome expansions in some areas), while retaining their wacky charm, and cast Michael Caine as one of the best screen versions of Ebenezer Scrooge of all time? Well, someone did, and somehow they were right on the money.Now, at 30 years of age, recently remastered in 4K, and with its extended cut finally available on Disney+, the picture still holds up and still supplies the right level of drama, horror, warmth, and Dickens-ian prose on one hand, and just enough puppet cheekiness the other. The only time that it breaks the fourth wall in a bona fide Muppet Show sort of way -- in that the production the Muppets are putting on, in this case A Christmas Carol, visibly gets out of control -- is when the Great Gonzo, who \"plays\" Dickens and guides us through the story alongside \"Rizzo the Rat as Himself\", needs to pull Sam the Eagle aside after he boasts that \"business is the American way\", reminding him that the show they're doing right now is set in London.The film, of course, stars several other Muppets, including Kermit the Frog as Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as Mrs. Cratchit, Fozzie the Bear as Fozziwig (because of course), Staler and Waldorf as the Marleys (Jacob is joined by a Robert Marley; I trust you get the joke), Robin the Frog as Tiny Tim, and a few others in bit parts -- all, in turn, performed by the likes of Frank Oz, Steve Whitmire, Dave Goelz, and other Henson Studio A-listers. At the center is Caine as Scrooge, and what a Scrooge he is!Too many jokes have already been made about the gravity of his performance; the devotion with which he realizes this classic literary figure; the earnestness with which orates to Kermit the Frog. The only other human actor to treat Kermit so seriously as a colleague is Orson Welles, but that was only for a few seconds.The story... do I even need to tell you? It's A Christmas Carol, one of the best Christmas stories ever penned and one of the earliest novels to feature time travel (and, to this day, one of the best and most poignant usages of such a device). Loathed by everyone in town, even his jovial nephew, for being a \"skinflint\" who \"charges folks a fortune for his dark and drafty houses\" (to quote the first song in the film), callous miser Scrooge returns home the night before Christmas, is haunted by the Marleys, and informed that three Spirits will visit him for reasons that aren't clear.Through the night, Scrooge is reminded of the past, made cognizant of the present, and warned of the future. As noted, all of this is as faithful as any Disney-Muppet variation of the tale could possibly be; not just the gloriously straight-faced performance of Caine or the accurate dialogue, but the details of the production design -- from the atmospheric sets and the way those sets are shot to the ominous lighting of a simple clock automaton tolling 2 for the next spirit's arrival. When I say that this film is bright and dark -- hot and cold -- in all the right places, I am also speaking of the image.Released shortly after the death of Muppet creator Jim Henson and his frequent collaborator Richard Hunt, the movie is dedicated to their memory and, alas, sidelines a few of the characters (sans Kermit, of course) that Henson would always voice, including Dr. Teeth and Rowlf the Dog. It is directed by Jim Henson's son, Brian Henson, and features all the intricate puppetry and direction you'd expect, replete with the aforementioned Victorian sets that seem believable despite discernably being sets. (The film successfully creates the illusion that these houses are lived-in; it probably helps that each set is populated by up to 20 puppets at once, themselves clearly fake yet convincingly alive.)Among the puppets, my favorite may be the full-body suit of The Ghost of Christmas Present -- who also constitutes one of the better alterations from the book. In giving him a short memory and habit of repeating himself, the film underscores how all he knows is the present. \"My mind is filled with the here and now\", he chortles as he greets Scrooge.Indeed there are some changes, but none that disrespect the original story or miss its essence. This includes the decision to make it into a musical. Some of the song numbers, namely the haunting yet catchy \"Marley and Marley\", are written well enough that Dickens himself could have penned them (the song does use the phrase \"captive, bound and double-ironed\" to describe the Marleys' fate on the Other Side, just as Jacob Marley spoke of his own prison in the book).For all the humor in the movie, the material is taken seriously at every turn. The closest thing we get to something that feels spoof-y is, again, Gonzo telling Sam to stay on script and Rizzo routinely asking why this story has to be so scary. (\"That was some scary stuff. Should we be worried about the kids in the audience?\" \"It's alright. It's culture.\") As we get to the third act and are pulled into the dismal future by the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come (who is a decidedly unsettling specter in this version, designed like a mute Ringwraith), Rizzo and Gonzo know to leave the story entirely, even bidding the audience farewell until the epilogue. Before you know it, you'll be bawling your eyes out as the truth of sickly Tiny Tim -- as played by a green piece of fabric -- becomes too real to ignore.I mentioned before that an extended cut exists. Almost every version of the film -- bar the VHS release and the version I saw on TV when I saw the movie for the first time -- excludes a song number from Scrooge's old flame Belle, heard while he's visiting the past, being shown the Christmas that irrevocably broke his heart. The song, called \"When Love is Gone\", was cut for supposedly halting the pacing and being altogether superfluous. But erasing the song ruins the impact of the final song (which is actually a reprise; a merry version of a sad piece) and weakens the emotion of the segment. Hearing the song in full, as Disney+ now permits, also better explains why Rizzo is blubbering at the end of the scene. Furthermore, it's one of the best-staged numbers in the whole thing; the bit where Old Scrooge joins in a duet with Belle, who can't see or hear him, is beautifully done.In any case, I intend to keep arguing that this is an unsurpassed adaptation of this book. It knows when to make us laugh like only these critters know how and when to tug at our heartstrings and rethink ourselves the way this story always should. Its songs range from jolly and memorable to tear-jerking, it looks wonderful (maybe not as technically impressive as, say, The Dark Crystal or Labyrinth, but it doesn't need to be), it supplies a grade-A central performance, and it translates these characters in fun, imaginative ways. (I've already praised the designs of the final two ghosts, but the unearthly agelessness of The Ghost of Christmas Past is inspired also.)So yes, when you hear someone make the case that this or that version of A Christmas Carol -- be it the 1984 TV movie, the 1970 musical, this crap, or any of the silent films -- is actually the best one, ask them: \"But did that one have The Muppets?\"",

            "content": "\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" is a 1992 musical drama directed by Brian Hanson starring Michael Caine and Kermit the Frog.\n\u26aa\nAll in all, the Muppets' take on Charles Dickens' classic carol dusts off and converts the iconic story into a lovely musical that knows to tackle both the affectionate as well as the dramatic aspects of it, without ever losing its light-heartedness, and thanks to a phenomenal leading performance by Michael Caine as Scrooge as well as the puppets, wonderfully composed and catchy original songs and a sensitive narration, it becomes an atmospheric, marvellously crafted and child-friendly adaptation that resurrects the values of the tale successfully.\n\u26aa\nI have seen it dozens of times in the past, but this time was still some sort of a novelty, as it was the first time revisiting it after having read the original novelette. To my astonishment, this production here did a phenomenal job adapting the story, for almost everything is done superbly. The book itself was a fine piece of literature, even if it is not the most complex and brilliantly crafted novels, it works out well enough. It is atmospheric, positively edifying and excellently capturing the essence of the holiday. It is a classic for a reason, and hence I think that every child in the world should be exposed to it in some form at least once in a lifetime. Fortunately, there were Brian Hanson and his colleagues, and what they did roughly thirty years ago is absolute magic. In their charmingly iconic way, they turned it into a Muppet musical, and despite this being an undeniably bold undertaking, it works out marvellously well. Michael Caine, one of the few human actors, plays the infamous miser superbly and knows to navigate around his puppet co-stars like it was the most natural thing. Like with many of the Muppet films, it is the perfect balance of humans and puppets that define the film's inimitable charm. However, it isn't the acting that makes this adaptation so excellent, it is the narration. Dickens' story has some undeniably creepy and gruesome undertones that I thought were too heavy for a film aimed at children, but since I wasn't apparently the only one thinking this way, it displays the changes that were necessary. To preserve the way it is narrated in the novel, Gonzo plays Charles Dickens aka the narrator, and by his side is Rizzo the Rat playing himself. The thing is, through this fourth wall breaking narration as well as the occasional jokes, the film is always relieved and maintains its overall light-heartedness. The two are the comic relief it needs to be child appropriate, and I think that is downright clever. Aside from them, I think that some scenes from the source material I deemed to be either too long or too heavy were altered and on many occasions, even improved. Seriously, it rarely happens that an adaptation is superior to its original source, but here we are. Furthermore, there are the lovely and marvellously composed original songs that make it even more lovely. None of them feels corny or pointless, they fit the scenario perfectly every single time. Even my brother, an avowed opponent of singing in films, thinks that they songs are delightful, and I assure you, this is an unquestionable compliment! Honestly, this adaptation is near-perfect. It has a distinct atmosphere, knows to tackle all the emotions it needs to tackle and honour its source material. Even though it cannot be proved, I think Charles Dickens would have liked this production. In the end, it is even my favourite adaptation of matter, and it has proved me once again.",

I cannot name a single failure in his career. This is one of his greatest performances, as well... and it is truly an honor to appear alongside Muppets, I imagine.The film is available in two versions: theatrical widescreen, and extended full-screen. I suggest the widescreen, not only because the picture is better, but because the only scene cut is of a woman singing, and her song and voice are not high points whatsoever.The DVD is worth owning for the special features.

In this version, we are taken to 19th Century London like any other \"Christmas Carol\" only this time, we have those adorable Muppets to keep us company with the humans. Playing Scrooge is the great Michael Cain who not only gives one his best performances here but is also one of the best Scrooges of all time. He can be both gruff and mean but when it comes to those emotional scenes, well, if your not crying or on the verge of crying, then your not human. In particular, the scene with Scrooge in the graveyard is probably the most powerful one in any of the \"Christmas Carol\" versions and believe me I've seen quite a few \"Christmas Carols\". However, its not all gloom for there is plenty of comedy and good songs that one can find in any of the Muppet movies while at the same time, for the most part, the makers do a good job of keeping true to Charles Dicken's work. Kermit the Frog plays Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as his irritable wife, Statler and Waldorf as Jacob and Robert Marley (nothing but praise for those two in that dual role) and Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat as the film's narrators. Plus, you can find all your other favorite Muppet characters spread through out the movie. In short, this is a movie that both kids and adults can enjoy and anyone who says different, well, they have to be a Scrooge themselves.

It is really heartwarming and delivers the story and its moral well and it's filled with great songs and fun characters.Michael Caine is a great perfect Scrooge, he plays the classic character wonderfully without overacting, something that other famous or non-famous actors in Muppet movies always tend to do. Also the Muppet's themselves deserve credit, they yet again show their great acting skills. Robin the Frog might very well be the best and most heartwarming Tiny Tim of movie history.The music by Miles Goodman and the songs by Paul Williams are surprising good. The movie is filled with great sing-a-long songs like a good Disney movie from the 90's also had.The movie is an enjoyment to watch for both children and adults. It's a wonderful way for children to get familiar with the classic Dickens story. It's fun but heartwarming and effective as well without forcing it.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "A Christmas Carol is famous for good reasons, but the Muppet adaptation is superior to all versions past and future. Caine insisted on playing the role as if he were opposite real actors and not Muppets and it works so well. His performance comes across as heartfelt and sincere as he slowly metamorphoses from the tight-fisted skinflint to a man he becomes. The Muppets fill the secondary role beautifully and the joke both subtle and obvious, helping to tell the story. I don't give out 10's willy-nilly but this deserves 10 out of 10 (more really). If you haven't watched this version of the classic. DO IT and thank me later.",

As a lifelong Muppets fan, I anxiously awaited this film when it opened, just to see them back in action after the death of their creator.  \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" is a satisfying experience for old-school fans; it seems less zany and adventurous than the earlier films, but still includes quite a bit of the old Muppet chaos.  It seems to me a cautious re-entry into the movies--kind of a resassurance to fans that things will get better.  Argue with me if you like, but I think there are moments of this film that are very touching.  The Christmas Yet-to-Come sequence is done better in this film than in any other version of the tale, and Kermit's incredibly moving farewell to \"Tiny Tim\" is the perfect farewell to Jim Henson.",

The notorious miser and moneylender Scrooge on Christmas Eve is warned by the ghosts of late business partners, Jacob and Robert Marley. He must change his ways or carry the eternal chains forever of what he has sowed in his present life on earth.Scrooge is visited by the spirits of the Christmas Past, Present, and Future who show him the errors of his way. Bob Cratchit and his wife are played by Kermit and Miss Piggy with the touching story of Tiny Tim.There are several songs in the film but they are not so memorable. Due to the nature of the story many of the normal Muppets are sidelined because Scrooge is the central character.The film underwhelmed at the box office when the film was released in the cinema. Over time it has become more appreciated by families in the festive period as heartwarming with the underlying Muppet humour.

It runs for slightly over 80 minutes and has some good parts, some not so good. First of all, Michael Caine is a brilliant actor and he shows it here as well. I would almost say he is too good for the part. Really strong performance that carries the film from start to finish. The Muppets I am usually not the biggest fan of and here they worked well sometimes and sometimes not so much. But as this one is especially for younger audiences, they are absolutely needed for the comic relief away from the dramatic, sometimes creepy story. I also enjoyed the music in here. In terms of emotional impact, this was only partly a success. Probably the loud and boastful Miss Piggy will take heart and feeling out of almost everything. And a little Kermit as Tiny Tim (one of the emotional highlights of the tale usually) is not working particularly well either. I enjoyed this one the most when it's humans only that we see, although I also liked for example the part when one of the gang climbs over an incredibly high fence with all his effort and shows us right afterward that he can easily get in right through the fence. As a whole, a decent watch for the holidays and if you like the Muppets in general, unlike me, you will probably appreciate this one even more than I did. Recommended.",

Gonzo (as Dickens) and Rizzo the Rat narrate the tale and tend to interrupt the flow of proceedings, whilst Kermit, voiced by Steve Whitmire (not Jim Henson, who died two years earlier), just doesn't sound like the frog we know and love.The whole affair is rather sedate considering this is a Muppet movie and I found myself struggling to stay awake towards the end.

            "content": "Following on from The Muppet Movie, The Muppets Take Manhattan and The Great Muppet Caper, this is Jim and Brian Henson's puppet version of the famous Charles Dickens story, \"A Christmas Carol\". It is a story done many times for stage and screen, and this version is pretty faithful to the source material, though inevitably it does make simplifications in order to accommodate its intended juvenile audience. Michael Caine is a perfect choice for Ebenezer Scrooge and holds the film together well (not easy, I'm sure, when you're a living, breathing actor surrounded by furry puppets!)In Victorian London, miserly counting house boss Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine) looks on in disgust as the citizens merrily prepare for Christmas. Since youth-hood, Scrooge has despised Christmas and what he deems to be the frivolity and excessive generosity associated with it. One of Scrooge's employees, Bob Crachit (Kermit The Frog), asks for time off on Christmas Day to be with his family, and is begrudgingly given it by his sour employer. However, Scrooge is visited later that night by the ghosts of his now-deceased partners Jacob and Robert Marley (Statler and Waldorf). They warn him that he needs to change his ways or else he faces eternal damnation. More ghosts visit him through the night in an attempt to show him the error of his ways. Firstly, the Ghost of Christmas Past who forces Scrooge to relive some of his acts of cruelty from Christmases gone by; secondly, the Ghost of Christmas Present, who shows Scrooge how his mean nature affects those around him; and thirdly, the Ghost of Christmas Future, who allows Scrooge a terrifying and heart-breaking glimpse of what will be if he continues to mistreat those he knows....The film is well-made and enjoyable in its simplistic way. Caine, as noted, is an outstanding choice for the Scrooge role. The production designs are also first-rate, including some well-designed wintry Victorian streets and some excellent interiors. There are a few things about the film that I find rather irritating, though, and as a result I've knocked my rating down to a 6. The linking device, which uses Gonzo as narrator Charles Dickens and saddles him a very unfunny sidekick called Rizzo the Rat, seems both unnecessary and heavy-handed. Also disappointing is the lack of screen time given to some of our favourite muppet characters. True enough, Kermit gets plenty of time as Bob Cratchit, but muppet legends like Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, the Animal, and Statler & Waldorf disappear from the action all too quickly. The central storyline here follows Scrooge, and since Scrooge is played by the human Caine, the muppets are reduced to brief guest roles.... and THAT seems a bit of a cheat when it is supposed to be a muppet movie. This is a worthwhile film and a nice, easy introduction to the story for viewers too young to read the book, but somehow I cant help thinking that it could have been better.",

The movie, considering its stars, is surprisingly faithful to Charles Dickens novel, Michael Caine turns in a brilliant performance as Ebeneezer Scrooge, one who wouldn't look out of place in any version of the story. The other characters from the novel played by the Muppet's, Bob Cratchit and his family, Jacob Marley etc are really well done, and don't diverge from the original novel too much, and including Charles Dickens himself as narrator was a clever touch as it gave my favourite Muppet character Gonzo a role which 'he' did really well, as was bringing in Jacob Marley's brother so Statler and Waldorf could essentially play themselves, hilariously. The three ghosts, past present and future are all well done, maybe the Ghost of Christmas Present was a bit too jolly as the character is really serious under his jolly persona. The Ghost of Christmas Future is one of the few times this character has been portrayed correctly, with more emphasis on subtlety and less emphasis on fear, as was that scene when Scrooge realizes the consequences of his actions, and scene of the death of Tiny Tim was genuinely moving when the Cratchits are on the verge of tears, you can see the sorrow and sadness in the characters, not an easy task when working with puppets. The music numbers help to move the story along and add to the story, again, no easy task when dealing with classical literature. This adaptation of Charles Dickens classic novel is well done, very faithful and just plain enjoyable for all the family, not just children, even if you haven't read the novel, a perfect place to start for children to enjoy classic literature.",

Never condescending, the story remains true to the original, and the humorous elaborations never seem obtrusive (best line, from Scrooge's clerks: 'please, Mr. Scrooge, our assets are frooooozen!'). These beloved characters who have worked their way into our hearts - Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Fozzy, and the rest - are a delight to watch. My only reservation, as has been noted by others, is that we could have skipped the songs, especially if Caine had to sing them. He does a very creditable Scrooge here, but a crooner he ain't. None the less, this will become a Christmas classic.",

            "content": "Quite possibly the most beloved Muppet movie of my friends circle, this is an absolutely barn storming take on the Dickens classic. Every element of this screams class. Even from the opening shot as the camera pans over a model of Victorian London crafted to a level of detail I'd expect from some modelling fetishist you know that you are in very safe hands. With Gonzo taking on the role of Charles Dickens and Rizzo the rat taking on the role of Rizzo the Rat, the pair act as our guides through want is one of the most charming Christmas movies I know.Trying to talk about this film is like trying to decide which packet from a box of Options to have first. It's all so good! OK\u0085 The music. I'll start with the music. From the opening number (Scrooge) we're treated to hearty, well written tunes that you can join in with by the second chorus. It's genuinely difficult to highlight a stand out number as they are all utterly charming. From Statler and Waldorf as Jacob and Robert Marley, to Scrooge regaling us with 'Thankful Heart' via the Ghost of Christmas Present singing 'It Feels Like Christmas' every song is fantastic. Disclaimer: That's not actually true. In the original cinematic release and the VHS version there is a song sung by young Scrooge and Belle called 'When Love is Gone'. While it still exists on the closing credits \u2013 in a inferior version sung by Martina McBride \u2013 it has been cut from the widescreen DVD release. OK, the song wasn't great, but I don't agree with the cut, mostly because now the scene is rather jarring, with Belle rather softly accusing Scrooge of no longer loving her and then suddenly departing, leaving Rizzo in tears. It feels like the hack job it is.Golly I hate finding flaws in this film, so lets move onto the acting. Pleasingly it's mostly the Muppets here, but with them is Michael Caine as the man himself: Scrooge. Now it might be easy to forget that, back in 1992, Sir Michaels career hadn't exactly been shining for the past decade. In fact he had been in some tosh and hadn't really done himself any favours with his performances. However this movie was, far and away, his best in ten years. He is stupendous! Something else great that this movie does is make Tiny Tim likable. I don't know about you but in most versions of a Christmas Carol I just want to punch the kid. They are normally either not that tiny, or to young to give a convincing performance and, no matter what, I almost always feel sorry for the other Cratchet children as they are forgotten in favour of their saintly brother. But because in this version Tim is a Muppet well\u0085 it's OK! It actually works! Though I do get frustrated when I see the Cratchets living in a nicer house than I have\u0085 This movie is a crafted piece of Christmas merriment. With so much going on in each shot you do not get board with repeated viewing, a 'must' for an annual favourite, it stays fairly true to the book, which again is good as, in my opinion, if you're going to start messing around with a work of genius you want to be *really* sure you can improve on it. And finally, like a favourite Christmas jumper, this film will warm and comfort you and is guaranteed to put you in that Yule spirit. Watch it.",

            "content": "Perhaps that title \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" is a bit of a misnomer as this is, really, \"A Christmas Carol (with Muppets)\". This is an adaptation of Charles Dickens' novella first, a Muppet film second. Take Michael Caine's fantastic performance as evidence of this - at no point does his Scrooge acknowledge that he's talking to a puppet. Every creature that he comes across, be they felt or flesh, are simply characters within the story. Or, how about the fact that Miss Piggy, one of the most famous of all Muppets, doesn't appear until about half-way through the film - or that she and Fozzie only appear in two or three scenes?It's a risky but, ultimately, completely successful choice as The Muppet Christmas Carol is a wonderful film from start to finish, perfectly encapsulating the tone of the novella. The Muppet comedy is left to Gonzo (as \"Charles Dickens\") and Rizzo, but even they sit out the \"Christmas Yet to Come\" sequences in respect to the tone. The songs are also very good, with \"Mr Scrooge\", \"One More Sleep Till Christmas\" and \"It Feels Like Christmas\" being the particular highlights. It would be remiss of me to not mention \"When Love is Gone\", the films's love-song which was cruelly cut from the cinematic release, restored for the VHS, occasionally found its way to DVD and is cut again for the Blu-ray. Yes, it's slow and may make kids restless. No, it doesn't feature any muppets. But if any film sells the torment that Scrooge feels when he thinks of his lost love Belle, it's this one. I can think of very few sanctioned cuts that damage a film so severely.In adaptation terms, the film is also surprisingly faithful and I can think of only two missteps. The first is the absence of Christmas Past scenes showing Scrooge's unhappy relationship with his father and his sister Fan's attempts to fix this. The second is, during the Christmas Present scenes where we see nothing of Nephew Fred saying anything particularly sentimental about Ebeneezer and instead simply skip to Fred making fun of him.But these are minor nitpicks- and cannot dent a film that has so much heart. If it's not making you laugh, it's making you cry. And when I watch this film every Christmas Eve (be that the ones in the past, the present or those yet to come), it prepares me perfectly for the festive season. If you want a truly faithful adaptation, I recommend the 1984 TV film starring George C.Scott. If you want one of the best family movies of all time, go for this.8/10 for the cut version, 9/10 for the version with \"When Love Is Gone\".",

Most of this is down to Michael Cane - his performance is just perfect; I genuinely believe this to be his finest.

Muppet fans may have a problem that Fozzie Bear only has a small role as Fozziwigs, but it's a good role. Brian Henson directs this movie wonderfully, and even though all the muppets don't have actual roles, he gives them nice cameos. Dr.Teeth and the electric Mayhem show up as Fozziwigs band, with Animal on the triangle. Lew Zealand shows up as a fish salesman. Even Jim's favorite puppet Rowlf shows up for a small, but nice cameo where he joyfully plays the piano. I recommend it, but it is boring. It's too slow for small kids and for adults.

            "content": "This time we got our very own Muppet version of the Dickens' classic about the ole skinflint, his miserable view of the Christmas season, and how he gets a good talking to by three ghosts that visit him during the night/early morn before Christmas Day. Michael Caine makes Ebenezer Scrooge his own, hitting all the right notes from how he begins as a grouchy, ill moneylender gradually eroded of his negativity when facing his past as a child neglected, gaining affection upon meeting his former fianc\u00e9 at his old employer, seeing how he is viewed by his nephew, nephew's friends and family and Cratchet's family, and facing the potential of his own demise. As far as the Muppets go, all the favorites are here and accounted for: Gonzo as the \"narrator, Charles Dickens\" with Rizzo, the rat, as his companion, Kermit as Bob Cratchet, Miss Piggy as Kermit's wife, Statler and Waldorf as \"the Marleys\", Dr. Bunsen and Beaker as street charity merchants, Fozzy as Fezziewig (named Fozziwig for the adaptation), with the likes of Animal, Swedish chef, and Rolf appearing in bit parts as Scrooge journeys from one time of his life to another. The lavish production design of the city and some excellent camera-work following different walks throughout London as Scrooge makes his way to his place of business to his home (and then the ghosts carrying him from one era of his life to another) are definite highlights, while the heavily criticized Williams' songs weren't that bad to me I didn't exactly consider them the success of the film. Caine does have his own led song at the end when he is converted from the crippling rot of seasonal angst to joyfully celebratory charitable delight\u0085he does show that transition from beginning to end as only a seasoned pro could. It is fun to see Kermit as Cratchet although the Tiny Tim part of the story that typically guarantees Niagara Falls for some reason just seems lacking this go-around. Piggy reacting to Scrooge on Christmas Day while he's trying to tell Kermit about his raise is one of my favorite scenes, although I thought Gonzo and Rizzo steal every moment they're on screen, (which are far more than I had anticipated) and are one of the main reasons to seek this out during the Holiday season. Another highlight: a younger Statler and Waldorf mocking Fozziewig from an upper floor balcony at his company party during the trip to Christmas Present. Caine wisely doesn't camp it up with the Muppets as Scrooge, deciding to play the character straight. A London filled with Muppets in a Dickens Christmas Carol, especially at the beginning and end with Scrooge first grim and glum then later blissful and bright makes the world a better place. I recommend this adaptation for early December viewing, as kind of a starter for the more serious and dramatic versions later in the month. Gonzo and Rizzo following along with us during Scrooge's trips keeps the tone light and slapstick alive; they certainly add some fun to the proceedings.",

            "content": "A likable version of the familiar story: a collaboration between Walt Disney Productions (who had already tackled the Charles Dickens classic in 1983; see my review of MICKEY'S Christmas CAROL) and the Jim Henson company, with most of the characters 'played' by the latter's popular Muppet figures (Kermit The Frog is Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy is Mrs. Cratchit, Fozzie Bear Mr. Fezziwig, etc.). interestingly, here we get two Marleys for the price of one \u0096 'played' by Waldorf and Statler, the old guys in the balcony from TV's THE MUPPET SHOW \u0096 but also The Great Gonzo as Dickens himself, who recounts the tale to a skeptical Rizzo The Rat! Defeating competition from the likes of David Hemmings, Ron Moody and David Warner, Scrooge, then, is played by Michael Caine, who does well enough as the reformed miser, though he doesn't bring anything particularly novel to the role; indeed, the script seems to be drawing most on the definitive 1951 SCROOGE and the 1970 musical version of the same name \u0096 this too, in fact, has a number of songs (the work of Paul Williams, written in his typically upbeat and catchy style).While the film does fall somewhat in the trap of not delivering enough of Scrooge or enough of The Muppets (Miss Piggy's role, for instance, would be much bigger in a more typical effort), it's generally enjoyable with a fair number of funny bits: the very opening scene with a number of aristocrats patting themselves on the back for a great supper thinking on what they should do next and one of them suggests they have lunch; Rizzo thanking Dickens/Gonzo for making him a part of the story (even if only to clean the outer window of Scrooge's office!); Scrooge's terrified employees transforming themselves instantly into sun-loving beach-goers when the former complains about their overconsumption of coal; the charity-seeking carol-singer in whose face Scrooge shuts his door is later shown freezing out in the street; etc. Ironically, from what I recall of the various versions of the story I've watched, this one provides the most satisfactory depiction of the Ghost Of Christmas Present {he's even given the film's best song!); incidentally, Caine does a unremarkable bit of singing himself. Furthermore, checking on the IMDb just now, I learned that the version I watched is missing a song! P.S. As I had written in my review of the 1935 SCROOGE, I was supposed to watch a good seven adaptations of \"A Christmas Carol\" during this festive season \u0096 but, for various reasons, I could only make it up to four...",

            "content": "Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol' is probably the most adapted story of all time, wiggling its way into all genres and audience generations. There have been straight adaptations, comedic adaptations, scary adaptations, meta adaptations and, even, musical adaptations. Possibly the strangest of them all is this, 'The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992)'. For the most part, the piece is a straight-forward, rather faithful adaptation of the oft-adapted story, with lead actor Michael Caine acting as if he's in an acclaimed, 'Royal Shakespeare Company' stage-play. He gives maybe one of the best performances of his career, conveying Scrooge's through-the-wringer journey with confidence and conviction. The thing is that he's partnered up with puppets, most of whom also act with similarly sincere intentions. The juxtaposition of man and Muppet isn't played for comedy. Of course, there is the occasional bit of background slapstick and the odd musical number, but it tends to just blend in with the established, not-at-all-watered-down tone or, worse, seem sort of misjudged. The most unmistakably 'Muppety' element is the narration by Gonzo (as Charles Dickens himself), but even this uses the novel's proper prose and feels oddly redundant. Thankfully, Gonzo and his little rat companion do add some personality to the piece, their banter being fun if not exactly funny. When it comes down to it, the picture is a solid adaptation of Dickens' Christmas classic. It doesn't really set itself apart, despite featuring the Muppets, which does give it an unexpected staleness, principally because the tale has been told so many times before. If this is your first 'Christmas Carol', you'll probably get more out of it. It'll help if you're a massive Muppets fan, too. 6/10",

At the time, I loved their original stories and wasn't pleased when they took on other fables, like 'A Christmas Carol in Prose, Being a Ghost- Story of Christmas' or this movie's follow-up, 'Treasure Island.' I thought this was just okay back then.Insert Present Day Me, or in 1992-3 Me's case, Me Yet to Come (wait, that sounded weird\u0085) and this movie isn't just harmless, it's cute, hilarious for all the inserted perfect Muppet humor and knows how to stick to the original source while intergrading basically a kids play.

There have been much more complicated puppets made since, with much more articulation and much more work gone into the face manipulation - but here the craft is so accomplished that you can feel for Kermit, even though he doesn't even have eyelids.The songs are good, as are the performances. Michael Caine made absolutely the right choice to play everything with a straight bat and treat the Muppets as if they were ordinary people. It doesn't shy too far away from the less family friendly aspects of the story, the deaths of certain characters and the horrors of the ghost of Christmas yet to come.

            "review_title": "No bah humbug here! Muppet Christmas Carol is the real deal. A good movie.",
            "content": "The Muppet Christmas Carol is a classic Disney movie that lives up to a lot of the other adaptations of Charles Dickens 'Christmas Carol'. It's better than some others Christmas Carols movies. This movie was the first film released after the deaths of Muppets creator Jim Henson and fellow puppeteer Richard Hunt. While the film didn't have any Sesame Street or much Fraggle Rock characters. It's probably the best Muppet movies ever because it focus on a main human character first, rather than the Muppets first right. Rather than playing themselves in the film, the film mixed their Muppet characteristic to that of the characters of the book, with negative and positive result. I just couldn't get behind, Gonzo the Great (voice by Dave Goelz) as Charles Dickens, the author and narrator for this film. Yet, I can see Kermit the Frog (voice by Steve Whitmire) as Bob Cratchit. I can see Fozzie Bear as Fozziwig. I have to say, for all the modern day adaptations, Michael Caine as Ebenezer Scrooge was amazing. He can give a great cold shoulder performance, while also having a bit of a charm to his character that makes you like him ever more. I'm glad, they didn't use a Muppet for this main character. Ebenezer is a surly money-lender who is more interested in profit than celebration Christmas. He treats his family, employees, and friends really horrible. Later that evening, Scrooge finds himself face to face with ghosts. Glad, again, they didn't use Miss Piggy, Scooter, & Gonzo as the ghost as well. Note the description of William Shakespeare's Hamlet passage in the beginning that foreshadows the entrance of the ghosts. I love the simplistic symbolism in this film with all the ghosts represent limits. The ghost visits all contain a distinct episode in Scrooge's spiritual re-education. The ghost of Jacob and Robert Marley AKA Statler and Waldorf Waldorf (voice by Dave Goelz & Jerry Nelson) is limited by his greedy sins, as his chains are forged of cashboxes, padlocks, ledgers, and steel purse. Dickens was particularly disgusted with the writings of an economist named Thomas Robert Malthus, a wealthy man, who wrote Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) that population growth would always outpace food supply resulting in unavoidable and catastrophic poverty and starvation. Dickens alludes to Malthus as Marley, when Scrooge echoes the economist's views on overpopulation in his rebuke of the portly gentlemen. The Ghost of Christmas Past might scare some little children, but I just can't help liking the visuals effects of this film. Ghost of Christmas Past (voiced by Jessica Fox), a childlike specter who takes Scrooge on a journey back through time to his youth is just beautiful to watch. Christmas past is limited by the darkness or negative thinking. The symbol of his light bright head cover by a cap represented optimistic thinking or the illuminating power of the mind. By covering his head with the cap, he limited himself. That is why some people believe that the Ghost of Christmas past is in fact, a young Scrooge whom allow negative thinking to seep in. The Ghost of Christmas Past also represents memory, and all the memories are that of Scrooge. So it does makes sense. I have to say, the film was missing the mention of Fan, Scrooge's sister that plays a big role in his childhood. I love the story of how Scrooge fell in love with Belle (Meredith Braun). Eventually, Scrooge and Belle break up due to Scrooge's obsession with money. While, the two don't share screen time too long; it's work as an emotional heartbreaking scene. Sadly the song 'When the Love is gone\" that works with this great scene was cut in some versions of this movie. It's a great song, and not having this song, makes it look like they jump an awful cut. I have to say, don't watch the versions that doesn't have this song as you'll be missing a big part of the back story. The Ghost of Christmas Present (voice by Jerry Nelson and Don Austen as: In-Suit Performer) was outstanding as the large, festive spirit with a booming voice who lives only for the here and now. He gives Scrooge a glimpse into the holiday celebration of others. The Christmas present ghost is limited by lifespan. He can only live on single day. He represent the central symbol of the Christmas ideal--generosity, goodwill, and celebration. It might be note that he was the late 19th century blueprints to what he think of now as Santa. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come was just scary, a silent entity who reveals the chilling grim future for Scrooge. He is pretty much the Grim Reaper. With A Christmas Carol, Dickens hopes to show how self-serving, insensitive people can be converted into charitable, caring, and socially conscious members of society through the intercession of moralizing quasi-religious lessons. By doing this, Dickens had to make a one-dimensional, representation of the plight of the poor with Tiny Tim (Robin the Frog). Dickens had every intention of tugging on your heartstrings with this tragic figure. Underlying the narrative and paralleling the more ostensible theme of moral redemption, lies an incisive political diatribe. Dickens takes aim at the Poor Laws then governing the underclass of Victorian England. He exposes the flaws of the unfair system of government that essentially restricts the underclass to life in prison or in a workhouse. The story also mirrors a lot of Dicken's younger life when his father was jailed. It was during this terrible period in Dickens' childhood that he observed the lives of the men, women, and children in the most impoverished areas of London and witnessed the social injustices they suffered that give him the idea. Overall: it's a good movie with good music, love nearly all the songs. The visuals are great. Acting was good. It's worth watching during Christmas.",

All the familiar elements are there, including Michael Caine as a thoroughly unscrupulous Scrooge, brought to learn the error of his ways by his encounters with the Ghosts of Christmas past, present and future. The familiar Muppet characters take on various roles: Kermit plays Bob Cratchit, with Miss Piggy as his surprisingly pliant wife; Stadtler and Waldorf play Scrooge's erstwhile partners, now living as the Ghosts of Christmas past; Fozzie Bear plays Fozziewig (Fezziwig in the Dickens text); Sam the Eagle has a fine time playing the Head Teacher of the Junior High School graduates. There are some nice in-jokes, such as the occasion when Sam the Eagle associates money-making with the Americans, but abruptly changes his line of dialogue when reminded he is acting in a British classic; now it's the Brits who are guilty. One of the shops seen in the final sequence where Scrooge bestows gifts to all is called Micklewhite's - a direct reference to Caine's real name. Miles Goodman's songs are catchy yet not exactly memorable; Caine at one point is forced to sing, which provides a few embarrassing moments.

I ain't into musicals, this isn't really one, but they do well here. Caine is convincing, as are the Muppets. This isn't the best of the Christmas carol adaptations. But it is a good one. There have been a hundred adaptations of A Christmas carol. Though The Muppets isn't the best, it is one of them. I give it a high rating because I love The Muppets and because I laugh a lot during this film. I like how,besides Scroge and his nephew and his friends, everyone in the town was a Muppet.

            "content": "This seems like a funny time of year to be watching a Christmas movie. As I write this, it's been over two months since the holiday last came around, winter is almost over, and the other three seasons will come and go before Christmas comes again. However, I didn't watch \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" because it's a Christmas movie. I watched it because it's the Muppets. I remember seeing at least some of this fourth silver screen Muppet movie, the first one made after the tragic death of creator Jim Henson, as a kid in the early '90s, but couldn't remember much of it at all. It was definitely well over ten years, probably over fifteen years, since I had last seen any of it before finally watching it all this month. Even out of season, it was still a good viewing.There are many celluloid versions of \"A Christmas Carol\", the famous story written by popular 19th century author Charles Dickens, but this one features the Muppets in the story. Gonzo plays Dickens himself and is the one who tells the story here, with Rizzo the Rat as his sidekick. The story is about greedy, selfish, mean-spirited businessman Ebenezer Scrooge in 19th century London, England who has a bad reputation in this city! It's Christmas Eve, and Scrooge does not believe in this holiday season, so one of his employees, Bob Cratchit (in the form of Kermit the Frog), has to tell him that the place won't get any business on Christmas Day in order to get the day off. After Scrooge arrives back home that night, before he goes to bed, he is soon haunted by the ghosts of Jacob and Robert Marley (Statler and Waldorf), his late former business partners who were a lot like him and are now shackled in the afterlife because of it! They tell him that he will suffer the same fate unless he changes his ways, and also tell him of three spirits who will come into Scrooge's bedroom late that night!This 1992 theatrical Muppet film is visually impressive with its cinematography, filming locations/sets, and special effects. Some of this shows right from the beginning, with overhead camera shots of what is supposed to be 19th century London here. Since it's the Muppets, one would likely expect a lot of laughs in this movie, and there certainly are those. A lot of them come from the Gonzo and Rizzo scenes. I think these two characters usually are funny, and there's no exception here, with their usual antics and many things that happen to them during the telling of the story. It was also a great idea to have Statler and Waldorf as the Marley Brothers. Even though Jim Henson wasn't around to take part in this film, and several Muppet voices had to be replaced after his death, the famous puppets still stand out as their lovable, funny selves here. They help carry the film, as usual. While Muppets are used for many of the characters in the story, some of the characters are played by on screen actors, including Scrooge, played by acting veteran Michael Caine. His performance as one of the many actors to portray the character in film history is definitely another highlight of \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\". As well as being funny, the movie also eventually becomes touching, and not all the scenes are for laughs.This Muppet version of \"A Christmas Carol\" says at the beginning that it's dedicated to the memory of Henson and Richard Hunt, another puppeteer who worked as a Muppet performer and whose life had also sadly come to a premature end by the time this movie was filmed and released. Henson had been deceased for over 2 \u00bd years by the time \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" came into theatres during the Christmas season of 1992, but they still managed to make another good film with the characters, and watching it this month made me feel like it honoured Henson, unlike the third theatrical Muppet movie made after his sad passing, the very disappointingly dreary \"Muppets From Space\". Some of the songs in this musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' book might be a LITTLE weak (though they're mostly pretty good, even if they're generally not classic), I didn't really care much for the version of the Spirit of Christmas Past here, and there may be other minor flaws, but all the positive aspects of the film make up for this, and make this holiday film an entertaining one for probably all ages.",

            "content": "In the eighteen years since its release I had never seen this film all the way through, until today. It is, of course the classic Charles Dickens tale told using the inimitable style of the Muppets. My thoughts later, here's a very brief summary first (summary haters please go & buy the biggest goose you can find while I write the next paragraph).This is the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a mean businessman who treats his staff very badly and is mean to everyone, even his own family. One Christmas Eve he is visited by the ghosts of his old partners, the Marley's. They warn him that he will be visited by three ghosts that night and urge him to change is ways or he will end up like them, in chains for all eternity. The Ghost of Christmas Past visits him first and he is taken back to his childhood to see the boy, and the young man, he was and he began to see what could have been. Next comes the Ghost of Christmas Present and he is taken to see his employee, Bob Cratchit and his family. One of Bob's sons, Tiny Tim is crippled, but has great spirit and this touches Scrooge deeply. Finally the Ghost of Christmas Future visits Scrooge and shows him what future awaits him if he doesn't change his ways. Will he take heed of the ghosts? Well, if you don't know I guess I'd better not spoil it for you.It's a pretty well made film with lots of comic moments thrown in courtesy of Gonzo the Great (as Charles Dickens), the narrator, and his sidekick, Rizzo the Rat. There are plenty of songs along the way too, these didn't do much for me, but I guess they have their place. I thought Michael Caine was excellent as Ebenezer Scrooge, but please don't sing on film again Mr Caine, it's not your best talent I'm afraid.Over all, a very engaging film with lots of familiar characters, some great comedy and a pretty decent Scrooge. It's not the best Christmas film ever made, but it is pretty entertaining and I enjoyed seeing the Muppets again! I liked the fact that they didn't stray too far from Dickens original story too, and so, recommended (but mostly for younger viewers).My score: 7.4/10",

            "review_title": "Timeless Muppets hit the high spots in cheerful classic",
            "content": "This movie gave Caine credence with a whole new market audience - the child / family one. Prior to this, Caine's movies weren't exactly family orientated, at least not for an age group below five, so this is a welcome addition. The 'story' needs no introduction, and as well as being a Christmas classic, has also been remade and redone countless times for the cinema. What will remain unique about this version without doubt are the muppets. I think the muppets still work well, despite advances Hollywood continues to make in terms of animation and new technology. There's just something unique about them and therefore they don't even fall between the two stools of Pixar and the classic Disney style. The muppets will forever remain timeless and a source of fixation for young children, essentially because the cleverness is having them appear in scenes opposite real life actors which gives them credibility and clout. So, what of this movie? Well, Caine is sufficiently nasty and cold hearted as bad old Ebeneezer, perhaps not as menacing as Jack Carter but distinctly unpleasant nevertheless. Caine himself has said in the past that the scripts that interest him the most are when the main character undergoes a huge change, so in that respect he wouldn't get a better one than this. Caine skilfully displays the changes needed, and he is a joy to watch. Unlike most Scrooges, Caine's post-ghost Scrooge is actually more convincing than the original, and his happiness in the final scenes of the movie are heart warming, and yes, he even tries his hand at singing, surely a first. There is also a delightful in-joke, as when Caine / Scrooge makes his way to Bob Cratchit's house on Christmas Day, he passes a shop called 'Micklewhites', which, was, of course, his original surname. Two final things I must share here. I recall when this was first shown on terrestrial television, the Radio Times movie review summed up its piece by using the phrase 'Caine hasn't been this good in ages'. Well, perhaps I am na\u00efve, but nearly twenty years later it was shown on television on Christmas Day and once again I came across the exact same review. I know I shouldn't really expect resident publication film critics to come up with different reviews time and again for movies that are on all the time (The Mummy anyone?), but it really did make me gasp. Well, I did say I was na\u00efve. Oh, and now for the second piece of sacrilege. It's Miss Piggy. Is it just me, or is anyone else irritated by this character? I nearly said 'her' but that would be falling into the trap. I'm talking about the countless times this 'creature' appears on chat shows and the audience and fellow guests whoop in faux delight, regularly claiming to be in the presence of a superstar. Er\u0085no. You're not. She / it is a puppet (ok, muppet). It isn't real! Get over it, and stop this ridiculous myth. I feel the same way about Dame Edna Everage (get over it, it's a bloke dressed up in womens clothes) and don't seem to find anyone prepared to share the same view.",

The title is a good indication of what viewers can expect from \"The Muppet Christmas Carol.\" Michael Caine is old miser Scrooge, who plays straight to a cast of everyone's favorite critters including Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, and the rest of the gang. He's visited by three angels on Christmas Eve who teach him the importance of the holiday and showing good will toward men.\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" isn't a bad movie. It's just another unnecessary re-telling of a classic Christmas tale. The concept of adapting Charles Dickens' short story and adding wacky characters or updating it was already played out even in 1992. I'm sure children will find it amusing, but their parents will be catching a quick nap amongst the tiny laughter.Michael Caine is absolutely perfect in the role of Scrooge. He pours his heart and soul into it. The fact that he is surrounded by Jim Henson's hand puppets doesn't affect his performance at all. As far as Caine's concerned, he's starring in a version of the famous tale surrounded by other Oscar-winning actors.The film provides good clean family entertainment for everyone. I'm sure it'll be and is considered essential viewing for many during the holiday season. Just don't expect the magic and wit you get when watching 2011's \"The Muppets.\"",

I still think Michael Caine makes a great Scrooge, the Muppets do genuinely add a new spin on this classic story, and I like a lot of the soundtrack, but above all else, this entire film is just so goddamn charming that if it doesn't at least put a little smile on your face, then...honestly what is actually wrong with you?Don't tell me you can actually stay completely straight-faced at virtually any scene with Kermit in it, or at the very end of the film, or when the Ghost of Christmas Present appears in Scrooge's house, or at least admit your heart is cold and black if you can.",

You see the main diference with that film is that Michael Caine dosn't play scrooge for Kids (Like tim Curry played Long John Silver in Treasure Island or all other human played in any other muppet movies  but play scrooge like in the book.Mikael Caine after that film you earned my respect,I was twelve when I whent to see this film and while I was watching it I didn't feel once that you were acting the part thinking I was a kid and it wasn't important giving your best to the role.He was great and the film was good mostly because of that,he acted so well around the muppet that you nearly forget that that his costars were mostly muppets. The humour was light and didn't take away from the story,which is a welcome change from space or treasure were the muppets are just too loud and crasy. Gonzo was at his best in that film and look more like the gonzo we love from the tv show than the moaning Alien (Horible idea that was to tell the world gonzo was an alien it was better when nobody knew what he was) you see in Muppets from Space.Ignore the other muppets film just watch this one.",

I mean, there are Muppets around the edges of this film, but Scrooge is not a Muppet, and only Jacob Marley is a Muppet. I have no idea what the Ghost of Christmas Past was, though.It is basically the plot of the Charles Dickens novel. Grumpy man is visited by ghosts that show him what a horrible man he is. He is horrified that he is a ghastly human being so on Christmas he changes into a very caring man giving everyone presents. Oh, by the way, Gonzo and Rizzle the Rat are narrating the movie and travel with Ebenezer Scrooge.Overall, this is a nice little cute version of a Christmas Carol. Also, I would like to point out that the Ghost of Christmas Past is unbelievably creepy, even more creepier than the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come. Also, Scrooge's appearance in this film is a good scene, with good music and good atmosphere. I thought this was supposed to be a musical, but there are only two or three songs in this movie.

            "content": "I am a big Muppet fan. One of my hobbies is collecting anything and everything that is Muppet, at least relating to \"The Muppet Show\". Naturally, I've seen all the mainstream Muppet films, and it's difficult for me to determine which one of them is the best. However, if \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" is not the best of the movies, it at least comes in second or third.There are so many things I like about \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" I really don't know where to start. For starters, I found from actually sitting down and reading Charles Dickens' story that this movie stays more true to the original book than other adaptations. Other movies, for instance, make the mistake of naming the last ghost to visit Scrooge \"The Ghost of Christmas Future\", when it's actually \"The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come\". Other versions completely skip over Scrooge's nephew's \"has done me good and will do me good\" speech. Although this Muppet version did take its own artistic liberties with the story, and didn't reenact Dickens' story word for word, they still did a really good job telling the story.Another thing I liked is that the makers of this movie didn't worry about making the film too sad or too scary for kids. I found from watching the movie at the age of 26 that these parts which were sometimes very sad added some real depth to the movie overall. I still can't help but cry during the scene when a young Scrooge finally loses Belle, and she sings \"The Love Is Gone\" (a song, by the way, that was originally cut out of the theatrical version back in 1992, but was thankfully re-added in the video release a year later). The scene with Robin as Tiny Tim singing \"Bless Us All\" is also very touching.Not only does this movie stand as one of the best Muppet movies made so far, but Michael Caine in this performance alone plays at least one of the Top 5 best Ebenezer Scrooge's in film history. This is significant too, especially since a number of great actors have made a name for themselves for portraying Scrooge long before 1992. I haven't seen every version of \"A Christmas Carol\", and probably never will, but Caine made a very convincing, and human, Scrooge. When he was mean, he was mean! When he was transformed by his dream experiences in the end, he really came off as genuine and believable, which is probably not easy to do when acting alongside puppets.There's so much else that's great about this film. Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat made great narrators, providing comic relief to prevent the movie from being too serious. The special effects were amazing, especially the Ghost of Christmas Past who looked like a living Monet painting. And most of all, Jim Henson would have really been proud of this film. There must of been a lot of pressure for the Jim Henson company to make this film great, especially since it was the first Muppet movie made after Henson's unfortunate death two years earlier. Fortunately, even sixteen years after the film's release, it still stands as a perennial favorite alongside all the other Christmas movies and TV specials played annually on TV. It's a great film, I still love watching it again and again, and I recommend it to anyone.",

Upon watching this today, I got more out if it than I'd ever done before because I picked out bits that were faithful to the original novel as well as some fourth wall jokes from Gonzo as Charles Dickens and Rizzo.The puppetry is mostly smooth if some of the movements are jerky but Michael Caine played a convincing Scrooge. While a lot of the dialogue stayed true to the book (which I read an abridged version of), it had elements of typical Muppet humour and the cameos from Animal and Swedish Chef were absolutely hilarious as was the 'Heatwave' performance in Scrooge's workplace and the part where Dickens lights Rizzo's tail by mistake. The first song is the most memorable. While the rest were initially forgettable, they were pleasant enough with a touch of festive spirit. The whimsical if somewhat generic incidental music had its Christmassy charms as well and the voice acting for the Muppets stayed in line with that from the original Muppet Show despite Kermit's voice actor having changed. Gonzo was perfect as Dickens to narrate the story while Kermit and Miss Piggy provided top-notch support as Bob and Emily Cratchit respectively.All in all this is one of three of my favourite adaptations of the classic Dickens novel, the other two being 'Mickey's Christmas Carol' and the version starring Jim Carrey that has a similar design to 'The Polar Express' and it's still a joy to watch over Christmas. 9/10.",

His playboy roles (Alfie, The Italian Job) and the tough guy (Get Carter, The Eagle Has Landed) were also a recent memory for viewers in 1992. He turned out to be an inspired choice for the role turning in an incredibly charismatic, but also in places scarily mean character. The songs in this film are good and memorable. There's some genuine laughs for people of all ages: \"light the lamp, not the rat\". The sets and costumes are also first rate. The ghosts in this are also surprisingly frightening for a kid's film.This film is now regarded as a classic with a cult following. Its legacy long lasting and it gets a cinema re-release every few years.

            "content": "The legendary Charles Dickens novel gets irreverent (but still respectable) treatment from director Brian Henson and the rest of the Muppet performers, as bitter, misery penny-pincher Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine) is visited by a succession of spirits on a eventful Christmas Eve. Their goal is to show the progression of events in his life that led to his current sour outlook on the world, how it is for the other citizens in whom he has little interest (unless they owe him money), and the possible outcome should he continue on his path.This was noted as the first Muppet film to be released after Jim Henson's death in 1990, and the last for Muppeteer Richard Hunt. The first Muppet film to be released under Disney and the first since The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984). While it does take a lot of elements from the source material, the makers of this wanted it to be centered in the Muppet Universe, with characters like Kermit the Frog (as Bob Cratchit), Miss Piggy (Mrs. Cratchit), Robin the Frog as Tiny Tim, Fozzie Bear (Fuzziwig, or Fozziwig), Gonzo as storyteller Charles Dickens, and his rodent pal Rizzo the Rat, who narrate the story and even are considered part of the story as well. There are still humans in this, including Ebenezer Scrooge, and other Muppet characters including Stater and Waldorf as Jacob Marley, as well Three Ghosts that are one-shot Muppet characters.This along with Mickey's Christmas Carol are the earliest versions of A Christmas Carol I ever saw and perhaps watched them more than any of the live action versions, but the thing is, these two films are still part of me since I grew up with them, and I thought Disney and the Muppets made such great retellings and just as timeless as the source material.However, despite the zany amount of humor coming from the Muppets, with fourth breaking and occasional pop culture references, the appeal of the story, and its tale of redemption, are still solidly punched across. Screenwriter Jerry Juhl keeps a fair amount of the poetry of Dickens' words intact, while also including some great moments for Muppets fans. And Paul Williams composed a variety of songs that are both catchy and poignant. Overall, another adaptation of the Dickens' tale that really connects with people and the Christmas spirit, and the most child-friendly since Mickey's Christmas Carol.8/10.",

On first viewing it's quite good, and on repetitive viewing it just gets better, as the music sinks in and your appreciation of the detail becomes more rich.

He remarkably maintains the believability of his role among the muppets and the songs. Speaking of the songs, they are well placed, they reflect the situations very well and are nice tunes. I was impressed with the creativity in representing the spirits of Christmas using muppets. Most of the other muppet characters are not very different from other muppet movies.

For the second time that day, to me Personally it's like taking all of the Biblical Stories and giving it a Loony Toons twist to it. I don't just mean the Characters I also mean giving the side Biblical Stories a Comedic take. Now I kind if don't mind a Fresh Comedic Take in the Christmas Carol it's just that I felt that it was over the top too Much. I found that CGI itself was Serviceable at Best. And there is one of if not the Worst Scene for me which is the Patriotic Scene during one of the Visits to Scrooges Past. And for me a large part of the Final Act was really Forget Able. Unless I'm Forgetting anything else that should do it for the Negatives. After letting it sink in I was Hoping to finally be able to start enjoying it at least but turns out that's not the case at least for now. I'm sorry I've tried to give it a chance for more than a few times ever since paying it and it turns out it's not really for me which is Strange because I Love the Muppets and I enjoyed almost all of the Muppet's Films excluding this one. With all of the other Muppets Movies I always managed to Crack at least a Smile but not this one this one is deferent some how to me Personally.But on the Flip side I do enjoy some of the songs at least with \"It Feels Like Christmas\" being my Favourite. And I do admit it was a little Crushing in one of the parts. And I do kind of like Both Gonzo/Charles Dickens and Ritzo The Rat Breaking The Fourth Wall Through Out The Entire Movie also enjoy those. But I just feel they did it a Little too Often. And the Last Positive that I could give is that MC did a Great Job as Scrooge.

The excellent soundtrack is filled with songs so memorable they will pop into your head every December.Sir Michael Caine is as comfortable and convincing on screen with muppets as with any other cast. His performance as Scrooge is faultless. The muppets are cleverly cast and narration from Gonzo and Rizzo the rat fills in any gaps.

            "content": "Jim Henson's ever irresistible Muppets takes on the famous Charles Dickens \"Christmas\" classic, with genuinely pleasing results. The story, as everyone probably knows by now, centers on one Ebenezer Scrooge, a greedy and mean-spirited moneylender who thinks only of money and can only respond to Christmas with \"bah, humbug!\" On Christmas Eve, he receives an unexpected visit from his deceased business partners, who warn him that three spirits will transport him to his past, present, and future. Grudgingly, Scrooge goes along with the spirits, and eventually realizes that his selfish acts will provide not only drastic consequences for himself, but for the welfare of his long-suffering clerk, Bob Cratchit, and his sickly son, Tiny Tim.The film follows the original tale faithfully, and more importantly, keeps most of the dark, sometimes dreary tone of Dickens' tale. Since the story has its share of heartbreaking moments, it is surprising that this movie, skillfully directed by Brian Henson, manages to handle them in a very emotional way without coming across as forced or out of place. Scenes such as Scrooge witnessing the departure of his former love Belle and an even more devastating sequence where the Cratchit family mourns the loss of their beloved, frail son (keep in mind that this is only a vision) all manage to tug at the right heartstrings effectively.Naturally, the Muppets do sneak in ways to provide a bit of humor in various places, but in an adaptation like this, it is most welcome. Actually, most of the laughs come from the Great Gonzo as Charles Dickens, who narrates the story to a skeptical Rizzo Rat as the latter questions about whether the \"scary stuff\" is appropriate for children. \"That's all right, this is culture,\" explains Gonzo, er, Dickens, respectively.It is a treat to see Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy as the Cratchits and even more amusing to see those old tycoons Statler and Waldorf as the ghosts of Scrooge's deceased business partners, but the whole weight of the movie rests on the performance of Michael Caine as Mr. \"Bah Humbug\" himself. He plays the role flawlessly, somehow managing to blend in with his Muppet and human co-stars. Also noteworthy are the creation of the spirits themselves: Christmas Past is a ghostly-like child, Present is a jolly, Santa Claus like giant, while Future is a dark-robed, faceless figure who is made all the more scary by the fact that he is mute. Paul Williams' musical numbers are also very sprightly and infectiously catchy, well-suited to both the spirit of Christmas and the story itself.All in all, THE MUPPET Christmas CAROL is great family entertainment, but even adults may find a lot to enjoy too.",

The iconic roles of the book are mostly filled by Muppets(Kermit as Bob Cratchit, Ms. Piggy as his wife, etc.)but Scrooge himself is portrayed rather well by Michael Cane. You should be well aware of the story of A Christmas Carol by now, a man is viewed as a miserable, greedy miser and is visited by three ghosts who show him his past, present and future. Little by little he becomes a better man through these visions and ultimately turns his life around for the better. The same applies for this movie. Only there's a lot of humor you'll find in a Muppet movie. Fourth wall jokes, slapstick, the usual brand of Muppet style. But some of the dialog is actually taken from the original book, and the themes of redemption and good will toward men are still present. One thing that makes the movie a good adaption is that the three ghosts were originally created Muppets just for this movie. Being a Muppet movie there are a few songs in it but they're all done very well and don't seem to slow down the plot(at least for me).The Muppets really captured the tone of the original story for me and I really love this version. I recommend it to any fan of the original book , or fans of the Muppets or just about everyone. While I can't guarantee everyone will love it, it's at least worth a watch.",

Two years later, in December 1992, the Muppets released their newest theatrical movie, \"The Muppet Christmas Carol.\" This was the first Muppet production that was released after I was born, and I LOVE THIS FILM! This is a wonderful movie! The Muppets keep up their tradition of having so much heart, charm, and spirit in their Christmas special. It's also a fantastic tribute to Jim Henson and his fellow puppeteer Richard Hunt. Richard Hunt performed such characters as Scooter, Janice, Beaker, Statler, Sweetums, and Gladys the Cow and the Two-Headed Monster on \"Sesame Street.\"...But I digress.This movie accurately tells the story of \"A Christmas Carol.\" There are some changes here and there, but they don't sugar code the story that much. It's a very good adaption, and a very good way to introduce the story to kids. Kermit is Bob Cratchit, Piggy is his wife Emily, Fozzie is Fozziwig, Gonzo is our narrator Charles Dickins, Rizzo is himself, Statler and Waldorf (now performed by Jerry Nelson and Dave Golez) are Jacob and Robert Marley, and our Ebenezer Scrooge is portrayed by Michael Caine.To be honest, this is one of the weird things about this movie. In this Muppet movie, Ebenezer Scrooge, the story's main character, is played by real human Michael Caine. In past Muppet movies, there was always a human cast, but the focus was on the Muppets. Here, the Muppets share the spotlight with Michael Caine. It makes sense when you think about it - after all, which Muppet could actually play Ebenezer Scrooge? - but it's still weird thinking that our main star is not a Muppet. Maybe it's just me, but it's just kinda weird.A lot of our favorite, lovable characters aren't shown here a lot like they are in other films, like Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem (they're seen, but Animal's the only one who speaks), The Swedish Chef, Scooter, and Sweetums. The reason is obviously due to the passing of Jim Henson and Richard Hunt. In these days, the producers made the decision to not have the characters speak in honor of our late Muppet performers. I actually thought that was a nice idea.This is one of the first movies ever I have the earliest memory of watching. This film has a special place in my heart because it is THE Christmas movie for me and my family; we do not let the Christmas season pass without watching this movie. But even by emotionally detaching myself away from this movie, it's still a really good film. The songs are great, the comedy is good, and you're even pulled into the drama. If you're curious to see how the Muppets take on the great Christmas classic piece of literature, take a look at this movie. You won't be disappointed! BOOYIKA!",

            "content": "The really clever thing about the way the script for this was written is that a viewer can appreciate it in many different ways. If you're a fan of Dickens' writing, you'll like the way that much of the dialogue is lifted from his original novel and yet can still be understood by the audience, whatever their age. (Of course, Rizzo's literary observations don't hurt, either.) If you're into costumes you'll appreciate that the \"present\" cast are dressed in the typical 1840s Dickensian wardrobe, whereas in the Ghost of Christmas Past segment, the boy Scrooge wears Georgian clothing and the young man (who looks uncannily like a younger Michael Caine) dresses in Regency attire. And pretty much everybody can appreciate those wonderful Muppets.Although the tale of Ebeneezer Scrooge is well known as a simple Christmas parable, it's clear just how much work went into making this film really work - using Fozzie Bear as Fozziwig, for instance. I wonder if that's why the Hensons decided to make this particular story in the Muppet style. In the school scenes, the walls are covered in busts of Aristotle, Shakespeare and others, all made to look like Muppets. The fake snow looks better and adds more Christmas atmosphere than real snow ever could, and I like the darkness of Scrooge's office - if he was too mean to provide lighting, it would have looked like that.I do like the interaction between Gonzo and Rizzo - \"Should we be worried about the kids in the audience?\", \"No, this is culture\" - and the way they retreat from the scary Ghost of Christmas Future by hiding in the church. It surprises me - given the way that the Ghost of Christmas Present was designed - that nobody ever seems to have made a toy out of him.The inimitable Miss Piggy is a wonderful (and, dare I say it, borderline psycho) Mrs. Cratchit - it seems so right that she's enormous compared to Kermit, with all her curly blonde hair and her mob cap.One thing I was really sad to hear of is that some new DVD versions (I was watching my thirteen year old video) have cut the song When Love Is Gone. It may seem soppy to some, but I think it's an important bit of the story because it shows that Scrooge lost people he loved because he was so concerned with money.",

Many Muppet characters really come to life as characters we all know from the story and I personally think that Michael Caine does a good job at portraying Scrooge. If you want to be entertained by the Muppets because you lik ethe Muppets, you will be entertained. If you love A Christmas Carol and want to see a new version, you'll probably enjoy yourself.

Rendering the fairytale imagery of Dickens' language proves to be a challenge visually, and the subtext is too inherently blatant to be expressed creatively. So, why not make it a musical featuring the Muppets? Certainly an inspired choice, and while this version suffers from the above pitfalls of every adaptation, it reigns supreme amongst all other Christmas Carol films precisely due to its uniqueness. The Muppets add some necessary levity - no one could take this overdone story seriously by this stage anyway - and the absurdism of the concept alone holds interest throughout the welcomingly short runtime. Michael Caine's performance is the counter-balance here, being oddly genuine (and quite good indeed). The songs add next to little, though even the weaker tracks are charming and easily watchable. Goes without saying that all the puppetry and voice acting is stellar, with the sets also standing out as lovingly crafted. Largely does away with Dickens' social message, the extent of its presence being two mentions of \"workhouses\" and the sympathy built for Cratchit's family. Feels rushed at times, as though it were struggling to fit in all the essential beats of the novella; end of the Christmas Yet to Come section in particular gave a reaction of \"Oh, that's it then.\" Following sequence of Scrooge as a philanthropist is a joy to watch, however, and as a whole the film is too short and heartwarming to take any major issue with it. Doesn't exactly work as a Muppet movie or a Christmas Carol movie, yet I can't deny I was smiling throughout. (Except upon seeing the Ghost of Christmas Past - that's solid nightmare fuel.)",

            "content": "This is the first movie in what I consider the second trilogy of Muppet movies. The first trilogy consists of The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper and Muppets Take Manhattan. The second trilogy consists of The Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Treasure Island and Muppets From Space. What separates these trilogies has nothing to do with plots and such, as the movies don't really have much connection with each other, other than the fact that they of course contain the Muppets. What separates them is the fact that the first trilogy was made before the tragic death of the Muppet creator, Jim Henson, and the second was made afterward. Being the first movie made completely without Henson, and I really have to say, they handled it very well. The movie was directed by Jim Henson's son, Brian Henson, and he really filled his father's shoes well. They also had to use a new voice for Kermit the Frog, Jim Henson's most well known role, and also the other Muppets he voices. Taking over the role as Kermit was Steve Whitmire, who I believe did a fantastic job keeping the character alive.As the title suggests, the movie is yet another adaption of Charles Dickens' famous story A Christmas Carol. Various characters are portrayed by Muppets, while several characters are portrayed by actual actors, with the key role of Ebenezer Scrooge being played by the brilliant Michael Caine. He did a great job, and it's my favourite role of his. That's partly what makes this movie interesting\u0085 all Muppet movies before this one were all about the Muppet characters, with human characters in more supporting roles. This movie focuses on a human character, with Muppets in supporting roles (not counting Gonzo as Charles Dickens narrating the movie). Kermit the Frog plays Scrooge's kind hearted assistant, Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy plays his wife and Robin the Frog plays Tiny Tim.Part of what I love about this movie is how well they are able to keep the fun of the Muppets, yet still tell a heart-warming story of A Christmas Carol. There are scenes in the movie where I honestly get a little emotional\u0085 but I am a big sook with stuff like this! I think that this the effort put in by Caine contributed a great deal to the emotional side of the movie. I think, if played by another actor, the end result may not have been as good. That's not to say it's not a well made movie overall, it's great! I'd have to say, my favourite parts of the movie would have to be some of the songs. They're catchy, and I often find myself singing them. My favourite is probably Marley and Marley, performed by the characters Waldorf and Statler (both with different performers, due to the death of Henson and also Richard Hunt, who died in 1991).If you have children, or if you want to feel like a kid again, you must get this movie, as it is a must see, especially over the Christmas holidays (a time when it was shown each year for a while when I was little). The movie actually makes my Top 50, along with The Muppet Movie and Muppets Take Manhattan (and also Labyrinth, if you want more puppet fun). I've actually caught flack for having them on my list, but it really doesn't matter. I love the movie, and I make absolutely no apologies for it!",

Watching it you can become absorbed into the story, the music and the meaning of A Christmas Carol.Of course, we know the story. Michael Caine is brilliant as Scrooge (second only to the great Alastar Sim), Kermit is Bob Cratchett. Other Muppets come in and out as the film progresses, Miss Piggy as Mrs Cratchett; its funny as the boys in the Cratchett family are frogs and the girls are pigs. The Great Gonzo is playing Charles Dickens and narrates the film along with Rizzo the Rat (a blue furry Charles Dickens who hangs out with a rat as Rizzo describes). These two never loose the plot and never seem out of place, even with the American accents and forgetting things like Rizzos bag of jelly beans. Thats all i'm going to say about the film. Kids and adults alike, buy this film. If you love the Muppets, its a must..",

            "content": "It is amazing to me, really. My wife and I, this evening, were looking up the 1966 film ALFIE with Michael Caine. I had never seen the film. But while looking it over, and being really amazed at the sheer number of films that the man has done, I clicked on one of my favorites: THE MUPPET Christmas CAROL.It was then that my jaw dropped. The overall rating is 6.9 -- something I consider close to 3.1 points shy of where this film belongs. There are not many 10s in my book of films. The Godfather, perhaps. Ben Hurr, might be there. And perhaps Patton. But in this list, most definitely, is this little gem.First of all, I am an old fan of the Muppets. From the old days of watching everyone from Steve Martin to Alice Cooper host THE MUPPET SHOW (nothing like the Muppet version of \"Welcome to my Nightmare\" I can assure you). The death of Mr. Henson was something that struck me fairly deeply, like a part of my childhood being ripped away.Brian Henson's word since has been spotty. Some of it has been good, some of it sub-par, but all of it worth seeing and enjoyable. But without a doubt, the peak performance has been with this beautiful rendition of a timeless classic. And lest I not get this across as I write this, let me say it now: there has never been (nor can I imagine in the future there will ever be) a better portrayal of the Charles Dickens's classic.The songs are perfect. The two best sung by Scrooge, one as a young man losing his first love, one as a grateful old man on Christmas morning telling us that if you wish to measure the worth of a man, you simply count his friends. But the rest are nothing short of spectacular: the ghost of Christmas present and his ditty about living life in the moment and appreciating every little thing; the song of having one more sleep until Christmas... all of them are unforgettable.The storytelling is superb. With the Great Gonzo playing the part of Charles Dickens himself, telling the story as it unfolds, and the part of Scrooge's old business partner, made into two partners so that the two old hecklers could do it together... perfection.But none of this really matters. None of it matters if the heart of the tale is gone. You can get all of the right people, all of the right gimmicks and still fail. Examples include that piece of cow dung that Bill Murray put out, SCROOGED. Believe me, this tale has been attempted a hundred times -- plays, movies... but none capture the magic of Dickens like this one. It has a heart as big as the story. And in the end, it captured mine. I watch this movie every year -- I get my family together, and we spend a night sharing stories about one other and remembering how much we mean to each other. And then we watch this simple telling of a perfect Christmas story... Thank you, Brian Henson. Thank you for reminding me what Christmas is.",

I have it on VHS and try to watch it every Christmas. I like how Scrooge reformed after seeing Tiny Tim sick.My favorite song in the movie has to be the one the Cratchit family sing together. Every time Tiny Tim (Was Robin the Muppet name of the little frog?) gets sick at the end of the song I get a lump in my throat and start crying. And in the future scene when you realize Tim's dead you can't help crying. My second favorite is the song Scrooge does at the very end, I think it's called \"With A Thankful Heart,\" but I'm not sure. I like how they show him playing Santa Claus to everyone. I also like the ones \"There goes Mister Scrooge\" in the very beginning and \"Marley and Marley\" by Statler and Waldorf.When Scrooge sees his gravestone and realizes he's the one everyone was talking about: \"I only know that he's dead, it's a shame he didn't die years ago\" I feel sorry for him.I like the little mice living in that hole in the wall.I'm not sure about one thing.

The only thing that's different about this version (besides the obvious) is that Charles Dickens (Gonzo) is the narrator, but he also travels along as a background character.Michael Caine plays Scrooge, and he's...fine? Not the best Scrooge ever, not the worst. Sometimes he gives a lot of emotion, and sometimes he looks completely zoned out, if not a little silly. He's somebody that I'm not sure could carry the film on his own, but with the Muppets, it balances alright.It hardly needs to be said, but the puppetry in this movie is ridiculously impressive. I especially like the design for the Ghost of Christmas Present. I don't know how they operated him (I know it's a suit), but he looks really cool. The songs are also just fantastic and ear-wormy as any other Muppet film.

Academy Award winner Michael Caine stars as Ebenezer Scrooge, a selfish miser who hates Christmas, and he is also a boss to Bob Cratchit (played by Kermit the Frog), who tells him tomorrow is Christmas morning. At one point, when Scrooge gets angry and shouts something funny, the rats (that are working for Scrooge along with Bob) begin to sing the \"The Island in the Sun\" song.One night, Scrooge gets haunted by the spirits of his partners, Jacob (played by Statler) and Robert (played by Waldorf) Marley, who both tell Scrooge that he will be haunted by three spirits. When Gonzo shouts \"EXPECT THE FIRST GHOST WHEN THE BELL TOLLS ONE!\", Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past (played by Waldo C. Graphic from \"The Jim Henson Hour\" and \"Muppet*vision 3-D\", AND PLEASE NOTE: this movie marks Waldo's very first big break into movie business just like all the other Muppets did). Scrooge is later visited by the Ghost of Christmas Present, who sings the song \"It Feels Like Christmas\". When the clock strikes twelve, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Future, or Yet to Come, and even both Gonzo and Rizzo can be unseen when the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is around. At Christmas Morning, Scrooge asks Bob to be his partner, Bean Bunny has brought in the turkey, and Tiny Tim (played by Robin the Frog) says, \"God bless us everyone.\"The Songs in this Muppet Movie are catchy. Also the gags and scenes are very funny and hilarious to me throughout this movie. For example, Rizzo shouts at Gonzo, \"Light the lamp, not the rat! Light the lamp, not the rat!\" Overall, I gave \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" a two thumbs up, when I laugh during watching this movie at the same time.

The final spirit scene could for sure have been scarier if they wanted it to, but they found a good balance.There are moments of humor, but never descending into slapstick goofiness. The narrating muppets contribute to a lot of the humor, but they pull away at the right moments.All of this, coupled with a great performance by Michail Caine give this movie just enough seriousness and soul to be memorable. Caine pulls off the pacing of Scrouge's transformation perfectly, and it felt natural (not forced).To nitpick, I didnt find the songs to really be all that memorable, but they were enjoyable I suppose (again, remember I am coming at this with no nostalgia bias). I also found the \"message\" of Christmas the film was trying to communicate get lost in a lot of non-specific, but nice sounding language - \"love\", \"hope\", \"giving thanks\".

Don' t be afraid to watch this if you're a Dickens purist - I am, too.Michael Caine is as good a screen Scrooge as there's ever been - he said he tried to act with the Muppets as if he were acting with the RSC and that's how it comes across.Funny, moving, lively, heartwarming and very, very true to the spirit of its source, this is a quite wonderful film. The Muppets are great, of course, but even so, this is so much more than just another Muppet movie.",

This version of A Christmas Carol is fun and accessible to almost every age, if perhaps slightly dark in parts for the very youngest of viewers - This should, however, be expected by anyone who even remotely knows the story.As a note to the person that thought that the movie had only two or three songs, the movie had seven song performances, not including overture, instrumentals or the songs played during the credits.A Muppet Christmas Carol is the perfect Christmastime movie.",

They deal with death and human nature in a very moving way, the highlights..you can't pick a highlight, really, because of the 5-star performance turned in by Michael Caine as an exquisite Scrooge, whose change in personality through the film is nothing short of amazing to me. We have been spared too much of his singing, but the numbers everyone else does are of the moral yet humourous style we know and love the Muppets for. Made to make you cry and laugh in turn, with outstanding moments from all the Muppet cast, and the few supporting humans, such as Michael Caine and Steven Mackintosh, it may be a little Muppified  but it is a movie which would have made Jim proud.",

For those who don't know, in the book there was just the one.\nMichael Caine played the role of Ebenezer Scrooge. Michael Caine is one of the famous actors who were tax exiles. He was a tax exile for ten years and is \"worth\" an estimated \u00a358 million.A partial list of tax exiles is available on Wikipedia.\nWhat would Scrooge have said about taxes? \"Humbug\" probably.\nHowever, in the movie Scrooge also talks about his taxes going to fund the workhouses and the prisons. We no longer have workhouses (at the time of writing). Tax exiles and tax dodgers want the police to lock up criminals and the prisons to house them. They want other people to pay for the police and the prisons.\nArguments about poverty causing crime are irrelevant to them. After all, they are not poor.\nAnd if poor people die, Scrooge had an answer to that too. \"They'd better die then and decrease the surplus population.\" Half the Tory Party would probably agree with that sentiment, and the other half would refrain from saying it out loud.",

I think my favorite part of the movie is when Belle is singing goodbye to Ebenezer and Michael stands behind her and sings. At that point you know he understands what he has missed out on in life. I also enjoy his singing at the end. Anyway, get into the movie, let it move you and touch your emotions. Laugh and cry along with it.

Instead of raging his hatred of Christmas he remarks on it with keen sarcasm. Dickens uses humor and irony throughout his writings and I truly enjoyed seeing it brought out in this movie. Maybe making it more amazing is that Mr. Caine gives this performance opposite the whole troupe of The Muppets. I am also impressed with how much of the content of the original story is included with the most important passages remaining intact. The Ghost of Christmas past is so true to Dickens' description, more so than any other version I've seen. Also interesting is that this character is mostly computer generated in a world of puppets. The Ghost of Christmas Present is completely infectious with the spirit of Christmas and I love the way he expands to fill any space he inhabits and gets smaller to relate to Scrooge. I find all of the songs enjoyable and high quality, the production numbers entertaining. This movie is also the best of its kind showing Ebenezer truly in love with Belle and the sadness of their parting. The Muppets are matched well to Dickens' characters and the performers are at their very best in this film.I love the cast and production of the film starring Reginald Owen from 1938 and it sets the bar for all other movies to be judged by. Alastair Sim (1951)is the scariest Scrooge and the movie has a very dark quality. I love Albert Finney as Scrooge in the 1970 musical, and look forward to \"Thank You Very Much\" being sung as the they parade through the streets and dance on the coffin. George C. Scott gives the character pathos and shows how truly haunted Scrooge is, not only by the ghosts but by his own past, while his conversion is subtle and believable. I watch each one of them portray Dickens' most famous character every year during the holidays and, in my opinion, Caine is simply the best Scrooge ever.note: I purposely left Patrick Stewart's 1999 portrayal of Scrooge off the list, it doesn't rate being included among the greats.",

It's hard not to rate his performance in this film as he delivers a fantastic turn opposite what is essentially someone's hand covered in felt and foam. My one grumble, however, has been the removal of one of the songs from the DVDs and TV broadcasts more recently - When Scrooge is in the past and splits up with his partner. The song was very poignant and Caine's voice breaking as he fought back tears in the duet had me biting my fist and trying not to blub like a 5-year-old. It now just goes from her saying she's going to leave, doing so, then Rizzo crying. I luckily managed to pick up a VHS copy with the full film in so plan to burn that to DVD for this Christmas so I can fight the tears once more!!

Perhaps my favorite thing about the film though, is that it's thoroughly a family film. Parents who remember \"The Muppet Show\" from their own childhoods can share the fun with their children.

There have been various portrayals of Scrooge and in my personal (albeit slightly biased) opinion Caine brings out what Scrooge from the book should be.

Every muppet fits in well with the role they have in the movie and it feels like a nice marriage between a beloved old story and the wacky antics of the muppets. The biggest surprise is the film being able to bring in Charles Dickens to narrate, despite his odd new attraction to chickens and strangely curved nose.",

I especially liked The Ghost of Christmas Present.  Gonzo and Rizzo are very good as the movie's narrators.  They also had some good jokes.  The songs in the movie are good.  There is no \"Rainbow Connection\" in the movie per se, but the songs fit the movie well and the musical numbers are well staged.

This is a retelling of Charles Dickens's 1843 novella A Christmas Carol as only the Muppets could do. Michael Caine played Scrooge in this version and while he might not be the best Scrooge ever captured on screen, he does a good job here. I do question his musical ability and casting him in a musical. Kermit does feel different with Brian Henson as his performer, but I think Jim Henson's son does capture the character well. Gonzo and Rizzo are the narrators for this version and their comedic antics throughout the film worked well for me. I also think that the Muppets on the whole do add to the story and provide a unique comedic take on the classic tale. The music for this film is fine. \"One More Sleep \u2018til Christmas\" is a new classic Christmas song in my humble opinion. The Muppet movies that follow this one also tell a classic story through a Muppet lens. This one is the best of those.

I've, in the past, before I started writing reviews on RT, seen the Jim Carrey Christmas Carol movie, Mickey's Christmas Carol and even the Looney Tunes version. But I've never seen the story as told by the Henson family. Until now. I don't think this is one of the greatest adaptations of the Charles Dickens tale but I understand why most people have fond memories of it. It is still an endearing Christmas movie with good songs and decent puppeteering which rises on the strength of Michael Caine's performance as Scrooge since he treats the Muppets as though they were normal people like you and me rather than just mere puppets. Since I didn't grow up with Kermit the Frog and his pals, I can't say I love this version of the timeless story but it is still a decent introduction for children to one of the most iconic pieces of literature.",

It was fun to remember the various muppets from The Muppet Show (those from Sesame Street are absent here), playing bit parts.  The major roles are taken by Michael Caine (Scrooge) and Kermit (Bob Cratchit).  Paul Williams wrote the songs -which are pretty bland and not up to the level of 1970's Scrooge (with Albert Finney).  In places the story seems abbreviated, particularly when showing Scrooge as a youth in love, but this was probably for the best as attentions of the under 9 crowd were wavering at that point.  There is a lot of comic relief, mostly from Rizzo the Rat and Gonzo (as narrators) but the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come might be scary for some.  Caine does fine but nothing spectacular. This is the first project for the muppets after Jim Henson's death and it is dedicated to him.",

            "content": "Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine) is a grumpy business man who is an active hater of Christmas, thinking that people shouldn't waste potential working days for leisure time. On the next holiday season, he receives some special visitors who try to show and convince that the true meaning of Christmas is one worth celebrating.\n\nI think the Muppets are very entertaining and can be very funny; I enjoy their comedy shows and I appreciate how diverse the cast is, which helps remember most of them. Their feature length films, though, I feel can be either fairly entertaining and funny (such as \"Muppets from Space\" or \"Muppet Treasure Island\") or annoying and weird (like \"The Great Muppet Caper\").\n\nFor this film, I thought the humor was well balanced to be enjoyable for kids while also appealing to adults who might have grown with these characters. Most of the Muppets have their own moments to showcase their talents but they are not annoying. The musical sequences are good. I don't know if I would say amazing, but they work for this Muppet movie.\n\nThe human cast also does a fine job. Michael Caine has the characteristics of what you might imagine Ebenezer Scrooge to be like: grouchy, a snob, but also a sad man at his core. I don't know most of the other cast members, nor would I probably recognize them by name, but they did well in their parts by showing their Christmas spirits.\n\nBeing an adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel \"A Christmas Carol\", the movie develops its plot well enough to stand on its own while respecting the original story, for the most part. If anything, the last scene of Christmas Past feels a little bit too rushed to get the full feel of Scrooge's motivation of his dislike for Christmas. I thought his character changes in the movie were well done with the songs because they have at least some time to be good. The theatrical edition of \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" was going to have a song also showing Ebenezer's Christmas past, but apparently it was taken out of the final film because the filmmakers thought it was too hard to understand for kids. Thank goodness for the special edition where we actually listen to that song. Such a shame it was taken out.\n\n\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" is a mostly beat for beat retelling of the Dickens classic, while having a blend of its Muppet style to go along with it. And honestly, it doesn't need to do anything complex for its story; it should just have good songs, storytelling, and performances to be good. And it is really good.\n8/10",

While the Muppets' fourth feature film is brimming with wit, sharp humor and memorable musical numbers, a palpable sense of sadness hangs heavy over the production. It permeates every scene, every reflection on death and regret, every puppeteer's work, even the way Kermit's head droops or his smile fades seems to whisper \"we are not what we once were.\" And yet Jim Henson's legacy is alive and well in\u00c2\u00a0The Muppet Christmas Carol. Brian Henson, his puppeteers and the Muppets themselves refuse to let a day pass wasted, even in their grief, and allow their sadness to not only invade the production but to inhabit it, enrich it and make it a more sincere, emotionally poignant film. Watching Kermit and Robin as Cratchet and Tiny Tim -- a loving father who devotes every ounce of his strength to his work and his son -- is suddenly utterly heartbreaking and incredibly moving. Seeing Scrooge learn what Jim Henson spent his days teaching -- to live life to its fullest, bringing joy to others whenever possible -- suddenly resonates unlike any \"Christmas Carol\" adaptation before or since. Realizing Brian Henson is coming into his own, in complete, confident command of his craft -- on his feature film directorial debut no less -- is suddenly wonderfully satisfying. \"We are not what we once were\" suddenly translates to something else entirely: \"This too shall pass. We are exactly what Jim wanted us to be.\"",

So you can see that this is a middle of the road, in terms of quality, for the Muppets.  With that said, it's still a pretty good movie.  The problem is that, while A Christmas Carol is STILL an excellent story of a man's redemption, I don't think the Muppets really work well when trying to fit into the framework of a story that's been told thousands and thousands of times.  There's still the musical numbers, there's still the clever humor that breaks the fourth wall, Miss Piggy is still great...there's just less of it this time around, because they're working within the confines of this book. Not that I can blame them for that, but it's still a little disappointing that there wasn't as much Muppet greatness as there is in other, original, films.  With that said, if there's one thing I liked about this movie more than any adaptation of A Christmas Carol I've ever seen, and that is Michael Caine's performance.  I think he's, head and shoulders, the best Ebenezer Scrooge there has been.  I think his performance isn't as notable because he IS surrounded by Muppets and all this absurd humor, but that doesn't make it any less effective or heartfelt.  This guy is incredible here.  It's not anything Oscar worthy, but it is an excellent performance that makes this film worth it even with its flaws.  It's probably not even the best adaptation of this story that has ever been made.  I even thought about it raising the rating to 3.5, but I genuinely think this film is just good.  I just think the lack of real Muppet insanity held this movie back for me.  But that's just me.  But this is a good movie nonetheless, this story will always bee a good one and with Caine's excellent performance, then this is at least worth a watch.",

This film had a great production value, wonderful songs, and still tried to stay true to the book while at the same time giving it a little Muppet flare/sparkle and humor that audiences know and love.  Micheal Caine does a great job playing a Muppet movie as a human role should be.  Play it straight, play it real, be in the film the same way you would be with other actors not just Muppets.  This was the first film after the sad passing of Jim Henson.  A serious amount of work went into this film to still make it what Jim would have wanted.  A lot was on the line and needed to be proven and boy did they deliver!  \n\nI made this account on this site only because I could not believe the low percentage when I saw it and just couldn't sit still.

            "content": "Let's not beat around the bush. I adore The Muppet Christmas Carol. Since my parents bought it for me on VHS back in 1993, it is the only Christmas film that I make a point of watching at least once every year. Taking one of the greatest stories ever written from one of the greatest writers of all time and making at least a half-decent film out of it shouldn't be too hard a task. Yet, there are films out there which have completely failed to make anything decent out of Dickens' story and some have even managed to somehow make it boring.\n\nThe biggest problem anyone faces with adapting A Christmas Carol is making it stand out from the other versions of it. To say there's an overabundance of adaptations is a radical understatement. On that basis, you'd think that one of the key ways to help your version stand out is by adopting a gimmick. There's so many failed examples of this though. The last high-profile adaptation was Robert Zemeckis' take on the story with Jim Carrey as Scrooge. The gimmick? Motion capture animation and 3D. Exactly what the story didn't need. Elsewhere, you've got modernizations, a potentially decent idea, but I can't name one that worked. I know some will stand up for Scrooged, but, for me, it was OK at best. Then there's A Christmas Carol 2000, in which ITV decided that a modernization with Ross Kemp playing Scrooge was a good idea.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nSo, why does The Muppet Christmas Carol work? The main reason is it's refusal to resort to any level of pretentiousness, a real sticking point for some of the worst versions of the story. Here, there is no belief present that they can add anything to the story or make it better, because they know that they can't. Instead, they take the story and everything that's great about it. Then, most crucially of all, they make sure that The Muppets themselves are made to fit around the story, rather than the other way round. I'm not providing a synopsis. If you don't know the plot, where have you been? In addition, I'm also not going to worry too much about avoiding spoilers from this point on.\n\nIn this adaptation, Michael Caine plays Scrooge and, frankly, it's inspired casting. Scrooge is a character that demands an actor with credibility, but the presence of The Muppets would mean that a lot of actors out there would not have taken this role seriously and would have completely phoned in the performance. Caine's not doing that here. He's crafting what I honestly believe to be one of his best performances. The usual style of performance for Caine wouldn't have worked here and it's refreshing to see little to none of his usual mannerisms present here. He delivers a fantastic interpretation and one that feels human, rather than the overly animated cartoonish performances (hello again, Jim Carrey) that we often find ourselves subjected to. That's not to say he's relatable. He's every bit as reprehensible as he should be, but because he seems like a real person, it means that his development over the course of the film feels legitimate and, in no way, forced. As for his singing and dancing, you'll just have to learn to forgive him for that and realize that it could be worse, you could be watching him in Jaws IV.\n\nThe presence of Caine also helps in another matter, as he makes sure the story is respected, allowing a balance to form between that and the antics of The Muppets, who fill most of the other roles. Kermit takes the biggest role of Bob Cratchitt and is really the only instance of a Muppet playing it straight, with the exception of a Kermit Jr. playing Tiny Tim. Elsewhere, the Muppets are pretty much kept to the comedy characters, as they should be. Rizzo's playing the sidekick to Gonzo's narrative performance as Charles Dickens and while Fozziwig may seem an obvious joke, it's a necessary one.\n\nTo be honest, the only place where the presence of a Muppet is fumbled is in Miss Piggy playing Emily Cratchit, or rather Miss Piggy playing Miss Piggy, but going by the name of Emily Cratchit. The jokes work fine for her. Piggy's not exactly my favourite Muppet, but the traditional and necessary elements of her character worked here. The problem is when they expect us to take her seriously as the grieving mother. It just doesn't work and renders what should be one of the most poignant moments of the story feeling a little bit hokey. To be honest though, it probably won't bother you too much and, as my score will demonstrate, it's not something that gets held against the film. In the long run, it's a minor gripe.\n\nThen, we have the Muppet-style comedy transitioning into the Dickensian world and there's only one word to describe how they've handled this. Masterful. First off, it;s actually funny. A requirement that shouldn't need stating about comedy, but I watched Disaster Movie last week and learnt that, apparently, it does. There's also the flawless way that each joke fits into the story without feeling like it's intruding. Each joke is fast and to the point and, crucially, they don't dwell on them. The joke happens, you laugh and they head straight back to the story, meaning that the focus is never lost. They also don't feel the need to saturate every scene with them. The 15 (or so) minutes assigned to The Ghost Of Christmas Yet To Come is pretty much devoid of jokes, relying almost entirely on the words of Dickens to bring out any humour, but, for the most part, keeping the necessarily morbid tone that the scenes require. As a result, that element of the story feels particularly powerful, as we're left to focus on Scrooge's despaired realization of where his actions will take him. If the earlier jokes weren't funny, this wouldn't have felt anywhere near as strong as it did and it also wouldn't provide the relief and joy of the final moments as we return to the jovial nature that dominates the rest of the film.\n\nFinally, there are the songs. I'll say it now. Musicals are not my thing. I would much rather someone just tell me how they feel, rather than sing it to me. Yet, despite that, I love a lot of the songs from the film. I'm sure it helps that I first heard them when I was 6 and far less discerning than I am now, but regardless they are well written songs and my only issue comes from the deletion of one of them. Again, this is not something I will hold against the film as it is entirely down to studio interference, rather than creative choice. The song that's deleted is called When Love Is Gone. It's not the best song and it's almost overbearingly shmaltzy. Despite this, removing it causes far more issues than the quality of the song ever would. The most noticeable is a jarring edit, one of the worst I've ever seen in my life. Even if you haven't seen this film with the song included, you'll almost definitely still notice it and it won't sit right with you. Added to this are the facts that it almost makes the entire character of Belle border on pointless as she's gone faster than she arrives, as well as rendering the whole point of the film's final song effectively moot.\n\nI found myself not sure how to end this review, because I kind of stated my conclusion in my introduction. I also would like to think that my love of this film has been summed up. So, I'll end with this. This review is my first perfect score that I've posted. This is probably more to do with the fact that it's Christmas time more than anything else. When I think about it though, The Muppet Christmas Carol is probably the first film I ever saw that I would have given a perfect score back then and still give a perfect score to now. On that basis, I think it's a fairly appropriate first.",

I'm not fond of christmas films they get too cheesy and sentimental for my liking - incredibly cringe worthy springs to mind.\r\n\r\nBut 'The Muppet Christmas Carol' I like - in fact I'd say it's great. There's no point in explaining the story everyone knows it. But it comes with a 'Muppet' twist with their patented brand of comedy. 'Gonzo' narrates the story up to the point where the ghosts appear. 'Caine' is 'Scrooge' and as expected puts in a fine performance.\r\n\r\nI don't need to say anymore its a classic in most peoples eyes and I'd almost be incline to agree with them. Its undoubtedly a fine film but it isn't funny enough for my liking. I don't have any problems with the film as such.

Now twenty years after the original release of that story Disney has re-issued it onto a new Blu-ray/DVD combo pack for a whole new generation of audiences to enjoy. \n \nThe Muppet Christmas Carol is just one of any number of renditions of Charles Dickens' classic literary tale.  There are so many different takes on the classic tale that it would seem that one needs a program to tell them all apart.  This modern take on the classic tale is enjoyable first and foremost for its general structure.  Rather than trying to be just another take on Dickens' story, it comes across as a stage play on screen instead of a movie.  The sets and musical numbers alone give it that feel.  And the cast's acting adds to that feel, too.  Veteran actor Michael Caine (Secondhand Lions, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises) does an expert job leading the cast as the infamous Ebenezer Scrooge.  While Caine does an extraordinary job as Scrooge, it's The Great Gonzo and Rizzo who take the story's other light.  Unlike other versions of A Christmas Carol in which the narrator is only heard and not seen, Gonzo takes on the mantle of Dickens, helping to guide viewers through the story on screen.  In its own manner, this is actually a visual aid of sorts for viewers.  It's a very valuable aid, too.  The comic turns between Gonzo and Rizzo add for even more entertainment for viewers, as well.  Audiences will enjoy the pair's physical comedy throughout the movie.  At one point, Rizzo falls down a chimney with rather warm results.  And the pair gets knocked off more than one window sill as it attempts to help viewers follow the story.  These are just a handful of examples of how the cast's acting makes The Muppet Christmas Carol enjoyable for the family.  The acting aside, there is at least another aspect that makes this two decade old story enjoyable even today.  That aspect is the movie's general presentation.  \n \nThe acting of both Caine and the puppeteers does a lot to make The Muppet Christmas Carol a believable and enjoyable story.  But it's not all that contributes to the movie's success.  The on-screen stage presentation is what really puts The Muppet Christmas Carol over the top.  As noted already, there are so many renditions of A Christmas Carol out there that it's tough to keep them all straight.  Among that mass of different takes are movies that are obviously take offs of that story, just with different titles.  The Muppet Christmas Carol does the exact opposite of those adaptations.  Rather, it opted to pay homage to the original in its own way.  Instead of trying to be another movie adaptation of the original story, it takes the avenue of being a stage play complete with enjoyable musical numbers and sets that make audiences feel as if they're watching a play on screen.  Combined with the acting, the musical numbers and sets will pull audiences in with ease and keep their attention throughout the near hour and a half story.  And for those audiences who perhaps might have to get up during the movie for any reason, they are treated to something very special courtesy of the bonus \"Intermission\" feature.  The \"Intermission\" feature allows audiences to pause the movie and enjoy extra musical numbers courtesy of other members of the Muppets cast.\n \nSpeaking of bonus features, the bonus features presented in the previous DVD presentation of The Muppet Christmas Carol are carried over to this new Blu-ray/DVD combo pack along with a pair of new additions.  The \"Intermission\" feature is one of that pair of new features.  The other new feature is an interview with Jim Henson's son Brian Henson, who helmed this new take on the holiday standard.  The manner in which the interview was conducted is worth its own share of laughs.  That's because Henson shares the moment with Gonzo and Rizzo.  The three discuss different aspects of the film and behind-the scenes stories that will keep the entire family especially entertained.  It's just one more part of the whole that makes the new 20th Anniversary Edition of The Muppet Christmas Carol fun for the whole family this and every holiday season.",

He's visited by three angels on Christmas Eve who teach him the importance of the holiday and showing good will toward men.\n\n\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" isn't a bad movie. It's just another unnecessary re-telling of a classic Christmas tale. The concept of adapting Charles Dickens' short story and adding wacky characters or updating it was already played out even in 1992. I'm sure children will find it amusing, but their parents will be catching a quick nap amongst the tiny laughter.\n\nMichael Caine is absolutely perfect in the role of Scrooge. He pours his heart and soul into it. The fact that he is surrounded by Jim Henson's hand puppets doesn't affect his performance at all. As far as Caine's concerned, he's starring in a version of the famous tale surrounded by other Oscar-winning actors.\n\nThe film provides good clean family entertainment for everyone. I'm sure it'll be and is considered essential viewing for many during the holiday season. Just don't expect the magic and wit you get when watching 2011's \"The Muppets.\" \n\nhttp://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",

Charles Dickens (The Great Gonzo) tells the story of a Christmas Carol with Rizzo the Rat. Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine) is a cheap, bitter old man who hates Christmas and everything to do with. When Christmas Eve falls, his apprentices come back from the dead to tell him that three ghosts are coming to show him things and try to change him. It's the basic Christams Carol plot, but it's executed warmly.\n\nACTING:The Muppets were the Muppets and there's nothing to that. Caine did a pretty good job as Scrooge, but I don't believe he was the best at all.\n\nSCORE:This is actually what I love best about this movie; the songs. The songs were written by the brilliant Paul Williams, and they are brilliant as well. Each song is catchy, melodic, and gives of a warm and fun feeling (aside from my least favorite, \"The Love Is Gone\"). The score itself isn't too bad either.\n\nEFFECTS:The effects this movie had were actually pretty intricate; from the morphing doorknob, to the sparkling loss of Christmas Present, to the harrowing portals of Christmas Future. The effects actually had effect!\n\nOTHER CONTENT:Now, this is a pretty good portrayal of Charles Dickens' classic story, but it's most definitely not the best. They say this is a wonderful introduction of the tale to younger viewers, and I agree; the Muppets put a certian charm in it with their humor and beloved family following, but the accuracy to the book is somewhat lost and the culture is lowered. The Muppets give it charm, but take away accuracy.\n\nOVERALL,an ok Christmas Carol with a warmly executed plot, good acting, brilliant score, intricate effects, and the Muppets' charm, but with that charm comes loss of culture.",

This film is all about Scrooge, who is played by a very human Michael Caine. This is truly, the biggest flaw in The Muppet Christmas Carol, because with the muppets getting so little screen time then they deserve, this adaption of the Dicken's story doesn't have much to separate itself from other adaptions. \n\nGonzo narrates, and Rizzo the Rat is there to make jokes. This potentially amusing duo isn't very funny, and is only there to move the story along. In fact, they feel a lot like filler. \n\nAnd speaking of filler, did I mention all the songs in this movie? I believe there were 6 or 7 songs total.

            "content": "Charles Dicken's seasonal favorite is retold once again in \"The Muppet Christmas Carol.\" Full of music, Muppets and mirth, this is the perfect holiday film for the entire family.\nWhile not the best of the Muppet films -perhaps the restrictiveness of the story held them back- it is still characteristically imaginative and entertaining.\nMichael Caine plays the cheerless Scrooge- king of \"Bah, Humbug.\" With the exception of some supporting bits, his is the only human performance. While not complex, his presence makes it memorable.\nThe remainder of the characters are filled by familiar Muppet faces; with Gonzo and Rizzo the rat as a pair of omnipresent narrators. All of the favorites are here, including Kermit, Piggy, Fozzie, Beeker and Animal. In addition, there is a whole city full of Muppet extras playing the roles of various citizenry, animals, fruits and vegetables.\n\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" is a visual treat with Muppets and Humans intermixed throughout. Coordinating the variety and density of performers -both those on screen and off- was a major accomplishment; and one that pays off with rich, active scenes that always offer something new for the eye. Even after all these years, I continue to be amazed at the range of expression obtainable from the Muppet creations.\nThe film also contains some first-rate special effects; utilized primarily during the visitations of the Christmas spirits. Blended in with the live action, they are both impressive and effective.\nThat the youthful nature of the audience was always in consideration is made apparent by Rizzo's repeated inquiries of Gonzo during the more \"intense\" scenes. Gonzo (Aka Charles Dickens) justifies the exposure as \"culture.\" Similarly, the more horrific elements of the story, such as the ghost of Christmas future, have been imagined with young viewers in mind.\nThe film introduces a handful of original songs written by Paul Williams. They range from average to excellent, yet all are staged with plenty of energy and enthusiasm to keep the story moving along.\n\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" is rated G, providing enough sophistication and simplicity to keep both parents and children alike entertained for the duration of the show. If this doesn't get you in the Christmas spirit, then \"Bah, Humbug\" to you.",

However I'm starting to believe that everything really is better with Muppets.  Who would have thought that putting a Muppet twist on the Charles Dickens classic would be so spectacular?  You'd expect it to be another cheesy take on the holiday story that is dumbed down for the kiddies, but instead it is one of the most faithful adaptations of the book.  In fact most of the lines of the human actors are straight from the source material and, while the Muppets do embellish some, the core of the story is entirely intact.  Yet what they do add is so much fun!\n\nA tip of the hat must be offered to the casting department for what they did here.  Michael Caine is the perfect Scrooge, and I'm actually surprised he hadn't played the role before on film.  However it's not just the human cast that rocks.  They found great voice actors to fill in for the late Jim Henson.  While it's noticeable that the voice of iconic characters like Kermit are slightly different, the personality is still there.  Plus the voices of the first 2 ghosts are perfect.  This movie continued the Muppet tradition perfectly, which is difficult without the founder himself.  Perhaps the Muppets will never be quite the same without Jim Henson, but the magic still lives on.\n\nThen we must talk about the wonderful music.  These tunes are catchy and very well written.  They add to the story and are inserted in a way that doesn't stop the pace, but just keeps it rolling.  However, perhaps the greatest aspect of this film is the addition of Gonzo and Rizzo as narrators.  Whenever the story hits a slow moment these guys come in and break the tension.  Their antics are hilarious and keep the humor in what is often a very serious drama.  I really can't muster anything negative to say about this film.  Muppet Christmas Carol is simultaneously a faithful adaptation of classic literature, and a laugh-out-loud romp.  Everything is better with Muppets!",

Ebeneezer Scrooge (Michael Caine) is visited by three spirits over the course of Christmas Eve, who help to bring back his festive joy.\r\n\r\nAs to be expected, aside from Caine, most of the main parts are played by the titular gang. So, we have Kermit as Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as his wife, The Great Gonzo as Charles Dickens, Statler and Waldorf as the brothers Jacob and Robert Marley (Yeah, I know...), even Kermit's nephew gets in on the action as Tiny Tim. The spirits are new creations, with the Henson team having resisted the temptation to have them played by others in the Muppet canon. A move that works well. It's hard to think the resonance of Scrooge seeing his potential would have been as strong if the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come had been played by original choice, Gonzo!\r\n\r\nDespite the prefix, Muppet, in the title, this is a very straightforward telling of Dicken's classic. It's not in the same vein as, say, The Great Muppet Caper, where Fozzie et al would break the fourth wall and give plot points away before they happen Caine recites lines from the set text with barely a knowing glance to the camera. However, don't think it's all straight faces, this is the Muppets. Expect talking vegetables, ice skating penguins, and hardcore republican Sam the Eagle desperately pretending to be English.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's a wonderful 90 minutes and deserves to be on anybody's list of Christmas viewing. But beware, as this is a straight-ish tale... Tiny Tim will die. If you thought you couldn't be moved by a felt pig and frog, then think again.",

It's a different kind of Muppet feature (though it has a sort of brother movie in MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND four years later) wherein the well-established characters are cast in the Dickens roles.  Their Muppet personalities are dominant, but in most cases they match up pretty well, such as the nebbish Kermit as Cratchit, the aggressively corny Robin as Tiny Tim and so on.  Some of them, such as Miss Piggy as Mrs. Cratchit, just play the Dickens characters as themselves.  A few Muppets make original appearances, like the Christmas spirits, and Michael Caine, though arguably shown up by his Muppet co-stars is serviceable and even great in some of his moments.  The major pitfall for nearly all Christmas Carol adaptations is the tendency to roll through the motions ineffectually, relying too heavily on the familiarity of the story and never really investing.  Now, the Muppets don't strive for big emotional investment, and here the story is mostly a showcase for their antics, so it's already immune to my common Christmas Carol criticism.  Overall, it's very entertaining, with good songs, humor, and just enough pathos.  It slows a bit in the Christmas Past sequence, but it survives.  Stick with the original theatrical version though, because as the DVD and Blu-Ray contain the theatrical and an extended cut, the extended is only different by one musical number, one that slows things to a dead halt for 4 minutes.",

The Muppet Christmas Carol is flawed and not exactly the smoothest ride I've sat through, but it has some entertaining songs as well as a good heart that makes it worthwhile.\r\n\r\nIf you know the story of A Christmas Carol then you know the plot of this movie. It stays fairly close to original, only adding in the muppets (with Gonzo as Charles Dickens) and some song numbers.\r\n\r\nThis was made after the passing of Jim Henson and Richard Hunt, two of the main puppeteers, so I wasn't expecting this film to be the best of the films. And it isn't, but it's not the worst either. The songs in the movie set the palette that both \"Muppet Treasure Island\" and \"Muppets in Space\" would follow years later and are pretty mixed bag. Some of the most entertaining of the songs were cut from the movie leaving us with some songs that are really good (\"Marley and Marley\" often entertains), but the majority sound almost exactly the same (\"One more sleep Till Christmas\", \"Thankful Heart\", and \"It Feels Like Christmas\" all sound almost exactly the same.) It's more than likely because they're trying to stay close to the era, but it's still a little disappointing for muppets. The jokes are a little stale, but there are some good jokes still left that entertain. Steve Whitmire (who has taken over the voice/puppetering of Kermit, Beaker, and Statler) does a good job for his first time and the other replacing puppeteers also do well. \r\n\r\nIf you're a huge fan of the muppets or have really little kids that you're trying to introduce to the Charles Dickens tale, this is a great way to start. It'll entertain kids long enough and still be fun for the adults. Most others may find it sort of silly and fun, but will be left wanting a little more. (Real Rating: 73%)",

The first of these, THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL, which recounts the familiar story of miserly Ebenezer Scrooge's fateful Christmas Eve journey to his past, present, and future, respectively, is a genuine delight. The marriage between Dickens' immortal tale and the Muppets' humor is perfectly realized in this 90-minute musical, highlighted by both a holiday-flavored score from Paul Williams, and especially a strong turn from Michael Caine as Scrooge. His performance deserves a shout-out. Instead of mugging the camera or going for laughs, he plays the role both well and with enthusiasm, even treating his Muppet co-stars like real people. This helps make the atmosphere of people and puppets interacting believable and it lends credibility to the emotional arc of the story. The film also has some surprisingly heartfelt, moving moments that are played very straight -- the scene in the future where the Cratchit's mourn their son's death is tearjerking, as is Scrooge's long-lost love's ballad \"When Love is Gone\" (cruelly cut from subsequent releases of the film). As for the Muppets, they are perfectly assigned to the roles they are chosen to portray. Kermit the Frog, surprise, plays Bob Cratchit, and of course Miss Piggy is his wife (and yes, we get to see their offspring), and in a particularly amusing touch, Gonzo portrays Charles Dickens, who narrates the story (using actual passages from Dickens' book) to a skeptical Rizzo the Rat. The chemistry between these two is hilarious and adds another layer of entertainment to the film. What's also fun is the way that they comment on the story's appeal for audiences and how storytellers are genuinely omniscient. Not only one of the best holiday family movies of all time, but one of the Muppets' best movies ever.",

I've reviewed a terrible direct-to-video Christmas movie they made with David Arquette, and it turns out I've never reviewed the good theatrical release Christmas movie.  Which I don't think I saw in the theatre; despite my family's intense association with the Muppets, we didn't see most of the movies in the theatre, for some reason.  I think probably it was our finances, though they would have straightened out by 1992.  At least mostly.  Still, I've owned this for years, about as long as any other Christmas movie in my collection, and I can't believe I've never gotten around to it.  I am fonder of it than I am of many of the classics, too; I'm not sure I own [i]It's a Wonderful Life[/i] and am not inclined to buy it if I don't.  It is also, as it happens, my favourite version of [i]A Christmas Carol[/i], though I'm notorious among my friends for the fact that I don't actually like Dickens.\r\n\r\nWe, like Charles Dickens (Gonzo the Great), know the story of [i]A Christmas Carol[/i] like the back of our hands.  Still, on the off chance that you don't, it is the story of Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine, or Sir Maurice Micklewhite if you'd rather).  He is a vicious and stingy man who mistreats and underpays his clerk, Bob Cratchit (Kermit the Frog).  He is never kind or merciful and mocks the very idea of Christmas joy.  One Christmas Eve, he is visited by the ghosts of his former partners, Jacob and Robert Marley (Statler and Waldorf).  They inform him that, if he is to escape their doom, he must change his ways.  To that end, he will be visited by three ghosts, the ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present, and Christmas Yet to Come.  They are what they sound like, and they show him what it sounds like they show him.  We learn what has made Ebenezer Scrooge who he is and what his eventual fate will be if nothing is changed.\r\n\r\nIt's true that I don't like Dickens and never really have.  It isn't actually true that he was paid by the word, not entirely--he was for some of his career but not all of it.  However, he did write serials and was therefore paid by the installment.  I think most of his works could benefit from judicious editing, and [i]A Christmas Carol[/i] is on that list.  (For the curious, I don't think [i]A Tale of Two Cities[/i] needs editing--when he babbles, he teaches history--and I think some books, [i]Great Expectations[/i] among them, cannot be saved.)  However, that doesn't mean he was entirely a bad writer, and my favourite part of this movie is that it captures the good lines which don't make it to other versions, because this version is Charles Dickens telling the story to Rizzo the Rat, which leaves in \"Scrooge climbed the stairs, caring not a button for the darkness.  Darkness was cheap, and Scrooge liked it.\"  This is in fact great character description, which is more important than the ludicrously whimsical names so many Dickens characters have.\r\n\r\nI think it was an excellent decision to cast a human as the main character in this, and I think they cast the perfect human.  Disney, when they did the story, had a character to slip into the role--for heaven's sake, they named him Scrooge in the first place.  But there is no Muppet for the part, and I think creating one would have been the wrong decision.  And while I know that Michael Caine is in fact a funny, charming guy, that's not the Scrooge he is able to portray and does so here.  His own origins were much lower than Scrooge's, but he seems to have a great feel for the nature of the character.  He is a somber man, a dark and dour man.  His life did not go the way he wanted it to, and it soured him.  He didn't deal with it; he held it in and let it shape him.  And Michael Caine creates that Scrooge, lets us into that Scrooge's mind and life.  It's a role played by dozens of men in TV and the movies, and I think Michael Caine is one of the best.\r\n\r\nIt does irk me that they trimmed the romantic ballad, and it irks me even more that the DVD only puts it back in if you choose to watch the film fullscreen.  This strikes me as backward; completists watch things widescreen, obviously.  I can see how little kids might find the song boring, but I think it is an important moment for the character.  This is the first turning point for Scrooge, the moment where he realizes that maybe he'd made a mistake somewhere back in his life.  He's still determined to live with that, I think, but he is finally now forced to acknowledge it, whereas he's probably spent every day since it happened pretending it hadn't.  So.  Does it slow things down?  Sure.  But I don't necessarily think that's always wrong.  There are several movies wherein my favourite scene is one that slows things down, but they're often vital to the story for all that.  And after all, it's not as though [i]A Christmas Carol[/i] is exactly non-stop action even without the song in the middle.",

    "rt_summary": "The Muppets perform the classic Dickens holiday tale, with Kermit the Frog playing Bob Cratchit, the put-upon clerk of stingy Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine). Other Muppets -- Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Fozzie Bear and Sam the Eagle -- weave in and out of the story, while Scrooge receives visits from spirits of three Christmases -- past, present and future. They show him the error of his self-serving ways, but the miserable old man seems to be past any hope of redemption and happiness."
