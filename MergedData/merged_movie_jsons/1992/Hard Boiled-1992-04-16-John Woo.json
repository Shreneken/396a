It's full of the most stylized gunfights ever seen and Chow Yun Fat is the definition of cool.  The full blown finale defies description.  Someone once called it an action fan's wet dream.

            "content": "Hard Boiled is my number 1 favorite Hong Kong John Woo action film that I love to death! I absolutely love this movie to death I love it. It is one of my personal favorite movies. Hard Boiled (1992) is literally John Woo's best Hong Kong action film ever made of all time! The movie is a hard-core action, I have ever seen. It is actually the best Hong Kong action film for me. It belongs right up there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) the best action classic film of all time. Chow Yun-Fat, toothpick in mouth, a gun in each hand. That's all of the plot you need to know. In fact, this is THE best pure action epic ever filmed. This is my film, my personal favorite Hong Kong action film of all time.\"Give the guy a gun and he's superman, give him two and he's God.\"Not even Jackie Chan can mess with this film or beat it. The only Jackie Chan film that is close to this film is Police Story. In my opinion Hard Boiled is John Woo's best HK action movie from the 90's and a true masterpiece along with Hard Target (1993) his first American movie with Jean-Claude Van Damme in the main role. Chow Yun-Fat stars as Tequila, a cop hell-bent on bringing down the gun smugglers responsible for his partner's death. He teams up with an undercover cop Tony Leung whose secret identity as a Triad hit man hangs on thread.Hard Boiled is my favorite John Woo's HK action movies. This action movie with twists around, The Hong Kong Cinema Hard Boiled has everything in it, no CGI, the stunts are real, the explosions are bigger and the plot of the film is amazing you can get in to the story without guessing what is going to happened and what the plot is about. The warehouse scenes and a shooting a motorcycles in an explosions from Tequila is my favorite scenes in the movie. Sometimes to me it come for this movie is similar to Miami Vice when Tony Leung was undercover cop on a boat he remind me on Sonny Crockett, but the shout outs in this film are awesome. Just Miami Vice TV series where more about drug cartels, this is arms dealer weapons about triads. The stunts are real and very dangerous. There was a hospital siege which was actually Die Hard in a hospital. Hard Boiled is a classic action film from Hong Kong, they don't make movies like this anymore. Phillip Chan is also in this film which I forgot to mention in my review Philip Chan was also in Van Damme's Bloodsport. You have a great action sequences in the tea house, where the guns are hitting in the bird cage, he shoots a dozen guys and saves a baby, the hospital sequences are real. The first time I saw this film I had no idea that how great film it is, the greatest movie of all time in the cinema. John Woo is also as a bartender in this film. The hospital sequences for me is real, the action is real. The best Chow Yun-Fat and John Woo movie ever made. Hard Boiled is a 1992 Hong Kong action film written by Barry Wong and directed by John Woo. It stars Chow Yun-fat as Inspector \"Tequila\" Yuen, Tony Leung Chiu-Wai10/10 I love this movie to death it is my favorite Hong Kong Action film and it is my second favorite film that I love. It is also my number 2 favorite action film.",

Only Face/Off has really come close to the type of style that he displayed in Hong Kong - Hard Boiled being a perfect example.Hard Boiled sees cop \"Tequila\" Yuen (Chow Yun Fat) lose his partner in a violent shoot out in a tea-house and aims to bring revenge on the gangs causing chaos on the streets. During the film he come across a deadly assassin Tony (Tony Leung) who may or may not be an undercover police officer.The film's plot is pretty good considering with several double crosses, good twists and the bonding relationship of Leung and Fat. However this is all about the action scenes and these are spectacular. Full of highly stylish violence, double handed gunplay and exciting near misses. Fat and Leung are both excellent in their roles but the stars here are the action scenes.The only problem with this is that it is very violent and may be a turn off for some. That said if you're watching a John Woo Hong Kong film then you're probably not that bothered about a bit of stylish killing.",

            "content": "When someone mentions, \"action movie\", the first thing that gets in their minds is guns, fighting, blood, and so on. The people who they instantly think are the likes of Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Willis, even the hammy Seagal, Snipes and Van Damme! Not until recently, I found myself confused about which action movie is the greatest. For me, the ultimate action hero is Arnold Schwarzenegger, but I cannot seem to find a perfect action movie.Until I began checking up films of John Woo, and stumbled upon this baby...Only a handful of action movies can compare to this, but most fail to be better. This movie IS the epitome of an action movie, it has never-ending thrill-a-minute stylish action sequences that just make your jaw drop in amazement. It has a body count that can be compared to most epic movies, and it has an excellent atmosphere to further enhance the story. The action sequences are a combination of outrageous, unreal and cool at the same time.The story is weak, but not very. It provides the basis for the action to unfold. And boy, when it does, you'll have a blast! I mean, they took the premise of a basic cops and robbers tale and highly jazzed it up somehow to deliver this truly authentic and unique piece of movie making. This is not just a movie which action fans alone should see, this movie deserves to be sought and recognized by other highly-ranked film critics.The director, John Woo, ups the ante on this one. After glorifying the gangsters in his \"Better Tomorrow\" movies and \"The Killer\" (which almost is as good as Hard Boiled), he decides to glorify the cops, and he does that, but with bigger elements. He doesn't show realism and humanism in this film, because he wanted to emphasize and slightly exaggerate on how big the elements can go. The criminals would kill lots of innocent people to complete their nefarious deeds, and the violence is hyper-stylized to the point where it becomes necessary to subdue the criminals using that technique. He combines unique Chinese Opera dancing techniques and dramatic shootouts to create stylistically significant and exhilarating gunfights for the eyes and ears to behold. The pace is hyper kinetic as Woo relentlessly dishes out whatever tricks he has up his sleeve, much to our delight.Chow Yun-Fat's status as an action hero is immortalized here in his performance as super cop Tequila, who dodges bullets and shoot crooks while cooing a baby to sleep and covering his eyes from the ensuing violence. This scene also signifies the violence in Hong Kong back in the days, but highly stylized to create a superb action experience. Tony Leung is also splendid as the disillusioned undercover cop, who seeks to regain his humanity and reputation. The rest of the cast gave good performances, with kudos to Anthony Wong as the sadistic villain who will do anything to get what he wants (fully exampled during the film's climax), and Cheng Jue-Luh as one of the most badassed villains ever, Mad Dog.The atmosphere of the movie further improves its credibility. John Woo's interests are shown through Tequila's passion of jazz and the beautiful and dark cinematography of Hong Kong, which, when combined together, gives an effect that signifies two different worlds, that is, the life of a cop and the life of a criminal. Also, the music score by Michael Gibbs is great, with a perfect melodramatic jazz score during dramatic scenes, and to pumping synthesizers, gritty and haunting scores during the majority of the action sequences. All of these add up to the amazing elements of the movie to make it even better.Overall, I cannot think of any other action movie than this. This is THE action movie for film-goers, critics, and action junkies alike. This perfectly shot ballet of blood and bullets is an example of how great and reliable Asian movies can be, when we are finally tired of clich\u00e9 elements from Hollywood. Mr. Woo, Your Midas Touch has its full effect here. This movie is one of the greatest action movies ever made. And I will stand by that decision for as long as I live.A must see.9/10Delton",

While most modern action films (Smokin' Aces for one) aspire to some sort of grand intelligence while providing shoot-outs and explosions, this film is a reminder of times when action films suffered no such pretensions. Crowds of people are gunned down without explanation and the smallest things explode for little or no reason. The bad guys are massively exaggerated cutthroat caricatures and the good guys never miss. Scenes of Fat and Leung running down corridors are inexplicably shot in slow motion. And, for all of these reasons, it is amazing. It's fast, it's exciting, and it never lets up.Hard Boiled is loud, exciting, and, thanks to quite terrible dubbing and a ludicrous early 90's soundtrack, often unintentionally hilarious. It is a film that places entertainment firmly ahead of plausibility and logic, and is quite frankly awesome for it.",

            "review_title": "\"Mr. Action\" Delivers Again",
            "content": "Master of Action John Woo delivers once again with his hard-hitting, action-packed thriller `Hard Boiled,' starring Chow Yun-Fat as a veteran cop known as `Tequila,' Hong Kong's answer to San Francisco's own `Dirty Harry.' In this one, an undercover officer infiltrates a gangland Triad dealing arms, and when a rival gang threatens to take over, Tequila joins in the melee, and once it begins the action never stops until the last of the credits have rolled off into the recesses of the darkened screen.  Along the way there are tests of loyalty, mistaken identities and a staggering display of superbly choreographed violence. \tThere's a couple of plot twists, but it's a rather straightforward story, and as usual, Woo melds it with the action with his trademark style and perfection.  The action sequences are incredibly well staged and delivered, but so exceedingly violent that it passes beyond reality at times (especially during the climax) into a somewhat surreal state of being, only to be ultimately drawn back in again by the grounded core of the story. It's a fine line that Woo treads successfully time after time in an arena in which many other `action' directors have foundered.  A consummate professional, Woo knows exactly what he wants and what works, and he doesn't quit until he gets it.  Among the directors of the `action' genre, he is quite simply the best there has ever been. \tAs the somewhat jaded and `hard Boiled' cop, the charismatic Chow Yun-Fat demonstrates that if Jackie Chan can team up with Chris Tucker, he most certainly could find a place at Eastwood or Gibson's side.  He has the attitude and the look that make his character credible, which helps anchor Woo's art in reality, albeit a rather violent one.  As with the `Dirty Harry' or `Lethal Weapon' movies, it gives the audience someone to whom they can relate and root for.  And it's all buoyed with symbolism and metaphor and Woo's impeccable sense of timing and deft and sparing use of slow motion, which in his hands becomes an extremely effective tool. \tThe supporting cast includes Tony Leung Chiu Wai (Alan),Teresa Mo (Teresa Chang), Philip Chan (Superintendent Pang), Hoi-Shan Kwan (Mr. Hui) and Philip Kwok (Mad Dog).  The true brilliance of Woo's films lies in the fact that he never sacrifices story for action, but instead blends the two together to create a whole that is artistically rendered (his action sequences are something akin to visual poetry) and  substantial, rather than having an action film that-- like so many others of the genre-- is hollow inside.  Like his earlier film, `The Killer,' which also starred Yun-Fat, `Hard Boiled' pushes the envelope and will keep you on the edge, right along with the characters in the film, right until the very end.  As with all of Woo's movies, this one is a satisfying foray into the intense, cutting edge `Action' world of one of Cinema's Master directors, and a must-see for any true film buff.  I rate this one 9/10.",

            "content": "If you're the average IMDB reader, you probably enjoy a good action movie every now and then, but you approach action films with a certain caution and skepticism (I can't blame you, even though I am an action junkie myself). If you're that kind of viewer, the score I would give (for you) for Hard-boiled is a 6.5. To you, this is a prototypical \"good\" action movie -- intense, perfectly executed, original action, shown to the tune of a forgettable and occasionally insulting story.To action junkies, this movie is an easy 9, because the only thing that really matters is that the action is superb and the other elements, if not stellar, don't detract enough from the action to really make a difference.Splitting the difference, we get an 8/10 -- an outstanding score.Hard-boiled is the ultimate John Woo / Chow-Yun Fat collaboration. Chow plays an uncompromising Hong-Kong cop who \"works\" together with an undercover cop (an EXCELLENT Tony Leung) in the triad gun-running organization. Now, when I say \"works,\" I mean \"launches thousands of bullets, slugs, and explosive projectiles into HUNDREDS of mafioso baddies.\" This film has a RIDICULOUS amount of gunplay. Pretty much everyone you see on screen dies at some point. Those that don't die often come perilously close to dying, before getting up and moving on as if nothing had happened. The gunmen in this film have magical powers that enable them to fire about 100 rounds from a Beretta clip without having to reload. And the top good guys seem only vaguely concerned about the loss of innocent life -- at a teahouse, or a large hospital -- except for tiny baby life, of course -- as long as they get to kill the top triad guy. And the story... well... not incoherent, but completely implausible at many points.Realistic? NO. Is the story good? NO. Is this relevant? Not particularly. You see, one watches a John Woo movie for two things: Strong lead characters; strong lead characters shooting their way to success in surreally choreographed gunplay scenes. \"But what if I don't want to watch a movie just for that?\" Well, this one forces you to! If you can stand action at all, you'll be glued to the screen the entire time. Chow is a good actor, and Tony Leung is probably even better here -- they make the obligatory story sequences compelling, and when they start firing their weapons, you can't take your eyes away. Slow-motion highlights bullets, explosions, and plaster and sparks flying every which way, even as the actors and stunt men acrobatically move through the air while evading enemy fire. It's a little hard to describe how great this really is, so you just have to take my word for it. Suffice it to say that no one does gunplay like Woo, although everyone and their mother tries. (James Cameron's technique with heavy weapons and muscular guys is the other way to do gunplay, and is great in its own, more limited right.) If you're a fan of Face/Off, an American John Woo movie that actually does not suck, you know what to expect -- but multiply that by 100.The story and realism are not good, but this makes no difference. Suspend disbelief, and go with the flow, and you're treated to prime-quality action. There ARE however, elements of this film that drag it down quite a bit. Most of them, to me, concern Woo's depictions of violence. It's obvious the man revels in blood. Several times, you see blood spurt copiously and unnaturally -- onto a wall, a desk, even a man's or baby's face. While the action is generally frantic and quick, these shots are slow, deliberate, and in-your-face. Why? To cater to our basest instincts, like a cheap slasher film. With action scenes and character acting done so well, it's embarrassing to watch such gratuitous gore added into the mix. But that's not all! The script's \"good\" characters are not morally corrupt: You can see them actively trying to avoid other cops or innocent bystanders. This is superficial. The characters aren't corrupt; the final script is. At least 50 innocent people, including patients at a hospital, die violently. The film doesn't display this as a horrific event, but rather as part of the scenery, cannon fodder; the film even gets pretty despicable amusement from this, particularly in one scene involving a baby (don't worry! the baby is not hurt).Technically speaking, the movie is perfect. Aesthetically speaking, the same is true, with the exception of the music, which is extremely cheesy at times (the sax that suddenly kicks in during \"emotional\" moments is unbearable -- is that some kind of HK movie thing, or what?).Such negatives are distracting. Your ability to ignore such distractions will ultimately determine if you give this a 5 or a 9. Were it a little more humane, I'd give it a 9. As it stands, I give it: 8/10.",

Having seen and loved HARD TARGET and FACE/OFF, I had heard about how good this film was, and I literally couldn't wait to see it after all the good words were said. Did it fulfil my expectations in the end? Hell, yes! The police procedural style plot will be familiar to anyone who's a fan of Hong Kong crime thrillers. We get an on-the-edge cop, and his murky world of villains, grasses, and untrustworthy allies. It's a simplistic plot in the extreme, averagely written, nothing much to set it aside from all the others. Chow Yun-Fat is good, yes, but he hardly sets the screen alight.And then comes the action. Starting off with a tea-house shoot-out, it ranges from massive showdowns in warehouses to the forty-five minute, hospital-set climax. During this time in which my opinion of the film completely changed. The hospital shoot-out has to be one of the best moments ever in an action film, it just goes on and on as criminal after criminal is shot, no, riddled with bullets, glass smashes, and literally loads of people die. Then the building gets set on fire, and babies are being rescued while Chow runs around shooting people with two guns in one of the longest, yet most consistently exciting action sequences ever filmed.I loved it. I hope, in the course of things, that I can discover more films which equal this kind of spectacle. Since I wrote the above comments I've rewatched HARD-BOILED a number of times and it's grown on me every time, offering perfectly shot action, full of excitement, highly stylised and never letting up on the violence and bloodshed.

This isn't your standard buddy cop fair like Lethal Weapon with tons of cheesey lines, dorky action and sappy side stories. The dialogue is insightful the action is the best ever and the side stories are well thought out, if a bit abbreviated (due to lack of time to shoot John Woo admits).Tequila is trying to deal with a failed relationship and the death of his partner, Tony is torn against blowing his cover and defending his honor and the Lieutenant insists on playing it by the book even though it isn't fair.John Woo said he made this film in honor of the men and women of the Hong Kong police force and the good work they do.

Their primary nemesis will be a brash, psychotic young mobster named Johnny Wong (Anthony Chau-Sang Wong, \"The Painted Veil\"), who's keeping his not-so-secret stash of weaponry in an unlikely location.This viewer has seen the films made by HK action specialist John Woo in America, but had still needed to experience the original genre films with which he established himself. Suffice it to say, this one lives up to its reputation. We've seen many expertly executed action sequences in the genre over the years, but here Woo takes this element to a whole other level. There's a degree of intensity here that is a true revelation. Squeamish audience members will be dismayed by the sheer volume of beautiful bloodletting on display, but people not bothered by gore will be amazed. This is an *operatically* violent film in which even heroes don't emerge unscathed. Lots of characters will be required to take their lumps before this is over.And yet, the story is an engaging and very involved one, giving its participants some key moments. One of Tequilas' defining characteristics is his affinity for jazz music, the path he would have chosen had he not decided to become a cop instead.Chow and Leung are vibrant performers, and get some great chemistry going. The supporting cast is first-rate, with the distinctively featured Wong making a memorable impression as the bad guy. The only female in a featured role is the gorgeous Teresa Mo as Tequilas' co-worker and girlfriend, but she gets to do some heroic things herself during the extended finale in a hospital.And this finale is not just one set piece, but a whole series of them. It's so dazzling and explosive that you're hardly able to catch your breath.The sight of guys leaping sideways with guns in both hands certainly has become quite the iconic image for fans of the genre.

            "content": "I love Asian films. However, after seeing this film, I have no desire to see any more films like this one. While the film generally has very positive reviews and a very good overall rating of 7.8, this is probably very deceiving, as I ONLY think die-hard ultra-violent/ultra-action loving people would enjoy this type of film and they traditionally flock to John Woo films. The average non-violence junkie has probably never heard of Woo or if they have, have no interest in such extremely graphic and violent fare.The first twenty or so minutes of the film, I actually enjoyed, though, of course, the film WAS mega-violent. At least there was some style and some sense of purpose to the killing. However, after about 50% of the movie was past, the rest of the film was one long, long, long extended scene of carnage. It was as if you took EVERY Rambo, Die-Hard, Death Wish and Steven Segal movie AS WELL AS THE KOREAN WAR AND WWII and combined them into one movie! There is no possible way to keep count, but the number of good guys, bad guys and assorted innocent bystanders killed in the movie seems like it must top 1000 (and this is NOT an exaggeration). Initially, this had a big impact on me, however, after a while it became downright boring. After all, how many dead people, fake blood and slow-motion death scenes can any NORMAL person take before they either turn off the film, get sick or become bored.The bottom line is this is a wonderful film if you really could care less about plot and just want 100% carnage. Period. Oh, and the plot device of having all the babies in the middle of the firefight near the end just seemed like a cheap way to build excitement. I mean, think about it, one minute the hero is cuddling a baby and the next he blows away a few bad guys, then he nuzzles the little tyke. Is this meant to be tender or poignant?! Gimme a break. This movie is dumb and I really do wonder about the type of person who wants a steady diet of this. Okay, now feel free to hit me with all your \"NOT HELPFUL\" comments--I am STILL right about this film!By the way, although I hated the movie, I really want to get a gun like the heroes had. You know, the semiautomatic pistol that can fire 10, 20 or even 30 times without needing to be reloaded!! And I want to find out where they got the hand grenades that when they blow up, they only injure bad guys--even though the heroes might only be a couple feet away from the blast!!",

Besides , it happens some romantic touches when his girlfriend (Terese Mo) asks him insistently marry themselves .The picture contains frenetic action , spectacular explosions , emotions , incredible gun-down and lots of explicit and grisly violence .

Fairly awesome vehicle Chow Yun Fat as a two-fisted police inspector , while Tony Leung goes undercover to infiltrate an organized crime ring . Chow gets to play splendidly a heavy and Tony Leung makes a terrific tough hit man . Film displays an overlong showdown in the hospital with ultra-violent confrontation and explosive set pieces. John Woo , who also wrote the screenplay , appears as an employee in a Jazz club where Chow plays music .

            "content": "\"Give the guy a gun and he's Superman. Give him two and he's God\"Chow Yun Fat is Tequila, Hong Kong Police Sergeant. Tony Leung is undercover cop, Tony(..using the alias Alan), who has successfully infiltrated a triad organization. They join forces to take down a ruthless arms dealing mafioso, Johnny Wong(Anthony Wong)who has a large cache of weapons within a vault underneath Maples Hospital. If Tequila and Tony are not successful in stopping Wong, he'll slaughter the innocent lives of the entire hospital to save his own neck.If you want to see how to make a real action movie, see John Woo's early work in Hong Kong before vacating for America. HARD-BOILED has some astonishing action-set pieces which will have fans of ultra-violence salivating. Bodies are mangled and pulverized by bullets as well as major destruction of the buildings where shootouts occur. Even before you can settle into the movie, Woo hits it out of the ball park with the superb shootout in Wyndham teahouse where Tequila and his partner trade gunfire with arms smugglers where many innocent customers(..and the poor birds in their cages chirp-chirping away)are caught in the crossfire. As you'd expect, Tequila loses his partner(..has become quite a clich\u00e9, I admit)but his murder of the one responsible(..while covered in flour!)is quite satisfying. Then a little later we get the successful raid of Wong(..desiring complete control of the selling of illegal arms)over his older competitor, Mr Hoi(Kwan Hoi Sang)inside a large warehouse where guns are hidden in automobiles as a means to traffic them to locations. This is were Hoi's best assassin, Alan, \"betrays\" him joining forces with his rival. You see practically all of Hoi's men massacred by Wong before Tequila(..moving within the warehouse unannounced)intrudes upon their success by blasting away at them. Not only does Tequila contend with men on motorcycles and Alan(..who is so skilled as a shootist he knows how NOT to hit Tequila), but with Wong's main henchman, Mad Dog(Philip Kwok, quite a memorable, intimidating heavy). Again, many men die as sparks and explosions emanate with bodies blasted apart as Tequila, Tony, and Mad Dog masterfully evade ammunition aimed their way by flipping and sliding over vehicles and through windows.The final dazzling, mesmerizing set-piece(..which occurs over an hour!)is set within Maples Hospital as Tequila and Tony(..now fully aligned after Tequila's informant, Foxy, played by Wei Tung, is pummeled, shot and soon killed by Mad Dog)must duel with Wong's army of sadistic hoods who will shoot anybody that stands in the way of their success. By the end, the hospital resembles the skeletal remains of a building you'd see in Beirut. Woo establishes Wong as an absolute monster..he even machine guns cripples with crutches who are in his way! His men actually blow away patients and medical personnel trying to get out of the hospital..and soon opening fire on SWAT members attempting to evacuate infants out from an upper floor window! This film features some of the most amazing gun battles I have ever had a pleasure to witness. Exhiliarting ways Tequila and Tony are able to avoid the contact of bullets aimed in their direction. I've never seen such damage to the insides of buildings before this film. One entire sequence has Tequila and Tony moving floor to floor dropping their adversaries..it's so incredibly shot and magnificently presented in epic form. It doesn't get much better than this. Also, featuring Teresa Mo as Tequila's girlfriend, and Philip Chan as Superintendent Pang(..always at odds with Tequila for he stands to ruin such a difficult operation that has went well until he Tequila started interfering). John Woo himself(..who isn't a bad actor!)portrays a bartender and former cop, whose jazz joint Tequila plays his clarinet from time to time..wonderful jazz score adds the right mood to many melodramatic scenes. Everpresent in John Woo's work is injecting humanity into his films, not matter how blood-thirsty they are. Where Tequila must defend himself against baddies with one hand while cradling a baby is nothing short of amazing, particularly how he escapes an exploding building! This film only adds to the iconic status of Chow Yun Fat and Tony Leung, even before their greatest works for such directors as Ang Lee, Wong Kar Wai, and Zhang Yimou.",

            "content": "There can be few cop movies which can boast a body count higher than Spielberg's entire Omaha Beach Landing in the first 5 minutes. Possibly no cop film except, of course, Hard Boiled.Hard Boiled is John Woo's Hong Kong swansong, and many regard it as his finest film. It stars young Chow Yun-Fat and Tony Leung Chiu Wai, two of the finest actors in Hong Kong; the usual \"maverick cop hunts big boss bad guy\" routine; oh, and lots and lots of blood. Imagine a slightly more realistic version of the Arnie midi-gun sequence in T2 \u0096 more realistic in that when someone starts firing a midi-gun and blowing up cars, the cops get killed. That, in a nutshell, is the plot of Hardboiled. All two hours and six minutes of it.The plot \u0096 well that makes about as much sense as a wolverine in a fruit salad, but I'm not sure addicts of HK Cinema care too much about that. Tequila (maverick cop and certified nutcase with a heart of gold - Chow Yun Fat) shouts and swears at his boss, shoots up bad guys, gets drunk and ends up (implausibly, if iconically) in a hospital, holding a baby in one hand and a shot gun in the other. Tony Leung lives Miami Vice-Style on a boat (alas, no Alligator) while committing murder, getting paid by the HK Police, and wearing loose tee-shirts with white jackets.If all this sounds like style over substance \u0096 erm\u0085 that's 'cos it is.The film definitely has its moments. In fact, like most John Woo films, it seems mostly to be a series of moments strung together to feature length. It also has some real grit. I appreciated the scene where a regular cop kills an undercover cop by mistake in a raid. Realistic, and not something that Hollywood would ever broach (the closest to this is in a truly class film like The Reservoir Dogs).However, while this is a true Hong Kong bullets and ballet classic, Western audiences are likely to feel slightly cheated by its totally bonkers story. Less bonkers than many, perhaps, but that's not really saying much.I enjoyed it. It was a guilty pleasure, but I'm man enough to admit I enjoyed it. John Woo has yet to make a better film. And has never yet made a sensible one, so don't blame him or me if you find it a bit daft. 5/10 (but watchable).",

It is about why Hong Kong is no longer a decent place to live (from Woo's point of view) and also a tongue-in-cheek celebration of the very violence that his critics so abhorred.It is the best written of Woo's Hong Kong films, the best edited, the best acted, and, yes, the best directed. It is unabashedly 'take-no-prisoners' in its attitude to action - Chow Yun Fat's non-James-Bond performance as an unstoppable cop pretty much out-does every other action Hero in film, except, maybe, Sean Connery's Bond in \"Doctor No\". The film starts with an over-the-top gun battle in a Hong Kong eatery, and ends with a WAY-over-the-top all out war between cops and robbers in a hospital - all with smart attitude, smart looks, smart direction. Believe me, the bodies can't be counted, but you never have time to worry about it.Yeah, there is the usual Woo sentimentalism, and Tony Leung's performance is a bit heavy-handed; but the positives are so positive - for gun-play action film fans, anyway - that the negatives are easily discounted and forgotten.Put your brain on hold and get ready for a wild ride - Woo knows we want the real deal, and he delivers.",

            "content": "Basically Woo's version of a Hollywood action picture: in here you'll find elements of 48 HOURS, LETHAL WEAPON, and DIE HARD, among others. Tequila (Chow Yun-Fat), one of those \"rebellious cops who get the job done, just not by the book\" that you meet often in the movies, is investigating a violent group of gun runners. He doesn't know, though, that one of them (Tony Leung) is an undercover cop. There's not much by way of plot -- those elements that aren't formulaic (tough rebellious cop, neglected girlfriend, irascible superior) don't make much sense (guns in a hospital? In a secret James Bond-like cellar under the morgue?) If you can turn that part of your brain off, though, and just approach the movie as pure imagery, you will see some of the most creative action sequences ever caught on film. Guns seem to fire an infinite number of rounds, endless numbers of bad guys meet their reward, our heroes take ridiculous amounts of damage and still keep swinging -- and it's all choreographed with a balletic grace reminiscent of Gene Kelly. Add to that Woo's moody, Melville-like camera work and the shadowy, somber cinematography and you have a true action spectacle, one that's even more effective if you're lucky enough to see it on the big screen.\nA classic, one of the greatest action movies ever made. Anyone seriously interested in the genre should check it out. Yun-Fat is his usual stylish self as Tequila, but the real star of the show is Tony Leung, who's very effective as the tormented undercover cop unsure of his identity. Woo made better movies, but he never made a better action movie.",

            "content": "Hard Boiled is an action movie any self-respecting genre fan has to see at least once. Even if they're not a big fan of John Woo's work (though how any action fan can escape the wonder of The Killer or A Better Tomorrow is hard to see), this could provide a good kick in the ass for those jaded on CGI effects and drab story lines. It's a good indicator what kind of thriller it will be from the opening scenes and the action set-piece. I thought to myself, 'I can't tell anymore who is the cop and who is the usual Woo gangster', but that's part of the point here. It's a twist-and-turn pretzel machine of a movie where you can't really be sure when a double-cross will take place (especially with the character Tony played by Tony Leung, who early in the film is called Alan), but at the end of it who really remembers the plot to this? I can just about remember The Killer, but only because it's ripped-off from Le Samourai.In this case Hard Boiled is about cops on the trail of gun runners. Simple enough, except that the plot keeps thickening as traitors are discovered, bodies keep piling up, and the head lieutenant or whomever keeps calling out Tequila (Chow Yun Fat in one of his coolest performances) for being so reckless and a loner on the job. But when you're like Tequila, who can come blazing down a staircase or flying through a roof or just about anywhere with two guns firing precisely at all times (and always with that toothpick held on for dear life), can you blame him for being suspicious of both the cops and the gangsters? After a while, perhaps Woo means for us to see, the 'glamorization' of the police here- as opposed to his sort of glamorization of quintessential Hong Kong gangsters in his 80's films- is really not all that much to take in. Except for those little nice moments, like humming American songs to get codes for messages passed along the enemy.Woo at his best takes a beat that should be familiar to anyone who has ever seen a SUPER shoot-em-up. I don't mean just a regular shoot-em-up, but the kind of deal that more than likely inspired Michael Bay. Except the difference between Bay and Woo is a sense of modulating excess with cinema style. Bay doesn't know when to quit and is too relentless, while Woo's action set pieces are like endless rivers of guns and blood and bullets and bodies that becomes exhilarating. Some may find it too much, or that it becomes repetitive despite it being so well-shot and choreographed. But if you can key into Woo's aesthetic from the start, which should in any other movie be the climax, you're good to go all the way through that almost half hour climax at the hospital.And it does become so relentless and reckless in that hospital finale. It's like Woo and his effects people and stunt coordinators decided at one point to just keep going and to not stop, to see how far they could take it (ultimately the body count of the movie is about 300, more than most war movies). Thankfully Chow Yun Fat and a young Tony Leung are more than game for it, they have fun with their roles as a bad-ass take-no-s*** cop and an undercover rat against a guy in an eye-patch and other psycho killers. And when they're put into the mayhem of Woo's carnage it becomes a lot of fun. Nothing is taken exactly TOO seriously, thankfully, and that's another sign of its brilliance. When it comes time to get to all of those babies left behind after everyone else gets out of the hospital or is laid to waste, you'll see what I mean (and how it's later ripped off, lovingly, in Shoot em Up with Clive Owen).It's a take no prisoners buddy-cop movie that can stand tall with some of the best in American film for humor and pathos (i.e. Lethal Weapon) while standing on its own as a quintessential HK flick of its time. This means some of it is a bit dated (you'll think listening to the music that Don Johnson is missing somewhere in the action), but only in a shallow sort of way. Hard Boiled can kick you in the face with a ton of bullets and shrapnel, and the kick some more, and in the right place and time it hits just the spot.",

And I'm not only talking about the slo-mo \"shootings\" ...What made most of John Woo's HK movies for me great, were a few things. Peckinpah's slo-mo thing aside, which he uses to a great extent and very masterfully, I always liked that his movies had strong themes and characters. There is no one who is cooler than Chow Yun Fat in a John Woo movie. But it's not about being cool. It's about friendship, loyalty, betrayal and respect! Sometimes even respect for your foe! As also shown in this movie.The action is insane, yes. It's also theatrical. It's not a secret that Woo is a fan of the Opera, which is also shown in his action choreography! But if you wouldn't care for the characters, that wouldn't really matter.John Woo and Chow Yun Fat are for me the equivalent for John Huston and John Wayne. Or Scorsese & De Niro (lately it's Scorsese and Di Caprio). Woo and Fat could be working together soon (rumors are heard all the time, maybe they do actually filming or prepping a movie right now) and I am sure I will enjoy their movie! As I enjoyed this movie!I'm also sure I will enjoy the game that will be based on this movie. It's called (Woo's) Stranglehold (due to be released Fall 2007) and you can play the character Tequila (aka Chow Yun Fat's alter ego)! Now that's cool! :o)",

I disagree with reviews who give this movie 3, 1, 4 or even 6 I think they don't know how to a rate a good 90's action movies . This is to me the best Chinese action movie from director John Woo that he directed and his last one. I love Lat sau san taam to death. It is one of my personal favorite action films of all time. The action sequences are among the greatest ever filmed. It is my second favorite John Woo movie. I only watch Hard Target (1993), this one Hard Boiled (1992), Broken Arrow (1996) that gets crap and is so underrated and Paycheck (2003) those are the onlyJohn Woo movies I watch. I don't watch Mission: Impossible II and Red Cliff I don't watch those movies. Face/Off (1997) I hate and The Killer I don't watch eaither anymore.Chow Yun-Fat is iconic super cop Insp. 'Tequila' Yuen from the Hong Kong Police Force with two guns and toothpick in his mouth, a cop hell-bent on bringing down the gun smugglers responsible for his partners's death. He teams up with undercover cop Alan (Tony Leung) to stop a Triad leader Johny Wong (Anthony Wong).Huge John Woo fan I love Hard Target which is my number 1 action film of all time, Hard Boiled is my second favorite action film from John Woo, Broken Arrow (1996) would be third favorite film and of course Paycheck (2003 that would be my fourth favorite film from John Woo). I don't like his other Chinese action films like are The Killer, Face-Off I think it is a horrible garbage action film I hate that film, A Better Tomorrow 1 and 2 they both suck. Never seen Red Cliff, I hate Windtalkers I don't know any of his other movies. Hard Boiled was John Woo's last Chinese film after that he come to America making American films his first American action film was Hard Target with Jean-Claude Van Damme my favorite action film of all time.Chow Yun-Fat is an excellent movie star love his acting performance in here never seen Tiger on Beat (1988) would love to see that film but I can't get it anywhere. I like The Replacement Killers (1998) which he did 5 - 6 years after this movie come out. Full Contact (Xia dao Gao Fei) (1992) right after this movie he did, I like. This movie is a cop action film it is only dediceted to Hong Kong Police Force and only to the police. Actor Philip Chan who was a real captain by the police force said this movie was an actual police work and it is realistic film.You have ton's of action and shooutouts like are: teahouse shootout, gun warehouse shootout with Tequila bunjy jumping uses with his automatic machine gun one during his one-man assault on the warehouse (firing it at Johnny Wong's men as he rappels down from the roof of the warehouse). I love Tequila shooting an assassins on motorcycle the motorcycle explodes. Their is 45 minutes in the hospital. You have a real practical effects ton's of gun fights. Specialy in the hospital it is \"Die Hard\" in a hospital. I love Kwok Chun-Feng as Mad Dog one the best characters wever created he only kills killers and cops but never innocent people. I love the gun fight bewteen Mad Dog and aln in the hospital. Everything is practical. Still one of the greatest 90's action films.I would say this movie is up there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Predator I love this fillm to death.

Do you think Clint Eastwood could make having a baby pee all over you and extinguish the fire on his leg somehow still look awesome?Also, for all the complaints about the amount of death and destruction in American films, this one wipes out 307 people in 92 minutes (well, if you're watching the cut version; there's also a 149-minute cut). There are also around 2,000 different guns firing off 100,000 rounds.It would also be the last film Woo would make before going to Hollywood to make Hard Target. Don't worry - he made better stuff after that.I've always felt that Woo is absolutely in love with everything that is film. This movie is a violent ballet with guns and leaps and fire and explosions instead of body movements. While not as dramatic as The Killer, this still has more of a story - and again, way more action - than anything that the U. S. was doing in 1992 or any other year.I mean, what else other than a love of film explains that the lead character's name comes from the fact that William Holde drinks an entire bottle of tequila in The Wild Bunch?",

            "content": "\"Hard Boiled\" (aka \"Lat sau san taam\") is indeed the embodiment of the pinnacle of director John Woo's career and it is definitely one of the movies that helped define the action genre of the 1990s for the Hong Kong cinema.While realisms takes a backseat throughout the course of \"Hard Boiled\", then the action and adrenaline takes the lead, and those things do carry the movie quite well. Everything in the movie is so outrageous that realisms has no chance of bidding in with anything. Bullet count? Don't even bother, because that is non-existing here. So every single handgun and rifle has infinite ammo, well right until it becomes a pivotal scene for the storyline, then suddenly there is no more ammo.The movie starts out in a high pace and it doesn't really slow down. So that was a great accomplishment on behalf of director John Woo.The storyline, while it is not the most complex of storylines and plot ever to have been constructed, is actually entertaining and does have some nice turns to it. Was it predictable? It most certainly was. But it is the type of storyline that picks you up and carry you along for a great action-packed thrill ride.One of the more impressive things about \"Hard Boiled\" aside from the amazing action sequences, was the cast. They had Chow Yun-Fat, Tony Leung and Anthony Wong together in this movie; three of the major names in Hong Kong cinema.\"Hard Boiled\" is actually a rather violent movie if you take a step back and look at it from an aesthetic viewpoint. There is a lot of violence in the movie and a lot of innocent bystanders do get gunned down throughout the course of the movie. But doesn't that sort of add some perverse sense of realism as well, because psychotic people would actually succumb to such wanton random violence and bloodshed.I have watched \"Hard Boiled\" many times, and return to it every now and again solely because of the impressive action and the ultra fast pace that there is to the movie. And \"Hard Boiled\" was actually one of the reasons why I have such a profound and deep love for the Hong Kong cinema.",

John Woo is at his peak before moving to Hollywood and toning things down.Chow Yun Fat plays inspector \"Tequila\" Yuen of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force who is investigated gun smuggling amongst the local Triads. His partner is killed in an opening gunfight in a tea house when they interrupt a gun deal. This opening scene is just a taster of what is to come, each gun fight is bigger than the one before; the final confrontation is more of a battle than a mere gun fight as Tequila and Tony, an undercover cop, battle against the psychopathic Johnny and his henchmen.Like most action films one has to suspend one's disbelief as people shot accurately while driving motor bikes or diving through the air, and guns don't run our of ammunition as often as they should. Unlike most western action films our heroes aren't bullet proof and the largest death toll isn't amongst evil henchmen but is instead innocent bystanders either caught in the crossfire or killed in cold blood by Johnny and his men. Another difference is that our hero seems to be an ordinary man neither a muscle-bound hulk nor a martial arts expert.The action is all brilliantly choreographed as one would expect from a John Woo film and the acting seemed good through out, especially from Chow Yun Fat and Tony Leung in the two lead roles. This review was based on watching the film in Cantonese with English subtitles.",

For whatever reason, that decade made some of the finest action films (and horror films), which have not yet been matched.

Sure, there was plenty of action, but the film was devoid of anything else. It was just two hours of blood and gunplay. That wasn't the only thing wrong with this movie. Although this was more the fault of the DVD maker, some of the subtitles(English) disappeared too fast for me to read them! The action was also very repetitious. Where's the plot? At least other Woo films like Face/Off and Mission: Impossible 2 had somewhat unique plots, especially Face/Off. This one was just a two hour exhibition of people firing handguns at each other. Another thing wrong with this film were the sound effects. The sound was very low quality and unrealistic. I watched the Usual Suspects about 50 minutes after this film and was amazed at how much better the gunfire sounded in that film compared to this one. I can't really think of anyone to recommend this movie to. 3/10",

Wait, the internet knows. 307. At 128 minutes, that's 2.4/minute, or someone dying every 25 seconds. Whew. Hard Boiled also relies on some of this genre's standard tropes, e.g. The cop being traumatized by his buddy's death in the establishing scene for his character, and it has a decidedly favorable view of violence used by the police, who are glamorized here. If you don't like cop/action films, this is probably not your film.On the other hand, it's all so stylishly done by director John Woo, and the two lead actors (Chow Yun-Fat and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai) bring a lot of charisma to the screen. There are enough wrinkles in the story with two rival gangs and cops not always knowing who's undercover to keep it interesting, and the scene at the hospital where they all converge and innocent lives are at risk (including li'l babies!) is intense. Anthony Wong and Philip Kwok are also strong in the roles of the cold-blooded bad guys. If you like cop/action films, this will probably be in the upper echelon for you.",

            "content": "Some guy quoted on the back of the cover to this movie: \"John Woo is God.\" Well, he's not God, and he's not even a god, he is just a human being like the rest of us, fallible. This movie though is extraordinary and leaves many Hollywood movies for dead. Even John Woo's Hollywood productions come no where near to this movie. Not only is it almost non-stop action, but the characters in this movie are real, breathing, and in some ways, very tragic. The tragic nature of Tony is something that one very rarely sees in a Hollywood movie, but is very relevant in Hong Kong.This movie is about a cop named Tequila (Chow-Yun-Fat) who is caught in a gun fight in a tea house when he attempts to stop an illegal gun deal going down. This fight is fast, furious, has a huge body-count, and stabs you in the heart as Tequila's partner is gunned down. This is no ordinary Hollywood gunfight, this is one with guts. One of the themes of this movie is loneliness. Tequilla is a major character but the movie deals more with Tony, an undercover cop who is trying to bust open a triad gang's gunrunning scheme. Tony is a lonely man whom nobody really knows. He has no identity and only one person knows his birthday and that is his commanding officer. Tony wanted to be a police officer but he never thought that he would be placed in such a situation. He has to kill for if he does not his cover will be blown, and with this killing he must also betray close friends. He is told by Mr Hoi not to trust Johnny Wong and it is Johnny Wong who he throws his lot in with in the end.Johnny Wong is also a very interesting character. He goes beyond being a bad guy to being outright sadistic. John Woo is known to make his characters all bad, Tequilla is one such character that even though he is a cop, he has a very nasty, annoying streak through him. The only truly honourable man in this movie is Tony. Johnny Wong though is far more evil than most bad guys that I have seen. This comes to the point of where you draw the line, and I think Woo is trying to help us think of where this line is, or if there is any. Wong goes to the point where his loyal henchmen begin to question his actions because he is doing things that not even they would do.Hard Boiled is seriously nothing short of brilliant. It has the longest gunfight that I have seen in any movie, and there isn't even a pause for breath. Unlike movies like the Killer and Face Off where there is a slow bit and then the action takes off, Hard Boiled just seems speed by yet giving enough time to develop the characters brilliantly. The only problem is that the subtitles suck.",

While there can be no question about Woo's skill at staging fast paced action scenes, that very element was probably the main thing that brought Hard Boiled down. Aside from the fact that the acting was terrible, even from the great Chow Yun-Fat, the film was awkwardly dubbed into English, so you DVD owners out there may want to just leave the subtitles on. With a traditional action film story (an effort to stop a gun smuggling operation and hunt down a close one's murderer, grossly outnumbered, of course), Hard Boiled is not an entirely uninteresting film \u0096 because the same old story is made to work again by the quality direction, almost single-handedly. The problem here is the gunfights. While they are, in fact, relatively well done, due to John Woo's careful hand at direction, there is just so much mind-numbing machine gun fire and so many nameless people being blown away that, pretty soon, a really terrible thing for the film begins to happen, you just stop caring.\nWatch this film is you are a big John Woo or Chow Yun-Fat fan, or if you are into mindless action films, but be advised, it pretty hard to be moved by a film that kills dozens and dozens of people \u0096 nearly constantly \u0096 within seconds of introducing them.",

            "content": "When people start thinking that the United States is the only country with the directors that can make the great action flicks, they can think again. John Woo is basically the James Cameron of China. And Woo's film-making skill is on the same level as Cameron's since he can make films that have great eye-candy action and a film that makes us identify and care about its characters.After seeing \"Hard Boiled\", I was completely blown away by the awesome gun fight scenes that were among the best my eyes ever witnessed. And there's plenty of it. The opening scene with the shoot-out at the teahouse is remembered for when Tequila (Yun Fat Chow) does a bunch of insane stunts like firing while jumping in mid-air and when he slides down the staircase handle and shoots the bad guys without getting hit. The warehouse betrayal will be known for the bad guys on the motorcycles shooting at the other bad guys, and then, Tony, who is really an informant for the police, betrays his gun-runner boss. And then that's when Tequila shows up and kicks a ton of @$$! There's even some shots of him shooting at the motorcycle engines and exploding them, which is some of the coolest stuff I've ever seen. And last but not the least, the climatic action scene at the hospital that lasts for over a half-hour, and it displays a long continued shot that lasts for almost 3 minutes. And in that shot Tequila and Tony shoot every bad guy in sight and while talking some emotional lines, I've never seen such a masterful shot like that until \"Children of Men\". This movie has EVERYTHING, grenades, shotguns, machine pistols and an entire arsenal of weapons that is shown in the hospital part. And we also have some suspense and emotional to along with the action since the hospital scene is very tense with all the babies in danger when Tequila tries to save them all while narrowly dodging bullets.And also, the American audience probably liked the action because the setting was very different. We didn't see an American background or an American city like L.A, but what we see is Hong Kong. And in the action sequences we see Chinese stuff getting blown up, like in the teahouse for instance. We saw a bunch of Chinese pasta and tea (of course) getting smashed to bits. And it also works cause it's very unique compared to the same old American films that we get here in America.The acting also works, Yung-Fat Chow, who is basically the Chinese Schwarzenegger due to his position as an action superstar is absolutely terrific as Tequila. Tequila is basically a maverick cop whose partner is killed during the teahouse shootout and seeks revenge against the Triad gang. However his boss is constantly pushing him over the edge and he has to deal with while disobeying orders to get to the Triads. And his character also delivers one of the most recognizable quotes in film history (\"You're full of $h!t, you know that? There's a toilet over there.\") I bet that if it was an American film, every person in the United States would be saying that in everyday situations, next to \"Hasta la Vista, baby\" and \"Yippie-ki-yay, motherf**ker\".And Tony Leung, another Hong Kong superstar, totally shines as the undercover cop who is infiltrating the gang of weapon smugglers. And his loyalty is tested on whether or not he'll be loyal to the Triads or to the cops. And also, I'll remember his character for his face-off with that bad guy with eye patch in the hospital (forgot his name), and then one scene, they realize there are a bunch of innocent patients and they BOTH choose to let them go so they could finish their fight. But unfortunately the gang leader shows up and decides to kill them all and the eye-patch guy basically dies while standing up for what he believes is right that only the violent people should die. Very touching moment.If you're looking for a great foreign action film and if you're tired of watching too many Hollywood stuff, then \"Hard Boiled\" is the film for you. The action is so insane that you'll probably see this over a hundred times before you die.",

Whilst the plot may be a little thin and the visuals occasionally veer wildly into pretension, this is undoubtedly the most stylish bullet-festival ever committed to celluloid. It has three stunning set-pieces; a shootout in a dim-sum restaurant, a shootout in a warehouse and an, er, shootout in a hospital. The hospital sequence, which lasts nearly an hour, is simply an amazing piece of action choreography, which tops anything done before or since. In one single two-and-a-half-minute tracking shot alone, Yun-Fat and Leung race down endless corridors, take a ride in an elevator, waste twenty-eight different bad guys along the way and act out a dramatic scene whilst doing it !! Stunning. Woo (who has an unbilled bit as a bartender) has an incredible eye for action, aided by top-notch stuntwork from Kwok, who also plays the aptly-named chief henchman, Mad Dog. Wang Wing-Heng's zippy, fluid camera-work and the groovy keyboard score by Michael Gibbs round off the perfect Cantonese gangster movie. Somehow, amid all the chaos, Yun-Fat and particularly Leung manage to lend some dramatic pathos to their roles. It's asking a lot of an actor, surrounded by villainous henchman in a burning hospital, to hold a shotgun in one hand and a baby in the other and sing it a rap lullaby, but Yun-Fat pulls it off !!",

            "content": "Review: I remember thinking that this movie was amazing when I first watched it, in the early 90's, because of the great action at the end and the coolness of Chow Yun-Fat but I must admit, it does look a bit dated now. The soundtrack is awful throughout the movie and the gun action seemed a bit messy and over exaggerated. Anyway, this movie is about a Hong Kong cop, Officer \"Tequila\" Yuen (Chow Yun-Fat), who attempts to arrest a group of gun smugglers in a tea house with his partner, Benny (Bowie Lam). During an epic shootout, Benny is killed and many of the officers are badly wounded so Tequila goes on a mission to kill the gang who ambushed there operation. Whilst seeking revenge for his partner, Tequila sets out to kill the gangster who sent out his henchmen to ambush the deal but Tequila's boss, Pang (Philips Chan) wants the gangster alive so he can testify. While all of that commotion is happening, a high ranking assassin, Alan (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai), works for a triad boss, Uncle Hoi but when Alan is approached by a rival gang leader, Johnny Wong (Anthony Wong) to join his gang because of his impressive gun skills, Alan turns against Hoi and they plan to raid one of Hoi's warehouses. During the raid, Wongs henchmen kill most of Hoi's workers and he demands Alan to kill Wong who is called to the scene. Because of his loyalty to his new boss, Alan kills Hoi and he's left alone with his thoughts while Wong departs. Tequila watches the whole alteration and he attempts to kill Alan but he runs out of ammo and to his surprise, Alan spares his life. Tequila is then told by Pang, that Alan is an undercover officer so they join forces to take-down Wong, while he still is undercover. Tequila's informant, Foxy (Tung Wei) gets fatally injured by Wongs henchmen and Alan shoots Foxy to show his loyalty to Wong but he knows that the shot wouldn't kill him because he gave him a lighter, which he put in his breast pocket. Foxy then tells Tequila about the whole alteration and Tequila takes Foxy to the nearby hospital because of his fatal wounds. When Wong finds out that Foxy is still alive, he sends his henchmen to the hospital to kill Foxy but Alan and Tequila are there to protect him. Whilst fighting against Wongs henchmen, Tequila and Alan come across a secret passage which leads to Wongs arsenal, which they use to defend themselves. Wong then takes the patients and police officers hostage and after killing many of them, without any remorse, Pang and his officers get involved to try and free some of the babies in the maternity ward. Tequila helps to save the babies and the hostages while Alan goes head to head with Wongs head henchman. Wong then plants bombs around the hospital, so Tequila has to fight against time to save the last baby. When Wong starts to murder some more of the patients, his head henchman decides to turns his gun on Wong because he's against killing innocent people but he runs out of ammo and is killed by Wong on the spot. While the building is exploding, Wong comes out of the hospital, holding Alan at gunpoint and Wong tries to humiliate Tequila in front of all of his fellow officers but Alan isn't having any of it and he puts up a struggle with Wong and shoots himself through the belly, giving Tequila enough time to kill him. Once again, it's another detailed storyline with loads of bullets flying throughout the movie but the whole look and feel of the film was a bit dated. I really liked Chow Yun-Fat's character because of his no fear, one man army attitude but the gun action is a bit far fetched and I personally would have enjoyed it more, if it wasn't 2 hours long. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was John Woo's last release in his native country before he hit the Western market with Hard Target with Jean Claude Van Damme. Its the last movie that he made with Chow Yun-Fat, after a successful run of movies together, which include A Better Tomorrow I & II, the Killer and Once A Thief and I hope they come together again, before Woo decides to retire. Anyway, the signature gun action from Woo is definitely what made this a hit in the early 90's but I was expecting more the second time around.Budget: $4.5million Worldwide Gross: HK$19.7millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/drama's starring Chow Yun-Fat, Tony Chiu Wai Leung, Teresa Mo and Philip Chan. 4/10",

            "content": "Maybe going back in time could explain to me the love of many viewers for this movie. John Woo made a big shootout movie with permanent dangers and many action scenes, which maybe would have even frighten veterans from Verdune. Unfortunately I'm not a fan of shootouts with so many bullets failing. Perfect shooters have machine guns at hands and are constantly missing their targets. That worked later with John Woos action orgy Face/Off, because this movie is so over the top that you can't demand any bit of realism.'Hard Boiled' was much cheaper, and for it's shoestring budget (even for it's time and location) it comes with an astonishing amount of big explosions, gunfights and police adventure. But it's atmosphere reminds me of the 70's.It's a movie mainly for fans of Chow Yun Fat, and as I'm not one of them, I did like the movie much less than they do. Fat was less leading actor than a supporting catalyst for the sympathetic Tony Leung Chiu Wai, who was clearly the hero of the movie. All other characters, maybe except Mad Dog, are only minors to support the two big names and the shootouts.But the shootouts are missing tension, as they are so massive but not really dangerous for the heroes. Countless, faceless enemies, policemen and bystanders are falling under the fire of the heroes and villains like bleeding puppets.I remember 'Scarface', where the final gunfight is something I never forget, because of its ultimate intensity. With 'Hard boiled' I can't remember a scene after a few hours.",

            "content": "What is this movie? How on earth did John Woo develop this idea? What was he thinking? I'm not entirely sure he knew what he was thinking. Like the brilliant Sam Peckinpah before him, John Woo makes auteur action films, and like Sam Peckinpah, those movies are unhinged masterpieces. Hard Boiled is the only non-English language Woo film that I've seen, so, on that level, I have nothing to which I can compare it. However, having seen most of his American pictures, I can call it his best. Do his other non-English films rival it? Probably, but I couldn't tell you that for sure. In any event, Hard Boiled opens with a great action sequence and never lets up. It's bloody, loud, and entirely unreal, but it's a complete gas too. The whole movie is like that--just plain fun. That first gun-battle opened my eyes to what John Woo can accomplish. Face/Off and M:I 2 had some great action sequence, but nothing prepared me for the confusing barrage contained within the first ten-minutes of this film. Who was good or bad--I sure didn't know. Within the first hour I still wasn't sure for whom I should root. What's stupendous about this film, though, is that it manages to top itself. The first action sequence is great, as is the one that occurs later in the arms warehouse, but neither of those hold a candle to the gratuitous and endless segment at the film's end. The hospital sequence, I think, lasts about 40 minutes. Maybe I'm exaggerating, but I thought it went on and on and on, and that's great because it never slowed down. Woo kept throwing in bits to ratchet up the tension a few clicks and keep things interesting. It also helped that he never completely resolved what side Tony Leung was on before that point. In conjunction with Mad Dog finally becoming more than an ominous henchman, this extended sequence is, like the first, disorienting. And when Johnny Wong and his men start killing hospital patients? I was completely thrown. I don't know that I've ever seen anything quite like it in an American action movie. I've seen innocents die, but never in such numbers and never in such an unexpected way. I remember wondering if Johnny and his boys would do it. I figured not and therefore figured wrong. And, as the cherries on top of this bloody sundae, are Chow Yun Fat and your favorite Asian actor and mine Tony Leung (okay, maybe he's only my favorite Asian actor). In any event, Tony proves that he's more than a dramatic actor here and Chow Yun Fat, as opposed to his performance in Crouching Tiger, shows that he has more emotion and humor than you're likely to believe. He's not some stoic gentleman, but a real live person! Oh my!This movie is great fun and much better Asian fare than I'm used to. This is a better movie than Hero or Crouching Tiger or Shaolin Soccer or anything Woo-Ping has had a hand in. The action's better and the story more interesting. It's intelligent and exciting film-making--an action movie at its best.",

            "content": "I am not a huge expert when it comes to talking about foreign cinema whatsoever. But I know enough about a specific foreign film called Hard Boiled. Hard Boiled is a Hong Kong film released in 1992 where it was first released in Hong Kong and eventually North America. The film was directed by John Woo (Face/Off) and stars Chow Yun-Fat (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and Tony Leung (Infernal Affairs). The film was a huge success critically worldwide but according to sources was not as big of a box office success in Hong Kong when compared to Woo's other films. The film would receive a sequel in the form of a videogame in 2007 called Stranglehold (of which I have played and would recommend if you are a fan of this film).Inspector Tequila (Chow Yun-Fat) is a tough cop. While doing his cop work, he finds out about an undercover cop (Tony Leung), who is going undercover as part of a scheme to get into the Triad gang. But this cop's cover is about to be blown.I seriously cannot express my true feelings for this film. I have not quite seen anything like it before and perhaps never will again. This is a film that proves John Woo is one of the best. He knows how to perfectly film an action scene. There is not any sort of quick and choopy edits with the scenes but rather we get to see everything happen and it is quite beautiful in fact. The scenes are exciting and hard hitting and went beyond. The camera work is absolutely amazing. The effects are even more impressive seeing that this was at a time when action films were not CGI. So when something explodes in a beautiful fireball, that is real. Gunplay is top notch here. Words fail me, so pardon for me being so basic here. Let's just say that if you have seen great action films like Terminator 2, Die Hard, Robocop etc., Hard Boiled is all of those films combined times one hundred in terms of action scenes which are often considered some of the best action scenes of all time and rightfully so. But what is a good film without it's story and characters/acting? Well, the story is a nice thriller that without the action is suspenseful on it's own and is well acted. For me, foreign films (for me, that is films released outside American) are hard to decide whether a performance is good or not simply by line deliveries alone. So what I look for is facial expressions and just body movement. Got to give credit to these actors because their facial expressions and body movements alone tell me that they are good actors. The characters are memorable with Tequila being a hard ass. But oddly enough, the way I see it, this film is much like Big Trouble In Little China where the main actor portrays the supposed main character/hero. In that film, Kurt Russell plays Jack Burton but the real hero and main character in a sense is Dennis Dun's character. With this film, Tony Leung's character Alan, makes it out to be that this film is more about him and I am completely fine with that. One last thing (that I can think of) that is worth mentioning about this film is it's music. We get some decent jazz music and more.Hard Boiled is perhaps one of the best, if not the best action film of it's kind. It does something unique and rather different with the genre and does so fantastically.",

It's violent but it's not actually all that entertaining; certainly not compared to something like The Raid. It's just lots of people getting shot.I've enjoyed other John Woo movies, like Face/Off and Paycheck, but this left me cold. After the second big shootout I'd had enough. Fun action scenes can pull you through a bad story and a good story can keep you interested if the action is lacking, but dull story plus dull action equals movie I can't be bothered with.",

            "content": "Prior to the extended hospital sequence, which plays like an unofficial 'Die Hard' sequel, John Woo creates a stunning eighty minutes of sensual, brutal, beautiful action combined with stunningly understated drama. Tony Leung's first meeting with arms dealer Johnny (Anthony Wong) is exceptionally well staged and scored (by Michael Gibbs), as is an earlier scene where Leung meets the older arms dealer who has become a surrogate father to him and his colleagues. These are incredibly moving sequences in which not a single shot is fired. This side of Woo's talent has never been seen in any of his disappointing American films. When Leung is forced to kill his surrogate father after Chow's spectacular warehouse ambush, we can only marvel at Leung's performance as he conveys his inner turmoil. The film makes a tonal adjustment once the action moves to the hospital and Woo serves up a number of brilliantly staged action set pieces. The sheer volume of gunfire does become wallpaper after a while, but fans of hardcore action will not be disappointed. If \"Hard-Boiled\" had continued along the same stylistic and thematic lines as its first eighty minutes, I'd probably like it as much as \"Bullet in the Head\", but, for mine, it sits just below \"The Killer\" and above the more obscure \"Just Heroes\". Fatt is his usual stalwart self, while Anthony Wong and Philip Kwok (who steals the show as Mad Dog) are sublime.",

Slick, stylish, violent, funny, clever, with interesting characters, a superior plot which will keep you guessing, and filled with set pieces, explosions and chases, Hard-Boiled is a genuine classic, at least of its genre.Chow Yun Fat stars as Tequilla, a cop with a love of Jazz, a man whose skills are never questioned, but whose methods are sometimes checked as it usually ends up in death and demolition. He also enjoys the odd bit of existential musing, and is always trying to win back his love, who happens to be a superior. The film opens with a fight between cops and arms dealers which ends in the death of Tequilla's partner. Tequilla kills all possible subjects so they are left with no evidence as to who the boss is. We meet Tony, played by Leung who is one the arms dealers lead men. He does his job flawlessly, and at all costs, but doesn't want to see his boss harmed. However, when a rival with greater ambition wants to recruit him, Tony double-crosses his old boss. Tequilla intervenes and many more are killed. Tony and Tequilla continue to come into contact with each other, and we learn that Tony isn't who he appeared to be. Soon Tequilla works out where the massive armoury is, and a massive gunfight ensues, taking up the last 40 minutes of the film. Will Tequilla get revenge, will any more twists enter into the story, who will make it out alive? The film is incredibly clever for an action film, with many twists, but this is all the more astounding when you witness the level of action which takes place. The set-pieces are almost overwhelming, with so much going on at one time they beg to be re-watched repeatedly. Each actor is convincing, and it seems Fat and Leung were born for these roles. Everyone else is good as well. The final hospital scene has some of the best, most exhilarating action ever filmed, and no-one is safe as patients, doctors, kids, cops, and bad guys are all slaughtered. Almost every window is smashed, all manner of guns are fired, and Woo is on top form. His slow motion style, balletic gun play have never been better, and the one steadicam shot which goes into a lift, between floors and features many deaths and explosions, plus dialogue, is awesome, and must have been a nightmare to film. Few action movies can suck the viewer in like this does, so that we care about the characters and are not just watching vacantly. Hard-boiled succeeds on all levels, and must be seen by all action fans. It is the benchmark of the genre.10 out of 10",

            "content": "John Woo's final Hong Kong film before he went to Hollywood to direct box-office hits such as Face/Off (1997) and Mission: Impossible II (2000), and disappointing misses such as Windtalkers (2002) and Paycheck (2003), Hard Boiled represents everything that is wholesome about Woo's unique brand of action cinema. His trademark action style plasters all over the film as if it is as brutally wounded as any of the hundred-odd bodies that lie dead in a teahouse, warehouse, and hospital \u2013 three locations that set the scene for three incredible action set-pieces that are probably still unmatched in its audacity and body count.Hard Boiled stars Chow Yun-Fat and Tony Leung as cops working for the local police department. Chow plays Tequila, a Dirty Harry-type cop who has no qualms about shooting anyone dead. He challenges his superior, takes life-and-death matters into his own hands, and understands that attack is the best form of defence. In the film, he investigates a case of weapon smuggling by a sinister gangster and his crew, of which Leung's character, Tony, belongs to. But oblivious to Tequila, Tony is actually an undercover cop. This raises the stakes and tension in what is arguably the purest Asian action film of the nineties.Hard Boiled is not plot-driven, and it is fairly clear that story takes a backseat in most of Woo's films. Despite this, Woo still successfully engages viewers with impeccably choreographed gunfight battles that are violent and stylistic enough to demand comparisons to ballet. A ballet of carnage that is. Woo, in many of his Hong Kong actioners, and especially so in this one, has elevated gunfights into an art form, with his signature multiple angles, slow-motion shots and freeze frames. A suspension of belief is necessary to fully appreciate the artistry of violence on show because the characters empty bullets as if there is no tomorrow, and they don't often stop to reload.Hard Boiled also features a stunning long take sequence that ranks technically as one of the best ever shot. It occurs in the final third in the aforementioned hospital, and runs for nearly three minutes. In this long take, we see Tequila and Tony battle the bad guys in a long mazy corridor. They later get into a lift to reload, only to come out with guns blazing again in another corridor. Everything is done in one entire shot, and mind you, in a single take too because of time and budgeting issues.What is most unbelievable is that the same corridor is used in this entire take. That means the crew had to clear the destruction and change the arrangement of props in just half-a-minute i.e. the time Tequila, Tony and the camera spent waiting in a (non-moving) lift. If one could forgive its incredulous execution of action and its thin plot, Hard Boiled is definitely a must-watch for all fans of action cinema. The quality of action alone is enough to justify a recommendation for this film. Film critic Mark Salisbury from Empire mentioned that Hard Boiled is \"more exciting than a dozen Die Hards\". While that is exaggerating, it is also not far away from the truth.GRADE: A- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",

There are no shortage of movies with a ton of action throughout the years(with The Raid Redemption films and The Expendables series as recent examples), but I digress, Hard Boiled is still in a class of its own. While Hard Boiled has some of the most intense, balls to the wall action scenes, high body counts, stunning action choreography(by Philip Kwok) and gigantic explosions. There is also excellent character development, intense melodrama and some of the best acting performances you will find in a movie with this amount of action in it. Chow Yun Fat is inspector Tequila, a serious tough cop and one man army who is working on a case involving gun running triad gangsters. Chow Yun Fat is very tough in this film.(like a Hong Kong Dirty Harry) Yun Fat is a very versatile and talented actor and brings a very naturalistic approach to his character, making his job look easy. Tony Leung, also a very talented and charismatic plays a deep undercover cop and one of the only actors in Hong Kong that can come close to matching Chow Yun Fat in both acting ability and screen presence. Both icons of Hong Kong cinema share great chemistry and work great together in this. Also from Hong Kong's A list of amazing actors and top stars is Anthony Wong as main villain, gun runner and all around amoral psychopath. Philip Kwok of Five Deadly Venoms fame is his sidekick Mad Dog, a loyal triad and hard as nails heavy with a code of honor. Philip is also action choreographer and stuntman as well. Philip Chan is Sup. Pang, Tequila's boss and former HK police officer for 15 years. Hard Boiled is the final collaboration between Chow Yun Fat and director John Woo. Woo is in top form here as director and collaborated well with his incredible cast. The dramatic scenes are as well done and interesting as the action. It is hard to pick a favorite John Woo film when you have A Better Tomorrow, Bullet In The Head, The Killer and this. Hard Boiled is every bit as good as the films I just mentioned, but kicked up a notch or two and it works. As Woo's swansong to the HK action film, he certainly went out with a bang before he made films in the US and returning to China with the awesome Chinese period epic Red Cliff.",

            "content": "I think the film was good back when it first released but watching it now proves that it does not stand the test of time. The acting is so-so at best with the exception of Tony Leung who does an excellent job of showing the anguish and conflict of an undercover cop. You can see it in his eyes. Yun-fat is just plain angry all the time and does various acrobatic things with his mouth. But his character does not have depth despite some effort to portray otherwise with the implementation of a former cop friend played by John Woo himself, who Yun-fat would sometimes confine \"deep\" subjects with such as friendship, life and death, etc. However, the conversations are stiff, shallow, and lacked of emotion. This film is widely praised for its action sequences and I could see how it's come about but I'm seemly biased by today's standard. I know I shouldn't do this but I just can't help it. The action sequences are just too over-the-top. I understand the unrealistic element of action movies to entertain but this one really irks me. Unlimited amo, bullets wouldn't go through car door yet throw a person across a room as if he just got hit by a truck, people miss their marks constantly in the most obvious way - yes, I'm talking about you Mad Dog, you were in an arm base with high caliber rifles yet you used a single shot pistol, you were 12 feet away and caught your targets off-guarded, and you still missed - which by the way somehow miraculously helped Tony, who was shocked with high voltage and on the verge of death just moments ago, back on his feet faster than a stallion; Wong, the main villain, tries to explode the building filled by gas (ordered by him by the way) that he was in, with C4s. Even my kid cousin knows better and Wong't do that. I know I'm really nitpicking here but it did strike a nerve. I'm willing to overlook all that but the main problem is hard-boiled down to this: it's too exaggerating, too much, and dragged on way too long which really tiresome to watch after awhile. Stripped the action and the plot is weak full with holes. There are some really cheesy scenes and dialogs. Most importantly though, I didn't feel any chemistry between characters. I didn't feel an emotional surge when a close friend is killed or when he's in great danger (A Better Tomorrow was great on this). I just didn't care for them; I was a mere spectator not an engaged participant that was drawn into the scenes. However, I'd not discredit this film for its influence. This and other Woo's films helped popularize the gun fight ballads. The scene where Yun-fat slides down the stair, back rested against the stair rail, tooth-pick in mouth, pumping the dual pistols is spectacular; wicked cool.TL;DR: average at best with lots of over-the-top actions that gets old really quickly while doesn't have a good enough plot nor acting to sustain it. Probably was great when first released but doesn't hold the water now. A Better Tomorrow and The Killer are both much better films with similar theme.",

Soon he will find in Alan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), an undercover cop who works with the gang, the perfect partner to end with the dealers.This is the main plot of the last film directed by John Woo in Hong Kong, and one of the most influential action films ever made. The story is simple and common in this kind of films but i really love it and for a simple crime/cop story John Woo creates a monumental and memorable film with some of the most original situations and in consequence some of the greatest action scenes ever filmed. I mean to set the last and biggest action sequence of the film in a hospital full of patients is really amazing and works perfect in the way that \"Tequila\" can show all of his abilities. And the the scene of \"Tequila\" and Alan in the hospital is amazing and without a doubt it rank in the greatest action scenes ever. So the film is that, a good and simple crime/cop story full of exciting action scenes with John Woo at his best. And with the coolest cop ever in a film, \"Tequila\" who is one of my favourite characters ever, of course because of his great skills and also because of his charisma that shows since the very first scene playing jazz and being the unique who drinks tequila.The cast is great, with Chow Yun-Fat in an excellent role and with Tony Leung Chiu Wai who is one of my favourite actors and who appears in lots of great films like \"Hero\", \"Chungking Express\" and \"Infernal Affairs\" and right now is very well know in the West. Also the cameo of John Woo is good as a friend of \"Tequila\" from the jazz bar. The rest of the cast is good too. The music is another aspect that i love of this film. specially the last song after the hospital inferno.Conclusion: \"Hard Boiled\" is one of the most influential films ever made, i haven't watch all of Hong Kong John Woo's films but i can say that this much, much better than all of his mediocre career in Hollywood, where the only decent film that he has make is \"Face/Off\" and his best work is the video game \"Stranglehold\" and for the low budget ($4,000,000) comparing to Hollywood films i can say that is more exciting than 121,000,000 \"Mission: Impossible II\", which budget was $125,000,000. So watch this film and enjoy Inspector \"Tequila\". 9.5 out of 10, just for the horrible and fake look of the blood.Dragon Dynasty DVD: since some DVDs of \"Dragon Dynasty\" appears in some stores in Mexico City i start to get every DVD that i see from the collection and i love the films. I didn't know that this film was in \"Dragon Dynasy\" so when i start to look out for this film, i knew that this DVD was the unique that i can get since the Criterion DVD is out of print and i recently get it. Is the number 15 and is great; contain lots of extras including some interviews, trailers, a feature with John Woo and a location guide. Terrific presentation for the film.",

Chow Yun-Fat is impressive as Tequila and so are the other cast members. The pacing initially feels a little slow, but the film grips you with nonstop action sequences and tension-filled moments.The story at first seemed like another cop vs criminals battle, but turned out to be a lot more than that as it unfolded. I was impressed, especially since it's a very old film but is still very fresh as per modern action filmmaking standards. Each and every action sequence is outstanding... I think even outstanding is a smaller term for that. I have really not seen action as exhilarating as this, ever before in a classic actioner.And I can assure you that when the famous hospital action sequence will start unfolding, you'll be nothing but excited. It'd be like watching a completely different film as the action touches unprecedented heights from there. Hard Boiled is very easily a breathtaking, eye-popping and still fresh action film that needs to be seen as soon as possible. It's one of those films you must watch at least once in life!10/10.

In fact, when John Woo completed this film, he went in U.S, later directed Hard Target, Face Off, which were a little bit disappointing compared to his Hong-Kong work.Yes, there is massive amount of shootouts, graphic violence, explosions doves(symbol of piece), gun play(Mexican stand-off). Everything in John Woo's style. But the shooting is amazingly choreographed. Strongly stylized. Lots of special effects, explosions, glass shattering. Looks and sounds so real. I never have seen it so in an action film.Bad things are choppy and ludicrous story, terrible dubbing and soundtrack as well the thing that irritated me most(but not enough to hate the movie). It is like a video game where some people get shot several times and then walk and shoot like nothing happened.

Hard Boiled isn't nearly as dramatic as The Killer or A Better Tomorrow but it is a prime example of when an action movie is taken so beyond it's limits that it com-busts and makes everything else seem like Walt Disney. Hard Boiled features some of the greatest action sequences ever filmed. The stairway massacre is awesome and the climax is so intense it becomes jaw dropping in how it is handled. Never in the U.S could something like this get made without people protesting and playing the morality card about how violence is affecting our children. What is quite surprising though is that the action in this movie would quiet down any cell phone armed teenager used to the artificial action filmed by a PG-13 friendly Hollywood. Hard Boiled is a lot like The Road Warrior in it's greatness. You feel like you were watching it for like 10 minutes and you note that the credits are closing. There is some character development but overall Hard Boiled exists in pushing the envelope and it does so in such a way that it is guaranteed to drain anybody's batteries.* * * * out of 4-(Excellent.

After seeing The Killer (my first John Woo movie and by far his best), A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2, Hard Target, Face/Off, Mission: Impossible 2, and Bullet in the Head, I eventually got around to watching this giant piece of noise.  On my first viewing, I was appalled by how many people are pointlessly shot up for \"fun\".  The film lacks both the rich melodramatic chord and style of Killer and the coolness of the action.  John Woo excesses himself overtime both in bullet volume, ridiculous dialogue, and nasty villains.  I really can't see why people like this movie so much, even the sound editing is HORRIBLE! It seems only three sounds are used for the dozens of various guns and only one explosion sound is used for the dozens of (annoyingly unnecessarily) explosions.  This film also has a serious blood packet fetish.  In Killer, some blood is used when people are shot but this movie takes it to the RoboCop level of ludicrous gore.  By the time this movie is over, you'll want to check your shirt for bloodstains and wishing John Woo had cut some of the subplots out.  Anthony Wong Chau-Sang lacks the real sense of cruelty and evil that Fui-On Shing oozes continuously in the Killer.  In the end you feel neither vengeance or depression when his character gets it in the end and your just happy the movie has finally ended.  That's the last point I'd like to make, did this film HAVE to be over two hours long?  The only American film I can think of that has everything this has and shows it in exactly the same way is Rambo III.  Watch that for the same effect in your head.",

Chow Yun-Fat is perfect as the lead character and has great chemistry with Tony Leung who plays Alan. Johnny Wong and his ironically named right hand Mad Dog are great villains. It would be a crime to talk about the movie without bringing up the climactic hospital shootout. The action scene takes up the entire third act and lasts over 30 minutes, not once did I think it overstayed it's welcome and the payoff is well worth it. Every cop in the movie gets a badass moment such as Teresa Chang who at one point slaps an armed guard without batting an eye.

The film begins really well, with a gun fight breaking out in a teahouse, done with both grit and grace. Alas, the impact here has become boredom by the end, because that is all you get from this movie. Nothing else happens, we don't care about anybody, the plot is the oldest formula on the shelf and there exist no intricacies, dimensions or details. More-is-more here.For a director who's spoken so often of honor, has said that he \"hates violence,\" I find it baffling that his films, both from Hong Kong and Hollywood, have little more to offer than hyper-stylized gun battles that, save for a few exceptions in his better movies, are only all of a piece. They are ends in themselves. Woo does some interesting things with Chow Yun-Fat's hard-boiled cop, giving him a sideline gig as a jazz clarinetist, his partner his drummer, to give him more dimension. Tony Leung, playing his counterpart, enjoys boating and making paper cranes. Ultimately, so what? They both kill so many people, so so so many people, often entire rooms and buildings full of people, and then Chow goes right back to the precinct where he flirts with the pathetically clich\u00e9d ex-girlfriend officer. My gripe is not so much that massacring hoards of totally objectified henchmen as if they're pop-up boards (I.e., that they're characters in an action movie), as much as that they, and nobody else, are real characters. The ex-girlfriend cop is nothing but alternately a latent romantic interest and a nurturing mother figure in the few scenes she has, the bad guy is just a guy who seems to just do things because they're bad and be followed around at all times by at least a dozen guys waving guns around as if to have no concept of discretion, the police chief is the barking, ranting superior who's fed up with Chow's reckless methods.The violence is portrayed like a martial art, or a painterly broad stroke, instead of something that generates tension, drama, horror or any intense feelings. The chase in The French Connection is exhilarating, not just because of the way it's filmed and edited, but also because the stakes are realistic, the character's motivation is there and we're absorbed in the visceral vice grip of it. In Woo's most pivotal work, violence and action seem to instill in a lionized fashion that might is right, especially if you look slick and cool during. Slow motion helps. It takes precedence over the worn-out, threadbare plot, or even any sense of logic. Why the hell would a stockpile of artillery be stashed by arms dealers at a hospital, where you have to seize control of the entire place in order to extract the load? Oh, right. Because they're baaaad. They're mean guys. Ooooh. And early on, when a character executes a hit in a library using a gun hidden in a book, Chow is called in and shown being such a clever pathological detective in finding the re-shelved book. Never mind the fact that the book is soaked in blood, and surely must've dripped a whole trail back to its shelf. But no, we're given dissolves between Chow and the other character, suggesting he's getting into the mind of the killer. Jesus.The climactic scene, one cop held hostage by the main baddie who forces the other cop to slap himself repeatedly and say that he's impotent until the hostage cop takes action, while an entire police force, a whole district of EMTs and hundreds of bystanders look on, doing nothing about the situation at all except watching it transpire with anxious facial expressions, is the pinnacle of the violence-as-wrestling-match mentality pervading this film. There is one scene that portrays violence to truly dramatic effect, when the scarred, one-eyed super-duper-evil-looking henchman sees the bad guy mowing down innocent bystanders in the line of fire as one of the heroes escapes, and tries to prevent it, saying, \"You didn't have to kill 'em!\" Only to be punished for it. But instead of coming off like it means anything in terms of honor or morality, it just ends up being nothing more than an exception to the rule, which is, All we're watching is guys getting shot in really cool ways, arbitrarily, without consequence, to the point of tedium, where we've seen literally hundreds of people fall down dead from getting shot that the effect is gone.I think the reason why Woo went back to Hong Kong, why he's not much part of the limelight in pop culture anymore, is because, like me, the rest of his cult following has grown up. The late '80s and '90s are over, and that generation of film fans want to see more than guys in black suits and sunglasses killing other guys in black suits and sunglasses. So what if a body flies through the air in slow motion with symbolic doves fluttering about? If that's all a movie has to offer, a viewing is fine, but the potential to start a craze based on that imagery alone has diminished.",

Some of the most significant are: - Catch 22 situation when two oponants are holding guns to each others temples; - Music to a child during violence (when Tequila sings to the baby in the nursery; Castor Troy's kid on the glass pane floor during the raid on his house); - Slow motion shots behind people during pauses when firing guns.\nAs pointed out by other IMDb users, the film would mean more to someone who spoke Cantonese given the significance of many cultural details.

Although John Woo's recent films have been more caught up in the world of Hollywood where you see he doesn't have the same sort of control over his pictures he is starting to move his films back to China, creating a more Auter film. \"Hard Boiled\" is one film that I garantee you wont regret if you're looking for a no holds bar action film but if you're a fan of realism then this film is not for your. The editing of the film sometimes doesn't stand up to the test of time and may look a bit cheesy to more modern cinema goers but the blasting action might be enough to keep your eyes off the editing, (keep your eyes open during the hospital shootout for what it one of the best long takes in action cinema history).

Starting off with a crazy bullet riddled teahouse sequence in which innocent bystanders are filled with holes by kill-crazy gangsters, Woo quickly shows that he is out to up the ante on previous efforts, The Killer and A Better Tomorrow. By the squib-tastic blood-drenched and very explosive finale, there are hundreds laying dead or wounded amongst the debris.Tequila (Woo regular Chow Yun Fat) is a tough cop on the trail of evil gun-runner Johnny Wong (the brilliant Anthony Wong), who keeps his stash of weapons hidden in a secret fortified location. In order to discover the whereabouts of this well guarded armoury, and successfully infiltrate it, Tequila teams up with an undercover agent who has been so long in the field that he is almost indistinguishable, morally, from those he seeks to bring to justice.Well staged, albeit incredibly unrealistic (due to the hero's incredible kill rate and inexhaustible supply of bullets), action scenes proliferate the film until the inevitable showdown between the good guys and the baddies (which takes place in a hospital); here, Woo pulls out all the stops, employing every trick in his book to wow his audience. Sure, things get a bit silly at times (Tequila's jump from a window, holding on to a piece of cable whilst cradling a newborn baby is particularly daft) but for sheer spectacle, you can't go wrong.I've been following Woo's work since the late-80s and, although I feel that he occasionally overuses his trademark style a tad (I think an action scene can work just as effectively when played out at normal speed, and that slo-mo can sometimes interrupt the flow of a sequence rather than enhance it), I recognise the huge impact and influence he has had on the action genre, and recommend Hard Boiled wholeheartedly to those who like their movies loud, relentlessly violent and completely bonkers.",

Still cool movie, very unrealistic but still with an authentic rawness to it, visually gritty and violent but also flashy and over the top at the same time, in a functioning and pleasing balance.I will se if I can get a translated version of this movie, preferably texted, dubs makes these movies into a comedy sometimes.If anyone feels like to watch a movie that purely is a straight up action, cops vs gangsters.

With a Hong Kong challenge coming up on ICM,I decided it was time to get on the boil.View on the film:Bringing the curtain down on his Heroic Bloodshed/Hong Kong era in a similar fashion to Dario Argento's 1987 Giallo Opera (-also reviewed), (both films did not do as well as expected in their domestic markets)co-writer/(with Barry Wong and Gordon Chan) co-star/ directing auteur John Woo reunites with cinematographer Wong Wing-Hang to conclude the visual motifs that span his credits,which fly into view from the opening bird cages in the tea house shoot-out shaking with slo-mo shootings, freeze frames and mountains of debris landing on Woo and Wing-Hang's \"Bullet Ballet.\"Holding everyone hostage in a hospital, the pristine, metallic walls sharply reflect Woo's ultra-stylisation, fired up with unleashed whip-pans and extended tracking shots that give the cracking action a breathless atmosphere.Changing the plot just a week before filming, the decision by Wong/Chan and Woo to pour Tequila on the side of the law brilliantly crystallises the themes of Heroic Bloodshed, via the rich loyalty between Tequila and Alan, (named after Alain Delon's Le Samoura\u00ef loner) the feisty attitude of Teresa Chang to get deeply involved in the fighting and a relaxed mind-set on using extreme measures to take out cops/baddies.Introducing Tequila playing Jazz, the writers cleverly place moments of close-up calm between the action to dig into the contemplation Tequila makes over how to get the most people out of the hospital alive. Facing bloodshed for the final time, Chow Yun-Fat gives a blistering performance as Tequila,who bounces along lively with Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's anxious Alan,and keeps a knife-edge alert in the explosive battles that never go off the boil.",

The shootouts in \"Hard Boiled\" - imitated by many over the years - are something else. Chow Yun-Fat is like a manically violent superhero when he's holding a gun, whether it's blasting away while sliding down a banister, taking on a warehouse full of goons single-handedly, or . . . well let's just say how he rescues a baby from a burning hospital is nuts.Great stuff.7/10",

It's a shoot-'em-up action flick, through and through, and it may very well be the best example of its sub-genre. I mean, no further proof of that is needed than the affair's extended shootout of a final act. In fact, this segment is so blisteringly brilliant that it essentially rockets the overall experience right to the top of the wider action genre, marking it as a true classic that deserves to be considered among the very best of its kind. Of course, the stuff in-between the blank-blasting, squib-triggering gunplay isn't quite as good. The story is barely there, to be honest, and it's actually fairly hard to follow. However, it does what it needs to: it gets you from set-piece to set-piece and does just enough with its core characters to make you care about their involvement in those set-pieces. Having said that, despite an absurd level of overall violence, there's never really any sense of proper danger when it comes to the protagonists; they may as well be superheroes. One of them barely takes a scratch and the other is shot so many times over the course of the narrative that he probably shares more in common with a slice of Swiss cheese than a human being. The final action sequence includes a lot of collateral damage, with civilians constantly being in danger. This raises the stakes, especially since Woo isn't afraid to show innocent people getting ruthlessly gunned down, and makes the third act incredibly compelling. Seriously, the final third is phenomenal. It's the perfect concoction of all the techniques Woo displays in the film's earlier action scenes, with near-perfect editing and jaw-dropping stunt work. It's expertly choreographed to be as exciting as possible and it's positively edge-of-your-seat stuff. When it comes down to it, the picture is highly entertaining. It has its slower moments, mainly in its midsection, but it's always engaging and its payoff is more than worth the wait. It's a certifiable action classic. 8/10.",

Lots of slow-mo action ensues.I enjoyed this movie and it kept me interested. Woo has a love for action as an art, just like Quentin Tarantino loves dialogue and style, and so quite obviously the plot is often pushed aside.However, this is a good movie.

            "content": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Loose cannon, unorthodox Insp. Yeun (Chow Yun Fat) goes on the trail of the criminal who killed his partner in a Hong Kong tea house. As he does, an un-named Triad killer has arrived in the city and has taken out a top mob boss. But as Yeun goes on his trail, bumping heads with key gang figures and official bureaucracy on the way, he finds everything is not quite as it seems.At just over two hours, Woo has taken, in one of his more renowned Hong Kong efforts, a rather lengthy amount of time to tell such a simple and formulaic story, but he's truly made his mark with Hard Boiled.Dubbed in the English release, giving it the feel of one of Bruce Lee's movies from the 1970s, this is still a prime piece of Oriental action cinema, which makes it clear why Woo got noticed in Hollywood. He has staged some absolutely mesmerizing gun battle sequences, including a mind blowing final showdown in a hospital which is so wild, action packed and crazy it's unlike anything you've ever seen before. Woo's niche seems to be with guns, an eccentric style that got carried over to Hollywood with what looks more like missiles than bullets firing out the chambers. Surprisingly, for a Hong Kong director, not so much with martial arts but with this wild gunplay on display who cares about that? He has an affable hero in Fat, who toddles along delivering the requisite action hero goods.Before the big studio heads of California maybe started to mess with his style a little, here's a prime slice of Woo in his native land, comfortable with the style that suits him best and served him well. ****",

            "content": "An absolutely ballistic, no-holds-barred, over-the-top yet purely unadulterated action extravaganza to come out from Hong Kong during the the early 90s, Hard Boiled takes action in cinema to a whole new level with its heart-pounding & jaw-dropping sequences and cements John Woo's reputation as the most influential director when it comes to action filmmaking.The story of Hard Boiled concerns two ace cops; one is a tough-as-nails detective in his department while the other one is working as an undercover agent & has risen sharply in the underworld over the years. The plot covers their initial friction with each other followed by a mutual partnership as the two eventually team up to take down & wipe out Hong Kong's most ruthless mobster & his crime syndicate.Directed by John Woo, the film is action-packed from start to finish & features some of the most breathtaking stunts ever captured on camera. The story is equally gripping & never really gets discarded during the moments of action. Cinematography makes heavy use of slow-motions & clever angles during the action sequences yet every detail is firmly captured. Editing keeps the story explosively paced, and the background score makes effective use of jazz tracks to go with the plot.Coming to the performances, the two most impressive work comes from Chow Yun-fat & Tony Leung as the ace detective & undercover agent respectively and both exhibit a charismatic screen presence throughout the film's runtime. Anthony Wong also chips in with a brilliant contribution as the head of the Triad while his henchman Mad Dog, played by Philip Kwok, effortlessly steals every moment he is in.On an overall scale, Hard Boiled is a viciously potent, highly influential, perfectly choreographed, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying cinema that delivers everything an action junkie can ask for. A top-gear, full-throttled action spectacle & an instant classic in every way, John Woo's Hard Boiled is a must for every film lover out there & is a template for any filmmaker looking to make a quality action entertainer.Although there are moments in the film that completely defy logic, I honestly didn't even care if the rounds in those guns never seem to go empty for the gunfights are so exquisitely filmed & fabulously shot that even after two decades, it remains in a league of its own. If you still haven't seen this genre-defining masterpiece of mayhem & destruction, then get your hands on it as soon as possible. You can thank me later.",

It is far fetched in the way that one man can go in and face hundreds with just a few guns, and in the way that the characters very rarely re-load the guns, but isn't that what you should expect from a movie like this.

The action..well if you want action at its finest, John Woo never fails to deliver. If you want superb acting, well there's the two leads who doesn't need any introduction(and let's not forget Anthony Wong). If you want a story, well there's your above-average cop story. Here we have two cops, one an undercover, who joins forces against the \"bad guys\". This movie reminds me of Infernal Affairs(although this one was released first). The only part where I couldn't really find myself applauding is in the warehouse shoot-out scene where some people found fantastic. For me, it was over-the-top and too unrealistic.

            "content": "Hell-bent on revenge after his partner is killed by firearm smugglers, a maverick detective forms an uneasy alliance with an undercover cop to take down the smugglers in this popular Hong Kong action movie. The film has received much praise over the years for its creatively choreographed action sequences and the large degree of imagination placed into the action does not disappoint, but the film is never quite the cohesive whole that it could have been. The plot comes second to the action every step of the way. 'In the Mood for Love''s Tony Leung is solid as the internally divided undercover cop who dreams of going to Antarctica where it is \"always light\" to escape the darkness of never quite knowing for sure which side of the law he is on. Chow Yun-Fat is less impressive though as the loose cannon cop and the whole revenge motivation is very formulaic. The two leads also learn to get along very quickly given all the initial tension between them. John Woo's directing style is, however, more detrimental than any arguable gaps in the screenplay. The energy that Woo exhibits behind the camera is undeniable with slow motion shots, dreamy dissolves and 'wipe' scene transitions in the mix, but through relying on so many unsubtle techniques, Woo's directing style constantly calls attention to itself, which at times makes it hard to become immersed in the action. If one takes a greater interest in action sequences than narrative elements, this is not likely to be a problem, but those who prefer traditional filmic storytelling may be best advised to proceed here with caution.",

            "content": "Before he was whisked off to Hollywood where his talent seemed to stagnate and eventually fade into obscurity, John Woo conquered the world of action cinema with bullet-ridden delights such as A Better Tomorrow (1986) and The Killer (1989). His Hollywood career would consist of sub-standard genre movies such as the Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle Hard Target (1993) and blockbuster pap like Mission: Impossible II (2000). But he had one more balletic, hyper-kinetic Eastern thriller left in him before he left Hong Kong, and with Hard Boiled, he not only topped his previous films, but made one of the finest action movies in history; a non-stop orgy of explosions, slow-motion, and homoerotic undertones of brotherhood and honour.After accidentally killing an undercover police officer in a bloody shoot-out, loose-canon cop Tequila (Chow Yun-Fat) vows to get revenge on the gangsters involved. Meanwhile, Triad boss Uncle Hoi (Hoi-Shan Kwan) has unwittingly employed undercover cop Alan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) as a hit-man, using him to bump off a gang member who has been secretly working for rival boss Johnny Wong (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang). Impressed with Alan's skills, Wong tries to recruit him, causing him to turn on his former employer in an effort to move up in the criminal underworld. Learning of Alan's undercover role, Tequila seeks him out so that they may take down Wong together. But the shooting of a police informant leads the two cops to the hospital, where Wong keeps his secret stash of weaponry.The film ticks off the genre clich\u00e9's at a rapid rate, even playing it dead serious in the quiet moments between the carnage. But all the wailing saxophone music and loose-fitting shirts that were so prevalent in the 1990's make the film even more likable, and a nice little time capsule for an era that seems not so far gone yet is shockingly over 20 years ago. It would be silly to dwell on the simplistic story, as it only really plays the role of McGuffin so that John Woo may deliver two hours of ludicrous, heart-pounding action-porn. The extended climax is a barrage of slow-motion gun-fire, leading to a shockingly high body count, but Woo squeezes everything he can out of the hospital setting, naturally leaving it in ruins. It's a exhausting and cheesy two hours, featuring some of the best action scenes ever filmed, yet it soberly reminds you of what could have been if Woo had resisted the glamour of Hollywood and stayed in Hong Kong.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "content": "There is no subtlety whatsoever to John Woo's \"Hard Boiled\" the follow-up to his action melodrama \"The Killer.\" \"Hard Boiled\" strips away much of the previous film's labored sentiment and replaces it with insane action set-pieces involving babies in peril, motorcycles exploding in midair, and hundreds of thugs and cops flying through glass windows. So many glass windows. Yet \"Hard Boiled\" is also insanely fun in its ludicrousness. There is not one shred of realism in this go for broke, surprisingly gory, action extravaganza, and we are thankfully spared much of Woo's heavy handed take on the duality of man, nature of evil, and spiritual concerns. There are also blessedly no doves whatsoever in this film. Woo's films are better when he keeps his rote, superficial philosophizing to a minimum and lets his flair for berserko action take center stage.The plot is simple if not always coherent. Rogue super cop Tequila (Chow Yun-Fat) is out to avenge the death of his partner at the hands of Triad gun smugglers. While gunning down mob thugs, Tequila comes face-to-face with an undercover cop, played by Tony Leung, who is continually forced to compromise his own values in order to remain undercover. In Leung, Woo is able to examine his favorite theme of man being neither completely good nor wholly evil, but unlike in \"The Killer,\" \"Hard Boiled\" doesn't dwell on this theme interminably and the film is the film is stronger for it.John Woo, a Christian, displays substantial gore in this film with many highly stylized shots of arteries being severed followed by blood splattering onto faces, glass windows, and white walls. The heroes and villains also possess an insane tendency to create mayhem in the midst of crowded restaurants and hospitals where innocent bystanders are picked off quickly and by the hundreds. Had the film been a mainstream US release, its gory action scenes would have assuredly caught the attention of congress persons displaying election year \"what about the children\" concerns about media violence. The berserk violence of \"Hard Boiled\" is not an afterthought, though. It is, instead, the point of the whole bloody exercise. Remove the film's stylized bloodletting and it would lose its pulse.Maybe it says something about this viewer that Woo's restrained by comparison and morally concerned \"The Killer\" came off as lackluster, while the more bloody, less talky cut to the chase \"Hard Boiled\" struck me as a wildly successful genre exercise. \"The Killer\" had a classical tragic story arc while the story of \"Hard Boiled\" is mostly a device to deliver mayhem. But \"The Killer\" was frequently heavy handed and Woo spends much of his film developing his hero's thin personalities. Character development does not play to Woo's strengths. He is at his best when choreographing death and destruction.Woo makes several appearances in \"Hard Boiled\" as the owner of The Jazz Bar where Tequila plays tenor sax after hours. He is the film's moral voice and offers meta-commentary on the action, but never overstays his welcome. These are light mostly insubstantial moments that clue you in to the fact that \"Hard Boiled\" is more concerned with obliterating man than examining his soul.",

A gang war unfolds and Yuen finds out that Tony is crooked. The climax occurs when Yuen tracks down a large cache of weapons to a hospital. Of course, Woo uses the long corridors of the hospital to his advantage, when the police and the bad guys get into an extended shootout.

The problem is that I've already seen The Killer and A Better Tomorrow, both of them earlier hit films from the director John Woo. Both of them are absolutely fantastic, and so is Hard Boiled in many ways. Except that nothing in it feels original. Woo is famous for popularizing the Hong Kong style of action in the West, but even his distinctive style can become repetitive.In Hard Boiled a loose cannon cop nicknamed Tequila, played by Chow Yun-fat because every John Woo main character is played by Chow Yun- fat, loses his partner in a gang shoot-out. He decides to take the matter of revenge into his own hands, which doesn't exactly please his superiors. And then the affair gets even more complicated when one of the most lethal assassins the gangs have turns out to have shifting loyalties. The plot is actually pretty good. The loyalties and morals always switching sides, you're never quite sure how the characters are going to react and it's all-around solid entertainment.Plus, the action works. The ending fight scene in the hospital drags a lot, but I cannot say that I didn't enjoy it. And the earlier fight scenes are all pure gold, exactly what you'd expect from John Woo.But, the story and the style do lack that edge. It feels more paint- by-numbers than it feels proper film-making. If this is the first John Woo film you'll see, you're probably going to enjoy it a lot. But he has done much better films, there's no denying that.",

            "content": "John Woo is of course a legend for the Hong Kong film industry and one of the great action directors because of his heroic bloodshed genre he created. Hard Boiled is considered one of his best and it is certainly a very entertaining film just for its action scenes.Officer \"Tequlia\" Yuen (Chow Yun-Fat) is a Hong Kong police detective whom partner gets killed in a restaurant shoot out and he sets out to get the Triad leader that was responsible, Johnny Wong (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang). But when his boss Superintendent Pang (Philip Chan) orders Tequlia to stop his investigation, so he goes on a one man war against the Triads. Johnny has also recruited a top assassin and enforcer, Tony (Tony Leung). But it turns out he has his own secret and Tequlia and Tony ends up working to together bring down Johnny.Hard Boiled is around three major action set pieces, each getting bigger then the previous one. They were inventive and bloody. The restaurant had a tense had a tense build up with the boiling kettles, the police on there stake out and it became a big shoot out in a tight location and many innocent people get killed. It was almost like a Bruce Lee film, particularly with the score. The warehouse was just fun seeing men riding around on motorbikes, shooting people and also shows how one man could take on a small army. And the hospital set piece is just a massive pitch battle between the police and Triads, it was almost epic in scale because of the amounts of explosions, blood and bullets flying about. Whilst Woo does overuse slow motion and bullet sparks sometimes he does know how to craft an action scene, knowing where to focus, how to edit so you could follow what happens. I particularly like the long tracking shots in the hospital as all the action and carnage goes on all round, focusing on our two heroes. It is also very refreshing to see a film that does not need CGI, a film that actually uses stunt work and real special effects and it was shot very much like other action films from the 80s and 90s using a rather dark filter to it and most of the action takes place at night. Woo knows how to move the camera and does bring to live his own sense of hyper-realism. Hong Kong detectives seem to be very trigger happy.The plot itself is simply but Woo does not treat the audience like idiots. It is simply a tough cop going by his own rules and sets out to bring down a Triad boss any way possible. Chow Yun-Fat plays the role very well and his character is shown to be tough, ruthless cop who does have guilt about the lost of partner. He is also shown to have good with Teresa Mo as they sing pop songs together as they decode a message from a undercover police officer. The whole undercover police officer subplot who has to do violence acts reminded me of Infernal Affairs but it possibly because that film was also set in Hong Kong.Hard Boiled does suffers from some cop film clich\u00e9s, particularly the police chief telling his rouge officer but this is a very well made, entertaining action film. This is a film that has a lot of John Woo's traits like slow-mo, reflections, gun-fu especially using two guns at once and playing soft music over a bloody action scene (a trick he used in Face/Off).",

His US films are stupid, unrealistic, and lack the brutally intense, realistic gun battles that he so masterfully conceived in his Hong Kong films. It's sad and hard to believe that this is the same director.Rarely are such intensely brutal gun battles put on film in such a masterful way as they are here. Every bullet does damage to something or someone, which had to have made this an impossible film to choreograph. It is awe-inspiring to see all of the damage happen before your eyes leaving you wondering in amazement at how they even pulled it off. All of the blood squibs and debris are placed perfectly. I was amazed at the intricateness and caliber of the sequences. Very well thought out. And while it is true that foreign stuntmen are willing to take more chances than Americans which makes the films far more enjoyable to watch (American insurance companies also have something to do with this), the audacity of some of the stunts is downright insane. I wish the Americans would take note of the detail and insanity involved here. Some of this can be seen in some of Woo's American films, but it doesn't really matter since they suck anyway. The one and only bad thing I can say about the action sequences, is that no one ever reloads, EVER. Other than that minor gripe, they're flawless.The basic story is fairly decent, although due to the cultural gap some things don't make a lot of sense or seem silly. This can't be blamed on the film itself though, but the aforementioned cultural difference. But overall, a great story that keeps you guessing. It makes for a rather long action film, but that's a good thing because we get treated to so much action. I can't say much for the acting considering I don't speak Chinese and can't interpret the way in which the lines are delivered...but it seemed satisfactory. Great story, invincibly awesome action, immense entertainment.Hard Boiled kicks ass, period. If you really would like to see how to pull off some amazing action sequences, then give it a shot. You will not be disappointed. Fellow action directors should take note, including Woo himself.",

            "content": "Hardboiled. I just don't know where to begin, except with that I just finished it. And all I can say is \"waaaaaaaa! Action!\". Seriously, the protagonist kills not one, not two, not three, but eight people while holding a baby, and that's shortly after rapping to it. The baby never cries, but instead repays the favor later on it a most ridiculous way. At the rate people were dying in that movie I'm forced to conclude China simply has people to throw away. It pretty much hit every clich\u00e9, and all the characters were at least twice as accurate while involved in one of the million combat rolls that occurred.... even in the scenes without gun violence. It was the most actiony action movie to ever have action. Oh, and the subtitles are pretty amusing in parts, like when they conqueror the bad guys. Of the hundreds and hundreds of people slain in this movie, the cops sustain the heaviest casualties rescuing babies! It didn't look like any of the seemingly limitless stockpile of babies was injured though. ACTION!!! So was it good? No, not really, but ACTION! I didn't even really enjoy the silliness until the second half, but once I thought about it damn that would have been a fun movie to have been making fun of from the start. Maybe it's because it's early, maybe it's because I just watched possibly more Chinese people gunned down than there were minutes in the film (squared) but my god I think you'll have fun watching this movie in the right mindset. After all, what's better than grenade launchers acting like pump action shotguns? Or what about pump action shotguns that make whatever they hit explode? How about motorcyclists with uzis? Eye shooting? Blood splatter on babies getting mopped off in a tender moment?!?!?! Action. So... much... action... I won't believe people have to reload a gun (unless they're shooting at good guys!) for at least a week. On a website dedicated to movie body counts it's ranked #3, losing to two of the three lord of the rings-es, but I assure you Hard Boiled has none of that epic battle nonsense where kill count rains from the sky. Bullets fly, people die, especially if they come into contact with babies.",

Your Asian version of John McClane. Hot on the trail of weapon smugglers he is a one man army. On the other side of the law is Tony (Tony Leung), the Triads hit-man. Sooner or later the lives of these two collide with explosive and extremely bloody consequences.However the plot really isn't that important and it's more of a vehicle to forward the fighting, shooting and filming some outrageous action sequences. It's best not even to focus on the script, because some of the stuff done by the baddies as well as the coppers reeks of stupidity and incompetence. Human emotions and reasoning are serviced us few and far between and the end sequence entailing a no-holds-barred shoot 'em up at a hospital involving kids, babies and crippled doesn't seem to realistic.Nonetheless it's a real entertaining watch and the two leads are a very likable duo. Maybe not as classic and great as many would like to hold this movie, but it certainly was breakthrough in the intensity of action put forth on the screen. If you don't mind movies in which you can seemingly shoot hundreds of times from one gun without reloading and love over-the-top action you will be enthralled. I just couldn't throat down some of the script, hence my stubborn vote.",

            "content": "Body count: a kajillion.Chow Yun-Fat is Inspector \"Tequila\" Yuen. He's a cop who's been in hot water so long, he's HARD BOILED. Or maybe it's cos his face is egg-shaped.He's on the trail of a gun smuggler crime boss, Johnny Wong (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang, who has the misfortune to look like Jonathan Silverman), but Wong is careful not to get busted doing anything wrong (except looking like Jonathan Silverman - and God knows, that's its own punishment).Before he moved to America and became Ang Lee without the gravitas, John Woo directed HARD BOILED, the last of his Chinese gangster flicks and the pinnacle of what made John Woo John Woo; an homage to samurai, cops, westerns, and Pretty Orange Explosions. He also co-writes (with Barry Wong and Gordon Chan) and makes a cameo as club-owner Mr. Woo (ha!).HARD BOILED's first scene, the teahouse shootout, is like an explosion in a fireworks factory. Staging gun battles like this is Woo's forte, and there are probably way too many gun battles like this in this film alone - bullets and blood and mayhem and Chinese stuntmen overacting. Tequila's partner is killed in this fracas. So Tequila is also out for payback. His methods remind us of one Mr. Callahan from San Francisco.A complex, touching story is interwoven with Tequila's, that of young undercover cop Tony (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) in Silverman's gang, who must betray his old boss to serve Silverman. Both decisions are wrong and his head would explode in ethical overload if it weren't for being able to bitch to Tequila like a high maintenance girlfriend when they're both trapped in a hospital basement full of - what else? - illegal guns.The action scenes are staged with the frenetic creativity that has come to define Woo, and some of the standoffs are magnificent. We can see the samurai influences - except with guns instead of katanas - in the scene where the hardest of Silverman's cop-killers, who is against the killing of innocent hospital patients, confronts Tony with hospital patients between them. Both the killer and Tony lower their weapons, eyes locked on each other while the patients scurry for cover. Then the gunfight continues.But a note to Chinese stuntmen: it would look a lot more authentic if you would stop flailing around like salmon being electrocuted when you're being shot. Just die. And remember how the stars of the movie dodge bullets: duck and roll in slow motion - even if you're ducking and rolling in slow motion across the line of fire.There is a stupid scene in the hospital where babies are being taken out of the nursery by hand when they could easily be wheeled out in their little cots; then another stupid scene where Tequila and his girlfriend (Teresa Mo) are putting cotton in all the babies' ears to block the shootout noise.The payoff for this idiotic scene is an iconic scene - Tequila with a babe in arms, shooting his way out of the hospital; emulated ten years later by Clive Owen in SHOOT EM UP (2002).Every time I chide John Woo, it pertains to his post-Chinese period, where he simultaneously glossied and sullied his style with overwrought Hollywood glambusters like BROKEN ARROW, FACE/OFF and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE II; merely copycatting American bombast rather than honing his own raw thunder. HARD BOILED's insane body count and outlandish action may be an indication that Woo was chomping at the bit to BE Americanized all along.",

As well, the cinematography supports the toughness of our hard boiled hero. Articulately directed, the care Woo shows is astounding. Every frame is some sort of slow mo, odd angle or intense bout of testosterone. Fueled by this pace the file contradicts a dream. Lasting hours but feeling like only seconds. Being so enthralled in the action I did not pay too much attention to the acting other than that to say it wasn't bad enough for me to notice nor great enough for me to be in awe. Scene by scene the action progresses hardly letting up during its long (about)30 minute end siege. \"You can never get too much of good thing,\" would be an unfitting quote here. This constant, endless seeming, action sequence becomes redundant. As over and over people are getting shot or huge explosions are happening. Eventually it loses its adrenaline rushing touch.\nMy favorite part of the film was the fact that the grisly, one eyed, psycho did not fit the stereotype. He cared for the innocent people. I was blown away by this never seeing it coming. First time I ever seen a character as such not fit his blood hungry stereotype. Too bad Woo ever came here. Hollywood has made him suck and looks like ruined what talent he had back during this film and the Killer's production. After watching Windtalkers im weary of anymore of his new films. In a nonracist way Woo should go back to China. 9/10",

The movie stars Chow Yun-fat and Tony Leung as officers that bust an out of control criminal organization. The movie is directed by John Woo and is meant to be an action movie first.Hard Boiled is first and foremost an action movie. To everyone involved, this comes first ahead of anything else. This frequently leads to events in the movie that do not make sense and dialogue that is pointless. There are even scenes that are cringe worthy and unintentionally hilarious. This movie is a terrible drama movie. How about the action in this movie?The actual action in this movie is awesome. Both of the leads in Chow Yun-fat playing Officer \"Tequila\" Yuen and Tony Leung playing Alan do such a good job in the action scenes that this makes the movie incredibly entertaining to watch. The director John Woo made many cool action innovations in film making that is incredibly fun and entertaining to watch. The entire movie is a me ballad of bullets and noise that actually has pacing. The entire early parts of the movie are well choreographed scenes that eventually build up to the largest hospital act. This final act is an incredible ballet of action. Every earlier technique is re-used to great effect. This final act is all action and it is also elevated with every cool aspect being used.I highly recommend Hard Boiled. This movie's action is worth the price of admission.Grade: A",

But the Con's of the movie is the music and the story. I was more upset over the music of the movie then the story, i knew the story wouldn't be that smart but that's OK, when i want to see a non stop action movie i don't expect a great story, but what stopped me from giving this movie it's highest honors is the music. Most of the music sounded like it belonged in the Amityville horror then this movie, it was allot of creepy instrumental for some reason and i don't think that worked at all.

And -- although the movie gets clever towards the ending -- the first 2/3 of the film is not very clever.Do you know what I mean? In Jackie Chan films, it isn't just punch punch punch punch punch punch. Usually they're bouncing off the walls, throwing chairs around, and doing some interesting physical tricks.Unusually for a Hong Kong action film, there isn't much physical trickery in the first 2/3 of Hard Boiled. Instead there is a lot of shoot shoot shoot shoot. Guns make it too easy and impersonal. The film is a little too violent, too.Who should see this film:-- action buffs only, and then only on a rainy dayI'll give \"Hard Boiled\" a 5 out of 10.",

This film wasn't worthless action or there was too much, but this film in my books is easily considered one of the greatest action-features of all time. Hong Kong can sure make some good films, but to add onto the great movies from there you have Hard-Boiled. The film is currently ranked as the 9th highest body count in a single movie. The characters cause so much mayhem it practically crosses the line of either thinking \"What's happening right now?\" and \"This is totally amazing\".

            "content": "We can start the review by stating one fact about this movie: the body count is 307. That is over two bodies a minute.To sum it up, this action film is pound for pound, inch for inch one of the biggest, baddest, most intense, and most insane action movies in the entire spectrum of cinema----not just China but the entire planet. This movie nearly immediately starts off with a bang (Well, a medley of bangs) and then interweaves action sequences with a plot full of betrayal, undercover work and slight double-crossing (Yea, technically there is a plot) before leading up to a finale that ranks up there as among the best you'll ever see.Hard Boiled is 90s action cinema plain and simple: takes no prisoners, the plot comes second, and its main focus is to satisfy the audience by any means necessary. But the biggest difference between this bloody gem and your old-school 90s Michael Bay and James Cameron is that Hard Boiled was far, far riskier in terms of stuntwork and far, far less restricted with rules, regulations, and insurance companies. Not to knock the safe techniques of Hollywood, but the extremely dedicated staff behind this dangerously destructive movie paved the way more stunts, explosions, and utter mayhem that just wouldn't be humanely possible in a film made in the American borders.John Woo (and Chow Yun-Fat) is at his prime here, cut down by age and Hollywood limits shortly after his peak in 1992. Unlike your rapid-fire editing, extreme close-ups, shaky camera-work, and over-abundance of CGI of your modern, easier-to-make action movies, Hard Boiled was layers of stuntwork, lack of trickery, exquisite long shots of just egregious shootouts---and so much action you might feel like having to clean the television set once the credits start rolling. The final showdown alone takes up about half an hour and has more broken glass than a mirror maze overrun by black cats.Physics and continuity are stretched to the limit as the gun fu style of action allows for thousands of bullets to fly out of the hundreds of guns at such an intense and entertaining pace you don't realize how impossible the entire sequence is. Picture high-energy martial arts except instead of punches and kicks you'll see bullets fly at each other and hundreds of near-misses from our heroes and some of the enemies. You are going to see years of action, violence, blood and guts compacted into a two-hour chunk of pure exhilaration.Non-action moviegoers would probably see this as mundane and repetitive, devoid of good dialogue and a deep plot. Action fans will see this as a sweet dream come true as you'll see fights of gunfire in multiple angles, multiple speeds, and plenty of creativity to keep it all engaging--while telling a tale about good cops going up against really bad men. This is John Woo at his best, Chinese cinema at its finest, and a violently beautiful example of what happens when you rely solely on real life stuntwork and good ol' actual explosives. And most impressive that with a $5 million budget it feels like a bigger and better experience than your modern $150-$200 million summer blockbusters.Loud, uncut, and out of control, Hard Boiled is as tough as nails, and deserves your full attention.",

Chow Yun Fat is back, and is this time joined by frequent Wong Kar Wai collaborator Tony Leung. They and the whole cast are in on the joke, and tackle their clich\u00e9 roles with conviction and gusto, saving the entire ridiculous enterprise for parody.The point of a John Woo film is the action, violence choreographed and devised like a modern dance, something nobody anywhere else - or Woo himself after relocating to Hollywood for that matter - has quite managed to replicate since.

As a result, I reviewed it - and the picture again pleased me and delivered certain emotions, and here is my brief opinion - the best Hong Kong action movie! I didn't notice the minuses in the picture, I'll note only a few remarks, but this will be closer to the end, but for now let me focus on the expressive virtues.\nSo here they are:\n1. The story told - in the picture we will talk about two heroes, one is a policeman, a real killing machine, whose partner dies during a dangerous investigation, and now he only wants revenge, the second is an undercover agent, rooted in a triad, which is torn between your assignment and the moral side. Fate brings two so dissimilar people at a critical point, forcing everyone to fulfill their duty. The story is simple as two glasses, but well-written characters, acting and music make the viewer carefully monitor what is happening on the screen, trying not to miss a single detail. The finale is partly predictable, partly gives a surprise. And although the militants do not look far for the sake of history, but if it is, and even well written, then it is a well-deserved plus.\n2. Skirmishes - the picture consists of seventy percent, if not more. It feels like John Wu decided to set a kind of record for the number of everything: meat, explosions, blood, weapons, shots, bullets - and it worked out. While watching, I had the feeling that all of Hong Kong was on fire. One gigantic shootout in the hospital is worth it, especially the moment when the protagonists clean several floors of criminals without mounting glues - my respect is John. And again, innocent people who die under a hail of bullets from both sides become a victim. And the heroes are not supermen, but living people from flesh and blood, who also get it. Many critics and viewers consider this picture to be the best Hong Kong action movie, and although I liked \"The killer\", but in terms of the number of shootings and their quality, I have no choice but to admit it. Yes, even now, after twenty-eight years, these skirmishes look pretty fresh and exciting, despite the outdated technology.\n3. Humor - here, for the most part, I liked him. There is more of him here than in \"The killer\", but here some funny situations and jokes looked ridiculously inappropriate. In a couple of moments I even laughed, but no more. Just a little more, and a criminal action movie would turn into an inappropriate bloody comedy.\n4. Music - in general, it's not bad, in the shootings - it's the most, but there's nothing memorable. Excuse me, but again I will compare it with \"The killer\", where there was a good title topic and a couple of catchy compositions.\nAnd again, the remark, as in \"The killer\" - the bandits are too clearly substituted under the bullets of the main characters.\nA little about the main characters:\n1. Inspector Yuen, nicknamed \"Tequila\" by Chow Yun-Fat, is a policeman investigating a dangerous case, during which his partner dies, swearing revenge, he did not suspect what all this would turn into. An experienced fighter, a thunderstorm of Hong Kong bandits, with a good sense of humor, a seasoned eye and excellent reaction. Chow again pleased me with his acting. Bravo!\n2. Tony performed by Tony Lina Chu Wai - a police agent rooted in the triad. Tony managed to convey the whole gamut of feelings of people in this profession, with a constant sense of danger, proximity of death, unbridled dreams, the gradual blurring of the line between law and freedom. I can only praise him! Well done!\n3. Raging Dog performed by Philip Kwok - a dangerous henchman of the main villain, and extremely tenacious cattle that can withstand so many bullets that you wonder. It should be said that the actor's appearance is a match for the hero, therefore he did not need to get used to the image much.\nThe director John Wu himself starred in a far from episodic role. Not to say that his hero is so much needed for the advancement of history, but it was still nice to see his sly grin and a mysterious look.\nThis picture is good, and definitely does not need to \"rethink\".\nAs a result, we have a good Hong Kong criminal action movie with the best shootings for this genre, a simple but catchy story, good humor, and good acting.",

Curious of his work I decided to check out one of his most famous films Hard-Boiled. And I don't regret it...After the amazing tea house shootout, I was hooked and it just got better from there. The star Chow Yun-Fat plays the Hard-Boiled cop, Tequila Yuen who's up against the triad and seeking revenge for his partner. Simple yet affective.Tequila is one of the coolest characters ever. As a 'take no prisoners cop' Tequila spends most of the movie, filling bad guys with led with an arsenal of weapons such as dual pistols, machine guns and the most powerful shotgun in a film. But while still a dark person, Tequila is still an engaging and likable character, that you'll be rooting for by the end.Featuring some of the best shootout scenes ever shot, the film is a non-stop 2 hour joyride. Full of exaggerated blood, stylish shooting, huge explosions and Chow Yun-Fat in one of his coolest roles, this is some of John Woo's best work.Unless, you've got something against blood filled action, I recommend you hunt Hard-Boiled down and enjoy one of Woo's best works.",

Although his attempts to make movies in America like Face Off, Broken Arrow, Mission Impossible 2 and Hard Target were great examples of his talent but none compare to his import titles. The fact that this movie is not in english doesn't effect it one bit in fact I think that it lets you focus more on the action at hand than what is going on around it. This is typical Woo where everyone has about 10 guns each and thers is one guys taking out about 50 villians with tons of huge explosions. Chow Yun Fat, Woo's regular has not exactly made a huge splash in American film, his only worth while performance was the Replacement Killers, is a one man army of an action star in this movie. The story is that fo a typical action movie you know one rouge cop goes beyond his call of dutey and orders to save the day and as one person do what twenty cops can't seem to do. The thing that is greatest about Woo's style is that even though it is very very violent and the shooting never stops all the action scenes are more like dance numbers than shoot outs. This along with almost all of Woo's films is an action masterpeice that is not to be missed.",

The story is fine, the acting OK and the production values not bad, but what makes this such a good film is the action. The end of the film consists of a staggering display of shooting, a must for any true action fan. I'm sure that if I spoke Chinese I'd enjoy the film more, but even with the appallingly poor English dubbing on the DVD, this is still a great film. Woo needs to get back to this level of quality for his future movies. The killjoys who advocate censorship would have a field day with this picture, so it ain't for everyone.

            "review_title": "Hard Boiled",
            "content": "Much has been said about John Woo's 1992 crime-action extravaganza \"Hard Boiled\", and for good reason. It is about Tequila, an impulsive, tough-as-nails cop that doesn't always play by the book, and it is also about Lung, a self loathing undercover cop that is morally confused. Both Tequila and Lung are on a hunt for an illegal weapons cache, but they are both on opposite ends of the operation, and neither is aware of the other for much of the screen time. One thing this film gets right from the very start is a sense of vulnerability for the characters. Yes, they are skilled and crafty policemen who can take on many at once in a gunfight, but there is always the feeling that they, and, by extension, all of the other characters in the film, could be killed at any moment. This feeling is largely due to the unexpected death of a character at the beginning of the film, which sets us on edge for whats to come. It definitely helps that every scene is incredibly well choreographed, well shot, and well edited, and everything is easy to follow because of that, even during intricate action scenes in which bullets are flying in many directions and many characters are trying to avoid them while trying to hit the others with their bullets. Although he relies on it heavily, Woo's use of slow motion is always effective in increasing the tension of the moment. All of the effects used in the action scenes are practical, with real explosions, incredible stunt work, and of course ridiculously large quantities of blood. All of the technical aspects of these scenes are undeniably fantastic, but that doesn't mean anything if the story and characters aren't involving, but luckily this has a crime story that is complex and characters that aren't perfect, but have genuine moments of empathy.A lot of the action in the film also has another reason than to simply look cool: it's to build character. Many people talk about the incredible 3 and a half minute long one take action scene near the end of the film, but what most don't realize is that without context, that scene doesn't evoke nearly the same emotion. Without the build up to that scene and an understanding of the characters, it is admirable, but not nearly as visceral and intense. One of the reasons it works so well is not just because of the amazing choreography, but because this is a turning point for Lung as a character. Up until this point, he has been haunted by his mistakes and the bad things he has been forced to do. However, during the moment in the elevator after he shoots the cop, Tequila helps him realize that, while mistakes that impactful are definitely difficult to handle, he doesn't have to dwell on them, and the sooner he moves past his fear of doing an irreversible wrong, the sooner he can do justice to others and move on. After they come out of the elevator, the music begins back up again, signifying a tonal shift, and a shift away from Lung's fear and guilt. Also, the character of Lung has been having an identity and morality crisis throughout the film, and as the viewer we never quite know who's side he's on, until around this point, when he confesses that he has never killed a cop.Speaking of the ending, I feel the rest of that 30 minute finale is vastly underrated compared to that one incredible shot. That whole sequence is fantastic. The stakes are incredibly high, with hundreds of babies, children, and injured people trying to be saved from the hospital, and many situations when I genuinely couldn't imagine how they would make it out, yet every-time they made it out, it totally made sense. It also cuts between many different characters and many different action scenes at once, yet it doesn't get knotted and confusing.This is a intense and fast paced crime story that builds from one action scene to the next, conveying character through its action with style that doesn't replace substance.",

The reason for the delay is really quite simple - \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" (seen on Tuesday) has been occupying my thoughts since then and it is only now that I can concentrate on \"Hard Boiled\", John Woo's acclaimed masterpiece of extreme violence cinema. And not a samurai sword in sight.Chow Yun Fat is Tequila, a trigger-happy cop pursuing gun-running Triads across Hong Kong. After losing his partner in a raid, Tequila must team up with an undercover cop who has infiltrated the leading Triad gang to bring down the organization. But the fact remains that few will watch this film as a serious study of police work in Hong Kong. John Woo has become a brand now and fans know exactly what to expect - theatrical shoot-outs, loads of slow-motion, paper and debris flying everywhere and a high body count. All present and correct, sir! Why shoot a baddie once when you can shoot him ten times as you are diving through a window, crashing through the glass and watching your doomed target sail through the air and crash through a table?The fact that there is so much death and destruction in this picture (230 people die on screen, a record according to IMDb) is this film's strength as well as its weakness. It runs like a computer game, with ammo seemingly limitless and a villain called Mad Dog (Time Crisis, people!). True, it pales in comparison to Tarantino's latest but all the action is so over-the-top and over-stylised that the impact of the violence is deadened. But action is what John Woo does best and there is no doubt that initially, the gun battles are exciting to watch. It's just that when every battle is the same, are you still entertained?Someone I work with described John Woo as a \"one-trick pony\". While that may be harsh, it is nonetheless accurate. \"Hard Boiled\" is no different to any other Woo film in that it glorifies the gun. I rated Woo's \"Face/Off\" higher than this film for two reasons. One - I find it easier to relate to an American setting than an Oriental one. Second - I saw \"Face/Off\" before I saw this and the Woo-effect still had the magic. It's starting to wear off now but that isn't the fault of this film. If you haven't seen a Woo film then the chances are you'll have no idea what I'm talking about. For the newbies, this film is an excellent place to start. The stunt-work and gun-ballet are as good, if not better, than anything the mainstream movie watcher will find in The Matrix, Desperado et al. But if you've seen more than one Woo then the appeal will depend on how much you enjoyed the last Woo film. The law of diminishing returns is in full force - the more you watch Woo, the less you enjoy them.",

Basically the storyline provides nothing fresh (buddy-cops against a huge gun-smuggling ring) but it tells the movie in the best traditions of the h/k trademark: \"beautiful\" bloody ballet, with lots of gunfights, slo- mo- action and bloodletting aplenty. Comes short of \"the Killer\" on the 'plot'-side, but comes to a tie with it having an attitude as mean and providing even more in the 'kinetic action'- section; when Chow Yun-Fat takes that toothpick on the corner of his mouth and two berettas in his hands, you knows there's nothing short of a WW to stop him...

A dozen may be an over statement but this exciting balletic action from genre maestro John Woo does its best to blow you away! This is easily Woo's best film along with The Killer and is a mile apart from any of his mediocre Hollywood efforts. He manages to take the classic elements of the cop movie, including plot devices, typical inciting incidents and characterisation and overload it with as much action you can fire a gun at, creating two hours of pure adrenaline rush. The superb action sequences are split up by good plot detail and a bit of humour thrown in for good measure, a lot of it completely incongruous to the often violent scenario (the sequence with Yun-Fat dodging bullets while holding a baby for example). In this sense it doesn't take itself too seriously and the respectable, if basic storyline helps to make this not jut another pointless action workout. If your not a fan of subtitles then watch it for the action sequences and any conosseuir of all things violent would lap this up. The amount of bullets fired is staggering and the gunplay and stuntwork is some of the best you will ever see! The last 40 minutes in particular is pretty jaw-dropping, with explosions and bullets gallore, amidst the frenetic camera-work and stylish visuals. Hard Boiled must be near to the record for having the highest on-screen body-count in a film and this is a statistic that hints at what to expect. Amazing.8/10",

For a bit there it looked like it was going to develop into something. It definitely had it's influence on 'Infernal Affairs' and 'The Departed' then for some reason they got away from the plot and character development and for what seemed like an eternity, decided to just have people shoot each other in a hospital non-stop??? There were no side stories. Good guys winning? 90% of the police force seemed liked it was killed during the shootout. Hundreds of innocent patients are slaughtered. This is dedicated for the good work the Hong Kong police do? If this is how the Hong Kong police go about business, God help the citizens of Hong Kong.",

It features some of the most sadistic, violent images in a movie, yet, paradoxically it has a heart. It's mainly found in scenes featuring Tequila, such as when he's comforting the informer Fox, saving Willy, or when he's bantering with his girlfriend.\nAll the gun fights are cool to watch. Gunmen jump sideways in slow motion as they fire endless rounds and dodge bullets at the same time. It's only near the end, during the hospital shoot-out, that the movie seems to lose me. Some of the images of hospital patients being gunned down tended to grate after awhile. And just how many badguys were hiding in the hospital when the battle began? Close to a hundred, it seems. It almost seems like a video game. But these are minor nitpicks... Some great images include: the floating paper swans, the tracking shot that follows Tequila and Alan through two hospital floors, and the offscreen death of Fox-effectively done with just a spray of blood hitting a nearby window. Great movie; a must see.",

            "content": "Okay, I just said before that Hard Boiled has the most action seen in any movie ever. That is not an understatement. Never before have I seen a non stop action sequence go for a whopping 45 minutes. This 45 minutes of mind blowing amazement also contains the famous \"2 minutes 45 seconds\" scene, in which a whole entire take endures for... you get it. This is all action by the way. John Woo is a man known for his melodramatic, action packed movies, but Hard Boiled only contains the latter. Trust me, this will either give action fans EXACTLY what they are looking for, or it will just be too much. My own step dad, who loves a great action movie, thought that Hard Boiled was just too much. Basically the story follows lead Chow Yun-Fat, a cop named Tequila, who is trying to bring down the gun smugglers who are responsible for the brutal murder of his friend/fellow cop. During his vendetta, he finds out that the police have an undercover man within the triad, and so Tequila and our undercover man Alan team up to bring down the bad guys. And that's just about it. Sure, I actually did think for an action movie it was good enough, it got the job done. Tony Leung's performance as Alan was great, he made a character we cared about in the midst of... insane chaos I guess. And Chow Yun-Fat is... Chow Yun-Fat, an ice cool, tough as nails star. He shines in this movie just as much as he does in The Killer or A Better Tomorrow. So obviously, the story is okay, but not as impressive as previous Woo films. Heck, half the film was literally filmed without any script. The action is where Hard Boiled is at. And it's just insane. Completely mental. John Woo must have said, \"Come on guys! This is the last movie I make before I completely ruin my career in America, so lets give it all we've got!\" Hard Boiled is filled with iconic action scenes. You've got the close quarters tea house shootout less than 5 minutes into the movie, you've got the crazy warehouse shootout just as we pass the first quarter of the movie. Not long after there's a small, impressive shootout on the boat. And then all hell breaks loose not long after we hit the halfway mark when our characters enter the hospital. Utter madness. Butgloriously beautiful madness. And that's all Hard Boiled really is. If you're looking for an action movie with an above average story, you'll probably be disappointed. Go in expecting more than half the movie to be just full of insane action, and you'll be fine. Hard Boiled is a landmark film for a reason, there's just so many memorable moments here, I can't really describe it. Saying that this movie has so much action will either put you off, or get you excited for one of the most mind blowing movies you'll ever see.",

Finally I found a video store that has both The Killer and Hard Boiled.  I rented Hard Boiled first since I remember hearing Robert Rodreguez say it was one of his inspirations for making Desperado (another very stylish action film).  Well I can see why it was his inspiration, because this is by far one of the best action films I have ever seen.One thing that disappoints me about the US is that we never have had the chance to see a great Chow Yun Fat movie unless we go into the Foreign section in our video stores.  The Replacement Killers was descent but pointless, The Corrupter wasn't to bad at all, but his films with John Woo are like masterpieces.The action in this is so poetic and stylish.  I can't even imagine where they came up with some of this stuff.  The stunts in the film are also amazing.  The action scene with all the motorcycles flying through the air and dropping babies out of windows in the hospital at the end make your jaw drop, literally.  After seeing this film, you see so many aspects in it that were repeated in Hard Target, Broken Arrow, and Face/Off that it's hard to count.I could go on for awhile talking about the violence and Chow Yun Fat's performance (it's even good when his voice is being dubbed over).  This is something I have to get on DVD, it's amazing.  I did see The Killer in the following week and, considering I saw Hard Boiled first, I kinda liked Hard Boiled a little bit more.  Although I seriously recommend if you haven't seen either of the films go and find a video store that has them and rent them both.  Watch The Killer first for it's great shootouts and it's softer mood and then watch Hard Boiled which will just knock you on your ass.  Just outstanding.  10/10",

His goal: stop the out of control arms smuggling in Hong Kong. After a huge gun battle leaves a number of dead civilians and officers, the reckless Tequila is removed off the case. Of course no higher up is going to be able to stop Tequila from shooting bad guys as Tequila continues to work behind the scenes. Simultaneously, undercover cop Tony, played by Tony Leung must murder and betray his way to the top of the underground weapons trade in order to take down the big fish.John Woo is the master of action and Hard Boiled is a perfect case in point. Woo knows we go to the \"movies\" to see heroes flying through the air with double pistols and unlimited ammo. We're not there to see realism, we're there to watch in slow motion a gun being drawn and bodies drop to the floor in blood. Woo's command over the camera and his ability to squeeze every drop of \"coolness\" from his action scenes is truly at elite level. Now that I've praised Woo's knack for action it's time to talk about the bad. Hard Boiled is far from the best action film out there. This film is over 2 hours long and the story is all over the place. In fact Woo had to shut down production for a massive rewrite after they shot the opening scene, then later their writer died in the middle of filming without having finished the script. There are scenes interspersed that perhaps show a little character development but don't do much for the story. It was pretty hard for me to follow the story and it felt uneven all around. Many action scenes are gratuitously long. Towards the end of the film there is a section where the cops pin the gangsters in a hospital. This chunk of the film takes about 30 minutes! The scenes are just too indulgent stretching the adrenaline reserves of even the most die hard action junkies. Hard Boiled would have benefited from slightly better planning.The acting is good, Chow Yun-Fat is obviously an Asian powerhouse and Tony has got some impressive acting chops. Overall this film is probably best just skimming through to the action scenes. If you really want to study the camera work you might watch the entire thing all the way through. For me at least the non-action scenes felt like overdramatized filler. However you definitely have to credit Woo for his action. Expendables has got nothing on this film.Who this film is not for:-If you don't like guns, no need for you to watch this film.",

            "content": "What's there to be said about John Woo's Hard-Boiled that hasn't already been said? What else is there to say about John Woo in general? His over-the-top and strangely balletic approach to action has been highly influential in the action genre, spawning copycats and rip-offs the world over for decades. Even today, long after Woo's last stylized action extravaganza hit theaters, directors like Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodrigeuz (to name the most obvious ones) still mimic Woo's kinetic approach.Hard-Boiled is Woo's last Hong Kong film before he emigrated to good ol' Hollywood, where his style was utilized with higher production values and restrictions Woo had never had to deal with before. Sure, he went back after a while, but things were never the same (or nearly as fun) after Hard-Boiled. His previous films, most of which starred Chow Yun-Fat, were all exercises in pretentious melodrama and frenetic gun violence.It has all led to this. Hard-Boiled, also starring Chow Yun-Fat, cranks down the melodrama a few notches and kicks the gun violence into high gear. It's darker and has less heart than Woo's previous films, but Woo will still find a way to film a tragic scene in blurry slow motion from multiple angles, and he'll be damned if he doesn't add in the obligatory reaction shot of an emotional onlooker. No matter what movie it is, or what actor, it's always the same look in the John Woo Obligatory Reaction Shot. With emotional jazz music. Don't forget the emotional jazz music.But we don't really watch John Woo's films for the silly melodrama, do we? No, not particularly. Woo's idea of drama is laughable and kind of childish. His dialogue is often just as stupid as his drama is over-the-top waterworks about loyalty and brotherhood and redemption and the like. The brotherly bonds Woo's protagonists share add to the overall appeal of his work and has been copied almost as often as his shootouts. In A Better Tomorrow, it was a cop brother dealing with the road his triad brother has taken--with Chow Yun-Fat kind of slapped in between them as the middle man who wants to keep them both together. A Better Tomorrow II was more of the same. The Killer was a hitman (also Chow) being pursued by and later becoming partners with a dedicated cop.This time, it's Chow playing an angry cop named Sergeant \"Tequila\" Yuen, eventually teaming up with a triad named Tony, played by Tony Leung, who may or may not be an undercover. Of course, that answer is obvious, though Woo tries to lead us astray at first. They're both caught on the same side and also opposite sides in a triple-threat death match between two warring gangs and the police. Poor Tony gets mixed up with all three at once. Sooner or later, he'll have to pick a side and betray the other two.Sound confusing? Not quite. It's one of those mixed bags where the film is executed in a more complicated fashion than the plot ought to allow. The plot is simplicity itself. Think if The Raid 2 was made in the early 1990's and had blazing guns instead of blurry fists and feet. A crazy gunrunner wants to expand his business and the cops don't want that. Plain and simple.Aside from some decent acting from Leung and Chow--Leung for his emotional performance as a man torn by multiple loyalties, and Chow as a jaded cop who struggles to maintain control of his rage--the only other things worth mentioning are the higher production values and Woo's fantastic gun battles, since the soundtrack is wonky and hard on the ears when it isn't a sad jazzy melody, and the dialogue is a borderline joke at times, both in Cantonese with an English subtitle option AND with an English dub track (the latter of which makes this even more fun to watch just for the unintentionally comedic values it brings).So why the 8/10 rating? I'll tell you why: Hard-Boiled knows what it is, and it is the best of both worlds. It's a dark, brooding crime saga and a highly stylized action feast with some good-natured dark humour and a surprising amount of camp sprinkled in for good measure. Sure, lots of films can get away with the argument that \"they know what they are,\" but few are executed as well as Hard-Boiled was. Hard-Boiled is just a wide load of fun for everyone--or at least, every action fan who's tired of the sterile quick-cut-zoom-close-up saturation style that generally infects most Hollywood films. In this case, it's not the \"why,\" but the \"how\" and the \"what;\" it's not the idea, but the execution of that idea. And Woo's execution of Hard-Boiled as a whole is both masterful and excessive. We're treated to wide shots, panning shots, and chaos in its most raw and balletic forms, and of course a two-minute continuous shot of our heroes rampaging through the corridors of a hospital swarming with flying cannon fodder. With Woo, no blank is spared, no explosive is abandoned, and not a single shot is wasted. And I mean EVERY shot--be it from a gun or a camera.As excessive as it is, it's quite amazing that Woo managed to film these things with multiple cameras without so much as a boom mike being present within the frame. He manages this throughout the film, which is two hours, six minutes in total--approximately an hour and a half of which accommodates one of its three major action setpieces (and a fourth brief one somewhere in the middle). Each setpiece is crazier than the one before it, and by the finale, which goes on for a whopping forty minutes; the actors were practically blowing each other up for real. In fact, Woo DID blow up Chow for real (or singed him, at least...) when he reset the explosives for the sole purpose of getting a more authentic reaction from poor Chow.This is basically The Wolf of Wall Street of action films minus the third hour, for both our sakes and, well, everyone else's. I don't think anyone could handle a third hour of this kind of mayhem--not even the best of us. We're out of breath by the second exhilarating hour. By the third, if such a thing existed, there would be nothing left of us but exhausted shells. Action fans looking for a quick fix would find themselves OD'ing three times in a single sitting on this.Is John Woo's Hard-Boiled worthy of being called an action classic alongside films like Die Hard and Lethal Weapon? It depends on who you ask. If you asked me, I would tell you the latter options have better characters and dialogue, but the former trumps both of them and several others combined for kinetic thrills and cartoonish mayhem.I wouldn't, however, take Hard-Boiled as seriously.",

I was about 15 years old so I don't remember too much about it back then, but watching it now, and having it fresh in my mind, I have to say that this is one of the best action movies I've ever seen. The only reason to watch this movie is to see a lot of shooting and people dying. This movie was made in 1992 and it shows its age. The action sequences are not as polished as today's movies. The choreography is a little off, but that's how it was 15 years ago. John Woo is known for adding a lot of slow motion and flying doves in his movies and this movie is no exception. It adds a little drama to an action filled movie. This movie is not just another dumb action movie. Although it's filled with a lot of action scenes, the plot is above average. Chow Yun-Fat plays Inspector 'Tequila' Yuen, a cop who plays by his own rules to get the job done. The first scene is in a restaurant where a deal is going down and the cops and bad guys shoot up the place trying to kill each other. Yuen eventually runs down the last guy and kills him. When the dust settles, he finds out that the last guy he killed was actually an undercover cop. The next day, he finds a dead guy in a library, and it turns out that he was part of the Chinese triad. He finds another guy who is part of the triad and eventually finds out that he's also an undercover cop. They work together to stop the triad from smuggling weapons. The final scene takes place in a hospital where the triad and cops shoot and kill each other as well as innocent civilians. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies.

This has to be Woo's finest work to date, i also heard this was his last film in china before going of to America. Well thank god Woo and Chow left their 'De Niro and Scorsese' relationship with something as beautiful as this. An easy 11 out of 10!!! shame Hard Boiled 2 did not work out so well!",

If you're not, and you're looking for an introduction to the genre, watch something else. Why? Because apart from one or two contenders, this one leaves all other action films for dead, and if you watch it first, all the others you watch after it will be a disappointment.In fact, the uninitiated may find it too much to take at first viewing. The ludicrous body count in the first ten minutes is indicative of what is to follow, and the whole in-yer-face bulletfest ends in a shootout that occupies over half an hour of screen time. In the hands of lesser film-makers this would be too much of a good thing, but not here.Chow Yun Fat, apart from being a brilliant actor, is simply the coolest packer of guns on celluloid. Tony Leung, so far (criminally) hardly known outside HK, is an even better actor, and the two make one hell of a team. And though you wouldn't know it from the mainstream tat he's churning out now, John Woo used to be the foremost action director in Hong Kong before he packed his bags and legged it to Hollywood.",

It wouldn't be unneccesary to describe  how much action scenes were beautiful. The reason this movie is wonderful is, though, even though it's a action movie, it also talks about friendship, loyalty, anxiety towards Hong Kong's future and love. Without those facts, this movie would be just a simple mindless movie with full of blood.

This movie is a movie that when the action appears you sit there silent....wow...it gives 100% all the time...it burns, smashes, explodes, bullets flying (and persons)all mixed with splendid camera work. ok, now you think..aha..so this is a movie with no story, then you're wrong..the story is there and its told very well.

The action scenes really blew my mind away, I mean completely. Especially the teahouse and the hospital scenes. It's gun-fu basically. This movie has a very high body count due to the lengthy action scenes. The hospital action scene actually lasts more than a half hour. This is not JUST your typical action movie. This movie truly is a epitome of bloodshed and glorification of violence. The action scenes are actually the main emphasis of the film because the action is pure art. The story is pretty generic and straightforward, but performances by the actors are actually very good because you sympathize with the characters and their problems in life.

It includes multiple action sequences that are possibly some of the best action sequences in motion picture history.With this said, I think that it really should gain the notoriety and status of Die Hard.. possibly more. Die Hard has everything to make a great film; amazing action sequences, a great protagonist and a great villain.. but Hard Boiled has TWO great protagonists, and TWO hard ass villains (even though one of the villains does become a bit sentimental.. but then again, he gets a cool mangled face!) and it clearly beats Die Hard in the action division! What bugs me is that English speaking folk only prefer Die Hard because they don't have to listen to the poor overdubbing or have to read subtitles.. but I say that is bull!- it's all about the delivery and the passion; and Hard Boiled certainly delivers, and it certainly has passion, whereas Die Hard feels a bit hollow. I'm sure Westerners would appreciate this movie as much as Cantonese speakers do if they just give it a try (they enjoyed Crouching Tiger, Hid.. didn't they? ..only because of the publicising it got in the Western world - Hard Boiled didn't get ANY!)So I urge anyone who has seen this film and enjoyed it, tell everyone that has prejudices against foreign language films TO TRY AND WATCH THIS FILM MASTERPIECE which by the way is better than Die Hard, Die Hard 2, Die Hard WaV (\"supposedly\" the hallmark of the action genre) SO THAT I CAN SLEEP AT NIGHT!

Chow Yun Fat oozes cool and he is given some incredible action set pieces to look cool on.I prefer A Better Tomorrow over this film but don't think that is anything more than subjective opinion - this is an amazing action film that most any fan of gun fights and explosions will enjoy to the fullest. You essentially get two hours of some of the greatest action sequences ever filmed. The opening scene in the Chinese tea house has to be seen to be believed and I won't even mention the finale.

Only two words can describe it and one word can describe the English transfers and it's, \"BULLSHIIIIIIIT.\"Let's just get straight into summary. Hard Boiled stars Chow Yun Fat for the last time as a cop named Tequila. After Tequila's friend dies in a shootout, he avenges his friend's death by fighting against the Triad gangs as he later finds himself exposing a Bay level of explosions and weapons that have been lying in a hospital.I don't want to say too much about this movie other than, cooler than most American action films. John uses his trademark formula of action: expose the audiences to the area of where it takes place, add a situation, build up suspense with music and tells the viewers that something bad will happen, then release all that suspense violently with a tango of gun shootings and stair slidings. John Woo and Chow Yun Fat uses every single damn furniture in this film and use it as a Jackie Chan stunt and literally explode everything like Michael Bay but more easier to follow. Stories don't always make a good story, sometimes beautiful visuals alone can make it a masterpiece. Combined with a scene or two of dark comedy and using jazz music as Tsui Hark tells Woo not to, Hard Boiled still lives up to this day with it's outstanding action scenes, each one being memorable in it's own way. A must watch for action films. Just watch it if you ever enjoy watching action films. My #1 favorite action film.",

Compare the camera shots and the effects to his later works like Face Off or MI2 and you know what I am talking about. I really can't understand why everybody here says it the best action flic. I mean come on people jumping (literally) to the ground moments before they get shot, people dying before the explosion takes place and people dying without ever getting shot. The sound is very bad the camera motion is average and the stunts are average too.I'm a big John Woo fan nowadays. As said before I liked the action of Hard Target, Face Off and MI:2.

I think that the only real reason why I have a taste for action flicks is because of the impressions they left on me as a child.  Even if the movie is terrible you can still love it as a child.This brings me to Mr. John Woo.  I first saw his film HARD TARGET with Jean-Claude Van Damme in 1993 or so.  I was twelve and I had been a fan of Jean-Claude since I saw Bloodsport when I was seven.  So I watched Hard Target and it introduced me to John Woo.  I really liked the movie, but what impressed me the most was the directing.  Anyway, long story short I started locating John Woo films and without a doubt HARD-BOILED (LASHOU SHENTAN) is his best.On a side note, and an incredibly sad note, John Woo's films have gotten worse lately.  I was disappointed with 1996's BROKEN ARROW, but 1997's FACE-OFF was really good.  However, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2 was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I'll just stop there and get back to HARD-BOILED.I saw this movie in 1998 when I was seventeen and loved it.  I think what primarily impressed me the most was the style of the film.  I was already familiar with John Woo's style, but it was more stylish in this film.  What I mean is, I feel like John Woo's style (ever since he started making American movies) has gone down the toilet.  His early films are the best. And I do love THE KILLER, but it can't touch HARD-BOILED.This particular movie basically introduced me to Hong Kong action films. And it made me hate American action movies even more.  The Chinese genre is lightyears ahead of us slow Americans.  And it looks like we are finally catching up (DESPERADO, BLADE, THE MATRIX, etc.) or just trying to be like them.I can't say enough how great this movie was.  It is without a doubt the best action movie ever made!  And I don't see how Woo could ever beat it.  If you have not seen it then watch it.  I can't tell you anything else about it.",

In doing so, he inadvertently finds out that there is an undercover cop, Tony, in the Triad he is trying to bring down, and eventually teams up with him.This isn't your standard buddy cop fair like Lethal Weapon with tons of cheesy lines, dorky action and sappy side stories. The dialogue is insightful the action is the best ever and the side stories are well thought out, if a bit abbreviated (due to lack of time to shoot John Woo admits).Tequila is trying to deal with a failed relationship and the death of his partner, Tony is torn against blowing his cover and defending his honor and the Lieutenant insists on playing it by the book even though it isn't fair.John Woo said he made this film in honor of the men and women of the Hong Kong police force and the good work they do.

Boasting a body count that few films can rival, Hard Boiled is fun for the whole family.  The Eastern ethos that pervades the movie is interesting as well.

But this was the first of the original Hong-Kong action flicks of his that I'd seen, and it beats out the American films by far. Two hours of non-stop shoot-'em-up action a la stylized and overly elaborate gunfight sequences that left me breathless. I had to put a few scenes in slow motion to catch everything that was going on. The plot seems like a typical cop-out-for-revenge/buddy-cop movie, but there are some intracacies that play on the viewer's ability to pay attention to the story while also being stimulated by seemingly endless showers of bullets. But let's not kid ourselves...the action is the star here. Woo even manages to pit some humor in the middle of some excessive violence, in the scene where Chow Yun-Fat holds a baby in his arms while simulatenously killing off the bad guys, and then saying to the child, \"X-Rated Action!\" Indeed...and it's all so spectacular to watch. If you're a fan of non-stop edge-of-your-seat action, if you like your action served up hot and bloody, this is the movie for you!",

Though it's not John woo's best film it does lack in a couple of minor areas and unlike most of John Woo flicks his films always has subplots and twist in his films but in this film it's straight-forward and not all the characters are well-developed. but never less with it's action pack sets, A breakneck pacing, and solid acting just sit back and enjoy.The film is about A cop name Tequila a honest, hard-boiled cop who witness his partner get killed in a teahouse shootout started by triads and wants nothing but to bring justice to avenge his' partner's death.he gets closer and closer into bringing the triads down but finds out that an undercover cop name Alan, who is working as hit-man for the triads is in his way and is afraid that Tequila might bust his cover as a triad.Eventually Tequila and Alan finally become friends and work together to bust down Johnny Wong, A psychotic triad boss who trusts Alan and starting to have his doubts about him.eventually Tequila and Alan are in middle of a gun-battle inside a hospital where Johnny has a stash of guns hidden and now Tequila and Alan must work together in order to bring Johnny down.Overall, the plot is straight-forward and far from confusion as it starts off from the teahouse shootout, to the warehouse shootout and a climatic 30 minute hospital shootout that has some of the most insane shootout you'll ever see in a film from Tequila sliding down a stairail to shoot down a couple of guys.or in the warehouse where tequila explodes a motorcycle in mid-air to be honest the's so much stuff I don't even know it might fit in this review.though the film lacks in character development.Tequila is your straight-forward, hard-boiled, dirty harry type of cop who only wants to bring justice but not much is known about though it would have been nice if he was a bit developed.To be honest Alan is the most developed of the two.He has regrets of what he does as a cop and a killer.the fact he's lonely and isolated from the world and has to kill people just not to blow his cover and it's people he cares about and it makes him crazy and angry inside as well.as for the acting it's solid and enjoyable to watch as everyone does a great job of the roles there given.Chow-Yun Fat gives a solid performance as Tequila usually he would play charming, charisma characters, but he does well playing the hard-boiled cop.But when it's all said and done Tony Leung steals the show as Alan.He plays the character with a charm and always on point with the role.But what makes him stand out is his range of emotion.At one point he could smiling, two seconds later he has a mean look on his face that makes it so realistic overall I give Kudos to Tony Leung as Alan.past the leads Anthony Wong as Johnny Wong is not bad but if his character wasn't so cartoonist he would of gave a better performance.Overall Great film I recommend to anyone out there go get it.",

The action is excellent, with stunts and choreography that blow the viewer's mind.  Some incredible things are put in this film, and everyone obviously tried their best, which is very nice to see. With that in mind, however, I do have some problems with it.  I am NOT denying its status as an excellent action film--but for all that, it is still only an action film, not going much deeper than most.  For me, great action alone does not a movie make. The plot has a decent enough basis...cop takes on criminals, avenging his partner, meeting up with an undercover man inside, etc.  There are actually a great number of subplots, as well.  The problem is, none of the plots are adequately explored, which gave the film a sort of half-finished feel, as though John Woo (for whom I have tremendous respect) had finished the action sequences but had to release the film before the acting for the rest of the stuff could be revised.  Certain parts of the film are just laughably done as a result...it might have helped the film if the number of subplots had been reduced, and the main plot alone emphasized, making it easier to go deeper into things. Hard Boiled ends up, for me, as some outstanding action scenes held together only loosely by a plot that seems grounded in good ideas, but never really uses them much.  It is still an entertaining film, but won't go down as one of the greatest in my book.",

They were killing each other if though there was no tomorrow.  That scene could be the best and the most action scene ever created.  The team work between Chow Yun-Fat and Tony Leung was also a good remark.  One shoots another, the other shoots back.  One takes cover, the other covers back.

The final scene is one of the finest pieces of action movie-making I've ever seen, but the entire movie acts as a superb setup. Everything about it is well-done.

The cinematography is excellent, especially one steadicam shot in the hospital following our heroes from behind as they stalk the corridors shooting triads, which has a true arcade videogame shoot 'em up essence about it. Much of the gun play is over the top (Could Chow Yun Fat really take out a warehouse full of crooks with 3 gas grenades and a shotgun?) but that's what makes Hard Boiled so much more entertaining than western action films of the same era.",

He is not into arresting people, shooting them is less paper work I guess. The movie basically has 3 gunfights. Well, they last about 75% of the movie! It sets off in a fast pace introducing Tequila as the cop that would make Dirty Harry look like a rookie! In the 2nd shooting scene he discovers he is not alone in hunting a bunch of gun-runners. But the biggest thrill is the last action scene (it seems like it lasts half the movie hehe). It also involves one of the coolest bad guys ever, and a scene lasting 2 and a half minute recorded with 1 camera in one take were the good guys and the bad guy shoot and jump around like crazy. Unbelievable action takes place there! This makes movies like 'Rambo' or 'Die Hard' looks like kids stuff!

            "content": "I have yet to make a body count, but estimate the death toll to be just under that of \"300\". The action sequences of \"Hard Boiled\" dominate the action genre. No director in good conscience allows for the gunning down of dozens of helpless hospital patients, and the jumping, diving, rolling, slamming into walls, and frequent defenestration of both heroes and villains alike - all during furious and often close-range gun battles that give \"Hard Boiled\" an edge especially over current CGI dominated action films due to its authentic on-scene stunts, and its ultra-violent intensity. \"Hard Boiled\" was made in 1992, and the main way one can tell is, besides the costume design and the lack of CGI, is the \"Beverly Hills Cop\"-type music that occasional bursts forth. The jazz music that highlights Tequila's few reflective moments create certain sincere suffering in the heart of our rebel detective, and which sets a heavy mood on a light wind on a summer night. \"Give the guy a gun and he's superman; give him two and he's God!\" -Superintendent Pang speaking to and a/b Tequila\"Hard Boiled\" features a bad cop, Tequila, the film's hero, and the undercover and more morally responsive cop, Tony Leung (played by Tony Leung), as well as many other interesting characters. Tequila (played by veteran actor Chow Yun-Fat) is a rebel detective who plays a significant, though indirect, role in the mayhem and tragedy that is enacted by the sadistic, power hungry gangsters that he is vehemently and single mindedly hellbent on taking down with extreme prejudice. Why is Tequila a crazed and insubordinate cop hero? It has to do with art.The drummer in Tequila's Jazz band, who is also a cop, is killed by gangsterz in the film's first gun fight, in the teahouse scene. It is Tequila's loss of a great jazz drummer that is the primary reason for his single minded thirst for vengeance against the gangsters, and I can prove this. After the tea house massacre, Tequila returns to The Jazz Club (The Jazz Club being the name of the jazz club) and the audience gets to see Tequila's reminiscing his lost drummer, not his lost cop. The deceased friend as artist was more important than he was as a cop, and this may point to the fact that Tequila's friend was killed in a gun fight as a cop, rather than as a drummer. Drummers don't get killed in gun fights. Tequila has a deep love for jazz and for the bond of band members that is created through the playing of music, and this loss of his drummer signals an end to the best part of his life. All that is left is vengeance, but Tequila doesn't give up his human side, even when his life or the lives of others are at stake.Director John Woo draws morbid comedy out of the interplay between action and dialogue, in which excessive dialogue between characters leads to the death or near death of other characters. Woo uses the dialogue\\action interplay to parody the time consuming dialogue that often takes place in action films at the point in such films when the audience is asking, \"What i/t/f are they doing talking and being sentimental in the midst of this obviously dire situation?\" In a hospital room, after Tequila and Tony kill a few gangsters, they talk sentimentally about themselves while a guy they are supposed to be protecting from yet more gangster, who has hidden in another room, is being murdered the the gangsters' top killer, Bull Dog. After they are talking with each other for a while, they seem to suddenly remember that they are in an action movie, and that their witness is probably dead. A similar event occurs later, near the conclusion of \"Hard Boiled\" when Tequila is rescuing a baby from the hospital (that is being blown up by C-4 charges placed throughout the hospital by the gangsters) and stops amidst the onslaught of explosions and flames to offer some sentimental words to the little squirt in his arms. Only when a huge flame-spurting explosion almost incinerates him and the lil' munchkin is he jolted back into the broader diagesis (the reality in the world of the film). What is significant and funny is Tequila's persistent need to stop in the middle of a deadly situation and, shall we say, smell the flowers, to talk of fluffy things and good times, to take time out of the entire madness of the situation and completely forget about it. But Woo, the director, doesn't forget about the surroundings, and he allows the surroundings to sneak up on our all too human hero. Tequila is not a Schwarzeneggerian killing machine, even if he does kill more guys in \"Hard-Boiled\" than the Schwarzenegger-as-Terminator does in all of the \"Terminator\" movies combined. Tequila is a very human cop - both driven and considerate for the little things in life that matter, even in the midst of death and destruction. This shows the fun Woo had in being realistic with respect to the time-action-dialogue that was happening in certain spaces in time. Woo, in his literalistic humour, outdoes the one-layered absolutist temporality of the storytelling dynamics that tend to dominate the action genre. Whether he intentional or not, in \"Hard Boiled\" director John Woo plays with this dramatic element of film fiction, absurdizes it, just as he does with the level of violence.",

I like long action sequences. I like a slight bit of martial arts but not too much. Good photography. The sense that the director gave a damn about the film. The sense that the actors are just as hard as the characters. Exciting editing. but not too over the top.To name but a few. The conclusion is HARD BOILED KICKS ASS!!!It features all of the above and more. Chow Yun-Fat matchstick gritted between teeth. 2 9mms and carving his way through hordes of badguys. who truly deserve to die. Is it just me or is he the coolest guy ever to walk the planet. It is tricky to go through all the things that make this film great, every second was mind blowing and it is near impossible to put into words how good this film is. Normally when I see a film I'm dissapointed. \"Oh I would have done it like that\" or \"I would have missed that bit out\" Often I'll go not expecting much and not get much. sometimes I'll go expecting alot and get nothing, Rarely I'll see a film expecting it to be awful and it's not that bad. But this, I had such high expectations from this film, I didn't think a film could be as good as what I expected. I was amazed that it was better. A masterpiece. go get it now. 10/10. Can't you see what I'm saying it's brilliant. However there was one minor flaw Chow Yun-Fat should have worn a big black trenchcoat.",

I felt the movie got boring after the first 5 min. The plot was not properly explained. Why was the MC like that (we could get to know him more, like his past). The same with the main enemy. Nothing of him was explained, except that he was a plain psycho that took everyone down with him. Beside, the action effects was redundant. The slow-motion effect was recycled throughout the movie. Sadly enough it didn't have any other cool action effects. I am not a fan of it, but I can at least appreciate that when the movie don't deliver a decent plot.So, shortly,summarized, a plot that didn't go in any direction, redundant action effects, and last but not at least unexplained characters.

There is so much to this film that makes it great, it's hard to begin. One reason why this is such a great movie is the drama. John Woo and Chow Yun Fat do great collaborations and we get some of the best action drama the genre has to offer. Chow Un Fat and the co-star (whose name I can't spell) both play cops that walk a very thin line between good and evil. Sometimes they lose sight of what it is they are doing on the force but have a compassion to make society a better place and to do so, they'll do whatever they have to do. The movie has one great action scene after another. The movie is non-stop for if it's not an action scene, it's a great character scene. And action movies aren't made like this anymore. In the film's climax we get an amazing sequence in which the two heroes must save a maternity ward of new borns while engaged in a heavy gun fight with the enemy. It's a scene that is timeless and breathe taking. Hard Boiled is one of the best movies of it's kind and no one should be disappointed.",

It is great there is a thick plot, juicy charactures and a very satisfying ending. Although the film is let down by the Dubbing it still beats all of the Seagal films. It has some very good violent scenes which I enjoyed and Chow Yun Fat is amazing, he truly could hold his place even against the greats(Sly or Arnie)This is one which should definatly not be missed and if you liked the Hong Kong feel look towards \"The Killer\", if you liked John Woo's trademarks then watch \"Face-Off\" and if you think that Chow Yun Fat is a God then try \"Replacement Killers\".    10/10",

They all featured plots that seemed to have been written by a 7-year-old with ADHD, and directed by someone who drank 10 gallons of nyquil! Then we have Hardboiled. This is an action movie! The script wasn't great, but it didn't seem like it was a rejected pitch for a marvel comic either! For the most part it was believable, mature, and managed to create a tension that haven't experienced in john woo's other movies. The acting wasn't great, but the actors did just enough to make you care,or hate, them appropriately. These two aspects of the film are just a bonus for me,because the plot and acting in an action movie just needs to hold its own, while things like editing, effects, and cinematography are key in my opinion. These latter 3 categories are done with incredible efficiency in hardboiled! The fact that mr. woo \"limited\" the use of slow motion in this film compared to his others, made it so much more effective when he did use it! Also, never have i seen so many squibs and pyrotechnics used so boldly! I swear to God, it seems like the actors are standing in a tornado in several shot,because there's debris and shrapnel flying all around them! Finally, the director seemed to be trying a much wider variety of shots here than his other films. My personal favorite is the 4-5 minute continuos tracking shot that follows chow yun fat and his \"partner\" through the halls of a hospital,on an elevator, through the halls of another floor before cutting! All the while, blasting away with pistols and shotguns, slo-mo kicking in and out. what a great shot! What a great action movie! If only all of Woo's movies could be this great...",

And how many squibs, explosives and blanks the production must have consumed. I don't think I've ever seen a film before that more successfully wades through such a gratuitous amount of carnage without batting an eye. I didn't keep track, but I'm sure that at least 200 gangsters, cops, innocent bystanders, SWAT team members, doctors and hospital patients were gunned down mercilessly in the film. And yet none of them really matter, except for Chow Yun Fat's slain cop partner and the head villain in the end. Perhaps the silliest/most awful moment was when Fat's character was mowing down goons while carrying a baby in his arms (two cotton balls in the ears make the infant oblivious to the awful bloodshed of course) - the renegade cop apologizes to his child ward and wipes the spattered blood off of his gurgling sweet face. All in all, a fairly engaging action movie and despite the wanton destruction and lack of interest in the value of human life, Hard-Boiled is well written and directed. However, it doesn't have the soul or wit of Woo's earlier film The Killer, which I highly recommend.",

He plans to blow the building up, even with babies still packing the maternity ward.  I WANTED Tequila to blow his headoff.

            "content": "Another Hong Kong action film that pits a gritty detective who seem to have been borrowed from the SWAT team against a comic-book villain who appears to be mostly intent on showing just how much of a bad guy he really can be.There's also a police chief who only seems to get in the way of our hero until he eventually does something useful late in the day, a gang member who isn't as bad as he seems, an evil henchman with a penchant for grenades, and a female character with no personality whatsoever who also manages to help save the day in a stereotypically female way in the end.Pure clich\u00e9 then.There's a little plot development in here, which is unimportant because the story - cop trying to stop a gun smuggling gang after they kill his partner - is basically an excuse for huge amounts of shooting and a whole lot of explosions.This is one of those movies where all kinds of things blow up whenever someone shoots them as if each bullet were a miniature bomb, and people only ever need to reload when the director wants to add a little twist to a fight scene.Towards the end, Hard Boiled almost seems to slide into parody, and I was half expecting to see a helicopter emerge from behind a panel in the rubble of the villain's lair to carry the him away, laughing evilly while machine gunning a children's birthday party, or something.If you're looking for an over-the-top action film that has no time for nonsense like making much sense, this is a reasonably entertaining two hours that you might as well experience. It's not one of the better action movies I've seen though.",

This movie has better, more explosive gun battles than any other action film! While the storyline isn't that creative, and the relationship between Tequila and Teresa Chang is not developed, it is one hell of an action film. The special effects are great, and the actions sequences can only be described in one word - art. Chow is a beautiful man, but this is nicely complemented by Tony Leung Chiu Wai, who plays Alan. Mad Dog, played by Philip Kwok, is a great and evil-looking villain. As with most of John Woo's films, there is a gratuitous amount of explosions and violence, enough to satisfy even the most voracious of appetites!",

            "content": "John Woo's 'Hard Boiled' is an amazing movie to say the least. His gunfights are incredibly well-paced and are extremely breathtaking with ingenious multiple camera angles and cinematography. The storyline is a little simplistic, but fun and realistic in a streamlined fashion. Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Chow Yun-Fat give some of their best performances as well. Especially Tony Leung who had been acting since around 1982 (mostly in TV series) gives superb acting and emotion in strongest scenes in the movie. And Chow Yun-Fat who has been in many of John Woo's films found himself in a starring role once again and he as always does a great job and shows it once again in this film.One problem though and it isn't the movie itself... is the fact that many of John Woo's films have been going out of print in the last year or so. Criterion Collection and normal versions of films are disappearing and it is hard to tell why. Find yourself a good copy of the Criterion Collection of Hard Boiled on Ebay, it is worth it, believe me. Also look for John Woo's 'A Better Tomorrow.' (Avoid it's sequels though) John Woo was a great director with a knack for some of the best action sequences this world has ever seen. Much of what is now considered action is based on his work and John Woo's work is based highly on Sam Peckinpah from the sixties. Discover what was John Woo before he sold out to the American Film Industry and you'll be very pleased. Take my word for it.",

I mean the whole movie is one fire fight after another, with just a few minutes of dialogue sprinkled in between. Which may sound cool, but after awhile it becomes monotonous. The action sequences themselves were fairly entertaining, but also absurd. Every time they shot something there was either a huge shower of sparks or an explosion, and there was an excessive amount of slow motion used.Overall I am glad I watched Hard Boiled because as ridiculous as it was, some of the gun fights were pretty cool, but it's not what I would call a good movie.",

            "content": "Hard Boiled was John Woos swansong from Hong Kong cinema, and its fair to say that he went out with a bang.  Indeed, the first twenty minutes alone, a stonkingly good and incredbly orchestrated shoot out set in a tea room contains more action than most Hollywood action films do through there entire running time.  Woo sets his stall out early, and then freewheels from one heart-pounding set peice to the next.  It is fair to say that the plot is flimsy, but who cares when the action`s this good?  However, there is more to recommend this than action alone.  Chow Yun Fat is as ever awesome, Tony Leung is more than capable in the support role, and Phillip Kwok is suitable menacing as Mad Dog. There is almost always more to Woos work, and most dissertations of it will blab on about thig such as the underlying themes of loyalty and duty, the complex friendship triangles that ocur, often between people on different sides, and the ultimate resolution of peace through violence.  These may be true,  but dont detract from the twin pistol, rip snortingly good shootouts. As has been mentioned, the acting is stellar, but Woo is the real star of the , injecting the action with both a staggering energy, but almost poetic grace.  Indeed, the gunfights are better than anything previous, or since. Not only does he stage one running gunfight that lasts the best part of 3/4 of an hour, he has the audacity not only to include steadycam shots that last for a couple of minutes, they include complex stunts, and explosive squibs gong of! All in one take!! It would be easy for m=e to rant on about how good this film is forever, but I couldn`t do itjustice.  Possibly the best action film ever made. Almost certainly the best film to come fromHong Kong.",

They say it is bad because the dubbing is bad (that is the crappy American company that sold you the movies fault, not the movie) or the transfer was bad.  Some say it is too violent.  Some say the acting is bad.  Some said there is not plot.  Maybe you watched the wrong movie. No plot?  An arms dealer housing his arsenal in a hospital.  That is a plot. Maybe you should go back to school.This isn't the greatest action movie ever simply because every action seen tops the other and they are so superbly choreographed.  It is cinematically beautiful, Philip Kwok of Five Deadly Venoms fames choreography and role is superb.  The Production Design is great, it blends so seemlessly with the lighting.  And it features the greatest shot in action cinema history, hands down.  The 3 minute shot to Chow and Tony traversing the halls, going up the elevator and killing numerous bad guys along the way is incredible. There has never been anything like it.To all those non believers out there, if you like action movies, you will love this.  IF you don't like it, they you are fooling yourself into thinking you are an action movie fan.  Now, if only John Woo could make another movie like this instead of the godawful Windtalkers.",

Those scenes are good, however, the action scenes are what give this a 10. John Woo is the master of gun-play. My favourite parts are Chow's classic \"stair slide\" and the hospital gun fight where Tequila and Tony face off with Mad Dog. When Mad Dog rides into the warehouse and dismounts his bike (and kills) is also stylish and noteworthy. Out of the three John Woo movies I have (A Better Tomorrow-excellent; Once A Thief-meh and Hard Boiled), I'd have to put ABT slightly ahead of this one because of the storyline and Mark's restaurant assassination is my all time favourite gun scene. This may change though, because I have ordered the \"The Killer/Bullet In The Head\" set and am waiting for it to arrive (it went out of stock 2 days after I ordered it, so I have to wait until they restock (fu ckers).

The action sequences don't come much better than they do here, and the climatic battle in a hospital lasts a staggering 45 minutes, which includes a superb long shot following Fat and Tony Leung through corridoors, up an elevator, and along another corridor.I strongly suggest that you watch this and enjoy what is easily the finest film to come out of Hong kong, and certainly John Woo's finest hour.",

After a spectacular single-handed gun-battle, Yeun is forced to team up with assassin Tony (Tony Leung), who is working for evil Mastermind Johnny Wong (Anthony Wong). And that's it. A simple plot obviously proves to be a bombastic experience. Yun-Fat and Leung are sensational as the hero-duo, while Tereasa Mo & Phillip Chan provide good supporting characters as Yeun's mates at the station. The action scenes are breath-taking, while the finale in a hospital can not be put into words . . . it's that good! If you have never seen a John Woo, then this is a brilliant film to start with and you'll be hooked in no time! It's the most rockrolling, heart-grabbing, gun-toting 122 minutes of your life!

If you don't like mindless action and would prefer something with, well, a plot, then steer well clear. If you do like mindless action then this film puts most Hollywood efforts to shame.In the opening gunfight director John Woo starts as he means to go on. The slow motion shots as the characters dive from cover to cover exchanging fire and wrecking the walls behind them are spectacular. Bullets fly, plaster flies, casings fly, and people fall. The action sequences seem to flow with an energy most films just can't summon up.The body count hits the stratosphere very early on and the plot is cleverly used as a device to move from gunfight to gunfight. This film never tries to take itself too seriously, and it never tries to be clever. It simply delivers a superb show. You could argue that the actors don't exactly have very much to go on, but Chow Yun Fat suits his soft-on-the-inside-tough-on-the-outside character very well (and also gets to deliver some amusing lines, such as saying 'Don't look! X-rated action' to the child he is holding in one of the gunfights). The other characters are portrayed with equal relish, with my favourite character being the hit man with morals called 'Mad dog'.John Woo truly delivers a masterpiece of style over substance, and his slow motion shots are now so copied in American films it hurts. But only John Woo can do it this well. The lobby scene? What's that then?",

To me, Hard-Boiled represents action as it should be (I mean, when you look up the dictionary and find 'ACTION', there should be picture of Hard-boiled there). No stupid drama (well, there's some, but not much), no CGI (gosh, I hate CGI), and MASSIVE on-screen body count (about 250)! I mean, this movie is 100% slaughter from beginning to end! You need to see the action to believe it! This movie is unique when it comes to action, the finale nearly 45 minutes long! Needless to say, this movie isn't for children. This is one of the most violent movies in history, though the shootings are not very graphic. By graphic, I mean no heads explode or guts spread all over. But the missing gore is replaced with huge amounts of cannon-fodder and blood. The plot is about cops and baddies and.... blah blah blah, you don't watch this movie, because of the plot! So, it is really unnecessary to explain it. Though, I must mention that Chow Yun Fat stars this one (surprise surprise!!), and he, as always, is great. The coolest man in the universe. Anthony Wong plays the bad guy here. The bad guy character is so over-the-top, that no other actor could play that part, than the greatest psychopath of them all (you understand this if you have seen Ebola Syndrome or Untold Story). I found out that my friends didn't like this movie at all, so i'm gonna put up a little FAQ: 1) Nitpickers STAY AWAY!! In this movie, unlimited ammo is a normal thing and one out of thousand bullets hits the target. 2) It is very important to turn of your brains for this one. This is pure fun, no brain function needed! 3) Some kind of 'Violence Toleration' is necessary. So, if you think that Face/off was bad, then.... uh.. this is not for you.So, if you enjoy REAL action (Jerry Bruckheimer-fans get lost) then this one is worth the buy.

As I flicked through the DVDs on the shelf, I saw films that I never knew existed, then I came across a film that kind of stood out to me.On the cover to this film was a oriental guy, clad in army or police gear and with one arm is clutching a huge shotgun and the other arm a half naked baby.I didn't have a clue what this film was or about, I didn't know who Chow Yun-Fat or John Woo was. I couldn't have let this film slip, I was compelled to see what this film was all about.So in one hand is \"The Matrix Revolutions\" and the other this crazy action film I'd never heard of, I only had enough money for one DVD, do I made the brave, but hugely smart decision in getting \"Hard-Boiled\".Two years later and Hard-boiled is one of my all time favourite films, and now when I watch \"The Matrix\", the action scenes don't impress me, when I want to see action, I go for Hard-Boiled every time.The film opens with a shoot out so daring, so dramatic, that most western action movie directors would have used this kind of action for the climatic end scene.And it just gets better.The drugs factory scene is also equally amazing, but on a larger scale.But nothing, not anything compares to the hospital shootout, its truly the greatest scene of action the cinema has ever scene, one word - mayhem.What John Woo does is take the forever old shootout, and make it poetic, ballet like and artistic - but still brutally violent, he, like Sam Peckinpah, is the greatest action movie directer, period. He and Chow Yun-Fat need to reunite and make more amazing films.What this film has also done is introduce me to the daring but brilliant \"world cinema\" and after I took this DVD back to the rental store, I took out \"La Haine\", \"The Killer\" and \"The Eye\", which are all great as well.This film does not get half of the credit it truly deserves, the only film that rivals this in action stakes is \"The Killer\", You can keep \"The Matrix\".

Woo touches on his usual themes of loyalty and brotherhood, but with nowhere near as much success as he did in The Killer or A Better Tomorrow.  The characters are also even more archetypal than usual...and in this case, the only real life in the characters comes from the amazing charm of Chow Yun-Fat and the likeable appeal of Tony Leung, both of them more than able to save even the thinnest characters. Hard Boiled is still a great flick, though...don't get me wrong!  In fact, it's probably the perfect HK action film to watch with a roomful of newbies and recent converts.  Loaded with great action and jaw-dropping stunts, Hard Boiled is spectacular eye candy, but for those of us already spoiled by more intense HK action films like Ringo Lam's Full Contact, it falls just a hair short in other departments.",

I only watched about 3/4 of this movie but that was enough to blow me away!!! Not only was the idea in this movie unique, but it had lots of great action. Not really that gory though.  The best part was that it was pretty hilarious.  There is pretty much swearing in this movie, but it's mostly not directed at people. This is a great movie...You should really go see it!!!",

            "content": "This ultra speed violence film is my favourite. Just perfect! There is not another director with the talent to make an action film like John Woo. But, even John woo won\u00b4t can make a movie like this another time. Everything works perfect. I have seen the film twenty times at least, and I\u00b4m not tired! The first scene in the birds in cage place is really incredible. And the last half hour goes upper and upper every time and you can\u00b4t believe it. The rhythm is like a symphony with an incredible \"tour de force\" end. You can see in this movie the best of Sergio Leone, Sam Peckimpah or Jean Pierre Melville. I know that many people prefer The Killer, but I think this is because it was first. Lashou shentan is better than this very good film. I repeat: the best violence film in the history. I have no doubt to vote with 10.",

Violence, beautiful camera shots, and superb acting from the greatest director of all time (John Woo) Come together in this film. Woo has made this film a visually intriguing one by using his vast knowledge of how to catch your eye.Chow Yun-Fat stars as Tequila (Sgt. Yeun) who has a distinct joy in killing ruthless criminals. They refer to him as the \"Supercop\". Tony Leung is Alan an undercover cop caught in the mix of the Triad and the police force.This movie has the greatest action sequence i have ever seen on film. It's a must see for any action fan!",

            "content": "From the opening sequence in the film you know what you are in for, a white knuckle roller coaster of an adventure that keeps you wielded to your seat. Hard hitting violence is crafted  into an eloquent ballet by the masterful John Woo in this superior action thriller.But underneath this high octane carnage is a well told story of friendship, revenge and new hope.  It centers around an uncompromising, tough, Dirty Harry style cop who gets emotionally involved in a gun smuggling case after the death of his partner. Tequilla (the cop) is played brilliantly by the ever charismatic Chow Yun Fat and equally Tony Leung plays a wonderfully cool and calm assassin with a big secret.With most action films you get one major shoot out at the end but with Hard Boiled you get three major shoot outs each superbly choreographed and given that certain touch that only John Woo can give. A true masterpiece showing both John Woo and Chow Yun Fat at their best.",
