Because yes it is the same old thing still going on to this day of what happens to women. One even wanted to know what companies allow 16 year olds to work for them?? Many! It's called an internship! Duh. You can pretty much guess who left those kinds of reviews. Shows like this are still being made because it's STILL happening. To women. So take a wild guess where most of the negative reviews come from. Yes you pretty much knew who was in the wrong but it was the unfolding of the story that was good. Some people just can't understand that. This is made for people who want to know the story not just try to guess the killer in the first 5 minutes. Give it a shot if that sounds like something you are in to. You might like it.",

I have seen some of the behaviours shown in this series so I can relate to some of it , what is missing though is the representative good people and particularly all the good men, the ones who are kind, thoughtful and supportive. I have worked with some difficult women but also many who have worked incredibly hard and remain wonderful. What I am trying to say is that this series lacks nuance, it like using a brick to open a window. It's a start but only that. Hopefully something similar can be produced which taps into the idea that we are not all good or all bad.",

The character build was perfect building up to the reveal in the final episode.I clearly do not understand the negative reviews. A lot of very clever work went into writing and development and complexity of each character.Sam played by Mexine Peake was truly a well crafted character. Very talented acting for such a challenging role. I will be looking for her previous roles and will be watching just to see more of her incredible talent.All actors we perfectly casted and brought so much. Bravo to everyone involved in creating this little series.",

The cast was excellent especially Maxine Peake & Alison Steadmans performances. The plot is plausible, I suspect this happens in many corporations around the world. The script was well written I would give it a go, but perhaps see all episodes before commenting to give the plot time to develop. I don't agree with other's sentiments on this drama, I would highly recommend.",

It used a common device of starting off with a death and using flashbacks to fill in the backstory. It was unusual in that the deceased wasn't revealed at first. There's a strong message about sexual harassment of women, which seems to have provoked some of the negative reviews, but I didn't find it detracted from the story. If you want a well acted, intriguing story that will keep you engaged then I can recommend Rules of the Game.",

I didn't like the cheese club either that was silly and I can agree much of the cast was unlikeable but that is the point I think.

I've given up on many new series this winter after one or two just because I was bored.First, it was good to have something different from the usual girl/woman on a slab/missing police procedural with the standard quirky/damaged police investigator. This is set in a workplace and there are too few programmes or films set in places where most of us work i.e. Not in a police station.As for claims that it was all too implausible well so is most drama because it has a beginning, middle and end - a resolution when in real life there isn't one. And as for boozy workplace parties, sorry work events - well I can't think of anywhere that's had those recently. Not just plausible very topical.I will say that the writers didn't need to cram in quite so many current stories - sexual harassment in the workplace, toxic workplace culture, children watching porn, abusive men/partners, activism. That is a flaw.And it is nice to have more of a female focus to a drama although I accept that not all the men needed to be out and out beasts. There are some good ones out there. I also liked that a main character was actually Indian with a culture and plausible family and not just a brown person with a western name and no connection to their culture or background.",

            "review_title": "Quite good, despite many flaws",
            "content": "We watched all four episodes, and I can't agree with some of the negative comments. The acting was excellent, particularly Maxine Peake as Sam, though she looked rather pinched (peaky), and it was Alison Steadman I think who said she was showing her age. The script was intriguing, keeping us guessing whether it was Maya or Tess who'd died: it was always a safe bet it was murder. I detected none too subtle digs at Sports Direct and Prince Andrew, while Rakhee Thakrar as Maya managed to be both annoyingly neurotic and self-righteous yet at the same time sympathetic.However, I have many reservations. The idea that there are companies where a woman can only get near to the top if she sleeps with the top men is insulting to both sexes. Tess was just obnoxious, and her attack on Maxine's character at the end, suggesting she'd brought the villains down to take over at the top was just ridiculous: Sam had finally had enough, and had risked her livelihood and indeed her life to expose the crimes. Sam's daughter was also a pain (I'm sure every younger generation thinks it can do better than previous ones, but Gemma was especially smug.) The two cops were the least convincing I've ever seen (an overweight 34 year-old DI and a pig-tailed DS.) The suggestion that Amy, who'd died 10 years ago, had made bad choices was slapped down, but if a 16 year-old over-indulges in drink and drugs and has an affair with an older man I'd say she made bad choices. That was just one example of the tiresome wokeness of the piece (and of the BBC?) The series was written and directed by women and with one exception the women were victims of terrible men. The founder of the company and his two sons, and Maya's abusive husband, were white, heterosexual and therefore vile. The two black characters, and the gay one, were by contrast decent. There's a call to make misogyny a hate crime. I wonder if those making the call think misandry should also be a hate crime, or will this be as one-sided as so-called colour-blind casting and the idea that only gay actors should play gay characters, and only disabled actors should play the disabled?Despite all the reservations, this was still a fairly enjoyable and gripping tale.",

The bleak and disturbing compromises or abuses many women most accept to get on either at work or at home. Or even to just move on day-by-day.Uncomfortable to watch at times and some characters need more time to \"fill out\" but not a bad story, all in all.Just not a good one either.",

            "review_title": "A Poor Show that misses the mark",
            "content": "BBC recently released this show onto the IPLAYER and I have now watched the 4 episodes of the show and here is my review for Rules of the Game. The premise of the show sees a new head of HR join a company and she starts to examine the toxic working relationship of the company and take action against the culture of the senior staff.Main Character\nMaxine Peake plays the lead character Sam and the best thing I can say about her is that she is clearly acting well. It is a strong performance and you can tell she is really giving her all in the role but the problem is that she is so unlikeable in the role. You can have flawed characters but when there is pretty much nothing to make you care then it is a pretty difficult sell to an audience.Supporting Characters\nRakhee Thakrar plays the new head of HR and she is okay, again she acts the role well and you are obviously on her side because of the clear issues at the work place. But she is just a bit bland and boring, the show loses the ball with her in the middle of the show and it made it a struggle to full get on board. Callie Cooke as Tess Jones is probably the best character in the show, she is really affected by the issues at the workplace and for me she was the one person that I felt was genuine with her character and I kind of wish she was given more screen time as she was my favourite character. Ben Batt and Kieran Bew play the brothers who are the executives and they are okay but there is no denying they are clich\u00e9's and it is laughable how over the top they are. The rest of the cast do their best but there just isn't much here and I would argue the show is a bit cluttered and could have done with some having a smaller role.Story\nThe story is where the show really falls down, it is just absolutely absurd. It starts off trying to set the show in pretty realistic conditions but as it goes on you realise just how crazy it starts to get and how it is just laughable. It also doesn't help how predictable it is, I worked out what was going on by the end of the first episode and that was a big issue for me. The ending is also too abrupt, it leaves you wondering what happened to the majority of the characters and that is a big let down.Script\nThe script does have some okay dramatic dialogue that makes the interactions feel more intense. But it also feels quite superficial, it is also a pretty dour show and that makes it hard to stick with, especially with its slower pace. Now I don't mind if a show wants to push a message, this show is clearly pushing the feminism message and that is fine, but why do shows like this have to make every male character a scumbag, it just takes me out of it and feels like the message is outweighing the actual show.Style\nThe show is filmed well enough but it is so boring. The show trundles its way through the episodes and it can't keep the suspense and drama up enough for me. It is a shame that this is the case as the set design is pretty good but I fear people won't even bother watching till the end.Overall\nOverall, Rules of the Game is a poor show that misses the mark. It clearly has a message but it executes it badly and I would say give this one a miss.Rating - 3/10.",

            "content": "For a show that explores misogyny and toxic masculinity in the workplace, it's also done a pretty good job of exposing it (as well as other deplorable traits) among IMDb users as well - appalled by some of the comments here that are nothing to do with this 4-part series but all to do with the world view of some very blinkered people.Therefore, sadly, just by being a MeToo drama, the series was going to face immediate backlash from the start. Hardly surprising then that reviews have been left panning the whole series after only episode.That is not to say that Rules of the Game doesn't merit any constructive scrutiny. There are times the whowasit/whodunnit plot (which is a clever idea) drifts into soap opera territory, but it's the execution of that script that keeps it firmly in the wheelhouse of elevated drama we expect from the BBC.The performances from Maxine Peake, Rahkee Thakrar and Callie Cooke are committed, and the direction/storytelling of the scripts whips the tale along clearly and at a great pace - even allowing for laughs here and there.It's not perfect and it wont be for everyone, it will also be uncomfortably familiar viewing for some, but it tells an interesting story of gender dynamics in the workplace it's time we saw a lot more.",

I love that word as an insult - I'm woke and proud.I just think it takes on too much, sexual harrassment/abuse (a reviewer actual says it was not in the show... well at least not really, it was consensual!) Of course, a 30+ year old boss and a 16 year old.... consensual? Of course it is. And these people are allowed out in society!!!But I digress, we have the above, the cheating husband, deceptive husband, abusive husband, a boyfriend who is a coward, a bitchy gay man. Any 1 or 2 of these could make a compelling story, having all the men being misogynistic is not going to push any agenda forward in a constructive way because of the attitudes i state in previous point.Women don't escape either from harsh treatment from writer. We have the bitchy friend obsessed with being beautiful and negging on her \"friends\", the women cheating with her boss (\"friends\" husbands), a busy-body neighbour, a mother who resorts to crimes and complicit in murder. The female cop proved incompetent by actually not solving case and to top it off the woman who is actually starts the investigation is a clich\u00e9 written HR person who is rathe bland, but whose behaviour seems to confirm some of the husbands allegations of mental issues and for the people like the earlier reviewers will excuse his abusive behaviour as being justified. Oh I forgot about her mum who is clich\u00e9 (again) mum knows best who interferes and screws up daughter's life further.I almost forget my point here, but.... oh yes, basically every character is flawed to varying degrees but so obviously that there is no subtlety or nuance that you end up not caring if there was an ulterior motive in Sam's final redemption. Because everyone is so nasty unkind that yes, she could have had ulterior motives other than moral justification.Could have been good, and the writer has missed the opportunity to write something that can be intelligently discussed to raise awareness of some VERY genuine societal issues with regards to gender discrimination.Maybe she thought.... this is my one chance to get all this across to an audience, I'm going for it. I just hope she has not blown her chance, because despite all the above, she tells a pretty good story.Phew. WOKE HA HA HA HA.",
