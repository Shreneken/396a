            "content": "I have already seen the original 2021 Drishyam 2 hence while watching the Hindi remake, i knew what was coming. Still i watched it to see what changes the Hindi version makes to the original or is it just a blatant copy paste.The answer is NO! It is not a blatant copy paste. Let me tell you in points about them:-1. Having not seen the original Drishyam 1 but the Hindi drishyam 1, i didn't knew that Gaitonde's character is a unique addition to the Hindi version. This , even in Drishyam 2 is a masterstroke.2. Gaitonde lives up to that hateful character he had from the 1st film. The Hindi version has slightly altered the police station interrogation scene in the 2nd half and this is where the Hindi version outclasses the Malayalam version and the difference was Gaitonde.3. Akshay Khanna as the IG is another masterstroke addition who fills in the shoes of IGP Thomas . While Thomas was direct and strict, Akshay Khanna is sarcastic in his tone and has this evil way of talking that gives him his own identity. Another place where the Hindi version scores full marks. He's done a terrific job.4. Another thing that gives the Hindi version it's own popularity is the famous \"Satsang\" confession. When again brought up here, the crowd roared ! Shows you how this Satsang thing has had its own fan following as compared to the confession in the Malayalam version.5. The fact that certain scenes have been a little altered to avoid being called a blatant copy paste, for example the film begins with a person murdering another and then running in the jungles. The Malayalam version started straight from the running part without much showing the sequence why he was running.6. The elder daughter's illness was better captured in the Malayalam version. The Hindi one just seems to add it for name sake.7. The final climax courtroom scene was , imo, better executed in the Malayalam version. The Hindi one felt like it was rushing to the main points of the climax. Also that scene in the court where Vijay and the IG cross each other , this too was a little better in the Malayalam version where George kutty and Thomas crossed each other and that expression on Thomas's face was better.8. Tabu and even Rajat Kapoor have nothing much to do as the spotlight are taken by Vijay, Akshaye and Gaitonde.Overall, Drishyam 2 hindi is a very good remake of the original, just like Drishyam 1 was despite change in directors. It almost felt like Abhishek Pathak had the soul of Nishikant Kamat in him while making this film. At this point, we all can agree that the Hindi version has made an identity of its own , thanks to including new characters and property modifying certain scenes. A tight slap on the face of those who thought this was to be an ott film.",

            "content": "************ Movie Review *****Ajay Devgn's Drishyam, released in 2015, was simply superb which was an official remake of Malayalam film Drishyam starring Mohanlal thanks to its thundering climax and electrifying screenplay.The sequel, Drishyam 2, which releases today takes the story forward when the IG (played by Akshaye Khanna ) re-opens the case which led to the disappearance of son of Meera (Tabu), leading the trail back to Vijay Salgaonkar and his family.While the first film was directed by late Nishikant Kamat, Abhishek Pathak returns to the director's chair with slow-burn and yet engaging story written brilliantly by Jeetu Joseph with twist and turns enough to keep you at bay. Drishyam 2 starts off on a slow note but gathers the steam towards the second half. The series of events infuses life to the film and will keep you guessing with what-will-happen-next scenes. Of course, the editing could have better reducing the duration of the film, especially in the first half.It is the last one hour of the film which makes it an interesting watch thanks to the outstanding climax. The only actor who could match to the calibre of Mohanlal is Ajay Devgn . The actor expresses adequately through his eyes and gives a stunning performance. Akshaye Khanna is just turning out to be fabulous with each and every role he plays and this one is definitely on the radar. Tabu and Shriya Saran's character could have been better written.So, overall, Drishyam2 is worthy sequel to 2015 s Drishyam which should be applauded for its skillful writing, brilliant performances and astounding climax.-Ketan Gupta.",

Even after watching the Mohanlal's 2021 Malayalam original, I enjoyed this Hindi remake immensely !!The story takes off 7 years after the incidents depicted the first installment happen, with Vijay Salgaonkar ( Ajay Devgan) and his family trying to move on with their lives. However the fear of the law catching up with them affects each one of them differently. The police, having lost round 1 haven't given up hope and are trying every trick in the book to nab Vijay !!Who wins this cat & mouse game forms the crux of the plot.The Hindi remake, like the original has a runtime of 2 hrs 33 mins & around 1 hr 30 mins are pretty laid back with the story proceeding at a leisurely pace. But dont get fooled by this as the movie picks up speed in the last one hour as it moves ahead with one dhamaka after another culminating in a mind-blowing climax.Performances by Ajay Devgan and Akshaye Khanna are exceptionally good. Tabu, Shriya Saran , Rajat Kapoor, Kamlesh Sawant and Ishita Dutta too are awesome!!An absolutely unmissable movie that remains faithful to the original. It was heartening to see audiences cheer Akshaye & Ajay's dialogues just like the good old times. Go watch it in the theatres .. you won't be disappointed for sure!!Going with 4 stars out of 5 ..

Ajay Devgan and Tabu did great and everyone else enabled them to excel in it.The cinematography was amazing keeping you hooked onto your seats.The best part was the casting was the same as part 1.

He is a good actor but he needs to take care of his muscle mass n bone density.This one is better than Suspect X (2008), Perfect Number (2012) n The Devotion of Suspect X (2017).All are based on the 2005 novel The Devotion of Suspect X (2005) by Keigo Higashino.",

            "content": "I might not have been able to experience the magic of Drishyam, one of the best crime thrillers from Bollywood even though a remake, on the big screen, but I was determined to experience the sequel in cinemas at any cost. Also, this was my first experience of a night show, and that too without wearing any masks as opposed to my previous cinema visits. And man, I was wowed. Drishyam 2 delivered nonstop entertainment and lived up to the expectations.Unlike the first film where I didn't know what to expect from the plot, I knew about this one and hence expected twists from the beginning, due to which the first half felt slower. The previous one had a lot of twists in the first half alone, due to which comparisons are inevitable. But the first half isn't wasted in unnecessary songs or comedy. It cleverly prepares the conflict through introductions of characters both old and new, and like a proper slow-burning crime drama, gives ample time to the development of the plot. You might feel that the intermission block has arrived either too early or nothing too big has happened this far, but trust me, you're in for a surprise! What might feel unimportant in the beginning will turn out to be a major asset in hindsight!As the second half begins, the tension begins to rise. Casting Akshaye Khanna as the rival of Vijay (played flawlessly by Ajay Devgn) turns out to be a brilliant choice, as he proves to be menacing at times even though we know he is not a bad guy. There are references made to the previous film, which can both surprise and make you chuckle. Unlike big-budget blockbusters we've seen this year, Drishyam 2 isn't replete with otherworldly visual effects or songs to make you tap your foot.Then what is it that captivates you and makes you ignore the lack of the aforementioned elements? The story. Yes, you might buy the ticket for the stars as they're all big names, but you'll leave your seat impressed more with the story. I can't imagine the film without the intelligently written story which compensates for the lack of any masala or visual spectacle one might be mistaking this film to offer. Also, I would love to reiterate that the performances were all terrific, and provided just the right amount of support to the story and the overall product. The final act is the best part of the film where I couldn't believe what happened and also couldn't help but laud the genius writing.Even though a remake (I will check out the original and other remakes too), Drishyam 2 is one of the finest thrillers of the year and promises entertainment replete with drama, suspense and surprises worth the price of your ticket. It's good to see the film is running successfully even though there are new releases out in cinemas. I'm glad I didn't wait for the OTT release and instead went ahead with enjoying this masterpiece on the big screen. Recommended!",

            "review_title": "A Very Gripping and Intelligent Sequel With Perfect Twits and Turns !!!",
            "content": "The sequel to Drishyam, which is adapted from a Malayalam thriller of the same name, begins where the 2015 film had left off-Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) emerging from a police station carrying a shovel. Seven years ago, the almost-perfect crime had a witness, and that's what gives the police impetus and ammo to revisit the Sameer Deshmukh missing-case investigation so many years later.Vijay is now a theatre owner who dreams of making a film based on a story he has written. His elder daughter Anju (Ishita Dutta) is still reeling from the shock of the traumatic events, while his younger daughter Anu (Mrunal Jadhav) is in her teens. Every member of the family, including his wife Nandini (Shriya Saran), is moving on with life as usual-but always on guard. And with a haunting sense of fear which never leaves them. A series of unexpected events turn the Salgaonkars' lives upside down when a truth threatens to change everything.Even the support Vijay received from his community seven years ago, begins to dwindle as the plot unfolds, and they begin to question if he actually committed the crime. The film gathers up steam when the police investigation led by Inspector General of Police Tarun Ahlawat (Akshaye Khanna), and Sameer's (who's accidental death in Drishyam formed of the crux of both the films) mother and former IG Meera (Tabu), swings into action. This time, they follow the leads without underestimating the protagonist.Following a similar pattern like the first, helmed by the late Nishkant Kamat, here director Abhishek Pathak takes things slowly in the first half. The family's dread and anxiety are palpable as he gradually builds the tension in the narrative. As the investigation progresses, every character serves a distinct purpose, and helps heighten the drama and suspense.Ajay Devgn shines as a protective father who loves his family unconditionally; he is a simple man with a razor-sharp mind. Akshaye Khanna, who in the past has played a cop, in films like Mom and Ittefaq, lends much gravitas to these gripping proceedings. Tabu is simply outstanding as Meera, a mother seeking justice for her son. Rajat Kapoor shines as her husband who eagerly wants everything to be settled soon. Kamlesh Sawant reprises his role as Gaitonde, who is still ruthless and bloodthirsty for revenge. Shriya Saran, Ishita Dutta, and Mrunal Jadhav, who play other Salgaonkars, have almost similar roles as they had in the previous part. Saurabh Shukla as writer Murad Ali plays his part well to resolve the mystery.Jeethu Joseph's original story is skilfully adapted by Aamil Keeyan Khan and Abhishek Pathak. They deftly weave in multiple threads, leading to a stellar climax packed with numerous twists that are as good as the first film. While the first one undoubtedly had a certain novelty to it, the sequel stands strong too, it intrigues and entertains. The story here remains unpredictable for the most part, however, some of the setups seem contrived and some situations too far-fetched. Having said that, making a sequel to a very successful first part wherein most of the characters are the same is quite a challenge.Amitabh Bhattacharya's song Sahi Galat that comes with the credits and the title track is upbeat. Saath Hum Rahein is slow but perfectly filmed to capture the bond family share. The background score by Rockstar DSP (Devi Sri Prasad) blends well and adds to the intensity of the drama.Overall, Drishyam 2 dishes out plenty of twists and turns to keep you hooked throughout, just like its predecessor. And the story of the Salgaokars will continue to remain in public memory.",

            "content": "Stepping into the theatre, it is natural for you to think, is there really the need of a sequel? Is it just gonna be another cash grab or there really is more story to tell which can match the complex narrative and high stakes of the first film which was so perfect in every way? Believe me, in the climax, you'll literally start clapping to the film's genius.The film starts off with the anticipation that Vijay and his family from the first film might, they just might get caught for their crime they committed 7 years ago and managed to get away with it by fooling the entire police department just on the basis of visual deception.The film starts off slow prioritizing the world-building and characters over the plot, but that's just the beginning, because the payoff it gives at the end (trust me, it's even more bonkers now) is just phenomenal. Having written a script myself (which took me 3 weeks by the way), I can only imagine of getting such wild and risky ideas to put in the climax. Cheers to the original writer Jeethu Jospeh for coming up with such unique concepts and connecting them to cinema.Ajay devgn once again beautifully portrays the protagonist (still scecptical on this one) Vijay Salgaonkar who appears stoic and calm on the outside but is planning everything to keep the secret \"buried\" on the inside. Tabu as this ex-cop turned grieving mother out for revenge and closure is just a perfect follow-up to the original film. Kamlesh savant returns in his role as Gaitonde and does not disappoint, he still oozes the same anger he had 7 years ago on Vijay for ruining his career because he was the only one who knew the truth behind it all but lacked the evidence to prove it. But, out of all the returning cast members, it was Akshaye Khanna, the new addition to this universe, that stole the show. Just his presence is enough to make the screen shine and his dialogue delivery is enough to give you the chills.The soundtrack once again, hits hard. Absolutely thrilling and apt for the scenes. Alhough, it isn't Vishal Bhardwaj who has composed it, Anil Johnson does manage to keep up with him and provide some good scores.One thing I would like to point out is that the film also delves deeper into Vijay's mindset as a person. It perfectly depicts how Vijay and his family with him will have to be in fear their entire lives just to keep the crime they committed a secret. Even though, they are free, freedom isn't with them. There is a beautiful line at the end of the film which goes like, \"even if Vijay manages to escape the cops with his wits forever, he will never be able to match eyes with the parents of Sameer Deshmukh (the boy who was murdered in the first film)\" indicating how ashamed he is and his life itself is his punishment.A perfect sequel, that's it. Vijay Salgaonkar is indeed, the smartest man alive.P. S.: this film does a few things different than the original Mohanlal film in order to streamline the runtime and it does manage to do so successfully, but deep down, I feel that it was Georgekutty's (Mohanlal) journey that comes a step above (you'll understand it if you watch the original Malayalam film) and shines just a little brighter than this.",

            "content": "After watching the trailer of the hindi remake of Drishyam 2, I was excited to watch it even though I knew the twist after watching the original one starring Mohanlal.So finally went and watched it today, found the first half more interesting than the original and got hyped as the best part was yet to come.And then when the climax portions start, they go destroy the best part of the original movie which is the scene where the biggest twist is revealed.This is the scene where the judge reads the DNA report in the courtroom and reveals that the skeleton is not of Sameer.Now let me tell you what the difference is in both versions and how this remake ruined it:Malayalam Version - In the courtroom everyone is shell shocked, cut to police/Tabu gang - Tabu character stands up and yells 'Noooo'. Closeup of everyone in shock, great bgm and such an impactful scene. Top cop Murali Gopy in frustration says \"What was the damn climax?\"Hindi Version - Zero reaction from Tabu/Akshaye and gang! Seriously? What were you thinking? Such a big twist and everyone is just looking down as if they knew it all along and Akshaye just mumbles \"Woh doosra climax kya tha?\". As if twist gaya baad mein mujhe toh kahani sun ne ka hain! Even in court room just confused looks, not shock. And Ajay Devgn just stares in one direction. Look at Mohanlal, still in character looking down with shame for what has happened.Akhaye Khanna did a splendid job but they changed the role of the top cop in the original a lot which I didn't like. In the original it felt natural and more like an IG/police officer played brilliantly by Murali Gopy whereas Akshaye's role felt more like that of an income tax officer rather than a cop.Shriya Saran is a huge letdown because she can't act and just keeps moving her eyeballs in various directions to express fear or takes a big gasp and it looks so weird.The torture scene by Gaitonde was not required and I actually laughed out during that scene because Shriya Saran taps the table she is thrown on, which looks like as if she is in a WWE submission match.In the original it was more of a mental torture which looked more natural.So they improved few things from the original but destroyed the best scene and rushed the climax, made some bad changes as mentioned above.You may enjoy it if you haven't watched the original.

It's because the film apart from its strong story was also technically brilliant. Also the chemistry between its cast members was impeccable. That family looked like a legit family and Mohanlal and his wife looked like a traditional Indian couple. Absolutely flawless chemistry. Same thing unfortunately can't be said about this Hindi remake. There was zero chemistry here. Also the kids were forgettable unlike the original where you will clearly remember the kids in the family.I'm not against remakes as long as they are done perfectly. But this is, forget perfect, not even just good enough. I liked The Hindi part 1 and his absence in this part can be clearly felt here. This director doesn't hold a candle to Nishikant Kamat who made a remake also equally good as the brilliant original.I guess it's all due to comparison. My younger cousin seemed to like this and she hadn't watched the original. So maybe if you haven't watched the original Malayalam movie then you will like this but as someone who holds the original to his heart, this remake was absolutely disappointing. Very forgettable.",

It is the official remake of the malayalam film 'drishyam 2' directed by jeethu joseph.Well, what do i say about ajay devgn. He is the living embodiment of 'be so expressive with your eyes, that your words don't hv much to do.' Again, he has acted full to his potential. His body language, dialogue delivery everything is on point. Shriya saran gave a decent performance according to me. Ishita dutta and mrunal jadhav brought the required aftereffects of trauma and distress. Akshaye khanna really elevated the scenes with his determined demeanor. He brought a sense of stoic presence in the film, a worthy opponent of vijay. Tabu and rajat kapoor did not have much space to do anything. The rest of the cast did their job. Kamlesh sawant as gaitonde again brings in that kick with his evil shades.Technically, this film is superior to any that you would find. Its cinematography uses a cold hue to saturate its frames, maybe as a picture to what trauma and PTSD feels like. The shottaking is good as well. The sound design and background score is enthralling and epic. In the scenes of high intensity and tension, the bgm elevates the film to a whole new level. Superb work!!The screenplay is tight and engaging. The first half builds up the characters, which honestly,\ni would have liked more. The second half brings in the mystery and tension which we are accustomed to with a drishyam film. The twists and turns are logical and have been justified as well. They really do surprise you. The two very superficial characters at the beginning are dealt with superbly in the climax. This also indicates how much realism and logic has went into the writing. Really loved it!!The dialogues are gold. And when you have stalwarts like ajay, tabu and akshaye with their gold dialogue delivery, its such a sweet pie. Dialogues have always been the strong suit of a drishyam film.I would have loved to see how late nishikant kamat would have handled it. RIP sir!!

Whether this time Vijay will be behind the bars??? Needs to be watched.Those who had watched the sequel of Drishyam 2 , malayalam version will definitely know the climax but those who don't, Ajay Devgn's Drishyam 2 will be an intriguing thriller movie experience.Those who have watched the original also might feel the thrill as here we could able to see how Vijay Salgaonkar, his family , the police handles this case..When talking about the performance, it was a pool of talents on one screen. Akshay Khanna cop presence was totally a different experience of what Murali Gopy had performed.Akshay Khanna's portraying as IG wherein he portrays as a cop with shrewdness, composed mind but knows where to hit. His screen presence was totally an add on flavour to the movie.Gaitonde inclusion in the script which is an addition from the original also brought a laughter and suspense kinda ambience.Apart from that, Ajay Devgn, Shriya Saran, Tabu, Rajat Kapoor again worn up their respective dresses of their characters and gave a stellar performanceSo, after a long time a well known remake movie but still refreshed to watch as this crime which is still refreshed after many years.",

            "content": "Sequel to the much raved about Drishyam, Drishyam 2 redefines what it means to make a sequel. Bare minimum, yes, but in this age of constantly degrading depth and meaning in Bollywood, where sequels are nothing but a way to capitalise on the brand of a successful film, this is a heartening sight. That doesn't absolve Drishyam 2 of its flaws, though.The pacing in the first half is understandably slow, given its genre, but at times it leaves you restless. The film does reward you for most of it in the second half - specially the climax - but I believe the first half could still have done with a bit more judicious editing.There's also issues with direction. For instance, the film is naggingly obsessed with the slow-motion effect to the point that it overuses it and it inevitably loses impact even in scenes where it should have worked.The film's cast is fantastic. Be it the lead cast of Ajay Devgn to Akshaye Khanna or the supporting cast of Kamlesh Sawant (Gaitonde) to Siddharth Bodke (Braganza). The background music adds perfectly to the film and the cinematography captures the magic of Goa (and its relentless rains) beautifully. The film also hits the buildup right and has definitely set up the third part well with the revelations in the climax. However, a key part of the denouement relies on suspension-of-disbelief which for a realistic thriller like Drishyam 2 is bothersome. Without getting into the spoilers, I would just say this film isn't as airtight as the first part was. It's also not as engaging as the first part which got to the point much faster.Overall, Drishyam 2 is still worth watching for it is a rare thriller franchise that is both indigenously made and entertaining for the most part. I am going with 6/10. Bonus points for being the first film to use humor against the brainless and jobless boycottbollywood propagandists.",

Why is Vijay Salgaonkar living in a palace? Georgekutty's place wasn't too big, was it?I thought Mohanlal and Meena looked more 'regular' than Ajay and Shriya, she looked like she was in a Sanjay Leela Bhansali movie. Adds to the plot? No. Takes away from the plot, no. So, not sure why.Overall - still a brilliant story regardless of if you've watched the original or not.",

            "content": "Drishyam 2 (2022) :\nMovie Review -Ajay Devgn, aka Vijay Salgaonkar, is back to save his family and fool the cops again. As he quotes, \"Sach ek din bahar aa hi jata hai,\" we were all prepared for the body to be found even before watching the film. Mohanlal's \"Drishyam\" (2013) was a sensation in Malayalam cinema and in the movie buffs' universe because nobody would have expected a cover-up thriller to be so good and captivating. Nobody would have imagined a sequel to the masterpiece suspense Drishyam had, but then we had Jeethu Joseph and Mohanal's duo pulling off an impossible and unimaginable classic sequel to cult Drishyam. The Hindi remake, \"Drishyam\" (2015), couldn't become a sensation and a huge blockbuster at the box office like the original Malayalam flick, but it gained a great fan following in the past 6-7 years. Now, the sequel is finally here, and it's another honest remake like the first one.Drishyam 2 takes place seven years after Sameer Deshmukh's murder mystery, as Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) and his family members are still looking for peace and happiness. Meanwhile, a newly appointed IG, Tarun Ahlawat (Akshaye Khanna), has started to investigate the same case to prove Vijay's crime. Suspended inspector Gaitonde (Kamlesh Sawant) and Mira Deshmukh (Tabu) try their best to find proof against Vijay to avenge the humiliation and personal loss. At last, the body is found, a few pieces of evidence are collected, and Vijay confesses to his crime. But will that be the end or has the fourth-failed Vijay Salgaonkar got some bigger plans to fool the cops? Go to the nearest movie theatres to know all the answers.Drishyam 2 was an easy script for the makers, as they simply copied and pasted the original source material. I don't know what changes Abhishek Pathak has made, as he claimed in media interviews, except for Gaitonde's addition to the narrative. The Malayalam flick is about the protagonist vs. The new IG, whereas the Hindi remake is about the protagonist vs. 3 cops (Tarun, Gaitonde, and Mira). This seems to have done injustice to Akshaye Khanna's character because the Malayalam flick gave full exploration to that character. The runtime is slightly less, but it didn't feel that engaging at all. Drishyam 2 does have a couple of scenes of its own, though, but nothing more impressive or better than the Malayalam thriller.Ajay Devgn's Vijay Salgaonkar is quite different from Part 1, and rightfully so. The gap of 7 years has to be filled with a few changes in appearances, and Ajay wore all the changes very well. Those intense eyes are at work again. Shriya Saran gives a top-notch performance, and Tabu is amazing in whatever few scenes she has. Ishita Dutta has grown up as a character, but it reflects on her performance too. I was expecting more from Akshaye Khanna, but he was slightly underwhelming. Mrunal Jadhav, Prathamesh Parab, and Saurabh Shukla barely appear to be noticed, whereas Kamlesh Sawant's Gaitonde still leaves the same impact. Overall, the acting unit has done fairly well, but the potential was greater because this was a performance-oriented film.We always say that an ideal suspense thriller shouldn't have songs and a runtime of over 100 to 110 minutes. Hollywood understood it in the 30s only, when they started making talkie cinema, but the techniques, storytelling, and viewing consumption have indeed evolved over the years. Drishyam 2 is neither songless nor less than 2 hours long, yet it doesn't feel boring. Don't know how, but the film has actually managed to do it. Malayalam Drishyam 2 did look longer, but it was a proper cinematic experience, which forced the viewers to overlook the length. The Hindi remake tries to work on the issue but doesn't add up to anything effective. The technical aspects are nice, be it cinematography, editing, or the background score.Abhishek Pathak is promising in his second film, but I think he has a lot to learn, especially in the cinematic sense of storytelling. You remember the courtroom scene in the Malayalam flick when the judge says it and the camera goes zooming in on George Kutty with slow motion visuals and a staggering background score? That was a damn classy frame. Believe it or not, but Abhishek Pathak has missed it here. Yes, you heard it right-he missed the best moments from the classic thriller while remaking it in Hindi. Jeethu kept it intact even in Venkatesh's Telugu remake, but Pathak just couldn't understand what it actually meant. He missed many important pauses, too. As you know, copy-pasting a story or film is easy, but copying somebody's vision is not possible. Drishyam 2 Hindi remake might prove it to you. Except for a few faults like this, there is nothing majorly wrong with the Drishyam 2. And like he says, hero to aakhir me jeetna chahiye! We all enjoy that.RATING - 6/10*",

And honestly the movie needs Focus and attention .First of all , I would like to say that this movie is the best Criminal movie I have ever seen before . Its really the best and its a completed movie from all sides . The cast is amazing and the acting is so good , the way ajay devgan and tabu and that new police officer also the family members of ajay's they all acted amazing , but the most two people who acted really amazing are ajay and the new police officer and the daughter of ajay .The second thing is the plot . So many twists and so many things that makes your mind blow and burn , you can't expect it . You expect everything but not the plot especially the ending . The third thing I liked is the soundtrack and the music and the quality of the movie , it was amazing and suits the weather of the movie and really amazing . The last thing I liked and the most is the directing and how they showed the plot I mean the way they did is Fantastic and so creative .To sum up , I want to say this is the first movie since 2019 I didn't write the disadvantages and things that I didn't like because I really mean it that this movie a perfect completed movie and I liked evrything about it .

After seeing part 2 trailer the eagerness was much more and did it lived up to the expectations ????I haven't seen Malayalam version of this movie so I won't be comparing with it. This movie has amazing plot with some really outstanding twists and turns. Ajay Devgn, well no one can beat him in this style of acting, his eyes and his body language are dialogues for him. New entrant in this sequel - Akshaye Khanna was outstanding and probably he only could have taken up this role. Cos against AJ's aura everybody would feel like pheeka pakwan. But he stood and he delivered brilliantly. The twists & turns keeps you on the edge of the seat. An important sign of a good thriller is not building suspense but fulfilling the audience with truth at the right time and Drishyam 2 nailed it to the perfection. Credit to story writer for such a brilliant story and great execution by the director too.There are hardly few sequels which were worth making and watching it and this is one of them which you would love to see it. This movie is definitely worth a dekho and that too in theatre only. Nowadays you hardly find people clapping or whistling at the end of the movie, but I witnessed it today and after a very long time for a movie. It's a top notch suspense thriller !!!PS : In the end Vijay Salgaonkar should have been a given a punch line against Gaitonde.",

Cinematography by Sudhir Chaudhary & Sandip Francis's Editing is something classic. The Film drives by thrill factor. Tight crispy screenplay by Aamil Keeyan Khan and narration is simply superb. Brilliant mind blowing delivery by underrated Akshay Khanna, blasting performance by Ajay Devgan and promising performance by Kamlesh Sawant as Gaitonde, as usual unparallel by Saurabh Shukla, Rajat Kapoor, Tabbu.Aamil & Abhisek in one place missed the originality and that's ...in front of IG an suspended Gayetondke started slapping Ajay's family which is not possible. There are cameras all over the police station & senior officers can track it. It is against the rule that male officers will physically torture of female suspects. No men's allowed to touch a female even if they are the culprit, only female officers are allowed to handle them. At the time of Ajay's confession the lawyers need to be there because he has the right to ask a lawyer.Any way a Magnificent venture by Director Abhisek Pathak and his Team with marvellous music & background scoring by Devi Sri Prasad.At a costing of 50 crores Film already collected\napprox 250 crores.The Film has lot of twist & turnaround..\nIt was fun to watch.",

            "content": "I am still not sure the intentions of the makers behind creating this sequel, and then with some clear loopholes in the storyline!!.. there are a few and then there are some weak writing and scenes.They made it so simple, with another person getting release from the jail, same after 7 years when police again started to look deeper into the investigation and very easily some police detective got hold of an evidence (in terms of some taped convo!!! Again the dumbo wife!)And I dont know why! I mean why even in the 21st century we show our wives and daughters so weak, confused and stupid!!! There are scenes which just doesnt make sense to me other than that, writers were lazy to come up with something more creative and stronger.Even after 7 years, the wife and daughter (and I can understand her issue to an extent after the killing episode) just dont seem to understand what has happened. Writers couldn't provide proper character arc for the wife. She doesnt have any depth in the character portrayal and unfortunately writers keep showing her as total dumb, even tho she looks and dresses so smart!!IThis is a story about a parent trying to save the daughter and family, but in typical bollywoodization they made it a One man hero show! I was expecting more depth, better and detailed scenes with strong and creative dialogues, but it was just a whimper, with usual bollywood masala of style over substance... The ending is underwhelming and we should just accept it because yeah it is gullible Indian audience and they are immature and cant control that the protagonist side can have ANY causalities! I Only watched for Tabu and whatever timeframe she was given on screen she did her best. Akshaye is dependable but he wasnt given much to do except to look serious and spit out some heavy dialogues....Try some more Bollywood!... OTT has surely made a difference and we know we have writers, directors, and actors that can lit up the screen with more creative scripts! Better luck next time!",

Simply remaking won't fulfil the idea of popularizing the film. The hindi version will not touch the entire national mindset. Drishyam 2 south is a masterpiece. So the art and film society should make amends in popularizing this film in malayali with appropriate subtitles in almost all language, english is a must for NE Region.Apart from these Ajay Devagan doesn't fit well in the role of Mohanlal. He is well suited in the role of a criminal or a revolutionary. In part 1 also its the same issue. The idea itself doesn't fit well the Bollywood mindset , also not in tune with its fans. Since a work is done by spending money so a 2/10. But this is not worth !",

The story of the sequel is also brilliantly written by Jeethu Joseph that is packed with many surprise moments and an applause-worthy climax. Director Abhishek Pathak's last film was Ujda Chaman (2019) and after that, he has shown impressive growth and successfully delivered a faithful remake of a great suspense thriller film.Although the first half of the film was slow-paced, especially in the initial portions but becomes engaging soon due to the performances. The screenplay by Aamil Keeyan Khan and Abhishek Pathak is gripping in the second half. The audience will be glued to their seats till the end credits. The dialogues and the cinematography were also noteworthy in the film. Rockstar Devi Sri Prasad's background score is exciting and goes well with the thrilling premise of the film.Ajay Devgn, once again, delivers an outstanding performance. He gets back into the skin of the character of Vijay Salgaonkar and does entire justice to the character. Akshaye Khanna was a good choice for the sequel and he delivers a notable performance. Shriya Saran, Ishita Dutta, and Mrunal Jadhav were fine in their roles. Tabu, Kamlesh Sawant, Rajat Kapoor, and Saurabh Shukla had given decent supporting performances.Drishyam 2 Movie Rating:\nDirection 3.5/5\nActing 3.5/5\nDialogues 3/5\nStory 4/5\nScreenplay 3.5/5.",

However, due to some urgent issues at the time of release, I was unable to! Since then, I have been patient and waited for my turn to see it on the streaming site, and today, when it was finally made available on Amazon Rent, I immediately started watching.In no way, shape, or form is the storytelling flawless. There are, in fact, quite a few flaws against which you can present arguments. Nonetheless, this succeeds in numerous ways. The performances are strong, the score matches the bill, and the script, despite its modest imperfections, gave enough moments of suspense and surprise.My only big complaint is with the film's beginning, where the build-up takes center - stage and the organic progression takes a back seat. It took a substantial amount of time to start moving, but once it did (literally, when Akshay Khanna enters the frame), there was no turning back! Everything was set in action as it was intended.",

Tabu is the consistent performer here, and her presence is not scattered unlike Asha Sharath's. Akshaye Khanna also puts up an enigmatic show as the IG, offering the right balance between clever and intimidating. The major plot points are left intact, so the climactic scenes didn't surprise me.

Infact, this is one of the best remakes seen in Bollywood after a long time.Cut to the plot, Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) is living a peaceful life with his family gradually tiding over the crisis they faced seven years ago. It is only when the newly transferred cop Tarun Ahlawat (Akshaye Khanna) comes to his town and re-opens Sam's missing case that Vijay and his family get in to trouble once again. Tarun is Meera (Tabu)'s ex-colleague and close friend and he vows to nail Vijay at any cost. But can he?!!Staring with a slow pace, the film skyrockets once Akshaye Khanna enters the frame and trust me, his introduction scene got as much ceetis and taalis as Ajay Devgn got earlier. The twist just before the interval is fantastic and the second half turns in to a practical hide and seek game which is truly fun to watch.The performances are first rate. Ajay literally shoulders the film on his own. Akshaye Khanna leaves a mighty impression as the investigating officer. Tabu shines even in a small role while Shriya Saran looks gorgeous even in a modest saree.Drishyam 2 is a thoroughly engaging fare which serves as a perfect sequel to first part. Personally, I found Mohanlal's original slightly better but this Hindi adaptation is also worth your ticket price. Book early as the shows are full.Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

You will get hooked to the story throughout watching the movie. I had a great time watching the movie. This movie started only with so much thrill and ended also in a suspense end. I really liked the message in the end of the film by AJay Devagan that even after he tries to defend his family he cannot watch eye to eye with the father of the boy their family has killed. This movie dialogue were also touching and really well written. I cannot remember that dialogue that I really liked. Very nice dialogues of the film. Story was also very nice, full of twists and turns. I had a really nice time watching this film. Really recommend you to watch this film. This is a paisa wasool film. Everything you get in this film, family story, drama, crime and murder mystery and a whole lot of suspense. I rate this movie 8 stars out of 10. I would recommend even more stars for the film. Not to forget Ajay Devgan and Shriya Sharan and Tabu being the main cast hold the story of the movie really well on their shoulders. Ishit Durra was also good. Mrunal Jadhav was cute. Siddharth Bodke one more star actor to watch out for.",

            "review_title": "Too far-fetched, yet entertaining",
            "content": "After seven long years, the story of Drishyam starts off from exactly where its first part had concluded. The family of a middle class person who has a penchant for movies is again in trouble for whatever had happened seven years ago courtesy an accidental eye-witness and some chess like clandestine moves made by the cops who have not closed the case by labelling it as unresolved. The case file of killing of a teenager is still open in the police headquarters. This middle class (and low educated) man may still be categorized in the middle class but now his class is the upper middle class. He has earned enough money to graduate from a cable operator to a theatre-owner. And he has been planning to make a movie himself, discussing his story with a well-known screenplay writer for cinematic adaptation. He has got the story published also in the form of a book (apparently) for copyright protection. What are his real intentions ? Is he still concerned for the safety of his family (from the claws of the law of the land) ?Well, to understand the things in the right perspective, we have to go in flash back, i.e., the story of the original (first) movie titled as Drishyam (scene) which had been released in Malayalam in 2013 and its various remakes in different languages were released in later years (all the versions filled the coffers of their makers like anything). Jeethu Joseph who had taken the credit of the story (calling it as his 'original') had only directed the Malayalam version. The truth of his so-called originality is that this story had been lifted by him from the novel of Keigo Higashino - 'The Devotion of Suspect X' which was first published in 2005. Anyway.The Hindi version, i.e., Drishyam (2015) was directed by (Late) Nishikant Kamat in which the protagonist's role was played by Ajay Devgan whose teenager daughter accidentally kills a spoiled teenager who was trying to blackmail her on the basis of a video of hers clandestinely shot by him. The dead boy was the son of a supercop Meera Deshmukh (Tabu) who is the Inspector General of Police of Goa (where the story is set, in Pondolem to be exact). Her businessman husband Mahesh (Rajat Kapoor) is a sensitive person but Meera is a ruthless cop as well as an aggrieved mother hell-bent upon seeking revenge from the killer. Now our hero named as Vijay Salgaonkar who is a less-educated person and fond of watching movies on small screen (as well as learning various things from them) has to dispose off the dead body in such a way and create such an alibi that himself alongwith his wife Nandini (Shriya Saran), elder daughter Anju (Ishita Dutta) who is actually the killer and younger daughter Anu (Mrunal Jadhav) remain uncaught by the scanner of the law-enforcers. And he successfully does it, checkmating the cops including the mother of the dead boy. Meera Deshmukh resigns from her job and the parents of the boy migrate to London, rendering a sigh of relief to Vijay.Since this well-made movie was hugely successful on the box office, making its sequel made sense. Now a story was required to put Vijay and his family again in trouble due to the killing that had taken place years back and showing the protagonist emerging as triumphant in the end once again (because that kind of end only is desirable for the Indian audience who cannot withstand their hero to lose to anyone including the law of the land). Since Jeethu Joseph only has claimed the credit of the story directing the original Malayalam version himself only once again, the question that propped up in my mind whether he has lifted the basic grains for the story of this sequel also from somewhere. Well, neither I have been able to figure that out nor any known film reviewer (at least till now). Hence let's give Jeethu Joseph the credit of the story which is more intriguing but less curious than its previous part because the novelty factor is missing. We don't know the plan of Vijay to safeguard his family members from the law in this reopened murder case (which as we have been told somewhere in the movie, had never been fully closed by the police), however we are always aware that something is going on underneath his various activities apparently unrelated to this 'case' and in all probability, he is going to outwit the cops this time also. In the prequel, everything done by the protagonist (leading his family members also in that) was before the audience alongwith his purpose, still the curiosity factor was bigger. In this sequel, everything done by him has a hidden purpose which is revealed much later (in the ending reels only), still the audience is not very curious. That does not mean that the narrator has failed in entertaining the viewers. The movie is entertaining, no doubt. The thing is that a lot of time has been taken for the build-up and the real tension which keeps the audience hooked appears in the post-interval session of the movie only. The protagonist is relaxed (at least he appears to be so). And so do we.The revived cat and mouse game between the cops and the hero picks up speed with the cat having many faces including a new I. G. of Police (Akshaye Khanna), the ex I. G. of Police and the mother of the killed boy (I won't term him as the victim because it was he who was victimizing the daughter of the protagonist) plus the suspended corrupt cop who has a score to settle with the hero with a few others whether in uniform or civil dress (i.e., undercover cops). The father of the dead boy is a sensitive (and sensible) person who wants to move on in life alongwith his wife and that's why he requests Vijay for the remains of the dead body of his son for proper cremation. However the mother wants to find them out on her own (with the help of the police, of course) so as to throw Vijay and his family behind the bars and in the legal trap thereafter. How Vijay saves himself and his family forms the remaining part of the story whose climax tells us that everything done by him in the narrative (prior to the climax) had the same purpose because he was always expecting the case to be reopened with a new box of troubles for them. In the same vein, it tells us that even the bit characters those had appeared in the narrative at various places were linked to his complex scheme. I found his scheme (fully revealed in the end) as amusing but too far-fetched. Popular Hindi pulp fiction writer (Late) Ved Prakash Sharma used to present such too complicated schemes formulated by the criminals in his novels. Vijay's scheme reminded me of them.New director Abhishek Pathak (as the director of the prequel Nishikant Kamat had passed away in 2020) has done his job well. However his job was not very difficult because he had to remake a Malayalam movie as it is without any kind of adaptation on the story aspect. He has changed only the milieu just like the prequel (changing the location from Kerala to Goa). However he has kept the length of this Hindi version shorter than the original which appears to be right considering the fact that now the Hindi movie audience of this era does not like too long movies. The fact that the hero and his family are able to live a posh life within a span of just a few years appears odd. Cinematographer Sudhir K. Chaudhary has captured the beauty of countryside Goa (not the happening areas) very well. Other technical aspects are also in order. Devi Sri Prasad has composed two good songs for the movie. All the same, it would have been better had the rap song which tells the essence of the story been kept in the movie and not played with the end credits rolling on the screen when the movie is over.Since the cast of the prequel has been carried over to the sequel, the actors have only replayed their parts which was not very difficult for them. Ajay Devgan is no match for Mohanlal (the great Malayalam actor who has played the protagonist in the original version) but no doubt, he has excelled in his role (just like the prequel). His eyes speak and indicate the churning going on in the interiors of his outer cool and calm personality. Tabu is effective in her low footage role also as she appears to be like a lioness waiting to prey upon the killer (or the killers) of her progeny. Akshaye Khanna presents nothing new in his cop avatar. He appears to be the same cop played by him in some earlier films.An esteemed film reviewer has rightly asserted that the story of Drishyam (including both the parts) has been liked by the audience so much because it's been woven around Indian middle class morality which advocates protecting own family at all costs and which glamorizes the underdog and vilifies the privileged. Another esteemed reviewer has also rightly asserted that the success story of Drishyam underscores this fact that we prefer what we feel right to what is right. Well, I have to agree to these views in the absolute sense. The killing which forms the basis of the Drishyam story had (inadvertently) taken place in self-defense. However the protagonist does not consider the option of coming clean before the law and get his daughter acquitted from the murder charge based on the self-defense plea. Instead he decides to play a hide and seek game with the law-enforcers. May be because the law enforcement agencies of Mera Bhaarat Mahaan, more often than not, indulge in harassing (and extorting) the underprivileged instead of ensuring justice to them.The lesson of the movie is very clear - the question is not what is in front of your eyes but what you are seeing (that's the real Drishyam or scene for you).I agree to it.\u00a9 Copyrights reserv.",

Despite a different director and the time lapse, the film perfectly gels with the first part and nowhere feels a different territory which most of the sequels feel. The first half is a bit slow with the background getting built up with the reminiscence of the first part. The second half is fully surprising with the viewers left to ponder on what went reprising repeated viewings. Perhaps it sets a franchise in family thrillers with a next sequel to be anticipated in \"Drishyam\" franchise. Overall, the tremendous performances, family theme, and the low profile it keeps turns into a masterpiece.Rating: 3 stars out of 4.",

Ajay Devgun is at his pinnacle of his acting whilst Tabu and others have justified their role. The only contest for this rating is for the director who shamelessly copies and tries to market it to other platform.

But with Akshaye Khanna's entry, the script picks up pace. He is intimidating yet subtle. With him enters Gaitonde! At some point, he says he can forget his wife's birthday, but he cannot forget the events of 2nd and 3rd October, lol; the guy despises Vijay and his family, which hasn't changed in all these years. More than anyone else, Gaitonde made me want to watch the first film again.The climax feels rewarding, and it logically places all the pieces in place, which I think has become a trademark of this franchise.\"Shabdo pe nahi, drishyon pe dhyaan do, kyuki shabdo mein jhoot chupne ki jagah dhoond hi leta hai, lekin drishya. . .

I am impressed they brought back all the old players and seamlessly jumped ahead 7 long years. I am even more blown away at how Vijay anticipated exactly how these threats would play out, down to the minutest detail. This time his manipulation of illusion extends beyond the local game to the system itself. His enemies never stood a chance, so well thought out is his every move, so well crafted the narrative defenses around his little world. There is a nice touch of closure to this sequel, with human kindness between enemies. It is hard to imagine how they can extend this amazing series to a 3rd installment.",

Let's talk about each aspect of the movie one by one.Cast:The IG: Akashay was a good choice for the role but he should have been in his uniform as it could have given more power to his character. Plus, he was supposed to be serious, not funny.The shadow police: The two actors were not fit for the roles. The actors in the Malayalam version were a much better choice and they performed a lot better.The eye witness: Again, he was unsuitable for the role. The guy in the Malyalam version was a better choice.Former IG: Tabu should have been a little more worried and upset but his was expressionless half the time. So, I was unable to connect with the mother emotionally.Songs and background music:The songs were all forgettable as they were not enjoyable at all. Unlike Drishyam 1, the background music was not thrilling or suspenseful, which reduced the impact of intense situations in the film. I found the music pretty boring.Dialogues:The original 2015 film was fantastic in terms of dialogue and dialogue delivery but this one falls flat in this department. In the first film, every dialogue was catchy, powerful and beautifully delivered.Direction: This is one of the biggest flaws of this sequel. The new director failed to make the actors express their emotions in each situation. The actors' faces were almost flat even in intense situations.The first director could have done much better if he were alive. So, I think the director was a wrong choice for this film.So, I will give 5 out of 10 points to this film. It's a nice one-time watch unlike the first movie that I have watched a dozen times without. It was a perfect movie from all angles.Go watch this sequel as it's still better than a lot of Bollywood movies released over the past 10 years.",

Nobody even cares to read the book or keep it as a reference. Nobody asks who has read the book to claim the story is picked from there.Nobody cares about who was the other body planted (since they temper with the evidence) in the police station and who would have done it and how was that David guy so sure about it that he recalled an instance of 7 years back in such a case. Isn't it alarming there's a body in the police station buried for years n nobody knows a thing about it.The daughters were young, class 12 n class 6th students, n as they mention Anju is still in school , she should ideally be having a job right now, graduated from college and the younger daughter should be in class 12th and not that young still.No cameras in an institution?

            "content": "A well made remake and film succeeds to enthrall audience for sure. Primely it's a remake however sadly a scene to scene copy and also shot / filmed at very similar locations without any single change in original script! So those who have already seen Drishyam 2 of southern industry wouldn't find any newness. But yes those who haven't seen original would find this film exceptional and enjoy all the twists and turns more jubilantly. Film also maintains the seriousness towards it's storyline and makers have not added any unwanted spices which is good.Ajay Devgan, Akshay Khanna, Tabu, Shriya Saran and entire star cast has done a fabulous job on screen. AjayD looks rock solid with his acting & AkshayK steals the show with his killing expressions and dialogues. Tabu, ShriyaS and Ishita Dutta have made their presence felt with superb performances. Specifically ShriyaS dominates the emotional scenes by bringing the right kind of expressions on face. So casting is very apt here.Coming to the storyline then film shows the whole recap of first part in title credits and the same case reopens thereafter as Tabu & her husband RajatK visits India to perform some rituals for their son's death. AkshayK takes the charge and with his brilliance and aid from an eye-witness he finds out that body buried inside police station. He catches AjayD's family and tortures them inside prison and get the confession out. Now will AjayD be able to save himself and his family or not forms the crux of the film.As I said before, the script is kept unchanged, scene sequences are identical and film progresses in very similar way. Nevertheless film wins in all other cinematic aspactilike Dialogues, BGM, Screenplay, Direction, etc. I also liked the two songs and off the beat music of DSP here. Overall film offers nothing new as compared to the original and I would like to give it 3 / 5 (\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f) to it.*What I Liked Most -* The Chess Scene (Entry Scene of Akshay Khanna)*By - Niraj Solanki..!*",

            "content": "The sequel begins where the first part ends - with the murder case of Samir Deshmukh, son of IG Meera Deshmukh (Tabu), closed as 'unresolved'. The new top cop in town (Akshaye Khanna) reopens the file much to the agony of Vijay Salgaongar (Ajay Devgn) and his family who inadvertently gets embroiled in the case. The real hero of 'Driysham 2' is the cleverly written plot (Joseph), and the twists and turns incorporated at the right times before a befitting climax, which may not be as novel or notorious as in part one, but is nevertheless equally captivating due to its ingenuity. The suspense is heightened by some good acting by the entire cast which is easily relatable. One can feel their tribulations and trauma as the Salgoankar family go through another extended and excruciating round of police investigation as well as close scrutiny by their neighbours.Repeated close-up shots of the leading characters and effective use of slow motion scenes add extra impact to an intense plot which ebbs and flows right through.In the seven-year gap since 'Driysham', Vijay Salgoankar, the 'Chauthi Fail Aam Aadmi' and a complete Family Man, has moved on from being a cable operator to a theatre owner and a potential producer of a film while Meera Deskmukh is now retired but still in the hunt to find the killers of her only son Samir.Akshaye Khanna as the new police chief enters the scene from where he left off in Sridevi-starrer Mom, all the mannerisms included. His role and that of Saurabh Shukla as a writer, is a welcome addition to a tightly knitted star cast and adds a new element of suspense. Shukla as expected blends with his character despite limited time and space. Khanna, on the other hand, is suave and sensitive as a police chief hell bent on solving a complex murder case.You will enjoy 'Driysham 2' better if you watch it without any needless distractions, like, for example, wasting time on finding faults in it.",

Then when the curtain, so to speak, was raised. It was like wait a minute. What? What? I didn't not see that coming. Then another twist and still I said, wait a minute. What? What? It was like peeling an onion with all the different layers. Till I was wondering if he went back in time to solve each problem as it came up or that Vijay is actually a genius and he too can play an entire game of Chess before even moving the first piece on the board? Unlike a actually Chess board his only had One King and the rest are pawns to be controlled and manipulated in very subtle ways, at least to me anyway. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie.",

SirajThe beautifully encrusted Crime Drishyam 2 released in Hindi, the perpetual investigating story of Jeethu Joseph about a common indomitable man to protect his family till his last breath.Undoubtedly #Ajay Devgan and Shreya gave their best performance in their career for this film, I could not keep myself from comparing it with the Malayalam Version. Mohan Lal with his minute expressions keep the audience with crossed fingers, namely, when he come out from the Court room, seeing the Shadow Police with direct eyes for their no trustworthiness, lowering his eyes when he sees SP and her husband because of his guilty feelings, moreover his financial progress from an ordinary Cable operator to a theatre owner is convincingly narrated by #Jeethu Joseph, whereas Ajay Devgan's financial progress is something abnormal.Secondly, screen play has been changed, (may be to tune with Hindi Audience) but original screenplay in Malayalam was one of the best. The character of Kalabhavan Mani is not coming in the second part, but in Hindi that character (Kamlesh Sawant) appears again, to corner Ajay Devgan with full of venom. Regarding the role of Police SP played by Tabu simply overshadowing Nadiya Moidu with her look and perseverance in taking vengeance on Ajay Devgan, specifically her dialogues with the Poojari on her son's yearly death day.Finally, #AkshyeKhanna as IG gave a spectacular effect on the screen, but in Malayalam version Introduction of Murali Gopi as IG and the two Mohan Lal neighbours as Shadow Police pulls up the heart beat of the Audience for its unexpected twist, which is missing in Hindi.Finally, those who have not seen #Malayalam Drishyam 2, the #Hindi version definitely make you thrill and no doubt, it is going to be a Blockbuster in Hindi.Watched Drishyam 2 Hindi at Jeddah Al Andalus Mall, Empire Cinema.",

The pay off is immense and makes you admire the writing.Personally for me i thought the setup was too long. There are lots of silence, pauses and slow shots which serves to lengthen the movie. But, the payoff at the end made it worth it.If you haven't watched the first one yet, take sometime out this weekend, watch the first one and then go to the theatre to watch this fine piece of movie.",

Throughout the runtime of the movie, every scene has its own meaning.The film takes a bit of time to set you up with the world and story we left off 7 years ago and it's worth it.What I liked the most in this movie is every single character from the first and second installments has something to do with the storyline.And when each character plays an important role in the movie it makes the movie so engaging.If you want to enjoy the ending of the movie, Don't miss the beginning.Direction: We miss the touch of Nishikant Kamat here but Abhishek Pathak has done a phenomenal job in direction. Suspense thriller movies mostly depend upon screenplay and direction and Abhishek Pathak has given justice to his work.Writing: Written by Aamil Keeyan Khan and Abhishek Pathak. Script and screenplay are the kings of this Franchise. Perfect writing.Cinematography: The cinematography is good. Cinematographer Sudhir K. Chaudhary has done good camera work. The framing, Composition, and color palette are so beautiful. It sets the tone of the movie from the first frame.Music and sound design: Songs are not so catchy but fine. The background score is so awesome. The background score plays perfectly in each scene. Especially when the time the Salgaonkar family interacts with the police.Thank You.",

Ishita Dutta shines as Anju once again in her scenes. Saurabh Shukla adds loads of spice and flavour to Drishyam 2.There's no need for fancy words to describe Tabu's supremacy.

Ajay Devgn and Akshaye Khanna are spot on with their performances. Tabu has little impact while Shriya Saran, Rajat Kapoor, Ishita Dutta and Saurabh Shukla were okay. The reintroduction of Gaitonde was useless regarding that he has little impact to the story. Certain scenes have been changed to make the story more original. The introduction scene of the IG was far better than the malayalam version. Though the court scene was ruined. The interrogation scene feels exaggerated. Certain scene also felt quite rushed.

The first hour of the film was solely focused on family drama with no mystery, investigation or action, which made it extremely boring. The only redeeming factor was the arrival of Akshay Khanna, who reopens the case and reignites the mystery element. The last 30 minutes were the most captivating part of the movie and portrayed real cruelty. The climax of the film was also well executed.In terms of direction, the film was shot in a very conventional way, similar to Mohanlal's Drishyam. I believe the director could have done a better job in terms of scene composition and shot selection. The movie was not devoid of good moments, but the majority of the scenes were not handled well. Despite this, the acting of the lead actors, Ajay Devgn, Tabu, and Akshay Khanna was impressive and they all fit their respective characters well. The background score was not great, but that was not the focus of the film.In my opinion, Bollywood needs to stop making remakes as people are getting tired of it. People are already boycotting these remakes and the industry needs to come up with fresh ideas, otherwise, Bollywood might become limited to web series only. Overall, I would rate this film 2 out of 10. While it had its shortcomings, it was still an average sequel.",

Unlike the first Drishyam, there wasn't much time to absorb and enjoy whatever was happening in Drishyam 2. I wish they paced it down (the ending) and detailed it a bit more so that the audience wouldn't be left trying to grasp everything everywhere all at once.

They could have stripped the story of all the unnecessary frills and delivered the movie in two acts: one where the body is discovered, and two, where Vijay escapes yet again.Honestly, we were all expecting that the body would somehow be discovered, all we were waiting for is to see how Vijay would escape yet again. They could have focused on that part more. Instead, the escape is restricted to the final quarter of the film.The final quibble I have with the movie is the casting of Akshaye Khanna in his role. The movie was telling us that the new IG was supposed to be more dangerous, cunning, and intelligent than the previous one, but the only thing he does in the movie to prove this is have a weird conversation with Vijay's wife. Think about it, what else does he do in the movie other than giving funny stares and playing chess with himself? If this dark, mysterious, and dangerous appearance was what the movie was going for, Akshaye Khanna wasn't the actor for this role.I liked the twists in the story, but felt that it could have been made simpler. At times, there were stories within stories, which was maybe unnecessary. I am a fan of murder mysteries, and also a fan of the cheesy 'last-person-you-think-has-done-it.' But I still left the movie feeling that there was something extra, like a teaspoon of masala in an otherwise perfect dish.",

Like everything happened to him on its own. We could've seen him creating much more difficult situation to the protagonist i.e., Ajay Devgn. The story was left one sided.2. Gaitonde deserved a serious punishment by the Protagonist. As the movie shows that the protagonist is who is so driven for his family's protection and safety from the very first beginning that he can literally cross any limits no matter what, didn't do anything even after eye-witnessing her family getting beaten and especially her daughter almost getting crushed under Gaitonde's boots. Gaitonde did the same thing with the protagonist's younger daughter in the first part but it was in his absence.

The song \"kya re zindagi\" was missed offcourse, it's counterpart in Drishyam 2 was not as effective so i instead played kya re zindgi when this song was going to relive gulzar's magic. There are two kinds of thrillers one is like cat and mice race so both parties are equally having their moments and another is like \" sau sunar ki ek lohar ki\" where protagonist is victim throughout the plot only to have last laugh as winner this movie is second kind , but no where u feel bored of family getting constantly oppressed, the major reason was akshaye Khanna's superb witty acting skills and ofcourse Tabu family's too.I had watched drishyam Hindi and loved it. Since I read about the talks of having second part in malyalam version i was very excited but I wanted to watch Hindi version only , the only reason is attachment that you feel with the characters and actors playing it ( of course malyalam version must be great). And i m not the theatre guy, i don't like watching such intense movies with public around whistling and disturbing , so i kept my patience till today for almost 9 years to watch it on Ott and tell you what, it was worth the wait.

Ajay brings his own signature swag along for the ride, but it is difficult to save this sinking ship and by the time Akshaye Khanna arrives, it really is too late.

Ajay Devgn as Vijay Salgaonkar delivers blast of a performance , Kamlesh Savant as Gaitonde is another highlight in the film . Tabu has got very less screen space in this instalment .

            "content": "Alfred Hitchcock once said\n\n\"there is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.\"\n\nwalking into the theatre, it is natural for you to think, is there really the need of a sequel? is it just gonna be another cash grab or there really is more story to tell which can match the complex narrative and high stakes of the first film which was so perfect in every way? believe me, in the climax, you'll literally start clapping to the film's genius.\n\nthe film starts off with the anticipation that Vijay and his family from the first film might, they just might get caught for their crime they committed 7 years ago and managed to get away with it by fooling the entire police department just on the basis of visual deception.\n\nthe film starts off slow prioritizing the world-building and characters over the plot, but that's just the beginning, because the payoff it gives at the end (trust me, it's even more bonkers now) is just phenomenal. having written a script myself (which took me 3 weeks by the way), I can only imagine of getting such wild and risky ideas to put in the climax. cheers to the original writer Jeethu Jospeh for coming up with such unique concepts and connecting them to cinema.\n\najay devgn once again beautifully portrays the protagonist (still scecptical on this one) Vijay Salgaonkar who appears stoic and calm on the outside but is planning everything to keep the secret \"buried\" on the inside. tabu as this ex-cop turned grieving mother out for revenge and closure is just a perfect follow-up to the original film. kamlesh savant returns in his role as Gaitonde and does not disappoint, he still oozes the same anger he had 7 years ago on Vijay for ruining his career because he was the only one who knew the truth behind it all but lacked the evidence to prove it. but, out of all the returning cast members, it was Akshaye Khanna, the new addition to this universe, that stole the show. just his presence is enough to make the screen shine and his dialogue delivery is enough to give you the chills.\n\nthe soundtrack once again, fucks hard. absolutely thrilling and apt for the scenes. athough, it isn't Vishal Bhardwaj who has composed it, Anil Johnson does manage to keep up with him and provide some good scores.\n\none thing I would like to point out is that the film also delves deeper into Vijay's mindset as a person. it perfectly depicts how Vijay and his family with him will have to be in fear their entire lives just to keep the crime they committed a secret. even though, they are free, freedom isn't with them. there is a beautiful line at the end of the film which goes like, \"even if Vijay manages to escape the cops with his wits forever, he will never be able to match eyes with the parents of Sameer Deshmukh (the boy who was murdered in the first film)\" indicating how ashamed he is and his life itself is his punishment.\n\na perfect sequel, that's it. Vijay Salgaonkar is indeed, the smartest man alive.\n\nP.S.: this film does a few things different than the original Mohanlal film in order to streamline the runtime and it does manage to do so successfully, but deep down, I feel that it was Georgekutty's (Mohanlal) journey that comes a step above (you'll understand it if you watch the original Malayalam film) and shines just a little brighter than this.",

Once again the brilliant Vijay finds himself battling with the ghosts of past sins, except this time the grim reaper is the new, determined Inspector General Tarun, played well by Khanna. I am impressed they brought back all the old players and seamlessly jumped ahead 7 long years. I am even more blown away at how Vijay anticipated exactly how these threats would play out, down to the minutest detail. This time his manipulation of illusion extends beyond the local game to the system itself. His enemies never stood a chance, so well thought out is his every move, so well crafted the narrative defenses around his little world. There is a nice touch of closure to this sequel, with human kindness between enemies. It is hard to imagine how they can extend this amazing series to a 3rd installment.",

This movie moves around Vijay(Ajay Devgn) and his family which met with an unfortunate incident 7 years ago on 2nd october 2014, when his daughter Anju(Ishitta Dutta) accidentally kills Sameer son of IG Meera Deshmukh(Tabu) . To protect her , vijay burries the body in garden , which at end of the first movie we understand that the body was burried inside the police station ,and this twist made Drishyam one of the best suspense thrillers of the time .Coming to the secound movie where vijay and his family are having good time when the new IG Arun(Akshay khanna) enters the movie and reopens the case for his friend Meera as they both were batchmates during there training. Unfortunately somebody sees vijay buring the body and opens that news to the police and police find the body and start the investigation again on vijay and take him and his family into the custody , Gaitaonde tortures his wife and daughters in front of vijay making him to confess everything .\nI could have written about the ending as well ,as i have already given so many spoilers but i really suggest you to take some time out and watch the movie available on prime video .The stars given to this movie are all based on the twists in the end . Overall movie is bit slow yet intresting .\nThanks \nSidhibaat NoBakwaas",

Afterwards, he attempts to apologize to his wife but ends up getting arrested. On the other hand Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay) who was the owner of Mirage Cables has established a cinema and wants to continue his passion for making films. He's an aspiring producer now. His family is constantly living in tension about what will happen to them if the truth comes out. His elder daughter, Anju played by Ishita Dutta who's suffering from trauma after Sam's murder. His younger daughter, Anu played by Mrunal Jadhav is now a big girl and his wife, Nandini played by Shriya Saran is always living in tension. They have new neighbors Jenny and Shiv, a couple living next door. Meanwhile the police got a clue and reopened the case. Tarun Ahlawat is the new IG of the police played by Akshaye Khanna who's now investigating the case. The events formed the rest of the plot. Will Vijay Salgaonkar be able to save his family this time Or is it all over for him? Watch the film to know more. Performances of all the actors were awesome. Although my favourite performances were of Akshaye Khanna and of course Ajay Devgn. Tabu's role was limited but important. Others were brilliant. The STORY was the winner. GREAT WRITING.
