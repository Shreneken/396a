            "content": "No wonder they say that man's best friend is a dog. There has been many movies made about self discovery, finding oneself and this is one of the best in that list. Here our Protagonist Dharma (Rakshit Shetty) is the kinda guy who'd be hated by kids and families in the neighbourhood. But he is also the kinda guy who values his solitude with anxiety simmering below the surface. His seemingly normal life of is suddenly unsettled, the constant ringing of his door bells, presence of people, all for the uninvited guest, our snow loving Charlie. It's only when he reintegrates with his surrounding which leads to a beautiful, affectionate, touching film, a journey that touches on topics of life, pet adoption, overcoming anxiety, and most importantly love. Firstly, many will be familiar with the key concept of the film and it be no longer surprising but trust me you will be proven wrong.From choo choo to naming Charlie after the great Chaplin, there are a lot of such touching moments in the film and i'm sure it will be very hard to hold back tears while watching. At the same time, the picture is a wonderful sketch of the soul of an ordinary Dharma and Charlie's last wish as they both find love, including a new addition to the family.To conclude \"777 Charlie\" is good movie with very little flaws, also it is cleverly constructed love story, where the emotions are truly at heart and it perfectly sums up \"The tale of Dharmaraj in Kaliyug.\" I went to the film and knew that I would enjoy it and with a brilliant cast and a cute dog, which is impossible not to love. I strongly recommend to stop looking for similarities with other movies that shares the same theme and enjoy this wholesome journey.",

After delivering critically acclaimed films like Ulidavaru Kandanthe, Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu, Kirik Party, and Avane Srimannarayana, Rakshit Shetty is back with another outstanding film.777 Charlie is a treat for dog lovers and those who are not connected to pets will definitely start liking them after watching this film. The makers have successfully delivered an endearing and wonderful film. The film has stood up to all the expectations of the audience. The writing of the film is flawless, the emotional roller coaster ride gives you the perfect blend of emotions and drama.Rakshit Shetty has again given an impressive performance and he never disappoints his fans. His bonding with Charlie is a delight to watch. The female labrador Charlie's acts and her eyes will surely melt your heart. The cameos by Danish Sait and Bobby Simha will be loved by the viewers. Raj B. Shetty, Sangeetha Sringeri, and other supporting actors were fine in their roles.This is indeed A Tale of Dharmaraj in Kaliyug, which has been inspired by Dharmaraya's character of the Mahabharata where he reaches heaven alone and a dog follows him and he ensures the dog will go to heaven. The score and soundtrack of the film composed by Nobin Paul are refreshing. The direction, cinematography, editing, and screenplay, everything was perfect in the film.The movies like 777 Charlie come so rarely in our Indian film industry. It is undoubtedly a worth-watching tale of human-dog relationships.Movie Rating:\nDirection 4/5\nActing 4/5\nDialogues 3.5/5\nStory 4.5/5\nScreenplay 4/5.",

            "content": "The Man-Animal relationship is something an important topic or subject for filmmakers because it is easy to build up so many emotional elements into it. Just remember the movies like Hatchi: A Dog's tale, A dog's purpose, etc we can find that kind of technique which makes the audience swirl into the depth of emotion even though the situation of pouring tears. I also belong to that category and shed tears while I finished Hatchi. 777 Charlie is similar to it, which leaves us from the theatre with wet eyes. Simply, the story of the movie relies on the relationship between Dharma (the protagonist) and Charlie (the other protagonist) with some top-notching emotional add-ups. How 'Keaton turned Charlie' came into the life of Dharma, who leads an untidy, lonely life, and how the influence of Charlie reshaped and revolve around his life, etc, are the main things that the movie discusses. Hats off to the wonderful performance of Charlie. He is the 'man (animal)' who stole everyone's heart. Along with Charlie, Rakshit Shetty also did his part brilliantly. Kiranraj, the director of the movie shaped everything from his own personal experience (he said so in an interview) and we can see the wholeness of the director in the film. He indirectly reflects his love for the legendary filmmaker Charlie Chaplin through he assigned that name to the protagonist. And also there is a slight director brilliance too in the movie where he named Keaton first to Charlie reflecting his love towards another filmmaker Buster Keaton. Directly or indirectly he just reveals his passion and admiration for the legends, both are comedians in the public domain but more than that when compared to their contribution to the film field. And I also noticed something in the film which looks comical in its aspect and that is the quote written on the waste bin near Dharma's house, the quote states that 'One man's trash is another man's treasure' and that quote remembers me another one that I heard on a film which also hit the theatres recently and that is 'One man's terrorism is another man's revolution. It was from Lokesh Kanagaraj's movie Vikram. Anyway, that remark was only for my satisfaction. Come back to the movie 777 Charlie, it is a beautifully executed saga of a Man and his pet.",

            "content": "777 Charlie is packed with all tropes of a light-hearted dog movie, including a tear-jerker climax. The first half is certainly more engaging as we wonder how an emotionless loner taps into his inner self and connects with a stray Labrador pup (the adorable Charlie), making him a more expressive-but-composed human being. These bits are also laced with situational humor and a sparkling Raj B Shetty extended cameo - a complete 180 from his vicious turn in Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana. While the bond between Charlie and Dharma is charming and full of warmth, it also moves into predictable territory in the second half. The dog competition parts did not feel essential to the plot whatsoever, and watered down the emotional core to some extent.The foreseeable finale is also stretched beyond all measure, especially since you've been readily waiting with a box of tissues for a good while. The writing in 777 Charlie also comes from a hardcore pet lover's perspective, and therefore, while the emotions hit sufficiently hard, there's only so many times you can go aww whenever Charlie spontaneously hugs Dharma. I did relish the texture attributed to Dharma (it's shown that he lost his family while he was still a child) and therefore, the journey he takes in the second half with Charlie makes sense as he never got to do something like that (with a loved one) before.",

It's an emotion which dives in the pool of your heart the splashes of which you can definitely feel in your eyes.I don't know exactly that for how long I cried but i can definitely say that i cried a lot, even after watching the movie I wasn't been able to talk to somebody for atleast 2 hours.. You can just imagine the impact of the emotions which the creators tried to convey through this movie..\nKudos to Rakshit Shetty and the whole team FOR SHOWING US THAT INDIA CAN ALSO MAKE MARVEL and even with such a low budget and last but not the least Charlie \ud83d\ude18 , what she did was amazing and i could easily say that even a hugely talented actor could not beat CHARLIE because what she showed us is EMOTIONS which is surely lacking in many of the so called Mass Entertainer movies which we regularly see nowadays\nLove \u2764 for CHARLIE \ud83d\ude18",

If i have to give little bit insight it is about a relationship between a dog and dog owner & how they create a strong bond overtime despite having different mindset & How it changes there perspective about the life they were living.

I don't think anything like this has ever been created in mainstream Indian Cinema.Most of the movie follows the protagonist and their journey with their dog. The journey takes them through highs and lows; some very realistic situations but also some crazy coincidences that had no place in the story. Some things were done purely for fan-service, and I don't respect that. 80% of the movie is an excellent, top-notch portrayal of human-dog bonding. But the remaining 20% is cringy, mood-spoiling, insensible mess.Despite that, this is an excellent movie and definitely a must-watch.",

            "content": "Kannada cinema might be known across India due to the Yash & Prashant Neel-led KGF franchise but in terms of pure content-driven high-concept film-making, the trio of Rakshit Shetty, Raj B Shetty, and Rishab Shetty are the true forces to be reckoned with. And now, after having already captured our imaginations with \"Kirik Party (2016)\" and \"Avane Srimannarayana (2019)\", in \"777 Charlie\", an adventure drama about the love between a man and his furry best friend, Rakshit Shetty has rendered another masterpiece in emotive, heartfelt filmmaking.The movie tells us the story of Dharma (Rakshit Shetty), a compulsive loner and misanthrope who seems to be spiraling down a path of self-destruction. Into his life comes Charlie the loveable runaway labrador dog and how their initially fractious relationship turns into an endearing lifelong bond forms the rest of the story. Rakshit Shetty is absolutely terrific as the morose, deeply damaged Dharma and steals your heart in the second half, especially in the emotionally charged scenes with his subtle performance.It is hard to imagine anybody not falling for the cuteness of Charlie the dog at first sight. The loveable white labrador is the heart and soul of the film and the trainers deserve all the praise in the world for how they make sure she immaculately performed in line with the narrative. Nobin Paul's music is uplifting and emotional in equal measure, supercharging an already gut-wrenching story. How man's best friend can take over one's whole world to fill the emptiness in our hearts is portrayed with conviction and a lot of soul by the makers.Director Kiranraj K and writers Raj B Shetty and Abhijit Mahesh are careful to avoid all the run-of-the-mill tropes usually associated with movies about pet love, going down radically different routes whenever you feel like the movie is becoming predictable. It is inexplicable how actor-writer-director Raj B Shetty is able to shift gears from the gory and violent \"Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana (2021)\" to writing this soulful adventure drama and also play a quirky, delightfully comic character in the same.After the soul-stirring \"Thangam\" short in \"Paava Kadhaigal\" (2020) and the Oscar-winning \"CODA (2021)\", \"777 Charlie\" is the only movie that had me reaching for the tissues in recent memory, such is the beautiful relationship between Dharma and Charlie. This is one movie to be experienced and not analyzed so I will stop myself here. Go watch it in theatres and I promise there won't be a dry eye in the hall. Highly, highly recommended!",

            "content": "A well balanced movie in terms of once emotions. It's all hanky-panky and laughter till a point and then though it's got tragic times way ahead the story still has its moments of smiles. I loved the authenticity given to languages - when Dharma meets a Tamilian, the Tamilian speaks in Tamil itself with 'koncham' Kannada. It keeps the character true towards reality.As this film is really wonderful I'll be strict on it's shortcomings or the cons as they say. The biggest irritating thing in this film is Raj Shetty. His overacting, over the top Mangalorean dialect (Tuluvas in daily life don't talk like that, definitely not in cities) & pronunciations, body language and facial expressions are all the same in every film. He has never changed his character since OMK. His every scene in this film has been very irritating. He is also not in his character. His dialect changes when it's a serious scene later on. Sangeetha Sringeri's acting is slightly bland or should I say I don't know if she is being sarcastic every time she talks. Rakshith is quite OK though there are more glimpses of his characters from the past in terms of body language, yet he is digestible. The neighbours' characteristics are very conveniently written for the story's progress or for Dharma's character. They don't have any contribution to the major part of the film. The dog is simply brilliant.The film doesn't let us know the route Dharma takes to reach wherever he wants to nor do we know where his destination is. It would have been great to know his map, his route, his destination without which the journey is all over the place.There is a word used in one scene - 'andha' meaning blind. I have no clue why the hindi word was used while the characters were within Karnataka in that scene. It doesn't come in any characteristic of any character. They could have simply used the word 'kuruda'. It's a silly thing but it made me wide eyed for a moment.For all these reasons I removed one star but this is a true pan India film and it deserves to be shared with everyone. I have no dogs and never have I ever had one but films with dogs' journeys are simply wonderful! Watch this film at all cost.",

A very few have managed to crack the right proportion and it won't be an exaggeration to say that we might have found another addition to the list. 777 Charlie is a film about the bonds we form unknowingly and how they shape our lives.Director Kiranraj K succeeded in narrating a feel-good emotional story between a dog and a human. But, Kiranraj could have taken some more care in writing a crisp screenplay. The cinematography is good, especially in the climax. Nobin Paul makes many scenes elevate with his wonderful background score. Editing in the second half could have been better.The story is simple and even predictable sometimes, but Charlie makes it beautiful with its lovely performance, especially in emotional scenes. Besides, Rakshit Shetty justifies his role. His transformation from an arrogant person to an emotional one is shown well in the movie. The emotional scenes between Charlie and Rakshit Shetty worked out very well and everyone will connect to those scenes for sure. Sangeetha Sringeri's character could have been better. A few scenes in the latter half are illogical but passable.777 Charlie' is a treat for fans of both Rakshit Shetty and films that convey essential messages, such as pet adoption in this case. There is a lot of heart and soul in the movie.",

A little bit more if the story had details and subplots it'd have been perfect. But to each his own!Narration, Screenplay & Direction: 4/5 - Felt slow at times but most of the time it was good. Some scenes were unnecessary to the story (ex: the dog show scene)Production Values: 5/5 - Great! Considering the budget and need, the VFX was very good and promising.Others: 5/5 - No other issues.Total: 18/20 = 9/10Final Verdict: This movie is a light-hearted movie about dog-human relationships. If you're a dog lover, or even if you're not one, you might like this film.(I just hope there's a sequel, or maybe the next project of the director somehow connected to this film, it'll be nostalgic!)When I saw many pan-Indian films like KGF, RRR, etc., This one is good for a change.If you're looking for simple themed movies then this is one of the best.

Who doesn't love seeing a dog smile and cry when he gets sad, Charlie demonstrates all these emotions beautifully. They made sure Charlie was not just a dog on the set but made her perform as well. Lot of effort must have gone into training her for this film.Rakshit Shetty does a good job in emotional scenes. The film is about his reliving of life hence it is his journey as well but what is most beautiful is the dog human relation brought out so well.Humor is there and it works perfectly.Songs are really good but there are just too many of them (one negative). Literally a song in the background in every 5 10 mins. I love the song that goes \"Bhasha pyaar ki\" which plays in the dog show sequence in the 2nd half which made me quite emotional but the place where everyone cried was the climax and how Charlie gives a thank you gesture before dying , that scene till now whenever I imagine i get tears in my eyes, weak hearted ones will already cry profusely.Another negative point would be the editing of this film. 2hrs 45 mins is too long for a film like this . In 2nd half, many scenes i felt could have been shortened. 2hrs 25 mins was enough for this film.Overall, if you have voot select and missed it in theatres, give it a watch you will fall in love with the film.

I regret for myself that i missed this masterpiece in theatres.

After this incident he becomes very much lonely. He is a welder in a factory. Everyone there maintains a distance from him in his worklace and society. His daily life is very disorganized. In the starting minutes director has shown his lifestyle with very minute details.Oneday a labrador puppy comes to his house somehow. But he doesn't like the puppy. So, he doesn't allow the puppy to stay here. But incidentally he keeps the puppy in his house. Charlie brings a change in Dharma's life and mentality. These parts has been shown with great care.Dharma gradully comes to know that charlie is suffering from cancer and has very limited time. So Dharma decides to fulfil charlie's wish to show her snow. How Dharma fulfills his decision that is the main plot in 2nd half.This film has everything whatever a viewer wants. This film has fun, comedy, emotiion, affection.Rakshit Shetty is awesome in the character of Dharma. He plays his character very realistically.Watching charlie is also a gift from the makers. Somehow they have managed to gift the viewers something exceptional.Sangita Sringeri as Devika ialsodelivers strong performance. She is damn beautiful.The little girl, Sharvari as Adrika is also an important character of the film.Good videography is seen in the film. Screenplay is also very powerful to convey the message through the film.Thank you team '777 Charlie'",

We have scenes varied versions of romantic movies and here is a special one where in one partner can not speak the way human speaks but can very well speak the language of love because Love is an universal language does not any special tool to express it except for yourself. Love has been so effectively shown that any routine romantic movie may not be able to showcase it even with spoken words.777 Charlie, it is a great cinematic experience in its own pace (slow at times) showing different emotional settings of a human being through few specific scenes. Charlie who is a new comer has delivered a performance which is unparalleled, Rakshit Shetty is great as always, Background Score has absolutely matching every scene filled with emotions along with absolutely simple yet effective cinematography. Other characters who are part of the movie had very limited role to play however everyone has lived upto the expectation. Overall a good movie filled with loads of emotions and leaves many questions open in one's mind to think for the self about love, hope and respect.Charlie Rocks.Love , Respect, Empathy, Humility are beyond spoken languages because of its universality and here is a masterpiece taking you to the world of Charlie in special way.",

Heroine is totally unnecessary there and it spoiled the bond between the dog and hero and changed into a lovestory.

            "content": "First thought after watching the 777 Charlie trailer was I wanted to watch this film in theatre at least for Journey episode and to see the love bond between Dharma & Charlie. After watching This film in Theatre I need to share some of my thoughts about this Emotional ride.Basic main plot is that when Charlie enters Life of a person named Dharma who was an introvert apathetic, how it changes his life and makes him to realize how Beautiful life is .We as normal audience can see how he one himself changes by his Charlie.Even Though I myself not a pet lover, I was able to feel the Diff emotions of Dharma throughout the film.A character Rakshith shetty played as apathetic ,antisocial and more of like Introvert due to his past. He convince us in every Scene with his Great performance.Even though i didn't liked the way Director chosen his past scenes to show us about is darkness in his life. Other than that Everything in the first half was clean and fresh. I personally connected to his early stage of the film. Major first half was all about dharma's resistance towards external world and how he gets bond with charlie and why?. The reason why he transforms from lonely person to loveable from Charie and that small kid was superb. Raj B. Shetty as Dr. Ashwin Kumar was hilarious , he makes us smile whenever he comes to the screen. Sangeetha Sringeri as Devika was good in her role. The film starts to make us emotional towards the end of it's First half. Definitely these two ppl steals our heart in the first half One is Bhargavi Narayan Mam & child actor Sharvari as Adrika with their innocence. Adrika character was so cute she brings cuteness to the screen with her smile & voice. First half ends with positive note.Second half is about Dharma's journey, his struggles to achieve for what Charlie wish for.This half makes us to enjoy the journey with them and later the stage makes to fall some drop of tears from our eyes that too especially with two-three scenes, how much one try not to cry still without our knowledge we would be more emotional. Personally didn't feel any lag in this half. Some felt Bhamsi character & Dog show was not required because those were nothing to do with the film' core plot. I felt both those were actually needed bcz (when one trying to show Dharma-Charlie's journey , there will be highs and lows in their journey. At some point they will take some inspirations from characters which they encounter in their journey & at some point they teach us how Deep their Bond is) Some Scenes are not always there to Steps to achieve Their Final Destination rather it's about makes us to know their character better & to Emote us at another level. At the ending of the film by Dharma's Struggles , for sacrificing everything(literally everything at one stage his time, money at one point he ready to sacrifice himself) to achieve what he decided at the first place. Especially in climax the way he Brings the emotion to the scene made me surrender for acting. For me it was best the performance from him till date. This film will be remembered for so long in his film career. And what left me was about Bhargavi narayan Mam's role didn't got proper closure. There is more to tell about this Emotional journey which just can't put those feelings completely into words. One thing is sure is, this is Must watch film.With all my heart i want to Thank Director Kiranraj, for giving almost 3-4years for this to bring such a Beautiful Story to us, Rakshith shetty for giving such a performance & to back this up. Nobin Paul for giving us wonderful playlist(O'Ga, Sahapati and Journey songs were my favorite. Welcome to The fire took the scene to another level). And Cinematography by Aravind Kashyap gave colors to each scenes. Similarly the way Charlie says thank you to Dharma I would say Thankyou \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Charlie Team for Bringing to us. Some films need to win not just with Box-office numbers, but by reaching out to maximum audience and need to get appreciated for it's Experience which it gave to us in Theatre. Really glad that it getting love from other state's Audience. Always not that just Mass films should go into Pan India , this type of films with great content should go and should succeed. Will be waiting to see such diverse stories to come up in our KFI.",

That should sum it up... It's what you need in life, every emotion is in there. Proud it's an Indian film, proud it's from kannada industry.",

Just when I thought creativity has reached its peak, the movie comes as a pleasant surprise and gives a breath of fresh air.Hats off to the director for creating a screenplay which doesn't get boring even for a second and you don't realise when 2 hours and 40 minutes pass by.I wish I knew about this gem of a movie earlier and could experience it in a cinema hall.Also it comes with its own set of life lessons which are easter eggs like the world is a selfish place and only uses you for self interest, true love comes from family only, one needs money to survive no matter what, etc\nIt has given attention to some fine details like gradual growth of hair in the second half (which you will know why it should be). Just shows the commitment of production team towards this project.Congratulations to the entire team for this masterpiece. Don't want to give any spoilers but this movie is an emotional rollercoaster and will surely make you humane by the end. If this doesn't deserve Oscar award, I don't know what does.P. S.- Rakshit Shetty's acting was phenomenal, and so was Charlie's. You two made the movie soulful.",

Movies are not like student of the year(franchise) and Dil de chuke sanam where 2 boys are running after 1 girl and there is a race that who will win the girl. Real is much more than these type of things. Real movies are actually such type of movies where the boy is not running after a girl but then also there is emotion,drama,suspense everything. Atleast people can get emotionally attached to the movie they can relate themselves to such movies. Not like a fictional movie with fictional plot, character everything,not an ounce of reality.",

            "content": "Screenplay:\nThe screenplay was nothing new. Movie is LENGTHY quite a bit. Run time of 2hrs and 15 minutes would have been ideal. 1st half was nice and engaging. 2nd half had lot of disconnects.. continuity missing BIG TIME. 2nd half somewhat appeared to me like watching tv serial that shows dog emotions. Rating on screenplay - 6.5/10Script writing:\nIn spite of good amount of negatives, director needs APPLAUSE for trying a script that gives importance to pets especially a DOG. Could have been better written (particularly in the 2nd half). Still I give 7/10 for the script considering how difficult it is write a script about pets.On the cast and crew:\nThe DOG - Charlie was very well trained such that her emotions were nicely captured.Rakshit Shetty needs improvement in acting especially when it comes to CRYING or emoting. But it is better than YASH by a LONG MILESangeetha Sringeri's character did not add any value. Her presence in the 1st half was okay. --> Rating on cast & crew: 6.5/10Main scene (The Tournament One):\nIn my opinion, this scene is totally messed up. The director tried to compensate the same by adding emotions but did not work out that well. Could have been better.The movie is 1 time watchable. Whatever pros and cons, RAKSHIT SHETTY needs to be appreciated for coming out with different scripts each time irrespective of how the film performs at the box office. According to me, an actor should try to break the NORMAL TEMPLATE which only RAKSHIT in the Kannada Industry is trying. BIG THUMPS UP for him \ud83d\udc4dOverall rating for the movie 6.5 / 10.",

The story may seem simple and predictable but the way it is executed is amazing. Not only the story speaks about the loneliness of introvert people but also showers light on topics light illegal animal cross breeding and brutality.The acting performances of the cast are amazing and believable. The dog stand outs in the film. Not only the dog \"Charlie\" shows perfect emotions but also makes you believe that she is can perfectly understand the emotions.Finally, I would say this is a must watch film. One of the most amazing film i have ever seen and i am very proud that a film of such calibre is being made in India.",

This movie deserves to get OSCAR.Guys do share it with others and along with it dont let its imdb rating fall below 9.",

It shows the cruel reality of animal abuse and the deep bond that runs between a human and their pet. The way Dharma and Charlie bonds together does happen in real life! It isn't overdone at all. Real pets do react to their favorite human's grief and joy in a similar way. Of course, it must've taken a lot of training to make sure the little Charlie acted comfortably without stress towards Rakshit's display of grief and frustration.A dog in a person's life is so close to their heart. It's because an animal's heart is pure and they bond unconditionally. It makes it heart-wrenching to let them go when they need to. I was terrified and felt upset when they showed and told us about the concept of inbreeding.Please don't buy pets from dealers! Go to a shelter and adopt them. \ud83d\ude4f",

It truly brought tears to my eyes and served as a powerful reminder that whether you adopted the dogs or not, they are still family. God forbid something should happen to them, the amount of space they leave can never be filled and the very silence without their presence is intolerable, and after watching the movie, I felt it for the second time.Adopting and providing food and care for stray animals are valuable lessons that the film imparts. Our first responsibility as humans is to take care of every animal in our vicinity since they are members of our family, they watch over our streets and stay loyal to us, and if we don't care for them who else will.",
