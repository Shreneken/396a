Two of my pet plot peeves are stupidity (the characters do something stupid to move the plot forward) and contrivance (circumstances beyond credibility to move the plot forward). So masterful in so many ways, it is a shame that this plot seems written by a drunk amateur shouting out random ideas (\"hey, and then this could happen!...\").The best bit was Stanley Tucci's and Atkin Estimond's neo-Sherlock/Watson rendition. Great character concept, actor pairing, and portrayal. The only downside (again) was the fairly contrived scenarios they were challenged to solve. But I could watch them banter all day.I would reboot the series around Tucci and Estimond and hire a professional writer to focus on plot structure and you would have winner to rival \"Sherlock\" and \"Elementary\".",

Tucci in particular is very entertaining as half Hannibal Lecter and Sherlock Holmes rolled into one. Whilst tenant as an honourable vicar trying to protect one of his flock and his son just ends up making things worse for himself.I can understand why people don't get this, but at the end of the day it's just a piece of fictional drama and don't take it too seriously and what you get is a thoroughly entertaining hour of television.",

First of all Dolly Wells character is so obnoxious, so smug, supercilious, and vile, that it makes this (terrible show) almost unwatchable.David Tennant is wasted, and his character's decisions are out of context with how any human would behave, ever. This show is based on a feeble, poorly written and utterly absurd concept.Stanley Tucci, another great actor, fairs better but he's basically playing a \"Sherlock\" type of character, and the tenuous link to involve him is also absurd.From the opening scene, a misogynist on a tube train, not necessarily an unlikely character, but the lack of reaction from the other passengers, and the strange response from the victim, strange because she is, by the story unfolding, a hardened journalist that has the financial backing to go to the USA for a questionable story, alarm bells went off that this may not be good.Can Steven Moffat write female characters? I'm not sure after this, I expected a classic, but as soon as the vicar doesn't expose the perpetrator, like everyone on earth would, all credulity is lost.This is after only two episodes, so if there is a story arc that blows everyone's mind, then I will apologize to the writer, but right now, it's a mess.",

A quick reading of the other reviews will detail the several dozen enormous plot holes or nonsensical interchanges or terrible dialog. In brief: the David Tennant character makes every possible mistake a human could, the Dolly Wells character is so unsympathetic you keep hoping she'll just die, the Stanley Tucci character's supposed genius is revealed by... oh wait, it's never revealed, it's only announced. Over and over. (And whose idea was it to make a mass murderer cuddly and adorable?)But what got me particularly riled ( as a journalist ) was that the journalist character clearly has no idea whatsoever how to be a journalist, starting with her inability to ask intelligent questions and her inability to show any integrity, and ending with this: no free-lance writer in the world, unless she's very, very, very wealthy -- and rather stupid -- would, on her own initiative, jump on a plane and fly across the Atlantic because she thinks she just might get a story from someone who doesn't want to talk to her. The creators of this mess don't even bother to give her an excuse for this nonsense. Then again, they don't bother to tell a coherent story either.There's a good chance that watching this show will reduce your IQ by at least several points.",

The viewers are left to imagine 'why on earth would someone make such idiotic decisions' and what is with the annoying introduction to Stanley Tucci ? I absolutely love his work and to see him reduced to this is frankly painful. The smug unanswered questions ... the complete lack of respect for the viewers ... zero character build up ... I could go on and on ... just annoyingly bad - especially because I wanted so bad for this to be good!!",

First the man from the church and in the same day, the son! Who does that? I'd say nobody. And yet, two characters keep their viewing on a USB stick in the same half hour! Baffling.2. In all the world, Ed needs the vicar to hide the stick? Couldn't he just have hidden it, I dunno, anywhere in the massive huge world? The world is a big place and a USB stick is tiny, right? His mother is not a superhero. Slip it behind the organ! In a book! Hide it anywhere, and she wouldn't find it. Again, why did he have it on a stick, and not just downloaded at home? Ridiculous. She'd just find it on his laptop or browsing history.3. Why on earth would the maths teacher need to use a stick to transfer the maths modules? Why didn't she email them to the son? Another ridiculous point. And gets more ridiculous when you consider that she then opens the folders on the stick when everyone in the world would have just dragged and dropped the modules without opening the stick then the folder. Crazy!4. Why wouldn't the vicar just say, oh, wrong stick, this must belong to the weirdo at church, let's go to the police and have him arrested right now? Even if she didn't believe him, the police would check the bloke's computer and see the trail and know forensically it was him and not the vicar.5. But WHY did the vicar even bring the stick home?!!! Why didn't he leave it in a drawer at work, where it was?6. Why would the vicar pretend it was his because the revolting perv won't confess? Does he not want to protect the kids on the images? Of course he would! He'd go to the police immediately with the maths teacher! Who would see those images and decide to protect Ed? Totally bonkers! He's a vicar!!!Then you get into other issues. Why on earth was a serial killer written as a cuddly sunny sidekick? He killed women! Why would anyone go to see Stanley Tucci for advice? Nobody would! He's also a killer! Why would the prison let people see him? Not a one would. They have luxurious cells, all clean and quiet. Nothing makes sense.In a nutshell, the show makes heroes and victims of men who abuse women and children and irritants of women who are trying to help. I'm completely disgusted by it. How did this version get made? How did nobody see these issues? Amazing.Tinkly comedic music over the serial killer, and emotive music pitying the child fancier. And then, the absolute cherry on the cake. The note from Ed \"he was protecting someone else.\" What? Why would he say that? He'd say \"protecting me\" because he killed himself, and in any case, his mother knows! What a waste of resources. I love Dolly Wells and Lydia West but why are they in this?",

That does not explain his irrational behavior.Stanley Tucci's character and the way he came up with the conclusion at the end of episode 1 made absolutely no sense.

            "content": "It's fair to say writer & executive producer Steven Moffat just doesn't seem to be able to catch a break since leaving the position as showrunner of Doctor Who in 2017; Sherlock S4 (excluding \"The Lying Detective\") was critically panned & rejected by fans, his BBC reimagining of \"Dracula\" was torn apart by audiences before his adaptation of \"The Time Traveller's Wife\" was then subsequently cancelled by HBO after 1 season (due to the fact that it barely made any impression whatsoever, good or bad) & now, as if all that weren't bad enough, his new series \"Inside Man\" is unfortunately abysmal...Hence, in the next disappointing project that's finally making its way in to the public's viewership, I'm honestly saddened to see that this show simply does not give the creator the \"win\" he so desperately seems to need at the moment, & is sadly yet another lacklustre addition to his growing pile of recent \"misses\", rather than \"hits\".This waste of potential is especially confounded by witnessing the sheer brilliance of the creative talent involved, both in front of & behind the camera; Paul McGuigan for instance, the visionary director of \"Sherlock\" S1 & 2, who solidified his status as an incredible filmmaker, bringing the world of Moffat's most successful series to life (so I get his admirable loyalty, continuing to work with him since - in the hope that he'll provide another major boost to his filmography), who has again misplaced his trust in that writing twice & consequently been saddled with the unenviable task of trying to salvage a 2nd, consecutive, dire production from the jaws of mediocrity - either of which were doomed from the start by uncharacteristically poor scripts - & despite his best efforts to imbue some sense of personality or charm in to the show, his attempts ultimately fail & his skill is therefore squandered on something which is undeniably not worth the investment of his time or energies.The cinematography irked me somewhat too... He used to work with phenomenal DoPs like Steve Lawes & Fabian Wagner & now he's coupled with Tony Slater-Ling again, who has an annoying tendency to continuously over-saturate his images & make them look very artificial. Thus, I can't even appreciate the visual aesthetic constructed - irrespective of the quality of the content captured within those images - because even from a technical point of view, the show's ugly to watch.David Tennant & Lydia West etc. (the entire cast, to their credit) are genuinely fine, but the stuff they're given to work with is so contrived & subpar, even their most convincing deliveries (of some seriously terrible, middle-class lines) cannot hide the fact that this is garbage... And it all culminates to form nothing.",

There would be an easy release mechanism for TOY handcuffs and the chain metal would be so soft you could pull them apart easily and why did she put them on in the first place? She wasn't actually being threatened at that point.So, the vicar lumbers in carrying a gas heater down the stone steps into the cellar (we didn't actually see that, being so preposterous) and then it is lit and the two people in the cellar don't question it. Nobody complained about it being cold ... it is just all so ludicrous.The Stateside storyline was much better than the UK one and Stanley Tucci way better than David Tennant.A complete waste of talent all around.",

And David Tennant playing a gallant but murderous Vicar of Dibly moron.The problem with Inside Man is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. It's neither a hard drama nor a comedy.

I'm not really sure what it is about the BBC, but they have a way of creating TV that is particularly out of touch with reality.On the positive side the acting is fine, the characters would be fairly compelling if in slightly less contrived scenarios and it isn't boring by any means, it just has a persistent distracting quality about it.",

Stanley Tucci is the world's favorite actor, and always delivers, but here he seems to want to be Lector light.This is an example of a good idea that was not then stress tested in the making, with not enough time spent or control over the script and plot.

It's a tale of the unexpected for the entertainment challenged, or anyone who has nothing but time to waste. It's Dahl remixed for the current trends in film storytelling, that is absurdity for the sake of absurdity. The suspension of belief we are asked to have in this abysmal series is a writer's excuse for having nothing worth saying and no interest in making sense. The real suspension of belief here is expecting that an audience will watch. Maybe they like Stanley Tucci and David Tennant, the name actors here delivering dialogue and making quizzical faces, showing anguish, fear, urgency, all those things actors must show to keep an audience watching. There's a sad, mamma's boy pedophile with a flash drive, and a vicar (Tennant) who chooses to hide his crime because he's a vicar and that's what vicars do. There's a wife murderer on death row (Tucci) who's an intellectual with super powers, sort of. He solves crimes or explains them. He makes profound statements, too: \"Everyone is a murderer,\" he claims. He's a bad man doing good. The vicar is a good man doing bad. Why? Because he's a \"f-king vicar.\" Oh, by the way, he's holding a woman hostage in the cellar to prevent her from reporting the pedophile to the police. And so it goes.

The plot feels as though it's been devised by a creative arts student. The reason why David Tennant's character lies is completely unconvincing and leads to frustrating and long-winded nonsense.

I was already in love even before the first second of the 4 episode series. For the story, I will not say more than what is in the synopsis: \"A prisoner on death row in the US and a woman trapped in a cellar under an English vicarage, cross paths in the most unexpected way.\" It is very much a British series, so if you are more into big action US ones, you will probably hate it, which would explain the rates you see all around. You do need to get through the first scene though, which is at best cringe worthy. You then get into a 4 hour long movie divided into 4 episodes so that you can watch them at a pace (yes, of course I binge watched them), where the whole premise could be summarised with 'Everyone is a murderer. You just have to meet the right person' said by Stanley Tucci within the first episode. The acting is superb from Tucci and Tennant (how else could it be?), though not great with the supporting actors. I did find it fun that I hated the main victim so much that I was on the aggressor's side.",

One is David Renwick, and the other is Steven Moffatt. Shows like Sherlock, Coupling and Joking Apart are now joined by another masterpiece.

All the main characters played their parts well and to all the people who say \"I turned it off after five minutes\" you missed the highlight of the show because you didn't like an introduction scene of two of the characters? That is a pretty dumb reason to down vote a show. This is an intriguing crime drama that works on the premise that at our core we are all capable of murder. That we are all just one bad day away from killing someone. There are two main stories at play. The first is Stanley Tucci plays a convicted wife murderer on death row who when it suits him gives advise on open cases to whoever he finds interesting. One day a young reporters shows up and asks him to help her find her missing friend at first he refuses but later he agrees to help. The second is David Tennant plays a vicar who through a series of unfortunate events end up assaulting and kidnapping said friend when she believes the vicar's son might be a pedeophile. Both stories converge on the hunt to find the friend before the vicar and his increasingly unstable wife decide to kill the woman. What I really like about the show is the kidnaped woman isn't made out of be stupid. As a matter of fact she is clever in the way she deals with the vicar and his wife and at time she is even given the upper hand despite the situation she is in. Of course everything comes crashing down eventually but the ending is quite entertaining and if you have four hours to spare I would reccommend waching this.",

This is what the entire story revolves on and it does not sit well with me. There are more plot holes than I care to mention and these have been well documented by other reviewers and the story is, frankly, ludicrous. Fargo this is not, nowhere near and you can well imagine this was was Moffat was aiming for. Tucci is great, as usual, but is in almost a totally different show. I'm a big fan of Tennant but he should have said no, this is truly awful. It leaves a real bad tatse in the mouth - the word paedo is thrown around almost humorously. I think this show is very revealing but for all very, very worrying reasons. If there is an uproar about Netflix's Dahmer show, where is the concern over this rubbish?

And I don't think Stanley Tucci is much better either (another travesty). This show doesn't know if it's funny or serious, so I don't know either. The cinematography is heavily saturated and unpleasant to watch at times and the acting/dialogue feels more in line with a Lifetime drama or after-school special. I want to scream at the idiocy, but sadly this is the state of entertainment nowadays.

I have yet to see him in even the most tedious movies not be able to put up an award-worthy performance (I'm looking at you Lovely Bones). So it's with regret and utter astonishment that I must rate this nonsense so low, as even his performance is dismal.The thing never makes sense- ever. From a supposed investigative journalist lecturing us about toxic masculinity after an attempted invasion of her personal space, sits and watches the offender switch his target to another without even the slightest hope of intervening, then after someone else invaded her space, proceeds to invade someone else's. Even after being told no about a hundred times, she continues to force herself on another.Tuccis character is supposedly some sort of intuitive genius who just happens to be an death row inmate (even though he pled guilty, which would make it almost impossible for him to receive this conviction) but the seedy warden parades potential suitors to him because, well, I don't really understand. And there's an exhaustive riddle presented as some sort of obvious HAHA EVEN A MORON SHOULD GET THIS! Except it's the most laborious explanation that not a single reasonable (or even MENSA member) could possibly wager a guess over, but hey he's an inferred genius you simpleton! Ugh.Then we're hit by the heaviest foreshadowing ever created where we meet a vicar who has not an ounce of decency and actually protects an abomination of a human being, while a hapless halfwit of a woman somehow transforms from a wilting wallflower to courageous defender of righteous indignation and that's where we finally had to chuck the entire series into the trash and walk away.After the first scene concluded, we were positive it was likely a fluke, it has to get better. After the second scene, we were under the impression it just can't be this bad, can it? And after the 3rd series of unfortunate events and/or acting insanity finally realized we'd given it far too many chances based on Tucci, and shut it off.Save yourself the time and don't believe the paid shills who are somehow giving this unrealistic ratings and glowing reviews.",

I agree that the girl's reaction is a bit hard to believe in hindsight after we learn about her personality. But the indifference of others... Well, I've lived that scenario more times than I care to remember. In my home country or in the UK, it was always the same. Nobody gives a toss if a lone female is abused, even if it goes further than pictured here. Even if the abuser is a skinny little nothing, and there are 20 able bodied men around. They just ignore you, just as pictured. There were times when I actively called out to the ones near me for help, they pretended not to hear me. I went to the driver, he didn't want to bother either. One time a few 15ish punk boys finally helped me, ones I really did not expected to, while father-aged men just kept reading their newspapers. Other than that, everyone always looks away. Same when I was 10 and really frightened, or when I was older. So you can say that this series is very unrealistic and I'll agree with you.

Stanley Tucci and David Tennant, in particular give the project some cachet. Talent which is sadly wasted. Truth is, Tucci's character is the only one that is even moderately interesting. The British side of the story is almost immediately ludicrous, with Tucci's American story holding steady... for while. It quickly descends into similar preposterousness.To its credit, it could be considered a masterclass in draining every bit of tension out of dramatic scenes leaving a dry pulp with its dull, lifeless and frustratingly repetitive dialogue. For many of the characters, life and death is in the balance... and the audience has no reason to care a bit.It's clear that there may be at least the thought of future series, with condemned man Grieff (Tucci), doing his best impersonation of an amalgam of Sherlock Holmes, Hannibal Lechter and the James Spader character from Blacklist (Red something or other). A genius mind who's a savage killer, but has seeming unlimited resources at his disposal. Talk about plot armor!

Instead there is a horrible second story involving David Tennant. This is where the show goes off the rails. Tennant's character makes the worst decisions imaginable. I caught myself asking why countless times just during the first episode. It makes the show so unrealistic that it's practically unwatchable. Normally I see Tennant in great roles and I have no idea why he decided to take this part. He does a solid job but his character makes such poor decisions that I don't think any human would make regardless of their level of intelligence that it makes his part of the story very hard to watch. I've seen this in a couple other reviews but if you can throw all reality out the window while watching this, you'll probably enjoy it especially if you're a fan of Tucci or Tennant.

A smiling monster. A camp, jovial, comedy sidekick, whose evil was constantly talked about, but either glossed over, or made light of. While Tucci's single crime was treated as a dark and terrible thing, Estimond's multiple serious and heinous crimes were all but used for comedic purposes, when they weren't being dismissed as rtivial. He was a serial killing cannibal, but hey, he's a camp jolly fat Black man, so he's not all that bad, right?The show is a mess.",

But he's surpassed himself here and it makes me wonder if the BBC has any quality control whatsoever when it comes to green lighting his projects.Episode 1 became somewhat implausible within 2 minutes but was utterly farcical by the half hour mark. I actually laughed out loud at the scene that sets off Tennant's problems; a supposedly pivotal and thrilling scene played out like a slapstick comedy. Also, the therapist explanation was so eye rollingly awful that i think i need therapy myself.It's really not worth mentioning the gaping plot holes because that would suggest flaws in an otherwise coherent plot where characters act like human beings and the writing has some concept of time and distance. This whole series is one big plot hole really.What we have here relies wholly on ludicrous coincidence and the characters constantly making decisions that defy any rational explanation in order for the plot to happen. This is cobbled together with the Tucci based scenes that come across like an implausible and tacky US 'case of the week' series (Lie to Me, Castle etc.)I can't even give stars for Tennant and Tucci's performances as they don't really salvage anything and they agreed to be in this disaster after all.",

Hijinks ensues when the vicar's son gives the flash drive to his math tutor who opens the flash drive and is horrified to see that it's filled with pedo porn. In the end, the vicar says that it's his flash drive to somehow protect his pedo parishioner. I saw the same thing on an episode of Gilligan's Island. It was hilarious.Then the pretend-pedo vicar assaults the tutor physically (funny, he seemed like such a nice man earlier) and tosses her down a flight of stairs. She's alive, but then the good vicar locks her down in the cellar. If this seems like a good premise to start a series, you are a better man, or woman, or possibly a pedo, than I am. The truth is that I'm terrible as a woman, or I think I'd be as I've never tried. I've also never assaulted and kidnapped a woman, but I'm not an ordained minister either.The Abbot and Costello serial characters played by Stanley Tucci and Atkins Estimond are fun, if wise-cracking murderers are your thing.

And I must say that the first two episodes hooked me.The combination of a story that (1) takes place on deathrow in a USA prison, and (2) in a vicarge in england, makes this a combination of \"hell\" and \"heaven\". The events that actually occur are the total opposite of what you expect: i.e. The good stuff happens on deathrow, whilst the bad events occur in the vicarage. How more counter intuitive can it get?!Episode 3 and 4 however became so absurd that I wondered what on earth I was watching. The absurdism however reached such a level that it became an overall enjoyable watch. Some of the events even made me recall some great \"Mr. Bean\"-sketches, where every good intentioned deed resulted in utter chaos. This without the comedy that is...The show is set-up in such a way that they can easily extend it with a second season. And I honestly hope that this will happen. I would hope though that a second season would get rid of the storyline in the vicerage and focus solely on the deeds of the \"deathrow detective\".

The actual victim played by Dolly Wells? Nope. So self-convinced that she knows the whole truth from a 30 second interaction. I didn't even feel any sympathy or empathy for her, that's how badly written she is. David Tenant's vicar? Psychotic, overreacting moron. All he had to do was step back, but he assumed he knew better, too. Stanley Tucci's \"detective\" did okay, but for being an imprisoned Sherlock, the character comes off as bland. The most likable and enjoyable character was Tucci's counterpart in jail, Dillon, the serial killer cannibal.The plot is an exaggeration, I get that. But it takes things out to extremes that are ridiculous and kills my willing suspension of disbelief. The entire event and chaos that leads to the conflict in this was so contrived and artificial that I wanted to scream at everyone involved. (**Spoilers:** It's 2022 - who uses flash drives anymore?!

Oh, he did that stupid thing. Oh, wow, I hope the character doesn't do this other stupid thing. And he does the other stupid thing. These decisions made by Tennant's character in the very beginning of the series are utterly implausible and the second one especially just comes out of left field. The series doesn't just have a weak foundation; there is no foundation. The characters decisions follow nothing we had seen previously and bear no resemblance to anything a real person would do unless they are uncommonly stupid. This character is not presented as uncommonly stupid. He just does really stupid things. In addition, while I can't go into details so as to avoid spoilers, the thematic setup is insultingly unsubtle. Through the mouth of one of the characters we are literally told, okay so here's the big philosophical and moral underpinning of the series. I'm beginning to rant. In fact, the stupid decisions Tennant's character makes are ham-handed apparently is a way to just quickly get that part of the story over with, to establish some ethical dilemmas so they can move on to the next stage. The writing is insulting to the viewer. The prospect of David Tennant and Steven Moffitt together again was exciting, which makes this shows failure from the very beginning all the more disappointing.",

It's a dark comedy with two main plot lines, one about regular people who get themselves into a criminal misunderstanding, make a series of bad decisions in the ensuing panic and progressively making the situation worse for themselves until it all unravels, and the other about a journalist collaborating with an eccentric, hyper-competent death row inmate to rescue the person who got imprisoned in one of the former group's early bad decisions.

Moffat, who still lives of his \"I revitalised Sherlock Holmes\" fame delivers a poor follow-up with this badly acted, badly directed, go nowhere, uninspiring feast of pretentious rubbish.I love Stanley Tucci and David Tennant, but they can't make up for the poor script and lifeless story. Tucci, wasted as another Hannibal Lector-clone (seriously, how many times do writers feel they're good enough to replicate such a character?) phones in his role, and gives nothing interesting to his character. Nothing. A monotone drawl and \"i'm so much smarter than you\" attitude gets boring real quick.David Tennant is capable of better (see Broadchurch) and fumbles through the poor script, and at no time convinces me that he's a priest, a father, a selfless soul willing to anything for his family. Instead, he's just a dumb moron who is just like his director - unable to make good decisions.Then you've got Dolly Wells as Janice. Probably the worst character to hit the small screen since Urkel. Moffat tries to show his solidarity with women everywhere by giving us a ridiculous, loathsome victim, who you simply cannot identify with, nor feel any sympathy for. By the end of the first episode I was already praying for her demise. Sadly, it didn't come.And finally we have the \"Rainman of Journalists\", the \"Queen of Derrrrrr\", the \"Dumbest Person in the Room\" - Lydia West, as Beth. Pretty much the stupidest, most clueless, naive and dumbest so called \"journalist\" that has ever had the occupation of journalist in the history of television. For 3 and a half episodes, Beth's first response to every comment or piece of dialogue is \"Huh?\" or \"Wait, I don't understand\", or \"But why?\". Give a rubik's cube to a cow and she'll do a better job at understanding than Beth. I felt bad for the actress, who was only reading someone else's words (well, that's the job, right?), but poor Lydia was criminally miscast as the tenacious young journo hellbent on finding her friend. Actually, the whole last sentence was soooo wrong. Never tenacious, definitely too young to have any credibility, and Janice and Beth were never really friends.Horrible casting, poor plot/story, lazy direction, irritating and pretentious dialogue, characters who you would give a toss about.

Maybe it's a personal pet peeve but I simply can't stand when a story entirely hinges on multiple characters being way too pushy, entitled and hurried and the characters opposite them being completely incapable of communicating the very simple points that would clarify the misunderstandings that are the only reason for the intense conflict.When a character who communicates for a living can't give the detailed explanations that would help remedy their extreme dilemma, I'm just too frustrated to care anymore. I just hate that writing trope and it happened over and over again with multiple characters and situations of contention. One would be way more pushy than is normal and the other would panic wildly and not offer the obvious words that that would end the conflict and things compound from there. It's hard to explain but I've seen it in storytelling so many times and it's infuriating to watch. You don't see it very often anymore in good productions but when it shows up its just far too ridiculous and obviously just a lazy way of putting the characters in direct, intense conflict.In only this follwing paragraph, some almost spoilers ahead, I'll reference specific instances very vaguely, so it won't truly spoil anything but if u have seen it, you'll know what I'm talking about. If u don't want to chance it, skip this following paragraph.There's also several plot points and character behaviors that just don't add up or maybe are pheasible but added to everything else, further enraging to watch. If only our innocent family had thought about the fact that if police can trace who's computer it came from,which they can do and the lead made mention of twice, THEN U DONT HAVE A PROBLEM. And if you're thinking along those lines, why the hell are we repeatedly using our devices to Google things and email things which would certainly implicate us? If the manipulative \"victim\" were so clever, why didn't she ever clue in to the fact that the most reasonable explanation for her circumstances would be that what the family was saying was true or at least discuss it with them and get more information instead of jumping to conclusions and putting everyone in their respective corners... or maybe, just maybe, stop focusing on how clever you are for one moment and notice that the person supposedly responsible for the material at the heart of this, keeps asking questions about it which make it BLATANTLY obvious that he knows nothing about the contents and therefore could not be responsible for them.I liked the idea of the characters and their conflict but the execution was excruciating to watch. It's really such a shame because there were a lot of likeable, interesting aspects to most of the characters. There was much more potential than was achieved. The acting was all brilliant all around, I don't mean that. The direction was middling, I wanted to shove the cameraman off the merry go round in the park scene with the reporter and the Scottish thief, dear God, I got vertigo from watching two people sit still and talk. But the plot and the limitations placed on the characters robbed it severely.The concept was a good one, sort of... the central idea was that ordinary, decent people can become murderers in the right circumstances. This concept is true and should be better explored and understood. But it's laughable when they lump serial killers with ribcage magazine racks and pedophiles with obvious psychological damage and behavioral disorders in with them like they're all the same... they aren't. And this was a poor example of when that is true. Sure, people do stupid things all the time, especially when freaked out enough to murder someone, but the characters were so distractingly shoehorned into contention by the writer and denied the common sense solutions to their misunderstandings every single time. It's just incredibly aggrevating to watch. There were aspects of most of the characters that I really liked... it could have been so much better. There's some great humor in it, which I really enjoyed. And occasionally there was a really pure moment of honest humanity and true psychology. But overall, I resented watching it.",

The lout deletes the picture (of course he knew the passcode to the phone) Ha ha ha. Clearly written by 3 monkeys with sunglasses on. Then all of a sudden people pluck up the courage but only by using mobile phones. All of them women, give me a break. The police arrest the lout at the next stop without a shred of evidence, apparently being ugly and dressed in garish clothing is enough to get arrested in modern London.The victim and one helper share words of thanks and pats-on-the-back outside of the station which goes beyond embarrassing. The police never take any statements from anyone. That's when I thought maybe I'll fix that dodgy looking shelf after all. Steven moffat has now become bywords for stinkers.",

They are quite funny together.David Tennant's character is a bit annoying, and does make questionable decisions, but it's all part of the mad storyline.I say just watch it and enjoy the suspense and mad storyline.

            "content": "My Review- Inside ManMy Rating 6.5 /10Netflix from October 31stI was lucky to see an advanced copy of this upcoming four part series and while I enjoyed the performances in Inside Man it left me with to many unanswered questions .Inside Man follows a prisoner on death row in the US, a Vicar in a quiet English town, and a maths teacher trapped in a cellar, as they cross paths in the most unexpected way\nI especially enjoyed Stanley Tucci as Jefferson Grieff a man on Death Row convicted of murdering his wife also David Tennant as the local village Pastor Harry Watling . Harry the trusted village Pastor makes a decision when he is confronted with the sins of his verger that will throw his well ordered family life into unimaginable turmoil.The two real problems that I had with the story by Steven Moffat was that the two characters and two stories didn't gel or have credibility for me .The decision that the Pastor makes by taking the blame for the discovery of his vergers child pornography in an effort to protect his son Ben played by Louis Oliver from being blamed just seemed unfathomable to me?Why didn't he just report the crime of the verger to the Police?Without giving any more plot details away the Stanley Tucci character while entertaining also baffled me a little because a prisoner on death row would hardly be given the privileges this one has of visits from journalists and be asked to assist as a super sleuth in various ways that don't connect to the Pastor's story till the very end of the series .Perhaps I just didn't get it ? But even in quirky Dramadies I like a little logic in the plot and this series ,especially in the last episode turns to the melodramady genre .However I think it's worth a watch for the two T's Tucci and Tennant plus a very good performance by Dolly Wells as Janice Fife the edgy maths tutor of Ben the vicar's son who lands herself in deep trouble by her incorrect assumptions regarding her student Ben .I interpret the title Inside Man as not just a reference to prison inmates inside gaol . The message , if any I got was that if a set of traumatic circumstances present themselves inside us all we have the capacity to murder ,especially if panic sets in and also that every action has a consequence.Steven Moffatt is obviously a very talented story writer but this one for some reason left me with to many unanswered questions,",

            "content": "'The Inside Man' is awful. And I'm a fan of its stars David Tennant and Stanley Tucci (yes, I know, I've said something like this before, for other films), so imagine how really bad this story must be.And the story is this. A woman disappears in a small English Village and her friend is concerned. Five thousand miles away a killer - Tucci - sits on a U. S. prison's Death Row facing his execution. The English Village friend somehow, and for some reason, approaches killer Tucci's character in person and asks his help in finding her friend. Why Tucci? Why America? Why not the British Police? Why, why, why?Here was my theory. It's WRONG, but a theory. This was initially two separate dramas (a) a killer's execution and (b) the disappearance in Britain and the role that a local clergyman - Tennant - had in her disappearance. But neither story was strong enough on its own so, the Director - Scotch-Tape in hand - combined the two into one. The two stories look and feel totally separate, as though directed and filmed by different individuals. In fact only one character appears in both stories - 'The Concerned Friend' - and easily could have been pasted into either story. Or removed.But as I said, my theory was wrong. But what I'm correct about is how really bad this is.1. David Tennant is hyper-anxious as a cleric protecting his family. I found myself uncomfortable in his presence; not because he's evil but because I felt that even he knew his acting was atrocious.2. The story is has as its center a contrivance that exceeds anything I've ever viewed. A sort-of mistaken-identity. And I've seen lots of mistaken-identity-dramas over the years and this one tops the list for 'Oh no!'3. The action-finale of the story is shot so terribly, with so many quick-cuts, it was hard to know what actually happened. And, more important, once we knew what happened we had to ask, How? How did this happen?4. And, because the director likely knew we'd be asking 'How', the two main characters have a 'Zoom' conversation in the film's final scene. As implausible as this meeting might be, the fact that the Tucci character describes in detail everything that took place 'off-screen', tells you everything you need to know.So, it's up to you. Who you gonna believe? Me or them other guys?",

A series with such strong moral dilemmas the protagonists have to face, should have a watertight plot that is driven by events and characters' actions that are necessary and unavoidable.

I didn't realize just how prophetic my guess would be.

Stanley Tucci, who is very talented, is very good in his role as a criminologist behind bars for murdering his wife. He accepts cases to work on while he awaits the executioner, because that is what happens in maximum security prisoners- outsiders are free to come and go as long as the warden is cool with it.Next we have David Tennant, a great actor as well, but completely unbelievable as an English vicar taking the blame for a heinous crime against children rather than reveal the true culprit who maybe confessed?

Not since the early seasons of 'Line of Duty' has a TV programme been so riveting.As the levels of intensity and craziness escalate, the only way to keep these situations believable is by having superb acting and all of the cast provide a natural and believable grounding allowing us to accept that what we're seeing is actually happening. The subject matter: loss of faith, murder, rape, child pornography and suicide are clearly pretty heavy so Steven Moffat treats these very sensitively and respectfully but also injects a wicked sense of humour throughout. Inside Man is the darkest of dark comedies and that humour is so necessary to make the nature of the plot palatable - not only palatable but enjoyable. Although few people don't seem to get the humour, most people do; you will therefore find this absolutely hilarious. That, along with it being totally mesmerising makes very addictive telly.",

K. ones and the obvious contrast between Stanley Tucci's superior acting to that of a wooden Lydia West when they were in the same scene was there for all to see. Yes, Inside Man had numerous flaws and yes, most people wouldn't act and behave as ludicrously as most of the key characters did but overall I found it fun to watch.

I agree with most of the reviewers on certain individual points, even opposing ones. And I think that might be the point but I'll get back to that later. It has its tongue in cheek moments I suppose, there are certain phrases that in hindsight are clearly foreshadowing, but I definitely wouldn't call it a \"light\" watch, nor would I call it playful simply because there are witty conversations strewn in. Implausible? Maybe but I'm not concerned with that when it comes to television and fiction generally, though this story takes it to levels that are truly insulting to our intelligence. Also, REALLY tragic things happen! And at every possible turn people make the worst choices out of the options they had. It's absolutely unnecessarily mad and chaotic. I would rather have watched a show that conveys this idea (that everyone has the ability to harm others despite what they may think), without taking to this level of ridiculousness. I found it painful to watch, and wondered why the writer made terrible choice after terrible choice just to hammer in a \"narrative\". I get the impression the writer thinks most viewers are stupid and he is **Very Intelligent**.So back to my previous rambling about how the point might be to hold space for opposing views. I'm all for that if there's a cause. In the absence of a cause it lacks substance. It seems the intent was to leave the viewer feeling they should \"question everything\", but then we're left with nothing but conspiracies aren't we? I thought the acting and cinematography was skilled hence the 3 stars, but the story was giving ReBeL wItHoUt A cAuSe vibes which isn't generally what I'm interested in consuming or amplifying. So, zero stars added for the story itself. There are plenty of actual causes out there, we don't need to be making a mockery at the expense of real life problems. I honestly regret watching the whole thing but had hoped it would take a turn at some point. And maybe it did, but not one worth sticking through to the end for IMHO. And the more I reflect on it, the more I truly hate it. And to open the story with such a gross boy thrusting his groin, getting pleasure from making everyone squirm, just to create a chance encounter? It's a NOPE for me.

David Tennant is great as he always is, but if you think too much about what's actually happening you realize it's actually really, really stupid...The whole time they keep repeating the phrase that good people can kill anyone under the right circumstances. So they give you David Tennant's character who is \"The Vicar\" as a set up to prove this point - subjecting him to a series of ridiculous coincidences that set him on a path to murder his son's math tutor.So, his creepy mentally ill co-worker (Edgar) just gives him a USB to hide it from his mom. He says it's porn so the vicar puts it in his pocket like \"hey man, I got your back, your crazy religious mom wont find your porn, nbd.\" So he takes it home and accidentally puts it in a place where his son's math tutor uses it for some homework thing. She opens it up and she sees it's not regular porn it's CP - no one knows this but her at this point.His son walks in while she's looking at it, he doesn't see the screen but somehow knows it's porn - so he thinks the USB is filled with HIS materials, not CP, and he apologizes for her finding \"his porn\". So he appears to admit it's his and the tutor is like \"ew, I'm leaving\" and the Vicar tries to get her to stay and talk about it so she doesn't report his son to the police. He fights with her, accidentally pushes her down the stairs, and then locks her in his basement while he figures out what too do.This scenario is what \"forces\" a good person to kill an innocent person over a misunderstanding... Except the only way this situation was able to play out was by having Tenant's character forget a MAJOR bit of information HE brought up! After the lady is in his basement, he decides to coax and record Edgar confessing to owning to the CP. Tenant says \"Don't lie to me, there are ways for people to find out this USB is yours\" and this is true (forensics, duh)! So why didn't he just let the lady leave thinking what she wanted and give the USB to the police?Somehow in all this he is concerned that his work buddy - who is a predator - is a suicide risk and he doesn't want to put him in a bad state of mind... So what does he do? He TAKES THE BLAME for owning the CP - puts it on his own laptop and then prints them out on his home printer! \ud83d\ude02 Why?! There is no reason for any of these choices other than to prop up that the Vicar is a \"good guy\". Perhaps he's got some real affection for Edgar but we never see a good reason to defend a pedophile in their scenes together.All of this happens while Moffat tries to build another story to weave into this CP story and it's just so ridiculous. The journalist you follow throughout the story really only serves to weakly tie Stanly Tucci's genius criminal mystery solver character to the David Tenant storyline - it's a build up with no pay out.To add insult to injury, the direction and tone is totally bazar. They go from tearful scenes where they acknowledge the Vicar is going to prison and their family is ruined but 5 minutes later they have the Vicar's wife doing a little comedy bit where she's trying to defend herself with a kitchen knife and makes lightsaber noises. They insert this inappropriate comedy relief all over like it's Dr. Who like forcing a scene where David Tennant's character must do a birthday shout for a delivery guy's mom asking him to say \"happy birthday from the sexy vicar\".There is so much more to say, but this show stole hours of my life I can't get back.",

Tennant, as usual, gives a fantastic performance and Stanley Tucci and Lydia West were really great as well. The writing for some of the characters though especially Tennant is REALLY bad. Tennant's character is so stupid that it genuinely ruins the show. It ruins the show because his misunderstanding is the basis for the story of the show. Why on Earth would he accept a flash drive from a suspicious person that he knows regardless if he's a pastor or not and why on earth would he love the flash drive out in plain site when he knows that there is definitely something bad on there. Instead of explaining to the teacher how he got the flash drive, he instead tries to cover for his son and act like the flash drive was his. His character was just incredibly and unbelievably stupid and really ruined the show to the point where once we learn the fate of Tennant's character, I just don't care because he deserved it for being so stupid. Stanley Tucci's involvement was very boring. We only cut back every once in a while to him and for someone on death row, he has a VERY surprising number of contacts that he enlists to help Lydia West's character solve the case.

IMHO I personally think a lot of the negative reviewers are either missing the point or didn't past the first episode. I see a lot of low reviews complaining about plot holes and the story is not believable. Yet we highly rate shows and movies that have magic DNA that defies science, action heroes that always save the day, time travel, and even superheroes with powers and other magical being because they are believable? Walking Dead? Game of Thrones? This is TV, not a documentary. Some of the complaints seem a bit \"nitpicky\", to me at least.The rest contains spoilers so stop reading now if you need to.About the journalist protagonist, there is no proof she is ACTUALLY a published journalist other than her word. She could be green journalist, a blogger who fancies herself a journalist, or some weirdo obsessed with crime, so train scene could be explained.People are hung up on the drive, but Edgar was obviously not rational and suicidal, but he should think clearly? Does not seem unusual he would run to his vicar whom he seems to trust in his panic.As far as why the vicar made the odd decisions he did, we may assume there is some sort of confidentiality clause in play attached to his faith for anything Edgar told him. Even if his faith had special rules that exist for abuse, he made a snap decision to protect his family. Even if he did give up Edgar, it doesn't mean he would be believed.It does not seem completely unreasonable to assume he might panic in the moment. This IS a vicar that swears constantly, and is married to a wife who does not seem to really believe in God, and he took the drive in the first place knowing what it contains (at least partially). I am not defending his actions, but people always believe a man of God when it comes to accusations of abuse right?A cuddly sidekick murderer, a warden who seems on the side of right but makes a questionable moral decision that breaks a law or two. Panic, stupid decisions, contradictory characters, all of these are designed IMO to make you think about stereotypes, preconceived notions, and to ponder that any one person is capable of anything given the right circumstances.I personally believe the ending was intentional to setup for a second season. The core story was wrapped up, but no, not everything that was teased was revealed (we've heard of Lost right?). Did I want to know, sure, but I am not going to lose sleep over it if a second season never appears.This type of show is not for everyone, but I enjoyed it and recommended it for anyone capable of seeing it for what I believe it to be.",

Avoid at all costs unless you want to see acting talent wasted, this is quite literally an example of how not to write a crime drama. Somebody at the BBC needs to take a good hard look at themselves, this is the channel that gave us Edge of darkness, An ungentlemanly act, Tinker tailor soldier spy and Smiley's people way back in the 80's, to say they have fallen away is quite the understatement.Currently sitting at 6.4/10 here on Imdb, a score that as unbelievable as the show itself.",

I started to wonder if maybe the tutor was some masochist who enjoyed hurting herself.The \"mysteries\" Tucci solves are ridiculously laughable.

            "content": "It is important for me to put a disclaimer that writing a show based on a supposed probability of someone placed in a position of being accused a p/do while not being a p/dophile and, instead, desperately trying to prove otherwise and falling into only more trouble of being viewed as a p/do is not possible. Not only not possible, but destructive to the views we form on immensely important social issues. There is also a lot of questionable p/do-apologism and compassion, which certainly makes you question Steven's priorities in this life.Moffat tried to introduce a turmoil of insane events based on simple misunderstandings. It's an interesting premise and I very much enjoy characters that slowly lose it completely. However, Steven was not able to do anything with his material. The subject is all over the place. The Vicar and death row plot is not connected and the desperate attempts of trying to intertwine the two only weaken the plot and frustrate the viewer. The death row plot and Stanley's character should have been omitted entirely. It is irrelevant, it provides nothing but clever integrations of clever monologues to present in a clever light the clever Writer itself.Another huge issue of the show is Steven's desperation in trying to prove that he is not a misogynist. The female characters are horrible, you can sense Steven's anger with them yet the unique desire to prove to everyone that he actually loves and respects women. I wish someone would finally tell the guy that the weird fixation on non-misogyny actually makes him more misogynous. It would save us all trouble and finally set his mind at ease if we'd finally move away from this subject.Moffat also wants to teach its viewer a very pretentious lesson. \"Everyone's a murderer\" It is another one of those things Moffat writes as if his characters are saying something immensely intelligent. One second of thought and you can fully counterargue the completely bizarre and incomprehensible statement. It's crazy that the show actually ends with a full-blown monologue on this matter. There is a very specific line there, \"Everyone is a murder on a bad day\". Not really? Hello? I don't know Steven, if these are the type of thoughts that occur to you on your bad days, I strongly recommend therapy.It's also clear that the lesson of putting his characters \"down\", showing they aren't so moral themselves is Moffat's personal projection. You see, the viewers who consistently point out issues in Steven's writing or personal views are no saints themselves and should therefore stop judging him.Steven's problem is that he lost his track. He focused the mistakes pointed out and obsessed over them to the point of making each episode of late Doctor Who and Sherlock, Dracula, and Inside Man all about them. He fails to write female characters, he's too narcissistic, and inserts the idealistic self as a protagonist in each project made. However, he is still a great writer. And sometimes, when he breaks out of that self-centered cycle, his stories become exceptional. Unfortunately, I feel that Moffat has fully lost himself in that desperation of proving to be higher than the criticisms made, or being angry at them, or cursing the viewer for how they don't differ from his also. Each project is like a diary of jumbled frustrations that he just pushes out into the world instead of reflecting on how to overcome these feelings and writing something he actually likes.I tell you what, I think the plot could have been interesting. If removing the death row and journalist plot entirely and instead focusing on a closed-off environment of one family slowly losing themselves and fixating on what to do with a trapped woman in a cellar, it could have worked. You could understand the characters, why they do what they do, and how warped their realities are to justify their actions. It would make it an actual quality dark drama Steven obviously hoped to do. Alas, what we got is another Moffat hysteria instead of evolving his mastery and focusing on producing new, interesting, and innovative subjects.However, the casting is great. All great stars of British television and all a joy to observe. Although, I do hold some grudge that David agreed to participate in this. Oh well.2/10 for the beloved cast.",

I don't like the series' creators and avoided it until a day when I said, How wrong can you go with David Tennant and Stanley Tucci?The spiritual torture Vicar Harry (Tennant) goes through reminded me of the trials Will Ferrell's \"Marty\" endures in Apple's \"The Shrink Next Door.\" It's hard to portray real, grinding, incessant, unending spiritual torment in a way that will keep viewers' attention and interest. Most people exposed to matter this dark, whatever their religious faith if any, will call religious dark matter crazy or senseless, dumb or worse. \"Inside Man\" is from the first minute to the closing credits (literally) about a Dark Night of the Soul. The Night ends very happily for one person and very badly for others.Unlike \"The Shrink Next Door,\" the spiritual darkness is offset by comic relief in the guise of a fetching young lass (Lydia West) who does the bidding of death-row inmate in the manner of Sherlock Holmes. Jefferson Grieff's (Tucci) execution-scheduling is part of the plot. For once, Dylan Baker gets a reprieve from playing smarmy Uriah Heep knock-offs and does a fantastic job as Tucci's compassionate prison warden. Atkins Estimond (Dillon) as a Watson to Tucci's Holmes is respected as a comic Dahmer-type. This part of the story takes place in the arid American desert.But the British part of the story is so relentlessly painful, it's inevitable certain viewers will recast it in ways that allow them to disdain it. Anyone who says the producers can't write female characters are mistaken. Dolly Wells as Janice Fife and Lyndsey Marshal as Mary, Vicar Harry's wife, are magnificent. Marshal especially is terrifying as a suburban wife and mother who segues in and out of being her own evil twin. (Tennant does this kind of thing so well, it's kind of not surprising that he's brilliant as a tortured soul. It's his schtick.)Just as \"The Shrink Next Door\" gives the viewer the unpleasant opportunity to sit through grueling amounts of spiritual pain--to teach lessons few Americans get drummed into them during religious services--\"Inside Man\" gives the viewer the even more unpleasant opportunity to sit through the ordeal of a woman trapped by utter coincidence in the hands of sane people situationally compromised. Marty triumphs in \"The Shrink Next Door\" at the cost of his entire life. Harry triumphs in \"Inside Man\" at the cost of his.I didn't even make popcorn. I sat through four episodes straight. Jefferson's (Tucci's) observation that all required to make a murderer is a bad day and bad timing... Ten stars.",

The script is laughable and the characters constantly say things that you wouldn't hear in real life, nor an irreverent Yorgos Lanthimos production.Both Dolly Wells and Lyndsey Marshal's characters are almost unwatchable.

I liked Stanley Tucci, although his character was very unbelievable and Tennant was quite OK.Sadly, that's it with the positives.The main problem with the series is, that almost everyone acts absolutely idiotic. Maybe this is supposed to be a contrast to the allegedly brilliant Grieff. And I mean allegedly, because the solutions to the puzzles he solves are extremely contrived.The first problem he solves in about 10 seconds. When they revealed what the solution was supposed to be, I could only shake my head. It is like one of the old riddles, that you solve at parties with a group of friends. Only in the games you know, that those things are not meant to be taken seriously. Almost every episode of the Mentalist had better mystery at its core and this show ran for seven seasonsThe character of the wife was so bad I already forgot her name and regarding Jannice, bland is the only adjective that comes to mind. The moment they reveal she is supposed to be \"smart\" I snorted with laughter. You know, they tell you, so it must be true, even though all her actions up to that point were just idiotic. The rest of the cast are just forgettable set pieces. Beth the reporter is only there to propel the dumb story and don't even get me started on the utterly ridiculous metro scene with her. Ben, the son, is there for some scenes. That's it. He is a plot device for his father to try and \"rescue\". Once he gets some scenes with actions and dialogue, he of course acts as dumb as all the others. At least his character has the excuse of being a clueless teenager. On the other hand, we are told, that he is just lazy but quite smart ... yeah, sure he is. Actions speak louder than words, screenwriters.Then there is the main storyline, that revolves around the vicar and his family. I think this is by far the worst part of the series. At some point, I started forwarding the scenes, because they were just unbearably stupid. Dumb dialogue, stupid decisions with zero possibility to connect or sympathize with the characters or develop an understanding for their actions. They act too bizarre, too damn ridiculous to allow for that.So, there you have it. Some people seem to like it and I think this is mostly due to the attempts at humour.

This part is very good. Tucci is just the right level of sinister, and manipulative. He gets drawn in to advising on what is transpiring in the second strand of the story. It's how her gets involved that is contrived. This could have been overlooked if the second strand was any good.

But it doesn't: it gets more and more serious and continues in the same vein until the end.ReviewAn English vicar is dragged into a violent act and unusual decisions, the result of moral dilemmas while in the US a man sentenced to death for the murder of his wife solves crimes from prison.As they read it. The script will be in charge of linking both narrative lines.If there is something that a good scriptwriter must deal with, it is credible: the story must be accepted and believed by the viewer, show some internal coherence, beyond the genre of the series or movie (a science fiction or fantasy can also and must be plausible). The excellent opening scene in a subway (full of tension) promised something interesting. But From Within is a miniseries that from the first chapter does not stop accumulating inconsistencies. Characters consistently make the worst possible decisions for themselves (and others), get entangled in pseudo-dilemmas, and commit the most outrageous acts.If it were a black comedy (for a moment it threatens to be one and some humor appears here and there) one could consent to the degree of improbability of what one sees. But no: it is a dramatic thriller with moral dilemmas and false dilemmas triggered by a brief series of \"oversights\" very little credible. Neither are the privileges of the prisoner incarnated by Stanley Tucci (who during half the series solves cases of crimes in an unlikely way and in the other philosopher with a certain pretentiousness).Still, if one manages to get around and put up with the shortcomings of believability and script strains, there are some tense dialogues and enjoyable moments of suspense and tension and good performances from David Tennant as Priest Harry, from the named Tucci as Prisoner Grieff, Dolly Wells (the unforgettable nun from the Dracula series, by the same author and creator, Steven Moffat) as Janice, Harry's son's math teacher) and Lydia West (Years And Years), who does what she can with Beth , a troubled journalist who will serve as an articulating link.The brevity of the series invites you to follow it to the end, to see its resolution and if it was all a big joke and ends up justifying its inconsistencies in some way.

However the writing is sorely disappointing.Episode 1 starts off with an unbelievable storyline, forcing us to really stretch our imaginations and believe the sequence of events that are central to the show.Secondly, Tucci's character is loosely based on Sherlock Holmes but does not even come close to the mystery and excitement of Doyle's work.

As always this is another story that hinges on a family...and the story goes to some dark places.I could see some not believing how he acted, but one has to put yourself in the mindset of someone actually going through instead of a watchers lens.

And actually she may stop the son Ben for attempting murder.If he think its too danger to ask Beth to go to vicar's home, then what's the point to ask her to go to Janice's home as there are also 50% chance Janice is being kidnapped there, by his own theory.Btw, what kind of vicar will murder an innocent teacher for protecting a teenager (Ed) who like to hurt children?

It's a dark (and clever) series about the True nature of Man, his stereotypes, belief systems and that he knows nothing about any of these things. The storyline is not linear not logical but I thought that made it more interesting. A vicar who tries to take all the guilt just to keep others safe (anyone you might know maybe?), a vicars wife who calls the resurrection a fairy tale, a woman kept underground (Hades?) victim who 'devilishly' plays People against eachother, loveable murderers and a prison warden, an old man who is desperately looking for the body parts of his daughter pictured as a dispicable criminal?? And most daringly the analytic Mind of Holmes and Dr Watson on the wrong side of the Atlantic. Absolutely brilliant piece of work. Well done.",

They expect everything to be perfect and explainable, but sometimes it just isn't. I loved this show, exactly because it showed that life can be ruined by simple circumstance and unfortunate chain of events.Great show, highly recommended.

With the exception of his death row cellmate, very well-played by Atkins Estimont who serves as a kind of Dr. Watson to Tucci's death row kind of Sherlock Holmes, the other cast members should all be on death row with quick execution dates for butchering their performances while Tucci and his friend deserve pardons for putting up with them. Tucci's character solves mysteries from his cell with his friend's help, and does so pretty well even though his cases are lame because of the show's very poor writing. The main case involves an attempted murder run amok by a non-criminal couple (a pillar of the community as the local clergtman and his wife) who let a mistaken identity child porn situation get ridiculously out of hand. It is neither funny nor credible. I would rate every performance except for Tucci's and Estimont's and Dylan Baker's somewhere between zero and less. I never put spoilers in reviews despite wanting to do so here to keep people from watching this mess, but after forcing myself to watch all 4 episodes mainly to see what would happen to Tucci as his execution date draws near I decided not to. The rest of the plot deserves a zero for stupidity and the wrong kind of silliness, as does the direction and overall script. I never thought Stanley Tucci could make a bad movie or show, and he does not do so here because he is fairly credible as a jailhouse detective. However, even he cannot save this dog which needs to be put out of its misery. I suggest paying attention to other reviews similar to mine before committing 4 hours of time better spent on better movies and series.",

By accident, not design.The powers of deduction attributed to Stanley Tucci's Hannibal Lector-like character aren't impressive. Is success is due to chance. In each of the cases he addresses, there are many other possible occurrences that might have happened.At least it really is 'so bad it's good.' Enjoyable for committed performances from the British actors, let down by barely engaged performances from the Americans. Blame timid direction for that.

But corny dialogue didn't harm Star Wars; it may have even added to its off-world charm. Likewise, Steven Moffat's wisecracking characters with grandiose speeches worked brilliantly during his tenure as showrunner of the equally unearthly Doctor Who as well as in his well-observed sitcom Coupling. But dramas set in the real world have become grittier and more true-to-life during the last couple of decades, and Inside Man sticks out like an unrealistic fake sore thumb with its unrelatably unusual characters spouting bizarre dialogue in even weirder situations. I'd compare it to the slightly otherworldly feel of the TV adaptations of Harlen Coben's novels, which have the same issue of dialogue that sounds perfectly fine in your head when you read the novel but sounds a bit ridiculous when you hear it coming out of someone's mouth. Inside Man has some brilliant acting talent on screen, but even they can't make the script sound like anything any real person might say. Even suspending belief and allowing yourself to be entertained will leave you with questions about the characters' motivations which also make no sense. That said, if you persevere though the first episode, you will want to finish it. The oddness does make it oddly compelling. I feel bad saying all this as I remain a huge fan of Moffat's writing; I just think he's strayed into an area that doesn't suit him. The only reason his Sherlock worked in a 'real-world' setting was by making the character an autistic savant who could speak like no neurotypical person would and still come off as believable. Inside Man is worth a go, but there's lessons to be learned from it.",

It has some interesting and unexpected plot twists and even the obvious plot holes become part of a completely absurd world.Greatest and well thought through characters are the man inside and his (in) mate. Let's hope they weren't executed in the end, as these characters could wel be the basis for more.The final scene (don't leave immediately when the credit titles begin) creates a completely opend end and thus future possibilities.All in all, worth you while although for any future undertaking based on this premise, I would definitely suggest a better storyline than a vicar that goes to length to protect his son from a wrongful accusation.",

Where did that come from? I wish I didn't watch that last part.We also never learn what was so special about Tucci's wife's head. He made a big spiel about how after finding her head, everyone will understand why he had to chop it off. Her face was just so horrible. Was she a vampire or something? Maddening.Sending the authorities to the Vicar's house because he figured out she was being held captive there was utterly ingenious (especially after he got a confession beat out of him).There are other plot holes that could've been rightly fixed, but I thought this was one of the better shows by Moffat. Not as good as his Dracula limited series, which I recommend everyone watch on Netflix. I can understand it's not to everyone's tastes, but I found it mesmerizing. Watched it twice.I hope Netflix does more shows with Moffat. He's very talented but needs a good story editor before it gets filmed. I see Netflix didn't get all woke with this limited series and just focused on the basics.I didn't appreciate the cracks about Christianity, calling Jesus' rising on the third day a \"fairy tale\" and other insults.

Tennant, Tucci et al should have sacked (or shot) the plot writer/s. The dialogue on the other hand is clever and, at times, brilliant. Sadly not enough to bring me back for another series.WhaaaaaaatTF!",

The investigation would be fast and prove who is the culprit. That this isn't the case is the writer making the characters dumber than they would've been in real life.Best thing about the show is that there are only 4 episodes.

There wasn't a single thing that made sense or had any continuity in the entire show, at least that part was consistent. The characters went through rapid unpredictable changes for no apparent reason only to return to their 2 dimensional profile moments later. The \"cases\" he \"solves\" make no sense and are full of holes.Overall the show comes across like an extra lite, sugar free Silence of the Lambs after school special meets an anemic, pedestrian The Green Mile but with not one likable character (aside from Janice at moments but true to form that gets ruined as well).I was cheering for all of the characters to die by the end, which is rare for me. The themes of hopeless victim-hood coupled with impotent flailing toward redemption running through the show were profoundly offensive, not in a moral way as was probably intended but in a acrid flatulent way.The theme song that plays several times through every episode, which sounded like a jeans commercial from the early aughts, is a folk song done in a vaguely \"Bluesy\" kind of way but with every ounce of soul or character effectively extracted and filled with plastic. In that respect I think it was the perfect selection for the series.It really seemed as if the show were written by two different people who never conversed or bothered to read the other's contribution. So this has me wondering...Is this show a test to see if the general public streaming at home are paying attention at all, a new TV series script writing AI or a money laundering scheme?I am certain I wouldn't have watched the second episode if it hadn't been a limited series.

I think a better focus on the captive situation would've been appreciated without the need to give a useless \"Holms\" type crime genius dragging out answers and being mysterious.It was also weird seeing him go from chasing penance with the death sentence to fighting for a stay of execution and ultimately not receiving it.The ending felt very rushed. The wife's demise, the amount of times Tennant reconsiders that duct tape, the convenient timing of the random mercenaries to save the day. I think this one needed more time in the oven.And can I just say, Janice was surprisingly healthy for the post credits scene only 2 weeks after ALL the physical injuries she had.Either way the performances were great for the most part, David tenant carried the show despite his poor and frustrating dialogue.

            "content": "BBC working with Netflix? Steven Moffat, David Tennant, and Stanley Tucci? Sign me up!Maybe I expected too much. The idea was a fun one, but the execution was awful.I'll start with Tenant's character, Harry. He's a vicar who doesn't put much into it. He jokes at the beginning about working one day a week, and he never comes across as the spiritual sort. He seems more annoyed at Edgar, the verger, and his little p*rn problem than sympathetic. Any semi-normal human being, let alone a religious leader, would be horrified to learn that guy is hiding child p*rn. Instead, Harry assaults and kidnaps a woman, put his entire family at risk, and in the end decides to kill someone, all because he's afraid Edgar might kill himself if anyone finds out. Dude, just call the cops and get Edgar help. I get that people make dumb decisions in the heat of the moment, but they have to make sense from the character's perspective. Harry had zero reason to do any of this. Also, the whining about \"this isn't my fault, this isn't anyone's fault\" was obnoxious. I still love David Tennant. He did the best with what he had to work with. But not even he can turn steaming trash into something enjoyable.Next we have Grieff, Stanley Tucci's character. This plot line was less annoying, but only by comparison. I loved the banter between Grieff and Dillon because the actors were so strong, not because the story was. Grieff is an irritating character who considers himself intellectually superior. Instead of revealing how he figures things out, he makes everyone guess and talks down to them. I'm sure this was a nod to Sherlock Holmes, but unlike Sherlock, Grieff drags it out to painful lengths. It's implied that Grieff was a stand-up citizen until he brutally murdered his wife. The warden says he doesn't understand how someone like Grieff could end up on death row. Yet Grieff has a network of criminal acquaintances that do his bidding without question. This is never explained. The whole song and dance about Grieff hiding his wife's head, which would reveal the reason he killed her? Also never explained. The story misses its chance to drive home the theme of \"anyone can become a murderer under the right circumstances\" by refusing to explain Grieff's motives.Beth, the journalist, was all over the place. In the beginning, she's a shrinking violet who's scared speechless in the face of a confrontation on the train. Then she becomes a hard-boiled journalist who'll get the story no matter what, even sacrifice her friend. After that, she loses definition entirely, becoming a pawn in Grieff's games.Janice, the tutor, had potential. I kept expecting her clever manipulation of Harry and his wife to lead somewhere. It didn't. She had no influence on the outcome of the story and ended up being nothing but a plot device trapped in the basement.Ben, Harry's son, tried to bludgeon Janice to death with a hammer. We're supposed to believe carbon monoxide poisoning made him go crazy. That's not how it works. It can cause confusion, but it doesn't turn you into a murderous psychopath.How does such amazing talent end up getting shoved into random nonsense like this?",

            "content": "The star of the show is the wonderfully suave and intelligent Stanley Tucci, who is awaiting execution for strangling and dismembering his wife. Grieff has teamed up with the sociopathic serial killer Dillon Kempton to solve mysteries in the most unconventional of ways. The chemistry between Grieff and Kempton is amazing, and their banter is hilarious, making them worthy of their own spinoff series.There is also the story of the hapless vicar, Harry Watling who finds himself in a situation that could ruin his family's life. To protect Edgar, a troubled, suicidal man working at his church, Harry takes a flash drive with some unsavory content (child pornography, as he later finds out) off his hands, and it mistakenly ends up with his son's math tutor, Janice. Unable to convince Janice that it does not belong to anyone in the family and afraid that she will go to the police if freed, Harry takes the interesting course of action of locking Janice in his basement until he can decide what to do. The tension builds thrillingly as Harry gets further and further sucked into his own mistakes.Their paths cross when investigative journalist Beth Davenport visits Grieff in prison under the suspicion that her \"friend\" Janice is missing. But despite her being an investigative journalist, we only see her driven around at the whim of Grieff as he sends her off to look for clues for his various cases with the help of the shadow army he has working for him across the globe. Beth spends most of the series with a confused look on her face as other characters take action all around her.The linkage between the two stories is clear thematically. Tucci's version of a murderer is so likable that the audience, and the characters themselves, wonder how he could have killed someone so brutally. But as he tells Beth in a calm, seductive voice, \"Everyone is a murderer; all it takes is a good reason and a bad day.\"Good people are driven to do bad things. The pedophile is tortured by his dark instincts, the vicar is nearly driven to insanity by his desire to be good, and Janice, the supposed hero of the story, is found to be conniving, manipulative, and unlikeable. And Grieff, as charming as he is, is still a murderer, and we never find out why he kills his wife.The effect of all this moral ambiguity is comedic. It is a rare show that would have benefited from a longer run of episodes, or at least a more carefully constructed setup. But if you are in the mood for quality acting, mindless thriller fun, and a healthy dose of moral ambiguity, then give this a shot.",

Janice is brilliant, I think she is on the autistic scale and plays it brilliantly.

I mean maybe that's what they were going with the series but the way the priest was so unnecessarily aggressive and lying. Like why even try to hide something for someone you know is a pedophile. Why not immediately call the police instead you have to lie for a pedophile then chase down a woman and man handle her. Also the cut scenes with Tucci in jail as a lawyer I honestly didn't get the point and I'm not sticking around to find out.

All the elements are there, but within literally the first minutes people are doing things no normal person would ever do, just to provide a setup. It continues getting more and more agonising as nobody acts the way any sane person would, clearly written to do things just to advance the plot.

Alas, I thought to give him another chance; after all, it's been so many years since the last Sherlock.Great opener; fantastic 1st episode, skilfully setting up the scene, characters and diagetic world, (a classic old Moffat writing, if you will).By the second episode everything went down the drain...and it kept going with scene afte scene; a relentless cacophony of charcater development, caricature-esque plot twists...other members of the household gave up on it...I thought to keep watching, afterall there only a few episodes, and how bad can it get?

I will also agree that Tucci acting as detective to outsiders while on death row is a reach, but Silence of the Lambs didn't receive such criticism for a similar arrangement. Also, do those who are intolerant of this also deride cash cow superhero movies where bulletproof heroes fly, breathe underwater, regrow limbs, etc.? I think not.

I am a huge Stanley Tucci fan, so I hung on the hopes that the writing would somewhere improve to a point worthy of his talent. Unfortunately, there are several other really good actors in this as well and they are all delivering as well as can be expected, which is something to say when what they are asked to deliver is completely unbelievable nonsense. I am obviously not using unbelievable in the colloquial sense of wonderful, but in the literal sense of incomprehensible. The storyline seems to have been written by someone who knows nothing of either human nature or how the modern world works. Starting off with the scene of the thin-thing young tough on the train who is trying to intimidate a young woman who looks quite capable of giving him a good bounce, followed quickly by the nonsense of same skinny boy somehow intimidating yet another girl into handing him her phone, followed by the tough old broad pretending to video him on \"facebook live\" being some sort of threat, as if the whole world is tuned in to her facebook timeline. All of which might have been forgiven in service of setting up a story line, except that the endless parade of people acting unnaturally and doing things that make no physical as well as emotional sense just keeps piling up; non-sequitur upon that's-not-how-that-works, upon non-sequitur upon that's-not-how-that-works until one cannot hope to suspend disbelief with even a Herculean effort to do so.Is there any writer, director, or creative person in the business today who has the professionalism and maturity to have their work edited by anyone with some knowledge of the things used in their work? How can anyone today be so unfamiliar with the internet, computers, and social networking even though they wish to use it as a main point in their tale? Steven Moffat might as well write about deep-sea lithium mining.

His moral dilemma was totally confusing. I understand what he was going for, but unfortunately I just couldn't enjoy it. I appreciate when something is meant to be hard to watch but this just wound me up.

Yes, there is some brief entertainingly light but grizzly banter between a sociopathic Holmes-and-Watson-like duo who are on death row for murdering women. But at heart this is no comedy, not when the precipitating crime concerns child sexual abuse.I only lasted one episode, feeling dowsed in unrepentant non-creative creepiness. I concluded that the only reason for the vicar's guarding the memory stick with child porn on it was because he was an accomplice to the child abuse. Based upon the spoiler reviews it appears thankfully this is not so.

            "content": "This just showed up on netflix in germany and because of the people involved we thought this should really be up our ally.But it was painful and we only finished it to see how bad it gets in the end.Had a few laughs in the final episode but probably not what the creators intended.The tucci plot was ok and the premise might work for a simple buddy detective show with the twist that they are deathrow inmates and maybe some quirky sidekicks on the outside for the legwork.Give them 1-2 cases an episode and it would be entertaining....What really sinks the ship is the UK Plot tho. I love almost all the actors involved but the plot was just bad and the further the story goes it just made less and less sense.For example, Janice believes the son is into child porn because of a usb-drive and he even telling her that its his (he does this because he thinks its \"normal\" porn, belongs to his dad and wants his permission to go to a music festival, so he takes the blame).If Janice wouldn't know the son at all this premise \"might\" work but the way the son is arguing that its his (haha yeah its mine, don't make a fuss, just porn) should definitely make her think twice and listen to the arguments of tennents character afterwards. Later in the show we even get some flashbacks with janice and the son where it shows that they have a deeper relationship and she is a person of trust in his live.This just doesn't make any sense... and her character is otherwise portrayed to be be so cunning and smart.The whole issue could have been resolved in a few minutes after the discovery of the drive and its content like: ok you take the drive and go to the police with a taxi. I (tennant) will follow you in my car and we will discuss it there. The owner of the stick definitely had issues (beside the pedophilia) like the issues with his mother who tortures him at least mentally... It would be in his and the community best interest to get him out of that house and the mental treatment he needs.But what is tennent doing?Arguing its his stick and when she doesn't believe him and thinks he only wants to protect his child? Well how about locking her up in the basement, that will make her see reason...Tennent later also tries to get a confession out of the real owner of the drive. After intimidation doesn't work he wants to take the blame again... Why? The \"boy/man\" definitely needs help. But ruining your live and that of your family is still the best option? Wtf...I don't even want to mention that this stupid card house of lies would break down immediately with a forensic investigation of the drive, it contents and the families computers.All those weird and stupid decisions piled up more and more. It was just infuriating...I get the idea the show wanted to portray... anyone could become a murder but the plot they are presenting us for this scenario just has more holes in it than any Swiss cheese. If tennents character would also believe it was his sons usb-drive and they would have changed the sons character enough to make this believable it might work but then the idea of the show would be somehow lost anyway because its not a normal family anymore.I would advise anyone to stay way from this unless you get a kick out of infuriating characters and plots.3 Stars for the entertaining tucci parts only.",

Not blaming anybody for reacting like this in that kind of situation, but it doesn't fit with her character being so badass and all.2) funny sidecharacter being a serial killer who killed 15 women? Why would anyone write that? At least make him feel like he is a very unlikeable person. But no, he is just a funny guy cracking jokes, disgusting.3) Janice being so smart and all, would she really believe Ben would give her a stick with that kind of stuff on it and then act like it's nothing? Like it's just regular porn? Doesn't it ring a bell that maybe Ben doesn't really know whats on it. Does Janice really think that he is so dumb and would not at his age understand that it's not okay to have this kind of material (if it were actually his).4) Janice is just super annoying, I just can't help it.The best part is that this show was only 4 episodes.",

And yet... Many people have attested to being hooked. I'm the same! I watched all four episodes and, while I'm happy there aren't any more, I have to attribute being interested all thanks to the brilliance of. David Tennant and Stanley Tucci, who I really hope did this irredeemable project just for the paycheck.I mean, they must have seen it in the script, right? Stanley's character and his co-star, played by. Atkins Estimond were the best thing of this show. I kept wanting the narrative to go back to them. Their chemistry was wonderful. The female characters in this show are horribly written. Either they're irrationably defenseless and clueless or they're sadistic for no reason. David Tennant's character has the weirdest moral code I've ever seen and makes the dumbest decisions that defy reason. A murderer on death row has a better moral code than he does, but thanks to being such an amazing actor, he.manages to trudge through the fetid mud that is this writing and brings us alive to the other side. Both David and Stanley should get awards for making this garbage very much watchable.",

And that he & Greaves were once, very close, inferring that Greaves was also a member of the mob.So, my belief is, that Greaves wife, actually hung herself, in shame of being involved with a criminal family.Thus causing Greaves to realise that he & the father caused her death.And, so as not to shame her, he cuts up her body to make it look like he murdered her & to revenge the father ,who is an evil man.This is my theory only, as the series doesn't actually confirm this.",

The high level idea behind this is pretty decent, and the acting is actually quite good, but the whole UK storyline is so preposterous that there's nothing the actors can do to save this. It's almost like they've written it deliberately bad so that people will have strong reactions to it!I enjoy twisty-turny-contrived crime dramas as much as the next person, but gave up half way through the second episode, and will be unlikely to come back to it.So, this vicar is prepared to assault and imprison - and consider murdering - the tutor instead of giving up the child porn addicted member of his congregation. His wife also seems ok with this. None of them seem to even for a second consider that they could just release her, allow her to go to the police, and probably only face relatively minimal consequences.Stanley Tucci is enjoyable to watch, but his storyline is not all that much better. He makes such monumental assumptions in order to deduce what's going on from almost no information, that it is bordering on supernatural - at least if this was some kind of magical/fantasy show, that would explain some of the utter daftness - although as I said previously, I'm only into the second episode, so maybe it will be.",

            "review_title": "Absolutely Absurd",
            "content": "First time reviewer here, I watched this show and just really had to share my thoughts on it. And let me tell you, these thoughts are not good ones.I decided to give this a chance down to two things: the actors and the writer. I like Tennant and Tucci and have enjoyed most roles they've played. I enjoyed Moffat's writing in Sherlock but series 4 (aside The Lying Detective) was arguably not his best work and I did not enjoy Dracula. I was therefore worried how this show would turn out, and boy was it bad.Where to start? Let's look at the only positive, I believe the actors did their best with what they were given. The performances were okay but with the script they had I don't think even the best actors could make it any better.Speaking of script, has Moffat ever seen an actual human conversation before? No person interacts like anyone does in the show. The interactions are so stilted and unnatural and borderline on cringe at some points. Everyone sounds too scripted and the immersion is completely ruined.I have to admit that the first 15 minutes or so caught my attention. I won't go too much into spoilers, but let's say it turns very very unfeasible quite quickly.The whole situation could have (and in the real world would have) been resolved in about 10 minutes. Instead, we see Tennant's character take the most illogical and completely stupid route possible. All it took was the truth and a call to the police and it would have been fine. But no, instead Tennant's character who is a vicar (yes a VICAR) opts to protect a pervert and implicate himself and his son. WHY?The rest of the show continues along the same string of insane reasoning and gets no better. I haven't got much to say about Tucci's character as that's a whole new bag of problems with stupidity as you would imagine. I'm sure people on Death Row can just do what they fancy whenever they want right? The directing doesn't add anything to the show either. It's not bad but it's just nothing special in the slightest. The ending is obviously begging for a season 2 but I don't care enough to watch it.In short, it's implausible and just plain stupid. If you were hoping the actors and writers previous work would make this show worthwhile, then you will be left disappointed.",

I don't think this was precisely what the show was going for, but the last episodes dialogue suggested murderers should be afforded some humanity, when really that's a very surface level conclusion to come to. I think that's my main issue, is that the premise had the potential to be clever and a complex insight to human nature, but the dialogue often came across as unnatural, the 'mystery' was revealed to be guess work, and for a commentary on life, was very out of touch with how humans actually act. I decided to write a review as I actually enjoyed a lot of the show, the actors were great, I was invested in the characters and their outcomes, and I do recommend the watch, just for their talent alone. This is a great series if you want something interesting to watch, but don't want to pay attention to the details.",

            "review_title": "A wasted opportunity",
            "content": "The main idea behind the show, that everyone is capable of murder given the right circumstances, is a concept that David Tennant's fan will be extremely familiar with because Alec Hardy expresses that same thought in Broadchurch, though the circumstances there are entirely different. Anyone interested in human psychology and deviant behaviour would be attracted to the idea, as I was. Unfortunately, what surrounds it is at times hard to describe.There are a number of issues connected to the plot. First of all, there's the convicted prisoner's angle - suspension of disbelief is something that I can do, but not when you are adding a number of problematic and impossible-to-believe elements on top of each other, layering them until there's very little left that the viewer can believe.To give a minute and non-spoilery element as a focal point to this, let's look into the fact that Dillon Kempton (played by Atkins Estimond) is told to be Grieff's (played by Stanley Tucci) recorder because he has eidetic memory, and as such remembers every conversation he's ever witnessed forever. While it is a common misconception perpetrated by shows such as Inside Man, who happily misconstrue true facts to suit their purposes, a simple search on wikipedia would tell Moffat that: a) eidetic memory is connected to visual, not auditory information, b) that the length of time for which the information is recorded is not indefinite, and c) it is mostly recorded in children and not in adults. (A short, and scientific valid read that could clarify point (c) at the very least, and in some small measure point (a) can be found on Scientific American, though it cannot be linked here).The one above is, admittedly, a small detail, but it is by no means the only one. Indeed, the plot seems to be built on altogether unsteady and contrived elements, making the plot itself untenable.Characters and dialogue might rank higher than the plot, but at times they also fall short.We are meant to strongly emphasise with Janice (played by Dolly Wells), but from the get go I was unable to do so. This is not, as far as I'm concerned, the actress' fault, but simply the way the character was written and the way she speaks. As a woman myself, I did not once feel the need to protect her; she makes a string of choices which are wrong not just mistakenly but willfully, she forces characters who are good into making terrible decisions, and this, I think, corrupts the entire point of the plot. The 'right circumstances' are corrupted from the premise until they become a parody of themselves.Another point against characters is connected to Edgar (played by Mark Quartley) and his mother Hilda (played by Tilly Vosburgh). The relationship there and the circumstances surrounding Edgar's character could have been exploited further (in fact, they could have been the pivotal focus of a much better show), but were only depicted as plot points to advance the story without any real investigation.A number of characters also appeared to advance the plot at different points, but brought no further depth to the show. Questions around them were often posed but found no answer. As any amateur writer will tell you, you only ask a question, if you later give the answer.Positive points do exist, but they're mostly external to the writing. There are solid performances (I was especially impressed by Louis Oliver, who plays Ben in the show; his character goes through a rather difficult evolution, but he manages to make it convincing), and the music and photography are well-suited to bring out the dichotomy between the rural, British landscape and the criminal reality of a USA death row; the play of lights, especially, and the intense focus on showing heat and sweat on the prisoners are strong elements to give characters more depth and realism than they probably would with just the dialogue and the story to sustain them.Overall, however, I feel like I came to the show because of David Tennant and stayed exactly for the same reason, so I would not really recommend this show to anyone.",

I know people are on a big Tucci kick these days, but this is not his best work. He's not BAD, but his performance of this role is nothing more than adequate. He leans into the melodrama, striving unsuccessfully to be as interesting as Anthony Hopkins playing Hannibal Lecter. But I expect he'll get nominations and wins because he's trendy right now. David Tenant is decent. The lesser-known cast is adequate though annoying at moments-that's probably more the writing than acting quality, though.

I watched the first episode without the conviction of turning this on again.Several days passed and I am sitting over the second one now, because I am in the mood to look sth., not totally boring (hard to find) and I like Tennants performance and the suspense build up with Tucci's character (after you hear a case, you want to know what happened - but this is mainly because of nosiness than because of intricate cases). Again, I am annoyed of the general stupidity.So, how could I rate this? 1 point for the acting, 1 point for suspense, - hm, already getting thin now -, it looks quite well, so I can add one more point for that.All in all, I had expected more.",

However, I didn't find the end in logical progression with the characters and a bit too constructed. I was also missing some plot twists that I had the feeling were indirectly hinted towards here and there.Also, the self righteous tone in which Mr. Grieff emphasizes that all are murderous got a bit dull after some time.

The whole story revolved around this dilemma, from start to finnish, so it being unbeliveable was critical.The story also seemed coarsed, only to hammer in the creator's point, which was repeated over an over again by Stanley Tucci's character, it just felt didcatict. It reminiscent ideas from silence of the lambs, sherlock holmes and a bit of sweeny tod, all done poorly. The writing for Tucci was really bad, he acted like a Sherlock/ Hanibal -knock off, and that's before I knew the creator did Sherlock the tv show as well. He just acted like a pompous know it all, blowing clues in the air for his dummer counterpart, in a really ridiculous way.Over all the show seemed to enjoy toying with the viewer's preception at the expense of making a good story, one that makes sense. The toying part was also contradictory, I'm supposed to identify with the regular man who got sucked into a horrible situation, in order to explore the premis that \"every one can be a killer, depending on the situation\", yet the woman's behaviour was so unrealistic, it took all the air out of doing so. And I was rationalising her at the beginning.I also hated how they made the serial killer into a cute endearing comic relief, I didn't buy into the attempts of balancing it with mentioning his heinous acts. All the topics the show attempted to handle where done soo poorly, it made me think there's nothing to it but relishing on murderers.

The repetitive dialogue undermined any cleverness I could've felt. The tone and pacing are bizarre. I had to watch it on 1.25x speed by the second episode because the slow pacing, probably meant to stew tension, was just maddening to watch. Just because it's tense doesn't mean it's good!Things the characters say contradict what is apparent on the screen and we're just supposed to go along with it? For instance, Grieff's sidekick remarks that he can tell Grieff likes the journalist based off his verbosity, but to the viewer it seems like he just talked as he normally does.

For sure not realistic, had alot of fun watching. Its also a serie to watch together, my wife enjoyed it for sure. Only the last minute, as a cliff hanger to the second season, could have been better. Even though i cannot wait and im hoping on a second season to come any time soon.",

This is where I started to feel like the writers were a bit lazy and I didn't like that.The castings were perfect. Stanley Tucci as the death row detective and David Tennant as the troubles Vicar nailed their characters in every respect. The visuals were stunning, although some shots felt repititive where there were opportunities to be more creative.

I also choose willingly to watch this through to the end so I would argue that there's think there's some version of this story that might have worked (everyone's a murderer, crime-solving detective on death row, Vicar torn between his religious convictions and protecting his son yadda yadda). What I unfortunately can't look past however is how fundamentally and completely unbelievable the story is. Unbelievable is even too weak a word with a story that takes place in an unapologetically cartoon-like universe where the plot in large part revolves around a door that has been assigned by the writer the magical property of not propagating any sound (not even through it's keyhole that is later explicitly tapped over as part of the plot). The character's decisions feel like they were chosen by a machine learning algorithm programmed to select out of all possible decisions whichever would maximise the length of the plot and I would say that reflects the precise strategy Steven wrote this story with. This story is formulated, not crafted. It's like how some when some AI's reach a no-win scenario, they keep playing because haven't been programmed with respect for the opponent's intelligence and that's really the fundamental problem with this story. It doesn't realise that its audience have a higher standard of realism than what it's aiming for. There are a number of moments in this story that considered in isolation are so completely ridiculous that it boggles belief as to how Steven didn't realised that he must have written something incredibly silly to get there.I might have given this a 6/10 if a moment towards the end of the final episode hadn't made me actively angry when a character fundamentally fails to redeem themself or even shown the barest amount of intelligence in learning from their own mistakes.",

But lazy writing decisions to advance this already hard to believe plot just makes this whole show horrific to watch. If the Tutor had just remained calm and didn't go completely nutty. While yes, it would be a startling discovery, any investigation would've proved innocence of the Vicar. The introduction of the plot is just all around horrendous. And it only gets worse. Stanley Tucci's character is a a bigger Mary Sue than Sherlock and Batman. At least they use logic and have the materials needed to make those leaps in conclusions. Sending people to places at exact times, running a secret inside prison fbi level? Come on. The Reporter not calling 911 when the Wife cut her? It's just idiocy. She mocked the lady with the knife, at her missing friends apartment that's the reason the whole story exists a. So she could run into traffic and kill herself?. DUMB. I'm a firm believer in the suspension of disbelief, but it can only take you so far. And with every plot point just becoming more and more unbelievable it seems like this whole story is a crumbling tower of Jenga blocks trying to play a game of jenga in another jenga tower, equally falling apart. The only good scene is when the Vicar helped Edgar. Of course he's a dirtbag, and deserves what he got, however. If the story had maintained that projectory, it would've easily been Emmy Worthy. Forget the whole Prison thing, make Stanley Tucci an American PI Who goes to the church. Or hell, Stanley Tucci could ace any role given to him, make him whoever. The investigative journalist could interview the new PI character, and the point of the Vicar crossing that line of becoming a murderer (which he doesn't do) because of him going through a bad day would actually pay off. Also Dillon is the best character. David Tenant did well for what he was given to work with. The wife was entertaining at times. The tutor was good except for being the reason the awful story escalated the way it did. All the actors did well. But the story and direction was big doo doo. 5/10.",

As a comment on 'even the best of us can make terrible decisions', the story was completely unbelievable for me to take seriously.

The length was appropriate, watching it felt like a longer movie.It ends on a cliffhanger, so I hope that means more episodes or a new mini season.

No reason explanation why Janice was so awful, no explanation as to why the convict chopped his wife's head off 'once you find her head you'll know why I killed her'. That wasn't explained. Why did the convict have a serial killer with him as his helper. As for the main plot.....one of the worst things I've seen for a while and if a 2nd season is made I will not give it my time.

Yes, dumb things happen in real life and people will make dumb choices under duress.It's just that last episode that is a complete mess for me. A couple of the highlights of what make this last episode a terrible writing masterclass:\n-Gas Leak Poisoning makes you murder a woman\n-Scene where a person runs into the street in a panic and gets hit by a car\n-Phone calls where simply saying some words would have solved all problems.The conclusion of it all: \"Anyone can be a murderer\" is super weak and it would have been more surprising if the conclusion was that they decided not to go through with it and that leading to Tucci having to review his own choices. Because anyone CAN become a murderer, but it is a choice they make.It was such a miss for me this last episode, while I loved the rest. I even loved the little teaser on the end, I want to know more about Tucci's character and if there would be more I'd watch it.But all-in-all it just never got to a good conclusion and these characters were so strong, that when they act out of character it sticks out as a sore thumb:-Tenant never was dispicable enough to give that rant he gives at the end, it just felt out of character.Pfife is smart enough to realize that when the son keeps being completely surprised by her reaction to the porn, that the vicar might have been telling the truth, same for the reason he would let her listen to the suicide note, would that not be a crazy thing to do if you expect it to go the way it went.-The mom basically becomes a bad comedy trope in the last episode.It's all so freaking bad, like someone had a stroke writing the last episode.

The journalist has a friend that was trapped by a vicar after finding child porn in a usb stick. Well, a member of the vicars congregation? Maybe? Gave him that usb stick to hold on to for him.THIS CAN ALL BE SOLVED IN 5 MINUTES\nThey managed to stretch this over 4 episodes.The only redeeming characteristic of this show is the acting. But I often found myself yelling at the TV because these characters watched 1 episode of CSI.But the incredulous demeanor of all the characters towards the incident drove me insane.",

David Tennant, Dolly Wells, Lydia West, Lyndsey Marshal, and Stanley Tucci all gave excellent performances.my favorite character came from Atkins Estimond, his character of Dillion had me laughing in almost every scene. It doesn't need seem to make any sense but in the end it does. I really enjoyed the story. Stephen Moffat's scripts always entertain. If you were the vicar, What would you do? So take it from there and realize the vicar has himself in a bad situation.",

            "content": "You gotta just roll with it being completely implausible and realize it was written this way. When you do, you'll see the humor and the brilliance of it. The build up from each episode is done very well. It starts out being very serious, and slowly you start questioning the writers and what the heck they were thinking, until for me in the 3rd episode you're ready to just give up on it and turn it off, when it clicks.... And now you just wanna watch this train wreck all the way through. Basically, whatever a normal rational human being would decide to do given the circumstances.... The characters will just do the opposite. It's definitely not predictable!",
