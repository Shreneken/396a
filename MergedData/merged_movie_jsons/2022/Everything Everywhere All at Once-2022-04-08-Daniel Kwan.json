            "content": "\"Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on.\"If only we could recognize that those who combat us in life do so out of hidden pain, and fight them with kindness. If only we could accept our kids for who they are, and say supportive things from the heart instead of trying to mold them. If only we could be content with the life we have, and set aside the idea of the countless other lives we might have led, had we made different decisions along the way. If only we could see that the flipside to life being meaningless and everything ultimately being sucked into the abyss is the freedom that comes from that, that we can do anything with the time we've got.Like the first word in its title, this film feels like everything. While watching it I thought Stephanie Hsu was everything too, but then again, so was Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The homage to Wong Kar-Wai with Ke Huy Quan making his enlightened speech is extraordinary, and the fact that James Hong was still getting it done at age 93 was wonderful. I also loved how both mother and daughter, troubled as they were with their upbringing, each found comfort in a kind and patient partner, and Tallie Medel's character was a nice touch.The film threatens to go off the rails with its madcap multiverse hopping in the first part, but it's all a setup for the second part, which is incredibly powerful. It was impressive that it managed to be so entertaining along the way, with its fast-paced action and the wild ride it takes us on. It's one that rewards a rewatch to, as its full of little details and references. Just a great film, lots of fun, and from the heart.",

Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.\"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the \"Indiana Jones\" movies).Grade: A.",

The answer to that question seems to be 'this one', Everything Everywhere All At Once having been nominated in eleven categories at the 2023 Academy Awards. I'm beginning to wonder if I've somehow slipped into an alternate reality where a film's worth is measured by how quirky, irritating and baffling it is.I believe that this film's success is down to viewers not wanting to admit that they don't 'get' it - \"It's A24, and that means it's intellectual, and if I say I don't understand it everyone will think I am stupid\". Well I think you're stupid for playing along.So what's the film about? Well, Michelle Yeoh plays laundromat owner Evelyn Wang, who discovers that the universe is made up of infinite parallel realities, each one different, and that an evil force is attempting to... ah, who am I kidding? I can't sum up this film. I tried to follow the plot, but there's so much random crap crammed into the excruciatingly tedious 139 minutes, all edited so as to induce a migraine, that I soon found myself struggling, not just to understand the plot, but to stay watching till the end.I get that the film is attempting to say something profound about life -- being happy with the choices that we have made, having no regrets, and accepting others for who they are -- but it's hard to give a toss about any of that when faced with such relentless codswallop.Rant over, I'm off to try and find a universe where this film doesn't exist.",

            "content": "It was my brother who recommended I watch this movie. He said it's crazy, but every time he thought to stop watching it, something else would happen to hold his attention. That wasn't quite my experience although I did stick with it to the end. I was also reminded of an almost identical experience some 20 years or so ago when a friend took me along with him to see a film he was raving about, \"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\" and that missed me by miles too when all that levitational martial-arts stuff started.Well, I couldn't get into \"Crouching...\" and I'm afraid it was the same for the sensory overload that was \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\". Go with the flow, sit back and let it happen is probably the best way to approach it but in the end, it was all too much for me.I sort of get the idea of multiple universes, where different versions of ourselves play out different destinies independent of what's actually happening to us in the here and now. Here though, the worlds are about to disastrously collide due to the emergence of an intergalactic super-criminal and it seems the first line of defence is Michelle Yeoh's unlikely middle-aged laundry owner Evelyn whose only concern when we first meet her is to get an almost unrecognisable Jamie-Lee Curtis's hulking auditor to sign off on the business's annual accounts and so keep her in business. Her dull husband then takes this moment to reveal that he's an alternative version of himself from what he calls the Alphaverse and that they are about to have the fight of their lives to try to thwart the approaching big bad super-villain whose identity I'll hold back from revealing.And that's your condensed plot. There are lots of characters straddling the universes you'd barely noticed earlier who suddenly drop back in and out of what I'll loosely call the narrative. Just when you think you've got a reasonable grip of one plot strand, it completely unravels and takes you in another direction.I certainly saw things I've never seen before or ever will again in a movie, including characters with hot-dog hands, a bagel as the centre of human knowledge, two inanimate rocks sharing a conversation and then there are the spoofs drawn from original features like \"2001\" and \"Ratatouille\" two films I didn't think I'd ever bracket in the same sentence.I also found the several attempts at humour to often be way too crude and vulgar for my taste, especially when you get two of the villains looking to boost their powers by sticking a sharp object up their behinds or another baddie getting knocked about by a set of male genitalia.Good luck to you if you managed to comprehend and actually enjoy this movie, but in the end I'm afraid it overpowered me into resistance. Maybe it was just some giant spoof of all those superhero blockbusters which have obsessed Hollywood for years. I don't know, but despite its successful box-office and the ratings here, I sort of wish that for two hours at least, I'd woken up in an alternative universe where I actually hadn't watched it at all.",

In IMDb, it is informed that this flick is nominated for 10 BAFTA Awards, 240 wins and 351 nominations. I can only understand that this is a heard behavior to the promotion of studio, using \"professional critics\" and press to promote such a garbage. I cannot envision a normal being, without financial interest or being manipulated by critics, to enjoy this crap. It seems to be a bad trip of the writers turned into a movie by insane productors. In the end, this film is 2h 19 min of complete waste of time. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brail): \"Tudo em Todo Lugar ao Mesmo Tempo\" (\"Everything Everywhere All at Once\")",

There's also some niggle with their daughter and her father is a constant source of belittlement and scorn. Now Waymond wants a divorce. Could things have turned out differently for Evelyn, maybe in a parallel universe?The plot summary for this movie intrigued me immensely: the idea of exploring how things might work out if you'd plotted a different course or, more broadly, the idea of parallel realities. The actual product, however, is far less engaging or coherent.The lack of engagement begins immediately. The Wangs' everyday life is a manic, unfocussed existence and just following this for the first 20 minutes or so was fairly annoying. It doesn't get any better once the multiverse concept is introduced, this just being an excuse for random detours and well-choreographed but meaningless action scenes.It's like a typical pretentious concept-driven sci fi/fantasy movie: paper over the lack of plot with a concept and developments that are so radical and in-your-face that viewers are fooled into thinking there's something clever there, when there isn't. Then, to make it seem even more important, have the movie go for 140 minutes when 100 minutes would have been sufficient.Every now and again there is a profound moment but due to the preceding scenes being all empty random action there's no context and the impact is diluted.Disappointing.",

The film is currently a Top 250 IMDb picture with an 8.2 rating, and rarely do I stray too far from the generally considered opinion, but this was just a chore to sit through. Not only that, but if you fell asleep for any length of time before it was over it wouldn't have made any difference at all, you wouldn't have missed a beat. In fact, the first time I saw 'The End' pop up on screen, it would have been okay with me.What I can say perhaps in defense of the film is that it truly lives up to its name because it does try to be everything, everywhere, all at once. For me, not a good thing. It was as if you took any number of random ideas and concepts and threw them into a blender to see what came out. For example, green eggs and ham, Topo Gigio, e=mc squared, pineapple pizza, and squirrel nut zippers. See how easy it is? I can't tell you how many times I said to myself, 'Please God, let this be over'.I guess I'd have to give credit to the film makers at least for an ambitious editing job with the picture's all too frequent scene changes and skip jumps from one thing to another. But I can't help but feel that the sentimental ending was supposed to help you forget what you just went through. And oddly enough, I was able to follow the main story line well enough, but it took forever to make its point, which if I had to summarize, would be:Be kind - even if my review isn't.",

Nice effort visually - my rating id higher than I feel it should be, but the visuals were often witty, so...5.Overall, I had to force myself to see entire film, and it was painful.

It's bursting with so many original, weird concepts and ideas that no serious storyteller in their right mind would ever dare to put in their movie. But Daniels did. And it works with spectacularly effective results.These filmmakers choose not only to put every bizarre idea they could think of into their movie, but they ensure that every oddity adds something to the thought-provoking, emotionally resonant themes that pervade the story. So many angles can be explored surrounding this story of emotional connection and the things that distract from it.As Evelyn connects with her alternate selves and alternate relatives, there is both envy of and pity toward them that is explored. It's such a cathartic experience to watch this woman discover what she truly wants from life and loves about her life.All of the beautiful themes and heartwarming character moments are just the tip of the iceberg here, though. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.The Daniels lean into the absurdity of the world that they have created, always reaching for the most outlandish possibilities and never playing it safe. It makes for some truly outstanding visual gags that will never leave my mind., and it makes for the most unique viewing experience I have ever had in my life.This is a masterpiece of originality.

Some of the characters were outright annoying such as the daughter and the various minions. The hubby was OK as he smoothly switched personalities. Good old James Hong still with us, always recall him as \"hey that guy...\". Jamie Lee Curtis is fine as the IRS Auditor hamming it up.

            "content": "This was a long and unnecessarily complex film to get you the message that life and people are messy and you should accept them for who they are. I would have preferred a more straightforward story telling and I could have done without all of the body humor...putting things forcibly in one's anus, ball gag humor, hot dog fingers, eating buggers, etc. I didn't even find that type of humor amusing as a child.The only scene I even remotely enjoyed in this film was the straightforward scene towards the end of the film when Evelyn and Waymond are not together and he explains that he knows she thinks he is weak, but he is fighting in a different way, with kindness. That short but sweet moment is in my opinion, the only redeeming aspect of this film.I have heard some reviewers rave about how this was like the best acid trip...I can't comment on that since I have never done acid and I have no intention of ever trying it, especially since as a healthcare worker I know and understand the very real dangers of doing acid. I will say that I do not watch films to experience an acid trip, I watch films to be entertained and preferably with a good story.This story essentially boils down to a struggling small business owner (laundromat), is being audited by the IRS, not having a good relationship with her husband who has decided to ask for a divorce hoping to just get her to talk about their marriage, and she has a struggling gay daughter who she is avoiding telling her father who didn't accept her marital decision about. Suddenly ta-da, she discovers that there are all these other universes that are populated with other versions of her that made different choices...like didn't marry her husband and didn't move to America. Also, she is the only person uniquely qualified to save this multiverse by tapping into skills from other universes versions. And she is saving it from the big bad who turns out to be her daughter who she created....and her \"everything bagel\".I'd say it was ridiculous, but not once did I laugh and I kind of agree with the viewers who said when they saw \"the end\" on the screen for the first time that would have been happy if that was truly the end.I am sorry. I love both Michelle Yeoh AND Jamie Lee Curtis and would really like to support films anchored by strong female characters...but this film isn't one I can get behind. (Although the message, about being kind and accepting...l am 100% behind! If you can choose to do one thing, be kind is my motto.) Along that line, I think it would be kind to recommend a different film with a \"be kind\" message...how about \"It's a Wonderful Life\".",

Clearly I am not the target-audience--I have little patience for films that claim to be \"smart\" by the sheer amount of confusion they cause--but a movie hailed by many as \"nearly perfect\" is hardly watchable.For most of the first 30 min, I felt assaulted by the sheer barrage of sounds and visuals which made very little coherent sense.

Half of the time I don't know what are they fighting for or what the heck is going on. And what was supposed to be the multiverse just felt like the characters were wearing silly different costumes.

Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!If there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.Verdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We're only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year! Sorry, summer blockbuster movies!",

            "content": "It was everything everywhere all at once. Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.Obviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.Oh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He's older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh's baby daddy in this joint.Last and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that's what you do when you have legends do your flick.Speaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.The fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.It's interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that's about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What's even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter looks like she's possibly in her early 20s. Don't know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)The music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she's going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I'm watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!I say it's good. It's all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on.",

            "content": "Rarely does a movie hit me hard and I go along for the ride. Every moment has a spectacle to it. Even the simplicity of having your taxes done. Often silly, mostly confusing but entirely entertaining. It was great to see Short Round back on the big screen with a very glamoured down Michelle Yeoh as a married couple on the brink of fracturing a family unit.The story is of, Evelyn, a woman who has never really committed to much in life. She has many interest but many where she isn't fully invested in. In this case, her family lives above the laundromat that is failing. They are being audited, but yet she has big dreams to expand her enterprise. Her husband (the fore mentioned Ke Huy Quan) Waymond, is a kindly follower and believer of his wife who seems to focus more on the bad than the good. Pessimist, if we are to be formal. It is the Chinese New Year, and many people are invited to celebrate with this family, including a Grand-Father who is labeled as a man set in his ways and wouldn't understand the same-sex relationship of his grandaughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). What follows is a grand adventure, first at the IRS building (of all places) and eventually to distant alternate universes to which shows her the way her life may have gone had certain things didn't take place. I absolutely loved the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis plays the uptight auditor, who seems perfectly fine in the core universe to which all revolve around. Evelyn, on the other hand, taps into her other universes to gather the skills needed to fight a fracture in the timelines that sneak into her mundane life.Yes, there is a message here. And...to be honest, it nearly derails the film itself. But it was required to tie in the meaning of everything that is going on. That we are made of experiences of every universe that exists out there (if you believe in metaphysics) and that they road you didn't take, through gained experiences, with some that even was more enticing then the present one, means we would never have known our other lives. Children wouldn't be born, love would be lost, relationships move on. It is the grand question of whether or not if we got a glimpse of that road we didn't take, would it all mean anything. In this case, I say it almost derails because the universes effect one another. And in this story, it even bridges them. Which to some, may feel like a cheat. However, the fact that I even ask this question makes it a vastly interesting story. That is for you to decide.The movie is exciting, vibrant, energetic and feels absolutely unique. It allows the viewer to slowly tie the ends together, and perhaps sometimes gets too far ahead. But doesn't let you lose yourself too much. What it isn't is boring. It is captivating and fresh. And, look, who can hate a scene of people being beaten with rubber phalluses?That said, it is one of the most interesting movies of 2022 and hopefully stays in the minds of awards in the future. Because it deserves a bigger audience. These are the types of fun, philosophical questions buoyed by comedy that we need.I go back to Ke Huy Quan. This guy can do funny and also bring a tug to your heart so easily. It's so hard to imagine him as the little boy from \"Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom\" because, here he shows so much range. His natural charm is shown through his love for Evelyn. He seems to be suffering through a fracture himself. He plays many roles here as well. Because, in many universes in life, the theory here may be that we will run into people we are meant to run into regardless of choices. That's a very romanticized view on the universe.Kudos to The Daniels for their talent and joy of cinema. It would not surprise me if they helm a larger film in the future. Perhaps they can re-vamp a comic book franchise into something much more unique.Thank you for this movie.",

Basically, it's a crap film.Let me explain why it's crap.Firstly you have no clue what's coming but a couple of middle aged Chinese taking their laundry receipts to the IRS to face a bulldoggish middle aged woman who makes uninteresting speeches about their receipts is NOT interesting. Neither is the fast talk in the elevator which still does not really explain anything and I found it to be confusing.Then what is all that about a divorce? Are they divorcing? Why? What has this to do with the film?Then suddenly the security come and her husband turns into a King Fu killer taking them all down with a scarf, before IRS lady staples something (unknown) to her head and attacks them. All the while phone earpieces that glow green are chucked about and laundry woman goes is seemingly magically transported from place to place, talking about her dog and her IRS bill and her divorce.Utter, rubbish. Pure and perfect trash. I was actually irritable at not being able to see what everyone is banging on about. It's not a great film, it's an awful one.

Allowing for that though, this movie bursts at the seams in being everything all at once, sequentially that is, in two-dimensions trying to project a four-dimensional reality and a multitude of parallel universes that all include Michelle Yeoh in some form or fashion. This movie definitely breaks through to a new level of sci fi visual delight and sophistication along with a strong storyline.

It is about a woman doing her taxes, technically, but branches off in a variety of ways that make this an action/adventure/absurdist comedy/fantasy/science-fiction/family drama all in one.All the tones and all the genres are balanced perfectly. It's masterfully written and overflowing with creativity. The editing is unbelievable and all the elements work together so well. It has some of the funniest and silliest scenes I've seen in ages that mesh perfectly well with some genuinely touching dramatic moments, and it has characters you really come to care for.The action delivers, too, and there's just the right amount of it. I love how thrillingly strange the film is for a while, then you begin to make sense of it, and then it just keeps expertly piling more and more layers on, and does so over a fast-paced 139 minutes in a way where it never actually falls apart. Also: it has some of the best film references/parodies I've ever seen, for sure.All the acting is fantastic, too, and everyone understood the insane vision the directors were trying to achieve, and played their parts perfectly. Michelle Yeoh is maybe the best she's ever been here, and Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, and Jamie Lee Curtis are all great too.Maybe original ideas are becoming harder and harder to come by, but for as long as movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once are coming out, the medium of film will never be truly artistically bankrupt. There have been movies that have tackled some of the ideas here before, but never in a way that's this creative, this funny, and this exciting, and the way it takes its outlandish premise and ties it to real life + real world + relatable emotions is so incredibly clever.I haven't seen every movie of the 2020s of course, but as of writing this, this is my favourite movie of the 2020s so far.

It is vulgar, repetitive, derivative with not one fresh idea or execution. It feels like it is a parody of something, like the Matrix, perhaps. But even as parody it fails because most of the attempts are humor are cringey at best, vulgarly offensive at worst.What a letdown. I was hoping for an intelligent take on the multiverse, or to be impressed by fresh ideas. Instead I got a infantile potty humor Kung Fu Hustle, that goes nowhere.But the worst part of this terrible movie? The characters. Or lack of them. The whole movie is so preoccupied with explaining its Universe and jumping from fight to fight, that it forgets to have engaging characters that are something more than rebellious teenage daughter, worried mom and submissive husband.I can't remember a movie that had such a promising trailer, letting me down this bad.For those who have not seen it, a warning I wish I had: if your hopes for this movie goes above having a buttplug fight, and someone putting snot into someone's mouth, recalibrate those expectations.

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. It's bonkers, I tell ya'! Co-writers and co-directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, known collectively (by their choice) as \"Daniels\", follow up their 'farting corpse movie' SWISS ARMY MAN (2016) with one that is somehow more bizarre, more audacious, and more fun. It's one of the most innovative films I've seen in a while, and although I can point out influences, I've yet to come up with a movie comparison that seems just or fair.Every small business owner can relate to the stress Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) is under as she attempts to organize her documents in preparation for an IRS audit of the laundromat she owns with her husband Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan). As if that's not enough, her father is scheduled to arrive the same day. She knows Gong Gong (James Hong) is disappointed in his daughter for the husband and life she chose. And while being crushed with those two events, Evelyn's strained relationship with her daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) continues to fracture as Evelyn wants to keep Joy's girlfriend status with Becky (Tallie Medel) a secret from dear old conservative dad/grandfather.That's just about the end of the \"normal\" part of the story, other than Waymond has had divorce papers prepared, not for the purpose of ending the marriage, but with the hope that the threat might force Evelyn to have a real conversation with him about their relationship. Things start to get weird even before they head to the IRS meeting with an agent played with gusto by Jamie Lee Curtis, but while there, we get our first real taste of the fantastical trip we (and Evelyn) are about to take. Of course, I can't really offer any description of the action that occurs, but nothing is spoiled if I tell you that some characters cross multiple dimensions and universes in an attempt to 'save the world'. While doing this, they mix in some acrobatic martial arts that would make Jackie Chan envious.It's the rare film where the frenetic pace of dialogue keeps pace with breakneck action sequences. A fanny pack, trophies with an unfortunate shape, and blue-tooth type devices all play unusual roles here, and this film challenges everyone from the actors to the directors to the editors to the fight coordinators. You'll likely recognize Evelyn's husband as the grown-up version of the child actor who played Short Round in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984), and daughter Joy is portrayed by Stephanie Hsu (a contributor to \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\"), who gets to cover just about the widest range of character we've likely ever seen on screen. The estimable James Hong is a riot as Gong Gong. Mr. Hong is now 93 years old with an incredible canon of 450 credits in his 8 decades of work. His presence is quite crucial to the film. It should also be noted that, as we would expect, Jenny Slate shines in her brief role as \"Big Nose\", a regular customer at the laundromat.As terrific as the cast is, this is really a chance for Michelle Yeoh to bring her full arsenal to the role of Evelyn. She's angry, frustrated, scared, courageous, and even adds her comic timing. Ms. Yeoh flashes her CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON fighting skills, while also brining a regal presence to a film that requires a strong core. It's no mystery that family and love can solve many of the world's issues, and Daniels have delivered a wild ride that defies simple description. It's a long one at 139 minutes, but you'll thank me later for not saying much more than ... it's bonkers!Opens in select markets on March 25 and April 1, 2022 and nationwide on April 8, 2022.",

This is a movie that morphs from immigrant drama to sci fi to Kung Fu to comedy to existential art flick and back again. Then it does that loop again, faster and faster and faster, without ever losing the audience. I saw it in a packed theater, everyone laughing and crying and caring. Perhaps most amazingly, this was a pretty simple and effective relationship story through it all. I don't know if I would rather watch it again right now or watch a documentary about how the film took shape. Either way, I'm glad it exists. I lamented multiverse stories after the last MCU film, and I guess I have to take that back now. It is possible to tell wildly imaginative genre bending multiverse stories. You just don't need superheroes to do it (unless you count the Daniels).",

Scenes drag on and on and when they're over you're still no further to any semblance of plot clarity than you were 10 minutes earlier. It seems like they shot tonnes of footage and just wanted to include it all, without really embellishing the actual story. If the movie was more succinct and arrived more quickly at the overall point of the narrative, that being her connection with her daughter, I would have liked it a lot more.I just really don't understand why producers and writers are electing their films to be these immense lengths these days when they really don't need to be. No Way Home, Don't Look Up, Licorice Pizza, Drive My Car, all over 2 hours for no good reason.I really felt the length of this movie was to the detriment of the overall narrative and it disallowed me appreciating what the message was meant to be.That being said, the direction and editing was cool, acting was strong and the scene at the end with the daughter really did hit all the right notes.

Instead it is scene after scene, and way too many of them... AND contains some of the most stupid, long, drawn-out and boring, nonsensical scenes. Without being cruel in any way I can honestly say it gives one the feeling the movie was filmed and edited by someone who has a very, very short attention span.I was curious about it when I read the description but not enough to want to view it. I happened to be watching my favourite talk show host, Graham Norton, the evening that Jamie Lee Curtis was a guest. After hearing Jamie and Graham both rave about how the movie is so good, surprisingly unexpected and incredible it then grabbed my interest. Jamie actually moaning 'oh it's so good'... 'oh it's so good'... 'oh it's so incredibly good'. Jamie went on to describe the movie to be multi-verse but at the center of it she said there is love, kindness, family and unity. I didn't pick up on the feelings if they existed. Another part that I didn't see was Jamie's description of a certain scene as being one of the most moving parts of the movie. I watched the scene but anything moving just moved right over me. And there is talk of Oscars for this thing?... The only Oscar that should be handed out, and deserved, is for Jamie's near orgasmic representation she gave on Graham's show, 'oh it's so good'... 'oh it's so good'... 'oh it's so incredibly good'. That turned out to be the best bit of acting I have seen in a long time. I believed it. But it is NOT so good...it is not even a little bit good.",

Her daughter, Stephanie Hsu, has a girlfriend, which she cannot explain to her father.

She is the worst version of herself. Naturally, she is confused, particularly when she discovers that the ultimate evil that threatens all realities is her daughter.It certainly gives Miss Yeoh a chance to stretch her acting muscles and the editing is wonderful. This sort of story is an enjoyable \"wheels of time\" story, and tackles the nihilism at the heart of the subgenre: if every decision you make was decided differently in another universe, what difference does it make?My cousin enjoyed most of it but thought the ending sentimental.

Really bad. Like, seriously bad.Average mom Evelyn is doing her taxes and a man from another universe tells her she is THE ONE. This takes 51 minutes. Five-one. If we take as a comparison a film that this film totally isn't completely inspired from, at 51 minutes we already have the Morpheus - Neo fight scene, we are already in the meat of the story.Throughout the film, the dialogues rapidly switch between subtitled Chinese, and non-subtitled English, forcing me to switch back to subtitles often within a single line of dialogue, because - i know this is gonna sound weird - I DO NOT SPEAK CHINESE.Eventually the.protagonist discovers that she can jump between existences where she is a different person; in addition, other characters from other realities can invade their own character in another reality, with most of the film having one character suddenly jump to being a completely different character.I mean, we would normally criticize a film that fails in keeping a tone, but here EE seems to be proud to have, as the title implies, every style of film, all at once. It randomly jumps between different types of comedy, adult drama, teen drama, surreal, serious action, joke action, uplifiting, romcom, as someone who has made a bad mistake and refuses to own up to it.There is supposed to be also a villain, and i would easily rate EE as having one of the worst villains ever put to film, the protagonist's own daughter, whose complete lack of acting skill is only matched by the villain's propensity of lines that shout \"i'm so villain, i'm SO villain\".Everything Everywhere is a film that could only be made worse if the filmmakers actually had any filmmaking skills, because it tries to be pretentious, but can't even aspire to any level of pretentiousness.Instead, it's slow, boring, badly, BADLY written, with absolutely no sense of any of the primary filmmaking tools, such as a coherent narrative, a protagonist the viewer can relate to, consistent, reliable characters, but instead just like Abe's stories, starts somewhere, winds up somewhere completely unrelated, that we're not interested in, has no reason to have ever gone there, and in the end just wasted our time.My final vote: 5/10 - just watch Shaolin Soccer instead.",

            "content": "This movie was awful man... I gotta say i just watched it and couldn't even get halfway through it.... none of it makes sense it's boring it attempts to make incredibly stale moments suspenseful by playing crazy music super loud for like 3 seconds for no reason and then it'll just be them looking at one another threw the security cam or from across the room. What an original story about a Failing Laundromat and having a Lesbian daughter \ud83d\ude10. Watching this film might be what it's like if a person was secretly slipped a hit of acid at a party or worse, at just some random point in their life and not told anything about what is about to happen to them.Instead of enjoying the ride, I was aggravated at the lack of a storyline. What happens next is just as broken and detached as what has been happening throughout all the previous scenes. If you get that much out of it then yeah, you're probably halfway there...I think.So if you're hoping for any consistency or something remotely comprehendible, be warned there aren't going to be any guardrails to grab onto here. You might as well accept that you will be consistently confused and possibly as upset as I was by the violence, but seemingly violence without much in the way of any purpose or meaning. Violence for violence sake? I don't know, didn't get it and now...I no longer care.WARNING: Among the bizzarro content (which constitutes the entire film) you'll be thoroughly molested both intellectually and sexually by radical butt plug action on par with the most violent fisting episode ever imaginable. Better think twice before bringing children of any age to view this disgusting.If this sort of thing appeals to you, knock yourself out. I'm a firm believer that there is a movie out there for just about everyone. This one should bring total satisfaction to those who have fully hated all the films I ever saw and could actually enjoy.I hated this movie. The dialog was juvenile, the cinematography sucked, the story was asinine and the acting was so bad.",

            "content": "This much lauded hotchpotch of absurdist humour and narrative chaos starts out promisingly by introducing us to a Chinese-American family who run a laundromat and are being audited by the IRS. Once we meet the IRS inspector Deirdre (wonderfully played by Jamie Lee Curtis), the film launches its concept of several simultaneously existing multiverses, and how our protagonists have learned to jump between them in order to fight that eternal battle between good and evil. Welcome to another childish toying with simple superhero themes and antagonisms.Although the filmmakers Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (known collectively as the \"Daniels\") do exhibit some visual creativity, all of the film's originality lies in the influx of images, atmospheres, and colours, not in its fiddling with philosophical or narrative concepts. The film's endless clashes, verse-jumps and attempts at explaining itself make this a longwinded and meandering experience. And the repetitive fights, which in all fairness make up most of the film's running time, are overchoreographed and unorganic. They never feel like happening to or having anything to do with human beings - and thus end up feeling irrelevant. Instead, Everything Everywhere All at Once becomes a martial arts extravaganza for the less athletically inclined - in a giddy, self-regulating movie world where you can jump between (uni)verses and deploy magically trained versions of yourself for various seemingly brainstormed purposes, with endless access to eccentric costumes and flickering projections.Everything Everywhere may seem ambitious and complex - mostly just for the sake of it - but it never is emotionally or narratively. There is such a laziness hidden in the film's onrush of imagery that you're likely to be offended by it - unless, of course, you let yourself be impressed by the emperor's new clothes. And the attempted comedy which is scattered around here and there resembles that of the National Lampoon movies from the 80s and 90s - which were mostly lambasted to an extent that Everything Everywhere also should have been. One highlight: A silent conversation between two rocks in a desert.",

There's no doubt that this is a movie unlike any other; the creativity is off the charts. The acting is superb. The direction terrific. But there's no substance outside of a feel good message about... something: hard to say what. Still, the most salient part of the movie, and something few people seem to be talking about, is that it's possibly the most violent movie of the year, if not the decade. Once the roller coaster begins it's one excruciating fight scene after another, all beautifully choreographed, and all bloody horrible. So if you like originality combined with imagination, constant bloodshed, and a completely incoherent plot, this is your movie.",

Daniels accomplished just that with this work of art coming to me right exactly when I needed it. The themes of family, fulfillment, love, and everything in between hit resoundingly close to home.

Sometimes it's agreeable, but oftentimes it's hard to agree with them because many claims with baseless information like the one with Titanic. How many people can really agree with someone saying \"Titanic is overrated\"? Well, today I'll make a point of why Everything Everywhere All at Once is overrated with a nutshell information by comparing with the move, Parasite. When Parasite was getting popular in US, I was thinking, \"it's probably because it's leveraged by a social trend\". However, \"Boy, was I wrong\" that's what I said right after watching the movie. I could understand why it gained so much popularity. The movie is well scripted and well directed, but most of all, it's a movie that nobody has ever seen before which is probably why the movie received a big applauds and awards at Cannes and others. It's understandable completely that Parasite is definitely not overrated. However, in case of Everything Everywhere All at Once, it's also well scripted and well directed, but the plot and EVERYTHING in this movie is something I've seen in many movies and TV shows over and over especially with multiverse and the family dynamics. There's ZERO wonder why it didn't get any attention from Cannes, and the movie is basically unknown in other countries except US. The movie's fame is only leveraged by the social trend only in US. I can expect this movie will grab a lot of Oscars, and also can expect this movie will easily be forgotten unlike Parasite.*Keep in mind that I'm not a diehard fan of Parasite. I do like the movie, but I'm only using it because it makes a good comparison with Everything Everywhere All at Once especially with Cannes award.",

I am 37 years old and have been a movie buff since I was a child. Movies are my passion - classic cinema, international cinema, domestic cinema. I see at least 30+ movies in theaters every year from all counties and compile a top 10 list of my favorite films.I can count on both hands the number of times I have sat in a movie theater slackjawed and stunned, unable to move as credits rolled on a film. I can count on one hand the number of times this has occurred to not only me but the audience with whom I've watched a movie. I have also only seen a few movies where the audience erupted in applause during the credits - rapturous, earnest, sustained cheering.Last night's screening of Everything, Everywhere falls into the latter category. As credits rolled, no one moved in a sold-out IMAX theater. We all sat and stared at the screen in awe before eventually cheering and clapping.This is a special movie, a miracle of a film, the type of lightning-in-a-bottle motion picture that comes along once in a blue moon to blow your mind and annihilate your heart with its boundless, bursting soul, energy, spirit, and creativity.In all my movie-watching years, I have never seen anything like it. The closest comparison I can muster is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. There are many similarities between both films' unhinged, creative expression as well as their ultimate message of persistence and living life in spite of seemingly insurmountable odds and the inevitably that all things, both good and bad, will eventually come to a crashing end when the curtains on our lives close.Michelle Yeoh is remarkable and delivers a knockout performance that will surely garner plenty of awards attention. It's hard to imagine many actresses who could have so effortlessly kept step with such a demanding role, but she coasts through drama, comedy, action, and sci-fi with a verve and energy that left me breathless. It's the fiercest performance I've seen from one of the best actresses of our time and one of the best performances I've seen in years.As for the movie itself, really the less you know going in, the better. I saw the trailer two or three times prior to watching the film, and it did little to spoil the experience. I really do recommend going in blind, though.I don't rate many movies a 10/10. I also rarely leave theaters feeling the way I felt last night: dizzy on the possibilities of cinema and lost in thought over all I had just experienced. Even as I write this, I cannot wait to see the movie again with new people so they can experience just how special this is.Everything, Everywhere dazzles with its creative vision, but it marries the bizarre and magical with the mundane and the ordinary to make a statement about human potential and how often we let our daydreams - what could have been, should have been, will or won't be - roadblock who we are. The movie obliterates the veil of ordinary to reveal the extraordinary, but it never loses itself within its relentless, wacky, metaphysical vision.Quite the contrary, really. When the dust settles by the end of the film, you feel like you have been taken somewhere new - to a place only the best films can take us - and are reminded that even though we might not matter in the grand scheme of the universe, there are kind things we can do - to one another and ourselves - to make the pain and joy of being human mean...something.And at the end of the day, maybe that's everything.",

            "content": "Is there any part of the movie world that has NOT been taken over by multiverses, time travel, alternate worlds and their like? It's no longer innovative just to use those concepts for a plot device; a good story has to go along with it. Here, Michelle Yeoh plays a worldweary owner of a perfectly ordinary laundromat who doesn't really respect her seemingly weak husband, has to deal with a demanding infirm father, and can't get along with her rebellious, aimless daughter. Things are falling apart bit by bit in her life, it seems. But then the multiverse breaks through, little by little until it all turns into a full-on, gonzo trip through different versions of herself. An Ultimate Villain emerges across all the timelines who wants to bring the whole thing down and who turns out to be none other than her daughter (or a version of her). As always, Yeoh is excellent and carries it all very well.Most of the movie becomes a whirlwind of world-jumping action. Moment by moment, it's fun and constantly keeps you off balance (which in fact is the state that Yeoh's character Evelyn is constantly in). But when I left the theater I was really wondering if I had just wasted my time, or not. The thing is that underneath, the basic story is surprisingly ordinary. A woman forced to look back on her own life and the possible paths she might have taken learns to see the good in her own family members and to reconcile with them -- not a rose-tinted Happy Ending, but settled within her own self. What it worth telling that story in this particular way? Maybe.\"Sliding Doors\" (1988) was one of the first to do the alternate time-line thing, and there it was just two paths that we got to see in detail. Everything Everywhere All at Once gives us a zillion, because we 'know' so much more about the multiverse by now ... One innovative and laugh-out-loud bit toward the end was when we get to see an extreme outlier of a possible world, where Evelyn and her daughter are just two large round rocks perched on the edge of a cliff, talking to each other in silent word balloons.I keep thinking of a comment made years ago by legendary film critic Gene Siskel: \"If anything can happen, who cares what happens?\" A story has to have some kind of inner logic behind it that makes it more than just arbitrary. Does this movie pass that test? No, and yes. The thing about the multiverse is that you can have it your way. You can have it both ways. You can have it all ways, all at once.",

First the \"just be kind\" wisdom. Yes, when someone attacks you, just be kind. I'm sure it works. In real life, it doesn't. In the movie they tried to show that it does (the stairway fight) by reducing people to one dimensional creatures, that there's just one hobby or a kink that can make one happy. I'm going to spank this guy and that's all he needs to live a happy, fruitful life. On top of that add teenage level of wisdom such as \"we are small and insignificant\".

The quality of effects and the acting are fine, but the story is just so near non-existent and stupid.

The film has good actors who, unfortunately, due to the poorly told story, cut out, repeated, confused, etc..., do not contribute much to improve the film. Supposedly this movie is advertised as a comedy - there is absolutely nothing comic in it. The few attempts make already silly situations even sillier (e.g., the one where in a given universe people have sausages for fingers). There is no continuity in the 2 hours and 19 minutes of film - you can leave the room for lunch, for example, leave the film playing and, when you return, continue watching it; the unseen part (whatever it may be) will have very little importance in the 'understanding' of the film because parts are repeated with slight variations. Also, I think that about 2/3 of the film focuses on very well-choreographed kung-fu style fights that a lot of people like and that, perhaps, is one of the reasons it was nominated for an Oscar.

Try to find a more imaginative film out there today or in recent memory. You won't.Everything Everywhere All at Once depicts a Chinese immigrant, Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh), empowered to travel multiverses to confront the many selves she could have been in order to save the world and more importantly her family. Like Lars Van Trier's Melancholia, this fantasy is an answer for what to do about clinical depression: Face your many demons and vanquish them with the sheer power of love.Everything is more impressionistic than narrative, offering exotic takes on our culture like satirizing the animation Ratatouille by placing a raccoon on the head of a chef and calling it Raccacoonie (Jason Hamer) or having Jamie Lee Curtis play Dierdre Beaubeirdra, an out-of-control IRS agent storming the Wang family's struggling laundry. Directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, labeled as \"Daniels,\" have taken their Swiss Army Man to a manic level even that quirky film couldn't imagine.In comments on the world as we perceive it, Everything references the popular theme of rediscovering family, so prevalent in super hero movies and elsewhere. Yeoh as Evelyn is a perfect heroine because her current self, which she considers a failure, becomes an active psychic traveler cum martial arts dynamo experiencing the lives she could have led. The branching choices she can make at any moment propel her into different outcomes. It's what we oft have thought about the many possibilities we have within our grasp every moment of our lives.Easy to see the themes bounce out, like becoming all you can be and loving family, such as her daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu), whom she strives to save from the negative forces of the world. Similarly, she struggles with her husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), to serve him divorce papers while every step of the multiverse he travels proves to be dangerous and loving.In the chaos each day brings, destruction around each corner, madness omnipresent, the film manages to lard its scene with kindness sneaking through each frame. Gone is the tyranny of the pandemic; here is the chance for salvation through charity that accepts our weaknesses for the sake of love.Here is The Matrix reimagined for those still reeling from the perceived mania of the Trump era. Buttplugs and an alpha version of Evelyn's boring husband are two of the many running gags that challenge us to think of our personal multiverses as not just daily apocalypses but containing everything to help us through to the best universe of all-a loving one.Everything Everywhere All at Once is everything cinema should be: stunning, challenging, witty, amusing, and true to life in its infinite forms.In theaters, thank goodness, because of the brilliant images and mind-capturing sound.",

Each individual decision has the potential to branch out into a myriad of paths, and I think Evelyn finally learns to appreciate the positive aspects of her decisions and their resulting paths, and realizes that few paths are without merit and no path is perfect.However, this lovely story gets lost in a a ridiculous over-exaggeration of chaos that, if toned down and purged of the stupid \"potty humor\" could have been a real positive. Beatings by huge dildos and universe jumping via butt plugs cheapened the sci-fi aspects of the movie and distracted from what could have been a great film. Too many long fight scenes made for boring stretches, the hot dog fingers stuff could have been funny (and point taken regarding the skills development of other body parts) if not overdone, and the bagel thing was just... dumb. The overused \"I can't accept my child being gay\" intro that turns into parental acceptance at the end of the movie seems to be a requisite storyline these days, and is becoming a real eye roller. \"Again???\" I appreciated the variety of \"Evelyn\" characters and they way the skills of each were integrated into the new Evelyn. Who knew sign twirling was such a useful skill? :-)Though the acting was excellent for the Evelyn character (Michelle Yeoh) and her family members (Ke Huy Quan, Harry Shum Jr., James Hong), the part of IRS agent (Jamie Lee Curtis) was played way too over the top. I also feel that the writers made the part of Evelyn's husband Waymond's a bit TOO passive.

I guess it could have went really easily towards a Quantum Leap or Sliders kind of story, but \"the Daniels\" kept it fresh and tight and the acting was great.I wonder if they started with \"We need an actor that can do everything and anything!\", so naturally they got Michelle Yeoh, then they made the story Chinese so it fit. I am sure in some universe that story is true :)Bottom line: Most films have some qualities that makes them special, but very few are so considerate as this one.

Further complicating matters the mother has been selected to save the galaxy against the ultimate evil that may destroy all existence as the family knows it...This movie is codirected by Dan Kwan (Swiss Army Man) and Daniel Scheinert (The Death of Dick Long) and stars Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), Ke Huy Quan (Goonies), Stephanie Hsu (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel), Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween) and James Hong (Big Trouble in Little China).I loved everything about this movie. The cast was perfectly selected and everyone delivered their characters to perfection. The family dynamic is very well written and evolves well throughout the picture.

For a movie like this, the editing needs to be clean in order to properly follow the story and the editing team succeeded in this task. The use of parallel editing in this movie was cleverly done and worked flawlessly with the story especially when a match cut was also used. The story for this movie as well is a unique one that makes you think one thing but then becomes something else. The main story for this movie just seems like any other action/sci-fi movie with there being a chosen one who's the only one that can save the universe but underneath that is a deeper story. The deeper story is really what hooks the audience for this wild and wacky ride of a movie as it's one everybody can relate to. What I really liked about this story though was how it easily mashed everything together from the comedy to the more serious moments and the action scenes. Another thing about the writing for this movie is how something will be mentioned and just seem like a throwaway thing but then come back in some way. This is a testament to the writers and directors of this movie Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert. This movie is a weird and wacky ride and the directing duo understood that and dived headfirst into it which is what makes this movie a unique and memorable one. What also helps in that department is the acting in this movie and man did everybody deliver for this movie. Everybody in this movie had to juggle between being serious and comedic and nailed it. Michelle Yeoh was the stand-out performance for me and I just want to know how she was able to stay in character during some of the scenes in this movie. The final thing I want to talk about with this movie is the lighting in this movie and how well it was used. The lighting in this movie, along with the screen ratio, helps the audience figure out which universe it is. In the end, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a wild and wacky ride that has a meaningful message along with it that you need to see.",

Creativity is something truly new and outside of the box, like a sensation that nobody has ever felt before.Second, the film's message and theme is very millennial (god millennials are the worst generation). The jist of it is how to live even though life has no meaning. It's an obvious, childish conundrum that most people get past when they're teenagers. But of course millennials are stuck in the past and don't know what a purpose-driven life is.Finally, and I haven't heard anyone mention this, but the film is pitched to you as an epic sci-fi adventure but it actually feels very low budget. Most of the settings are ordinary places (like an office, laundromat, etc) and the weapons, even the futuristic multiverse-jumping gear, are just mundane cheap objects. It felt like those episodes of Community where they played paintball. The movie feels really cheap and thus the multiverse stuff feels like it's fake.That being said, it's not a bad movie.

It is as though awakening in a gigantic dumpster filled with the rotting scraps collected from a global garbage dump, then scrambled in a vast blender, and spewed out on top of you, leaving you to claw your way to the surface through infinite layers of trash. It is easy to interpret it in endless ways. There seems to be a consensus about the woman at the center of a \"multiverse\" who experiences \"everything\" nd there are popular analogies drawn with the internet, and I see it as a toilet into which a thousand people have deposited a vast variety of, well, wht usually winds up in that swirl, that have come from a vast variety of sources. It does not help either that the production value is so poor, that the \"cinematography\" is so grossly amateurish in appearance, though this is surely part of the charm for the only people I can see liking this: very young children, with no experience with people or life, just video games.",

Motion, lighting, colors, framing, and focus make every shot engaging and meaningful. The sound symbolically conveys psychology through silence, volume, and echoes. The multifaceted effects contribute to the ambitious atmosphere. Similarly, the production design is boundless, yet united by a lighthearted vision. Lastly, the editing is a powerhouse, jumping between several timelines, yet synergizing perfectly.

I don't understand why so many people are giving this such high reviews.

How can a women who has never worked out, thrown a punch, done a pushup suddenly able to jump off walls and throw people around. Sure she has the knowledge and skill, but not the muscle mass or body. There is one moment she throws a POLICE SHEILD like its captain Americas shield, hits multiple people and then proceeds to catch it.

Everything. Just open every damn can, jar, bottle, carton, package, spice, and dump it all in the pot; flavors you like, and flavors that you find horribly distasteful. Dinner guests would likely find the concept unique, but would not likely find the dish itself palatable. That is my take in this film. Far too much for far too long.

That woman is just incredible - anyone who has seen her 80s and 90s Martial arts movies from Hong Kong can attest to that. And hearing her behind the scenes stories a few weeks ago, made certain things even more incredible.But I digress. It is not just her - we have the kid from the Indiana Jones movie. A sort of comeback thing, than Jamie Lee Curtis and so many other people involved. And of course you have the filmmakers who came up with the whole thing. Add to that a bit of Marvel flavor - at least in the producing chairs - with Joe Russo ... and you have a real pool of amazing talent working together here.There are scenes here, that you might find woke, but it also has a lot of scenes that you might find disgusting. But as with Swiss Army Man behind the story, behind things that may be disgusting, there is so much heart. Yes seeing someone rip a (dirty of course) gum off a table and chew it was not something that made me feel good inside ... but those scenes work, because the movie itself works.The frantic pace is just out of this world. No pun intended - especially considering how many worlds there might be. It is not entirely out of the realm of possibilities right? Who knows what me - or all the other me's are doing at the moment? Surely not all writing a review of a movie - but also hopefully not caring about the inconsistencies the movie has. If you break certain things down, they do not make much sense. But this is heart over mind - do not overthink it - let the movie and the experience take you on a journey and you will not regret it. It has some violent scenes and some other disturbing content (lesbian characters not being high on that list), but all that is packed neatly and in a way that works like a charm ... highly recommended.",

Turns out, this film, though garnished with fictional concepts, narrates the reconciliation of a family.Regarding costume design, special effects, and film editing, the movie has accomplished to the summit, which truly depicts the vastness and variations of universes. Rapid montage and transitions present how the protagonist experiences \"everything\", and quickly highlight the few worlds with their whimsical aspects. To understand the surreal illustration, imagine riding a roller coaster down a tunnel of black and white spirals, while having the Wachowski sisters blowing bubbles into your eyeballs. Personally, I really enjoyed the segment when two rocks conversed through literal texts, extremely amusing and creative. Talk about comedy, the film applied Asian stereotypes, understatements of crucial features, unexpected interventions, and erotic implications, which successfully detonated laughter.Embellished under such flamboyant set up, is the self-introspection of a typical middle-aged woman (performed by the amazing actress Michelle Yeoh): immigrant, minority, mother, wife, daughter, lower-middle class. All the disappointment and determination gave Evelyn resilience and optimism, which almost seem unrealistic in the face of taxes, business expansion, festival party, divorce contract, elder's critiques, child's displeasure, as her positive qualities start to fracture. Through living the lives of her better selves, Evelyn is slowly attracted to the bagel theory, that all are worthless in making regretful decisions, and are meant to self-destruct. However, unlike Jobu Tupaki, she has Mr. Wang, a mediocre, coward, and noisy husband, but constantly supporting the crumbling family with no complaint, and oriented to improve their marriage with an unspoken love. Finally, Evelyn realizes the necessity to heartfully accept her daughter, even though if it means to let go. Stephanie Hsu's impressive performance of an omniscient, unrestrained teenager who craves familial affection makes the idea further more convincing.This movie isn't perfect, because the director's immense elaboration of multiverse and cinematic allusions can't prolong thoroughly, creating artistry fatigue and disconnection to the main plot. Moreover, the resolution of conflict is quite cliche, especially in contrast to the innovative exposition.In all, an inventively aesthetic piece of work in recent times.",

The acting is terrible, none of the performances looks realistic nor does any of the characters believable. Actually, I hated all the characters, they're so uninspired and bland. Most of the film it's just so stressful and messed up that it's just beyond annoying. The film is full of immature childish humour that is so lame.But the worst of all is that this film doesn't have any kind of originality at all. We got so many multiverse and meta films at this point already and this seems to be the most generic of them all. None of the other universes plays an important role in the film and there are so few, to begin with. The structure of the film is just like any kind of generic blockbuster following the same 20 rules of the generic \"The Hero's Journey\" film. It's full of cliches and doesn't bring anything new to the table, possibly one of the weakest screenplays I have ever seen. It overexplains everything and is repetitive to its core in doing the same events over and over again. Mindless fights and brainless arcs.

Our creative minds may not even be capable of imagining all the possible versions of ourselves in existence. It's hard to wrap our brains around the concept itself to begin with. So when asked \"What version of yourself, of our world, do you think is out there?\", there are no wrong answers.

In essence, it's a solid take on nihilism with the recently popularized concept of multiverse due to some MCU films. Our main character Evenlyn (played by Michelle Yeoh) tries to save the \"world\" using various abilities that she picked up from different versions of herself in different universes.Technique wise, this movie was flawless. Very trippy visual effects scenes were everywhere that made the movie feel like a long acid trip. Music was also great. Editing also made the film digestible despite telling a complex story, jumping between different universes.However, at its core, \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" is a portrayal of family drama, with a spice of multiverse. To quote NYT, it's a \"bittersweet domestic drama, a marital comedy, a story of immigrant striving and a hurt-filled ballad of mother-daughter love\". The struggles that they face are actually very common, especially within the Asian immigrant community. The movie actually portrayed Asian immigrants VERY well, partially informed by myself being one. It portrays complex emotions such as Evelyn's regret and nostalgia for the choice she made to leave her home country, in a refreshing manner. I resonated a lot with that and wanting to be a different person with a different life. The clash between different generations in sensitive topics like sexuality was also explored particularly well. What most stood out to me was the portrayal of the mother-daughter relationship. While I am not a daughter myself, their conflict and love were so well portrayed - sort of a love-hate relationship that spans the entire multiverse. Acting for all the characters were phenomenal. Jamie Lee Curtis popped off too.I guess what I got for this beautiful mess of a movie was this. Every decision at every moment is universes colliding. We can do whatever we want within the multiverse but we chose to be at this point in time in this space with the person we love. Because nothing matters and there are infinite universes, we should be loving and accepting one another. This is a take on nihilism that I personally vibe with so I think it moved me more too.All in all, amazing film. Recommended for EVERYONE. At Once.**I regret not writing this review sooner. I've been procrastinating on it. There are a lot of details and quirks that I wish I documented more to write a better review but maybe I will view it a second time if it ever comes out on streaming.",

The concept of the film, the reasoning behind the plot is quite similar to the movie \"tenet.\" And the reason is \"nothing at all.\"The movie runs us through the problems of the main character and how different choices made by her could have meant a \"better life\" than the one she already has. But the main reasoning for all of the action and plot was confined down to her daughter's issues with her. It'd have been interesting if the main character was the villain in the alternate universe, where she snapped and gotten all vengeful of the universe/s as she crumbled down the years of emotional and mental torture.Also don't even get me started on the bagel. It was an annoying detail in the film, i don't know if I need to have an artistic mind to actually appreciate that concept but I truly do not.It's a good action movie but not a great sci-fi movie. Which is why 7\u2b50 is for the action, acting and overall attractive scenes. You just have to turn your brain off in order to enjoy it without thinking about it in the back of your mind. The movie is infact not worth the hype, watching it or not watching it wouldn't make a difference in how you understand the concepts of science or the possibility of alternate realities.",

When you look up the definition of the word \"maximalist\" in the Oxford dictionary, the poster for this movie should be the first thing you see. At its core, Everything Everywhere All at Once has a rather familiar premise, where our female protagonist suddenly finds out in her everyday life that she lives within a multiverse and has the power to prevent the destruction of everything as we know them. What makes this movie stands out from its peers is the mind-boggling commitment of the filmmakers to really show the viewers what an infinite number of universes looks, sounds, and feels like from the perspective of a character caught in their wake.I am honestly very conflicted about this movie. On one hand I am in absolute awe of what this movie was able to achieve in terms of raw impact on the viewers through an all-out sensory assault. It is without a doubt one of the most visually-daring and creative films I've seen in quite a while, with an endless number of insane action sequences flowing from one scene to the next. The story really goes to the max with using the multiverse context to pull off every joke you can and can't think of, frequently conjuring up tens of different skits within a single minute. On another note, something I really appreciated is that underneath all the dizzying spectacles there is also a very heartfelt and touching story about family and living for kindness.Where the movie gets exhausting for me is from its shear overbearingness of its presentation through the majority of the runtime, which I fully acknowledge is the point and that many others won't feel is a problem. I did thoroughly enjoy the frantic style for the first hour, but after that the relentless attack does start to wear out its welcome and feel a bit repetitive. Some of the jokes also didn't land that well for me, which relate back to the presentation style whereby random bizarre things happen almost nonsensically one after the other due to the presence of the multiverse, making them feel like watching YouTube compilations of meme clips - funny for a while but starts to grate after that. I enjoyed the movie more towards the final act where it focused back on the characters and their relationships, so I personally would've preferred the movie to have struck a bit more balance on developing that aspect with the visual extravaganza exhibition.To summarise, Everything Everywhere All at Once fully delivers on the potential of its title by giving an acid-trip-esque experience that is designed to mystify and overwhelm the viewers in what might well be the craziest multiverse movie in any timeline or universe. I always appreciate when the filmmakers have the guts and bravado to stick and execute their vision without compromise, and by golly if Daniels did not do just that. As a final note, I have to give a shout-out to A24 again: not all of their movies fully work for me, but you can count on them to be unique and to leave a lasting impact.",

Best, most wonderful film I've seen in ages... Thank you Michelle Yeoh for existing.\" Purely on that advice, I went to see it, as he suggested, \"See it knowing nothing if you can.\" READ NO FURTHER if you want to take his advice. I don't know if there was a single department of this production that didn't excel. The writing was clever, unexpected, witty, deep, poignant, insane... the editing must have been an Herculean task and it is executed absolutely amazingly. The premises that are morphed together totally eclipse any singular focus on its own. Michelle Yeoh performance is indescribably brilliant. The supporting cast deliver with brilliance of their own. You will laugh out loud, cringe, gasp, cry, examine your life and be awestruck. I'll just stop, now, because I could go on ad nauseam. I give this film an enthusiastic 10 (superlative) out of 10 {no genre will be a sufficient label}",

Their daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) wants her lesbian girlfriend to be accepted as part of the family.Everyone wants approval from Evelyn's father Gong Gong (James Hong.) The crusty tax inspector Deirdre (Jamie Lee Curtis) is gunning for Evelyn because of her expenses claims.Suddenly another variant of Waymond appears and introduces Evelyn to the concept of the multiverse. Where she can gain some powers and skills. All so she can stop some the impending destruction of the multiverses from a weird bagel.Everything Everywhere All at Once is basically another take on Dr Strange 2. It's overstuffed with weird ideas that really leads to a multiverse of madness.It has energy, philosophical ideas and pathos. Due to all the chaos some of the concepts end up in a cul de sac. It was overlong and maybe the appropriate jumping off point would had been the two rocks in an alien planet.Great performance from Yeoh, there is a version of her that is a famous film star in one world that Everlyn is envious of. She holds the movie together and once again displays that she is more than a far eastern martial arts star.",

Many years later they get a gay daughter and as her granddad finally visits their laundry business in USA. The daughter has a bunch of ugly tattoos and just overall acts like a spoiled depressive brat who hates everyone in her life. The movie is about the mom being contacted by people from another universe. Apparently they fight an evil being who wants to destroy all the universes, this being is actually her daughter in another universe. So now the mom is supposed to travel to alternative universes and pick up all the abilities of her alter-egos to fight her alternative daughter who already sees every other universe at the same time. The idea overall is kinda fine. It's a silly idea, but could work.The One (2001) was a big hit and still liked to this day and this is basically a cheap imitation. The One also had a Chinese kung-fu actor in the lead collecting abilities from himself in alternative timelines. The One was silly, but made sense. This movie doesn't try to make any sense. To jump to another universe to collect the abilities you have to do a silly thing. This is obviously a Matrix idea they put in the movie. But here it's not technology or something concrete and cool. People wet their pants, get paper cuts on purpose, use objects in sexual ways, dance in weird ways, chew used gum. Much of it is really disgusting and that's the main issue with the movie. There are so many disgusting scenes. If you just made the universe jumps less disgusting the movie would be way better.The movie furthermore steals from Mr. Nobody (2009). Jared Leto lives 3 different lives at one time. With 3 different attractive girlfriends. And one of them is also Asian. So yet again it just feels like the movie is taking better movies while lazily constructing a story around a boring \"accept your gay daughter\" theme. At the end of the movie we find out that all this fighting and traveling was just an analogy. There is no magic, no great technology. It was all a dream. It's just about a mother accepting that her daughter is depressive, has ugly tattoos, and is out and about gay counter to the conservative Chinese culture where you don't act flamboyant. The movie theme is about accepting flamboyant sexuality, weird crazy people, seeing sex objects everywhere. The movie is so weird and disgusting that the theme is about accepting just EVERYTHING and especially all things nasty and sexual. The mom doesn't even seem to dislike gay people or anything so I'm not sure what the point even is? There is no logic or cultural focus. It's just the mom and daughter using various sex objects and sex symbolism to fight each other. And even the mom is gay in another universe. A universe where they have sausages instead of fingers. That's just how weird the movie is. It's not realistic alternative universes or events. It's a bunch of craziness. It looks like a movie a bunch of spoiled young flamboyant hipsters would write together while high. It could have worked while telling a random story like Mr. Nobody did. Just jump from event to event. But with the disgusting stuff and boring overused theme it fails. Especially the theme is a huge letdown. We have seen this a million times before. Older person needs to accept some gay family member. It's just awfully boring at this point and I wish Hollywood would work a bit harder on themes. The flashy surface doesn't cover over the fact that the overall story and theme is extremely weak and melodramatic in extremes. Maybe teens will be surpriced by how \"new\" this feels. But anyone over 25 will have seen this stuff a billion times before.",

Her business is struggling, she is becoming distant from her daughter while embracing the poorer qualities of her father, her marriage is on the rocks and all of the mundane faux realities like taxes and business are colliding; becoming far too important in her life. There is a lot of internalized guilt on her part, and she is trying to utilize poor coping methods to deal with it. And then of course, she finds out she might be the most important person in the universe(s) even though it is blatantly clear she is the worst version of herself in all realities.I won't get into the sci-fi mumbo jumbo of the film, but basically an all powerful being is looking to destroy the very fabric of space and time. We talk about multiverse theories and cause and effect theories while also meshing them with abandonment, guilt and insufficiency syndromes by Evelyn's character. As she struggles to figure out her place in all of this, she is being pulled in multiple directions by multiverse jumping men posing as her husband and father, while her daughter is essentially the representation of destruction. This is where things get heavy.Is humility really possible if you can literally be anywhere at once? Is nihilism even possible with this kind of power in tow? How important is the meshing of tradition and progression to a person from an unique culture assimilating into a new one? Are women truly the destructors of reality as so many \"enlightened\" misogynists like to stupidly put it? Does an Everything Bagel really have everything? And why has Ke Huy Quan been off the map for so long? I mean he was great in his role, seamlessly switching between the overly nice Waymond Wang to his Alpha Universe version that can turn a fanny pack into a weapon of mass destruction.There were a lot of things I didn't expect from this film and I hope some people remember it for the unique vision it had. Framing a story about the universe in danger while a mother and daughter come to terms with their differences makes for a fun coming of age story that does not reek of the usual step-by-step tropes. It was also great to see people like Michelle Yeoh and James Hong get some great roles for once. Kudos to the film makers on that one.Go watch this film. It does drag a little in the middle but once you get into the final act you will definitely want to get the Blu-Ray because there are literally dozens of little detailed moments that will require a very slow run through. And in my book, that is a good thing.",

Despite having all the right ingredients, that didn't quite happen this time around.The average viewer is going to struggle getting through the first half because it's slow, confusing and has a lot of subtitles to get through. Which is a shame because the magic in the movie is definitely in the 2nd half.Ultimately it's a high concept movie that can be explained quite simply but not without spoilers. However the basic premise in the movie sees the main character Evelyn, a run of the mill middle aged family woman, interact with the multiverse to save every universe.Whilst it is visually stunning and one of the most creative movies you'll have seen in a while, I feel it falls somewhere between serious philosophical sci-fi and in part daft comedy and doesn't quite blend them well enough. There are two food based elements of the story which could have been something different and it would have A) made more sense and B) made a more satisfying story.This is definitely the kind of movie that can split the crowd, with the average viewer unlikely to give it much of a go. So the current iMDB rating of 8 at the time of writing this review did surprise me, but fair play.Great visuals, quality acting, awesome ideas but something is missing for me.",

As much as I do love going to see blockbusters on opening weekend, it's really all about how good a story is for me when it comes down to it. Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of A24's latest releases now playing in theatres and I haven't seen a film this weird and also thought-provoking in all the best ways, in a very long time. It's been almost a week since I've seen it and I'm just now wrapping my head around what I watched. When I first heard about this film I was excited, but I didn't expect how deep it would be under the surface.To put it as simply as possible, Everything Everywhere All at Once is about Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh), a woman who is struggling to keep her business going. As she's being audited an opportunity presents itself. Since she's in just a bind, she goes along with it, but it unleashes an endless number of realities. Being able to see many different versions of herself, her husband, her daughter, and many others, she basically discovers what her life could've been like, for better or worse. On top of that, abilities are garnered by her, due to the studying and linking of her other, smarter selves. The way this film gets to its climax was both wacky and emotional for me.This is the first review I've written in a while where I don't feel the need to complain about a single thing and also don't want to get into too many details and ruin it for anyone. I will say that it's absolutely not for everyone, simply due to the sheer weirdness of it all. This will more than likely turn off some viewers. Yes, it's incredibly weird and off-putting at times, but if you really think about the visuals on-screen, the meaning behind it all and where it leads just brought me to tears. Speaking of the visuals, for a smaller budgeted film, I was blown away by how this film was made and looked overall.In the end, Everything Everywhere All at Once earns one of the biggest recommendations from me in quite some time, but I also want to warn those who aren't a fan of weird cinema. It's bonkers in all the best ways. I loved the direction by both Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, but I wasn't surprised by that because I loved their previous film, Swiss Army Man, which is arguably even weirder. From the technical achievements to the moving dialogue, to the straight-up cheer-worthy strangeness that it has to offer, I walked out of this film overjoyed. Everything Everywhere All at Once deserves to be recognized for awards all year long and I hope it continues to get the attention it very much deserves.",

But perhaps game marinated teenager brains wont mind that at all?Not any good then? It's really a wonderfully creative movie, with excellent photography, excellent choreagraphy. It's definitely something else. There is also a great role by Jamie Lee Curtis as some kind of psychopathic old IRS lady.It's simply not my cup of tea, because this movie does not know when to breath, when to have a pause and let REAL characters interact with each other, instead of fantasy ones.It's too much of a gimmick.

            "review_title": "A truly bizarre, fast-paced mind trip that revels in every minute of its originality",
            "content": "\"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" is a sci-fi action comedy film written and directed by Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, a.k.a. \"Daniels\". Starring Michelle Yeoh in the lead role, it is a truly bizarre, fast-paced mind trip that revels in every minute of its originality.For many years, Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) has run a family laundromat with her husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan). Things aren't going too smoothly for Evelyn due to many amounting problems - the IRS is in the process of auditing the laundromat, Waymond is considering divorcing her, Evelyn's father Gong Gong (James Hong) has recently arrived from China, and Evelyn's daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) is struggling to convince her mother to accept her girlfriend Becky (Tallie Medel). One day, Waymond's personality suddenly changes right in front of Evelyn and he reveals himself to be from an \"Alpha\" parallel universe. This Alpha version of Waymond informs Evelyn about the existence of different multiverses due to the abundance of choices people make all the time, and provides her with a device that allows her explore many different realities and borrow special powers from different variants of herself.It seems that thanks to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the idea of multiverses and alternate realities have become rather popular with audiences lately, and for that I couldn't be happier. I've always enjoyed fiction that deals with hypothetical scenarios in which we see how differently things may have turned out had one small little thing happened instead of what we actually ended up with. In \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\", we are treated to a surreal, over-the-top exploration of multiple possible timelines in one of the most uniquely strange films I've seen in a long time.This film takes the very concept of exploring the multiverse and flips it on its head, quite literally sometimes and often with humorous results. I was surprised how many times I spontaneously laughed out loud at certain parts just out of sheer absurdity, but it never felt like I was doing so at the film's expense. We see so many different twists and turns throughout that it's hard for me to definitively categorise what they are truly about. One scene may involve a reality where people have hotdogs for fingers and the other might feature literal rocks with googly eyes as the variants of our main characters. Yet, strangely, this film has created a world where all of these things could plausibly exist. It would have been easy for the film to be simply weird for the sake of it, but there's a certain cadence to all this weirdness that makes it so appealing to watch in the long run.The two Daniels (Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert) have clearly given close attention-to-detail to every scene of this film. Most of the time we are shown several blink-and-you-miss-it moments alluding to what particular version of Evelyn may be like in a certain reality or which of her obscure memories may be the trigger towards gaining that one's power. I can't discuss these in too much detail here, not just because I am reluctant to give away spoilers but also because even as I write this I'm still trying to fully comprehend what I have watched. Due to all the intricately hidden things that will likely go over people's heads, this is the type of movie that will require multiple viewings. However, I believe this is a good thing since it will help it attain the cult status it rightfully deserves. Not many movies released these days have the courage to go all out with this much passion and charm, especially one distributed by an independent company like A24.There's more good news - the action is fantastic as well. The fight choreography is so well done you'd be hard pressed finding better hand-to-hand combat outside of a Jackie Chan film (funnily enough, Chan was actually the original choice for the lead before the filmmakers decided to make her a woman). Even better is that the shaky-cam elements are kept to minimum, which makes it easier for us to see who is fighting whom. The high quality of the action scenes in this film can likely be attributed to the involvement of the Russo brothers, Anthony and Joe, who serve as co-producers. Their creative fingerprints have been left on this film as that same style of MCU action and fun is definitely present here. Any fan of the MCU will be aware of the Russo brothers' important contribution to the series in that they knew how to correctly balance character development with solid action sequences to go along with it.If there's any person who can truly hold this crazy but wonderful film together, it's Michelle Yeoh in the main role as Evelyn. Just watching the way Evelyn goes from a frustrated family woman struggling to make ends meet to a full blown action hero in the same movie is quite a staggering accomplishment. Yeoh never misses a beat battling her way through adversaries from unfamiliar realities while borrowing powers from her variant counterparts. I think it's safe to say this is the best performance she's ever given in a film, even more so than in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\". Additionally, we also see the surprising return of Ke Huy Quan to the big screen as Evelyn's husband Waymond. For those who don't know, Quan played Short Round in \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" and Data in \"The Goonies\" when he was a child. It's nice to see that Quan's acting talent hasn't waned as an adult and his inclusion in the film's cast should make for an amusing, albeit minor nostalgia trip for fans of 80s movies.With the endless possibilities a multiverse can present, \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" has successfully established itself as one of the most unique films of the 2020s. It's rare for such an ambitious, risk taking venture to have made so many different elements work so harmoniously but every now and then a film like this comes along and shatters all our expectations. This is the type of film you could watch over and over and still find something new to talk about each time. Because of that, I foresee the film achieving cult status in a matter of years, especially among fans of time travel and surrealist cinema. However, this can only occur if enough people end up seeing it in the first place so if all of what I described sounds exciting to you, what are you waiting for?I rate it a solid 9/10.",

Think of a trippy Matrix and you come close. Michelle and Ke are Chinese immigrants that run a laundromat with their daughter, Stephanie. They go to pay their taxes and Jamie is their IRS agent trying to make heads or tails of their receipts. That's when things go bonkers. Ke tells Michelle that he is from another world and needs her help to defeat a chaos agent that is trying to destroy everything. It takes quite a bit of convincing before Michelle can believe him but when she does, she discovers that she can access her other selves from the multiverse as well as their abilities. This leads to lots of exciting battles and a big helping of comedy. An example of weirdness; On one world, the people have hot dogs as fingers-they have adjusted by learning to use their feet more. By visiting these other universes, Michelle sees different lives that she could have led if she took a different path but basically, it's about relationships with her father, husband and daughter.

Hence my rating.If I could sum up this movie in one literal sentence it would be: Asserting the idea that the infinite Cosmos, and infinite possibility of our existence, all of life and all of the Creation, all the time effort energy matter was all made for the sole purpose of advancing the United State's leftist political agenda. (And no I am not left nor right nor even an american nor do I take any solid position in anything. I'm just a human observer watching a movie. Resist the urge ti put me in a box lol)I mean the literal quote they use in the ending of the movie and throughout is \"nothing matters\". It's as if they are only looking at the chaotic part of all Creation but forgetting to also see the orderly part of all Creation. I mean creation is both chaotic and orderly at the same time. And saying things like \"Be kind especially when you don't know what's going on\". Well if you don't know what's going on then shouldn't you be neither kind nor mean. Your assuming kindness is always answered with kindness. That is equally as dumb as assuming unkindness is always answered in unkindness.This movie wants to pretend it is being open minded when really it is just taking an extremist position just like any other boring bias movie. It had so much potential...that's what will disappoint you the most.",

            "content": "Unlikely award winner Everything Everywhere All At Once is perhaps the first film to capture the chaotic mental dopamine of constant Internet use, which is not necessarily a good thing, though obviously most people can relate. Attempting philosophy, action, and comedy all at once, the film can be best summed up as a mixture of the Matrix, a Stephen Chow or Jackie Chan film, It's a Wonderful Life, and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. A disparate set of influences, nearly all of which are better films.Stylistically, the Daniels borrow the most from Michael Bay here, pushing his type of rapid-cut, juvenile sensory overload to arty levels. They nevertheless lack both Bay's sense of composition (con), and also his misanthropy (pro, though the stuff they do to Jamie Lee Curtis goes beyond unflattering). Still, the overall effect the film produces is about the same, especially when it comes to the humor.Unlike the Kung-fu comedies of Chow, the humor of EEAAO lacks a sense of comic delirium and is more fractured and crude. When in Chow's 'Shaolin Soccer' a soccer game transforms into a trench war, it's funny not only because it's unexpected, but also because it parodies the intensity of the sport. Had the Daniels made that film they would have just as likely turned the game into a sex dungeon. Too often they're only willing to throw random stuff at you in place of actual wit---the concept that alternate realities can be experienced through statistically improbable actions is funny at first, but gets dull very quickly. Especially as it's used almost exclusively for high school gross-out humor: inhaling flies, sticking mucus in someone's mouth, etc.The resulting action scenes lack the smooth inventiveness of even a lesser Jackie Chan film. For another example, the fight in 'The Accidental Spy' where Chan, completely naked, tries to beat off several assailants (while covering his privates with anything at hand) is infinitely funnier than anything offered here. The main reason is that the best humor, like Chan's, needs some basis in reality so you can understand the characters' reactions and frustrations. The Daniels have that in the opening scenes but quickly abandon it, choosing instead to indulge a kind of TikTok randomness.It can still be imaginative (I'll give it that) but only up to a certain point. You'd think a reality where people evolved giant hot dogs for fingers would look entirely different even in terms of simple objects such as doorknobs and shirts, but the Daniels merely show us the same world, only where people play the piano with their toes and squirt condiments at each other. Again, this is more about throwing random crap at the screen instead of allowing the premise to develop naturally.So the film fails as a comedy, but how about as a philosophical tract? Like 'It's a Wonderful Life', EEAAO deals with the lost chances of life, 'what might have been' through alternate reality. It goes without saying that Capra's film is far more mature and thoughtful, but it's also more emotionally moving. The Daniels are able to engage nihilism head-on, since especially in the face of the infinite multiverse any form of meaning melts away. The problem is that they don't know how to address it; the idea that humans are no more than insignificant specks is only indirectly repudiated, and the final message is spoken: 'We don't know what's happening in this world, but just be kind to each other!' This conclusion is so basic that it's beyond criticism, except for the fact that it is so basic. EEAAO lacks Capra's edge---advocating as he did kindness and happiness even in the face of intolerant cruelty---though it obviously strikes a chord in our culturally confused, digitally-addled times.",

Is this a bad film? Oh, absolutely not. It's incredibly charming and delightful at times, and even very meaningful- and made me cry towards the end. Where my problem lies with this film though is through its messaging. There are some basic flaws to be had with this one, it can be predictable at times, its pacing can kinda drag, and there are quite a few cliche moments here and there- but most of them feel insignificant enough to ignore and enjoy the incredibly bizarre atmosphere and story this film is trying to tell. Its overall meaning though feels a bit squired, and feels very mixed in my mind. I know it means well, but I can't help but feel it doesn't do enough to satisfy me. All this time they are dealing between the relationship of the mother and the daughter, and still as the film comes to an end we see the mother nitpicking and not changing. She seems willing to change, but then does nothing in the end to resolve these facts and it just feels a bit too messy to ignore. Not only that, but the fact that just because the mom loves the daughter is an excuse for her to keep hurting her- is not okay, and I feel kind of hurt that a lot of that goes unresolved and the tone seems to pick up where the story has no right to let off. If you can get past that, the film is enjoyable. It definitely feels otherworldly, and has a very unique feel. It's easily a very originally made film, with some familiar elements, and visually it is also quite beautiful to watch and see unfold. The acting is incredible and I love how detailed and full of life each little character is, never shining away from darker elements, even if it means not fully settling things. It has some missteps here and there for me, and I can't ignore certain aspects of it- but in the end, Everything Everywhere All at Once does deliver on its promise enough to be enjoyable and is certainly a memorable watch.My Rating: 7.3/10.",

            "content": "Everything Everywhere All at Once is a film that accomplishes something very difficult - it's a movie that looks like an action blockbuster on the outside, and succeeds not only at that but also as a film in general. It actually has a plot very reminiscent of many superhero films - an average person, in this case middle aged Chinese immigrant worker Evelyn Wang, is swept up into a fantastical world (or worlds) where her true potential is realized. It's bolstered by solid performances from Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan (who was the kid in Temple of Doom back in the day), Stephanie Hsu, and Jamie Lee Curtis. It is a very creative and original movie, both very welcome attributes in today's movie industry.This is an off the wall film, but a perfectly made one. It has lightning-fast editing, and it feels much shorter than 2 hours, 19 minutes long. One of Everything Everywhere's best successes is that it takes the concept of a multiverse - the exact same thing Marvel has been doing for the last few years - and manages to make a cohesive structure for a complex metaphysics in just one film. There are still holes in its worldbuilding (like how there can only be one everything bagel if there are infinite universes), but as far as something this complex in a 2 hour movie goes, it's as good as it can be. The martial arts combat is the best there has ever been in an American action movie. It's got nothing on actual Chinese wuxia, but for Hollywood it's a massive upgrade from anything before. The costume design also aids the world building, and gives each unique universe its own distinctive flair.Despite all the laud it gets, this movie is not at all perfect. The weirdness doesn't always feel organic, much of the content of the movie seems weird for the sake of being weird. There is a point at which to distinguish weirdness and uniqueness, this movie is on both sides. Some seem to think that there's a philosophical depth to this movie, which there isn't. This is the biggest problem with the movie. The movie's message is that nothing matters, but yet Evelyn and company most certainly act like things do, whether or not they'd admit it. The idea of nothing mattering is a de facto rejection of objective good, but yet the movie insists on a vague notion of \"kindness\" being the ultimate objective good. You can't have it both ways. The idea that in all these universes Evelyn and Joy come to the same point also implies the existence of fate and thus an ultimate purpose. It's the type of pseudo-philosophy that's tailored for the \"I am very smart\" superiority complex driven Rick and Morty crowd.It is also worth noting that as of writing this, Everything Everywhere is the current frontrunner for Best Picture at the Oscars. It does not really deserve it compared to the others. Tar, The Banshees of Inisherin, and even Top Gun: Maverick are all better movies than this. That doesn't mean it's not a good movie, it is, but it's far from the top. It is a surprising film to get attention from the awards crowds, there hasn't been an action movie win Best Picture since 1971. Back when this came out I said it was going to be one of the big snubs of the year.",

That combined with a complex multiverse story and a family dynamic intertwined makes for an incredible film.The pacing of this is very quick and you do not feel like you've been there for 2 plus hours. It moves quickly but allows you to get to know the characters and develops them very nicely.Michelle Yeoh is phenomenal as the lead character Evelyn, Oscar worthy.

The rest of the cast is also across the board outstanding. Ke Huy Quan, James Hong, Jamie Lee Curtis all give great performances in their respective roles.In terms of gripes, there are times where too much is going on and it's hard to follow and as a result certain aspects are lost.

Unfortunately I was quite disappointed: aside from the peculiar visual effects and the compelling photography, the plot is almost non-existent. The story is confusing, the director tried to explain to the audience how the multiverses works in this narrative, but he failed to deliver a convincing exposure. By the end I wondered what was even the point of these almost two and a half hours that I dedicated to watching this mess. Some might say that there is a hidden message to this story, but I could not find it. There are a few genuinely funny scenes, but overall for me this was quite a tedious experience: this production is way too long for what it is and there are a lot of repetitive sequences that could be removed completely from the final cut. The cast did overall a good job, Stephanie Hsu and Michelle Yeoh were amazing in their acting, even though the characters they played were basically empty shells with little to no development.Personally I think that this was a very ambitious project, but the production required more work on the writing and editing side. This production is way too complicated, it needed to be simplified in order to make the movie more digestible for the audience. A24 productions are a hit or miss, this is definitely a miss, but I appreciate the effort in trying to make a good sci-fi movie, having a more limited budget, compared to a Hollywood company.",

            "content": "\"Everything, Everywhere, All at Once\" is a rollercoaster of glitter, color and chaotic multi-verse hopping nonsense. Beneath it all is a stretched story about a dysfunctional Asian family trying to muddle their way through life as they negotiate their relationships, heart-breaks and bitter disappointments.While visually impressive, with a kinetic pacing and clever editing, I found it hard to be invested emotionally in the story. The absurdist slapstick humor is sporadically funny -hotdog-fingered apes reenacting the stick scene from 2001: A Space Odyssey made me snort- but more often it's just crude and stupid (yes, butt-plug fight scene, I'm looking at you). When it slips from Gen-Z 'Rick & Morty' style gags to tender family moments that are supposed to make us cry, these scenes don't really hold up. It's hard to feel moved by a mother embracing her wayward daughter when you've just watched a guy sumo squat on a dildo and dropkick someone through a door.The script pokes at existential questions, but isn't really clever enough to come at them in a meaningful way; In fact, I don't think it's really interested in doing so. Much of the dialog is just exposition for the wacky dimension-hopping world rules, which you quickly realize don't make any sense. The sequences where characters are switching in and out of their parallel selves become so frantic, it's often hard to tell which version of a character you're looking at and what their motivation is. The writers can of course always keep leaning on the main point of the film that 'life doesn't make sense, so this doesn't need to either'. The ultimate effect on me was that, rather like our main character Evelyn, I just felt exhausted by it and rather lost.I have to give a film kudos when it dares to try something new. There were some spectacular moments and genuine laughs, but it wasn't the masterpiece I'd hoped for.",

Although I think it could have been played out much more sophisticatedly.3. The parent-child relationship is well portrayed. The perceived lack of validation from parents felt by the child, the poorly communicated love of the parent, the process of gaining awareness and emotional growth for both the parent and child is inspiring.Things I didn't like\n1. It is a very bizarre movie, you could even say chaotic. It's as if they tried to combine every single meaningless detail together and gave up filtering out what's actually worth or necessary to the main plot. Tried too hard to make it funny/original/emotional/relatable that it ends up being neither of those things very well.2.

            "content": "This is a movie you must experience for yourself to fully grasp exactly what it is. I absolutely loved it, and yet I find myself unable to write a coherent review... because the movie is absolutely crazy, as well as being cinematic perfection. It's one of the greatest films I have ever seen, or rather, experienced! Instead of writing a full review, I feel this movie is best described in points, because I don't want to say too much about anything, I just want this to convince anyone reading this to go out and see it as soon as they can (in theatres with an audience)! It's the most original and creative piece of filmmaking I have witnessed in probably the last 5 years, I just can't believe what the directorial duo Daniels was able to pull off here! So without further ado, here are my thoughts on \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\":* The film is flawless and true cinematic perfection in my eyes!* An assault on the senses; the visuals and sound design are insane!* Extremely impressive from a technical standpoint.* Editing is a huge standout and was incredibly done, the edit alone took us on a ride! They used match cuts so creatively too!* Cinematography was stunning, I especially loved the creative use of lighting!* Sound design was absolutely crazy, it had so much going on and complimented the visuals perfectly!* Every genre of film in one!* I've never seen anything like it, it's ambitious, crazy, bonkers, insane, creative, hilariously funny, heartfelt, clever, wild, awesome, the best, odd, wacky, touching, chaotic but in a well-written way, stylized, brilliant, and most of all, masterful!* None of this movie should work, and yet due to the Daniels' excellent and clever direction, it somehow does (and yet I still don't know how they were able to pull it off)\n* There is no way Multiverse of Madness will be half as crazy as this movie, this is the best multiverse film we will probably ever see\n* The writing so cleverly establishes the multiverse rules and keeps it flowing in a way that allows you to feel like you understand what's going on despite how complex it gets. It perfectly guides you through the story without spoon-feeding it to you, making sure the chaotic multiverse makes sense.* Also loved the thematic exploration in the story, and that they didn't let the novelty and entertainment value of the multiverse stuff take away from the story, it just complemented it instead. It's some genius writing, especially when heading into the second half of the film where the emotional/thematic core really starts to open up and shine!* Action is phenomenal and intense. It's some of the best I've seen in the last few years, it's so wild! It's very stylized and impressive, the Daniels know how to direct action so well. They get great coverage that shows off the choreography and every hit, and perfect timing for cuts.* The film is so funny, has some witty dialogue, insane gags that I never saw coming, and some hilarious comedic payoffs - one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while, it had both me and the audience howling with laughter!* Michelle Yeoh's performance is astonishing! She's just awesome as the lead; she's so badass in her action scenes, so funny, and yet still gives such an emotional, heartfelt performance\n* I also loved Ke Quan as her husband, he was so loveable and had some of the funniest moments. So great to see him acting again, have really missed him since his days in \"Indiana Jones\" and \"The Goonies\".* Stephanie Hsu was phenomenal as the daughter, and a huge part of why the 2nd half of the film works as well as it does!* Jamie Lee Curtis had me laughing so hard, she was hilarious here, I've never seen her do anything like this!This film does things you would never expect to see, and I loved it for that! I was enamoured by this film, it's truly a glorious piece of filmmaking. It's one of the coolest films of the last decade and I cannot stop thinking about it. I really want to see it again too, it's so much to take in on first viewing! Daniels truly knocked it out of the park on all levels; as a comedy, action film, familial drama, sci-fi film, something that's thought provoking and emotionally potent, technically impressive and so imaginative. It's just a masterpiece; cinematic perfection. It left me with a feeling of pure joy, I really hope everyone gets a chance to experience this film. You have to see it in a theatre with an audience... it's an insane experience! I just loved it, highly recommend! The film's title really says it all; it's \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\"!",

But I think the editing and production was great enough to show the parallels of the timelines and the actions. I didn't like some of the embarrassing scenes but I think that's just me with any kind of scenes like that on other films. I did enjoy the rest of the movie even if most of the humor wasn't really my thing but I get the point of those. Just going with the flow and not thinking too much about everything or else it will be easy to get stuck questioning a lot of things. I do like the originality and the creative execution of a fairly simple story of acceptance of what ever already happened and dealing with problems in an optimistic way.

            "content": "Many films, most of them really, tell the same stories. It's just the approach, the style that differs (in some of them, even the style is the same). Daniel Scheinert and his filmmaking partner made it clear in their debut film, 'Swiss Army Man,' what kind of style they were going for: a quirky, absurdist style, and even though I didn't like it, I don't like it, I respected it for its newness. In this film, Daniel takes the story of 'The Matrix' and tells it in his fashion. He makes it seem fresh and original, but the bore I got from watching this was of Olympic proportions.Dense! You think 'Tenet' was convoluted - buries that! But, if the things in 'Tenet' do start to make sense if you stop to think about them, here, I'm not sure they do. There's so much information coming from everywhere, suffocating you. The film takes you down and then starts beating you to a pulp. But I'm not sure. Maybe I couldn't keep up with it. The whole story felt like it had so many plot holes. Like, a lot of the stuff that happened didn't make any sense. It's weird because the film sells itself as a very grounded movie, regardless of the premise, which it isn't - I'm talking about the filmmakers' approach - but then it switches in the absurdist elements, and it just didn't feel like it all fit nicely. It didn't fit at all.Most of the films that leave me convoluted also leave me with the urge to rewatch them, but this one doesn't. I didn't appreciate this film, and I don't think I'll ever touch it again. But, who knows? Maybe I'll find myself in the right circumstances - I'll lose a bet or a dare or something, else, there's no way - and I'll watch it again, love it, and think of how wrong I'm being right now. But as of now, as of this first watch, I think 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' is one of the most tedious and tasteless pieces of film I've come across recently. And, to think I've had some bland and distasteful film experiences lately.",

I wasn't in the story, I was spectating a movie instead.Similarly ironic, I didn't care about any of the characters whatsoever because everything could happen at any moment, all at once. There was no purpose to invest in the story because there wasn't any real threat, just chaos. The daughter said it herself: \"it is all purposeless because everything is possible\". Very nihilistic in a way.It was fun to see the protagonist gained skills from other dimensions, but set aside the funny visual gags and fighting scenes, I didn't think that concept was leveraged that much creatively.A movie that bombarded me with so much visuals and melodramatic craziness left me bored and uninvested.I did love the way how the mind made the travel between dimensions possible.

Taken out of context, numerous scenes from this movie would be the most ridiculous thing you have seen on the big screen. But every single one of the bits and jokes and plot devices works within the context of the film, which is so beautiful. I don't know that I count this as spoiler so I feal comfortable saying, there is a bit where two objects are talking to one another that is so absurd, but it serves to eventually be the most poignant symbolism in the entire runtime.Of note, Stephanie Hsu is an absolute standout. I am scrolling through her film history now to add things to my watchlist because she was so phenomonal. I assume she had a blast with the role given the context of the character, as did the design team. Everything Everywhere All at Once is a film you won't soon forget, and you should see soon so that you can be in the conversation if it is ever brought up, inevitably, for years to come.",

Portions of the film were quite moving; I cried more than a bit.But, god, my kingdom for rewrites and some ruthless editing! The film was so repetitive and overlong I wondered how the directors and producers could possibly believe the story played as is. Much of the visual humor was overused to an embarrassing degree. The IRS audit evoked more suspense and tension than the super villain/end-of-the-world plot, which was entirely unconvincing.The film's ultimate Message, the love and kindness offered as an antidote to...well, everything, would have carried more weight if it weren't undermined by the protagonist almost immediately.How 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' got so overhyped is a mystery, beyond the obvious appeal of a feel-good Hollywood underdog(s) tale. Love me some underdogs! And weird is *always* more interesting than tentpole flicks. But when people first touted EEAAO as a potential Best Picture nominee, I thought they were joking.

Some of the reviews feature adjectives that aren't even actual words.I gave up on this with a half-hour yet to go.At the core of this movie is an unoriginal concept about how our lives would be very different if we made different choices in life. In this movie the mechanism isn't angels (\"It's a Wonderful Life\",\"The Family Man\") but the now overused narrative device of \"the multi-verse\".The emotional core of the movie is about a harried Asian woman and her gentle-mannered husband as well as her strained relationship with their daughter.So far so good.Then it goes off the rails. It all gets buried under a ton of overdone wire-work martial arts, much shouting and screaming and lots of frantic special effects.Like a LOT. Like about sixty minutes too much.I think it was the point where our heroine is fighting two dudes who have anal plugs dangling from their asses that I just rolled my eyes and gave up on it.At this point I was losing the thread of the plot and, honestly, didn't care about it anymore.I wanted to get on with an actual story, but we see the same scenes more or less repeated over and over. Crazy fight scene... heroine dies or seem thoroughly defeated... no, wait! She's back up again for another crazy fight scene. And another. And another. Quiet emotional scene with husband or daughter. Then MORE fighting.It's exhausting and you're a better person than I am if you can get through this endurance contest.",

            "content": "Everything Everywhere All at Once left me feeling simultaneously overwhelmed and underwhelmed. There's a lot to admire about this film. Its premise is original, the direction is very well done as is the editing, and the entire cast is genuinely great. When this film started, I thought I was going to love it, but as the movie went on I started to like it less and less. This movie feels like an art house film made for the Tik Tok generation. It's very random, overly chaotic, and absurdly fast-paced.I can't help but feel that Everything Everywhere All at Once really buckles under the weight of its own creativity. It's a film that's trying to be a lot of different things. It wants to be an art film, a sci-fi film, a kung fu film, a comedy/absurdist film, and a family drama. I admire the ambition but it really began to feel like way too much after a while. The pacing is so breakneck that I literally began to get a headache, and it was hard for me to get emotionally attached to anything in the story because the movie was just throwing so much stuff at me constantly. It felt like the directors were trying way too hard just to show off.I understood what this movie was trying to convey thematically. It's clearly a commentary on finding optimism in a nihilistic world, or in this case, worlds. I get it. But whatever genuine emotions this movie was trying to have, it all gets immediately undermined by nonstop visual gags, some of which were needlessly juvenile and all of which felt weird just for the sake of being weird. I think a great film to watch as a juxtaposition to this one is Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind. That's a great example of a weird and highly original movie that doesn't have its depth or emotional weight undermined due to its staggering creativity.I wanted to love this movie, really I did. And I understand why so many people do love it. It is different, there's no denying that, and who knows, perhaps during a rewatch I might feel differently but as of right now, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like an overhyped film that is far too chaotic for its own good.",

It's a visually impressive piece that pounds the senses and ends with a wave of feel-good fun. Everything Everywhere All at Once oozes originality and creates a new mind-bending world in which to immerse yourself.Yet, originality alone cannot carry this film. The jokes did not always land. The script was so simplistic it sometimes felt like it was directed towards children - something belied by the unnecessarily sexual nature of many scenes. Possibly the worst issue is the many plot holes. In a modern world where anything is possible, the choice of martial arts as the main medium of warfare is unexplained.To use an analogy from the film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is like a clay pot that holds your attention in the moment, but is so full of cracks that it fragments the moment you start to reflect any deeper.",

Evelyn's chaotic life includes her disaffected lesbian daughter, her invalid father with possible dementia, her husband about to present her with divorce papers if only he can get her attention, and a forthcoming tax audit which she is frantically trying to prepare for. We somehow manage to get all this from the first few minutes, despite the fact that the lead characters switch randomly between Chinese and English multiple times during sentences. Then they arrive at the tax office, her husband inexplicably changes character and slips her a cryptic message, and things get weird. What follows is a surreal scifi kungfu multiversal comedy mystery with deep emotional subtexts and buttplug-driven martial arts. In short, it is almost indescribable in any meaningful way - the title sums it up perfectly.Some people will hate it. They will find it prentious and confusing. I completely understand, because so did I for a lot of its running time. I finally understood that the jarring transitions and lack of obvious exposition are deliberate narrative devices to place the audience in the same unsettling place as Evelyn as she tries to make sense of what is happening to and around her. Editor Paul Rogers deserves either an Oscar or a long prison sentence, because his work here is either inspired or demented, or possibly both.Did I mention the performances? Did I mention how good they are? Considering how off the wall the film is, they are uniformly excellent. Committed, emotional, moving, and often very funny. Michelle Yeoh holds the film together as Evelyn manages to be put-upon, stoic, saddened by frustration, and sometimes very very silly. It is a pleasure to see Ke Huy Quan as Waymond so many years after Goonies and Indy 2 - I recognised his voice before I recognised him. Stephanie Hsu is phenomenal as daughter Joy and multiverse destroying villain Jobu Tupaki. I can't believe how long it took me to recognise the tax lady - ominously villainous and hysterically funny at the same time.Because that's another feature of this movie - it's really funny, with some great lines (You're capable of anything because you're so bad at everything.\") I laughed out loud quite often in a small auditorium. I was not alone.And, as the end approached (I still had no idea what to expect), and two rocks, one with google eyes, had a conversation in a universe where life had never begun, I wept.It's that sort of film.You may read this and think \"That sounds awful,\" in which case don't see it. You'll hate it. But if you think \"That sounds a bit different, interesting,\" then I urge you to give it a chance. I assure you that you will never have seen a film remotely like it.",

            "content": "First and foremost, you won't see a more original movie this year, or many years following. The story is not straightforward and requires several viewings to pick up on all the nuances of what is being told here. It literally is Everything Everywhere All at Once. In no way is this film meant to be serious though it does touch upon existentialism. Ok, more than touch it. It's the theme of the whole movie. In a nutshell (from what I understood) the movie shows us that every choice we make in our life creates a new alternative universe we can choose to live. Therefore we have hundreds of \"lives\" we live with regrets. How we live those lives is up to us.This is definitely a comedy more than science fiction. If you go into it with that in mind you can allow your mind to wrap around that concept. I give a ton of credit to the actors as this had to be a very hard script to put together. On top of the layers, movies are shot out of order so having to jump into the characters at random times would be a mind meld. The actors did an outstanding job with their portrayals of the layers of their life without being too much \"in\" on the joke. EEA doesn't assume we follow the plot anymore than the characters do. It doesn't insult our intelligence at the same time. Follow? Of course not. It's not meant to make complete sense. There are many stories within a story. So much of it is so outlandish that we cannot assume to take everything so seriously.There are a lot of serious tones in the film as well. Divorce, parenting mistakes, tax problems, success or the lack of it, love, and death are all there. But so are bagels, butt plugs, dogs being swung around as a weapon, hot dog fingers (I hope Dwight Shrute takes credit for that gag), and googly eyes to name a few.In the (real) end, (there is a false ending in the middle of the film) we are left wondering, \" what the hell did I just watch?\", feeling but we also can't stop thinking about \"what the hell? Did I just just watch that?\"I recommend EEA based on the themes, the acting, and originality. When someone complains there are no original ideas in Hollywood any longer, turn them on to this movie.If you like The Matrix, Kill Bill, Being John Malkovich, and Into the Spider-verse you will probably enjoy EEAAO. If you like romantic comedies and straight forward movies that walk you through every plot line then you will not get through this film.Side note: Kudos to Jamie Lee Curtis for her outlandish comedic acting. She is hardly recognizable and very funny here. Michelle Yeoh channels her Crouching Tiger...role and that's fun to watch. I also didn't realize that Short Round played her husband. He's all grown up (like we do as we age). All of them did an excellent job and we should see their names on the Oscar nomination lists soon.",

I also thought it was cool that Key Hu Quan had a lead role after such a long absence from Hollywood. That being said the movie was just terrible. Spoilers ahead. Yeoh is a Chinese immigrant who owns a laundromat. And her father comes to visit. She is afraid to introduce her daughter's girlfriend to him because homosexuals is bad in Chinese culture. She later goes to do her taxes and is visited by a version of her husband from another universe and gives her instructions. She is told she needs battle a great enemy to save her universe which we come to find out is her daughter from another universe. So essentially the message is she needs to forget her old Chinese ways and accept her gay daughter. A storyline thats been done a million times. Hollywood as a whole might be in trouble if they keep catering to one category of people. This movie had so much potential. With the ensemble cast. But it just sucked so bad. The different universes they use and sequence are just flat out dumb. I'm convinced people behind making this film paid critics and others to come on here and make reviews. It currently has 8.5 on here as I write this. What in the world ? There are classics that don't even have an 8.5 this movie should be at 6/10 at best. Don't know what is going on with the industry.

This will drive you mad. Just sit back and enjoy the mind-bending experience you are having.After that point, either it will click in your brain...or it won't. If it does - great! If not...continue to sit back and enjoy the mind-bending experience you are having.For...EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE is a trippy head-trip of a film that is certainly unique - but it also has something going for it that all good films do - characters that you will care about in a story that will touch your heart.Written and Directed by Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (SWISS ARMY MAN), EVERYTHING...tells the tale of unhappily married couple Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) and Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan), her father Gong Gong (the great James Hong) and their daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu). When interdimensional travel interrupts their mundane life, things get much, much more than mundane.Yes, folks, you read that right INTERDIMENSIONAL TRAVEL - and this is not a Marvel movie! Evelyn and family start jumping to parallel dimensions, experiencing everything, everywhere...all at once (hence, the name of the film).This is a smart, unique and visually interesting film and credit for this must go to Wang and Scheinert. They have come up with something unusual. However, they don't just do \"unusual for unusual sake\" they wrap this film up - and connect the dots - in a satisfying way in the end. Oh...and they also build in some incredibly impressive fight scenes along the way. To not hype them too much, but these are the best fight scenes that have been on film in quite some time - certainly the most interesting and unique since the JOHN WICK films.The duo, smartly, enlisted the aid of the underappreciated - but very talented - Michelle Yeoh (CRAZY RICH ASIANS) as the protagonist of this piece. It is a wise choice for she must go from mousey housewife to kick-butt SuperHero (and everywhere in between) throughout the course of this film and her Martial Arts background comes in very, very handy. It is a bravura performance by Yeoh and it would be TERRIFIC if her name is called come awards season next year (yes, it is that good of a performance).She is ably assisted by Hong (a veteran character actor with more than 450 credits to his name), Hsu (known for her role as Mei in THE MARVELOUS MRS. MAISEL) and, especially Quan (the kid \"Short Round\" who assists the hero in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM) - it was good to see Quan back on the big screen.The filmmakers also sprinkle some very strong character actors/actresses in the mix here. Both Jenny Slate (Mona-Lisa Saperstein in PARKS & REC) and Harry Shum, Jr. (GLEE, CRAZY RICH ASIANS) are fun in small roles as is the aforementioned James Hong as Gong Gong (the Grandfather).But...the person who ALMOST steals this film from Ms. Yeoh is the incomparable Jamie Lee Curtis as the somewhat overweight and out of shape IRS Agent who plays a pivotal role in Evelyn's life across the Dimensions. It is a fun role for Curtis who is not afraid to look physically bad. Again, I would LOVE IT if she got some love come awards time next year (she won't, but maybe in some other parallel Universe she would).Not for everyone - the multi-dimensional travel is going to give some folks a headache as they try to figure things out - but if you surrender yourself to the wildness that is going on, and embrace the spirit and the heart of this film, you will be rewarded with a very rich film going experience.Letter Grade: A-8 Stars out of 10 (might move up to 9 on a rewatch) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

            "content": "Charlie Kaufman once wrote \"Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you'll never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out\". I can start with nothing better to talk about an immense new movie, the Daniels' \"Everything everywhere all at once\".This hyperreal piece of art comes to us quietly sampling something that crosses our path only every decade or so to remind us that there is still more to explore in our collective cultural consciousness and that we are yet to discover a fraction of what a truly good script can do; How images can transform a script to something better, deeper, and more effective; How a harmonious marriage of script and picture can explore emotional depths that are commonly visited yet rarely understood. \"Everything everywhere all at once\" is only the second movie project of its writers/directors. Their first was a subject of small talks at drunk parties and \"the weirdest I have seen\" conversations, the story of a desperate loner who was saved by a dead body that mainly flatulates then comes alive to ask existential questions about the meaning of life, \"Swiss Army Man\". That project might have been too eccentric and much ahead of its time for the common taste, but it was a true eye-opener. Now, after 6 years since that ambitious project and the experience it distilled, comes this utterly more marvelous achievement.\"Everything everywhere all at once\" is impossible to describe and synopsizing it is unjust as it is a true and rare symbiosis of script and picture, each highlighting the other, making each and the whole something more than words can explain. But perhaps to describe it best -and you must see it yourself to try and state your own- it's a surreal psychedelic journey through the eyes of a financially struggling immigrant nuclear family with their crumbling owned business and their cyclical hopeless life and what bent it of their dying hopes, missed opportunities, decaying bounds, and their valiant efforts to maybe bring some love and tradition and purpose back to it. This essence of the story is challenged by the simple concept of \"what if\" through a theme of a multiverse with characters sliding through the different possible versions of themselves to try and find meaning through the overwhelming nonsense of their lives.There are many aspects that make this movie a bombastic one. The screenplay introduces a simple premise but then quickly, continuously, and relentlessly evolves into absurd levels that are unpredictable and, frankly, unprecedented throughout the whole runtime, effectively challenging your sense of what is \"enough\". The story is an adventure of cosmic proportions of characters and characters' versions of themselves that then is juxtaposed with its intimate origins. And so, this gargantuan design is just an external manifestation of the emotional depths of a dialogue between a mother, a father, a daughter, a grandfather, and a tax auditor in the span of 6 hours of one day of their tiny lives. It's childish and hilarious and creepy. It is a meticulous machine that keeps discovering unimaginable dimensions to portray an intense emotional and philosophical battle between purpose and nihilism, and then purpose through nihilism. The script actively prevents itself from committing to a moral conclusion. It juggles continuously -as life is and any grasp on it- between the hopeful and the hopeless and is only bound by accepting the inevitability of chaos while rejecting the perceived destiny of loneliness.This immense script wouldn't have made this piece without the visuals. Here, the actual pictures do not only serve as a representation of the script but also feel that they have their own identity. The visuals are utterly and out worldly surreal, like a Salvador Dal\u00ed or a David lynch or a stargate sequence of Kubrick's Space Odyssey. They are beautifully influenced by the exciting and fun Chinese martial arts Jackie Chan movies, the action/mystery of \"The Matrix\", the eerie imagery of Charlie Kaufman's \"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind\", \"Synecdoche New York\", and \"Adaptation\", and Wong Kar-Wai's sexy romantic spectacle \"In the mood for love\".Script and picture being their own separate entities in this movie needed a masterful editor, and here too it excels. This cinematic piece could have been easily a disorienting mess of random events and visual madness, but what the editing actually achieves is a story that is easily followed and understood with characters that are poignant, close, and intimate, creating relatability that captivates and elates. The acting is flawless, specifically on the parts of Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan, who both complete and finesse. The cinema that comes from all these passionately crafted ingredients creates what can be described as a particle accelerator that elaborately assaults the senses, with passion, from every angle, generating a hilarious, creepy, and immensely emotional journey that will undoubtedly leave you to tears on many occasions, and then latch on to you with a fantastic and inspiring after taste.The Daniels wrote and directed \"Everything everywhere all at once\" to make it look like a marvel blockbuster but with the spirit and the feel of an art-house independent picture, effectively thriving through the fierce competition that is threatening creativity in cinema. They -either willingly with the audacity of an artist, or instinctively through the passion of a child explorer- ditched the three-act structure of a script and then went above and beyond with a bizarre and mind-blowing cinematic exploration of the depths of meaning and love. It is contemporary yet traditional, enormous yet intimate, focused yet living up to its title; It is truly Everything first, everywhere second, then all together all at once. This picture is an absolute triumph, a true masterpiece, one of the best movies in the last 20 years, and one of the most beautiful things I personally have ever seen. Be sure not to miss it.",

I still loved some of the messages behind the movie but it got so repetitive and nonsensical. She acquires abilities from other people but they never explain how they can change physical elements and also out of the billion versions of the multiverse they only show like 10 versions max, while focusing only on 5.

            "content": "As \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" (2022 release; 139 min.) opens, we are introduced to Evelyn Quan, who along with her husband, runs a laundromat. For reasons unknown, the laundromat is being audited by the IRS, and a meeting with the IRS auditor does not go well. Then out of the blue, Evelyn's mind is taken over by her husband's alternative from the Alphaverse, one of apparently thousands of alternative universes out there... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comment: this is the latest from writers-producers-directors Daniel Kwam and Daniel Scheineret (a/k/a \"the Danierls\"). This is only their second feature length movie, after 2016's critically acclaimed \"Swiss Army Man\". Like that movie, in \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" they bring a highly original premise and story line. Frankly, the plot is so off kilter that it doesn't even make any sense, nor need it be. Instead, one simply sits back and enjoys whatever is unfolding on the screen. Michelle Yeoh is outstanding as Evelyn. I didn't realize that the IRS auditor is played by Jamie Lee Curtis until the credits rolled. I don't know if others felt the same, but I felt a bit overwhelmed, if npot exhausted, by it all and I watched the entire movie over two equal parts on consecutive evenings. That does not mean that I didn't like the movie, let me be clear.\"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" was an unexpected box office hit during its US theatrical run that started last Spring, For whatever reason I just didn't feel drawn to it. Then earlier this week, it gathered an amazing 11 Oscar nominations, more than any other film, and I told myself I really needed to find out what the buzz was all about. I watched the film earlier this week (it's streaming on Showtime). Glad I did. If you are in the mood for truly something very different and uniquely original, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",

            "content": "There's no question that EEAAO is one of the most well-regarded movies of the year, and it's leading the charge in Oscar nominations with a total of 11. It's is to be expected, since it's very much not a blockbuster and more the type of film the Academy would tend to award. At the same time, it is a bit of a surprise given that it's a very out-there kind of movie, with an almost outrageous concept and even more outlandish execution.That being said, it's almost a miracle that this movie works at all, given that it is very true to its title, it's a lot of things at the same time. Incidentally, that's what takes a lot of people out of the movie.In a very summarized way, EEAAO tells the story of Evelyn, an immigrant middle-aged woman from China living in the US, where she manages a failing laundromat with her husband Waymond and daughter Joy. Her marriage to Waymond is failing, her daughter Joy feels like her mom does not truly understand her for who she is and resents her for it and the laundromat is at risk of closure due to an imminent IRS audit.At this critical moment in her life, Evelyn finds herself day-dreaming about what her life could have been like, and incidentally, people from other dimensions pop into her life and ask her help in stopping an interdimensional threat that is on the verge of destroying the entire multiverse and dooming it all to non-existence. In combating this threat, Evelyn understands the true value to be found in her simple life and re-contextualizes her outlook on the world and on her relationships.On paper, this seems wacky enough, but what's interesting is that the character work on Evelyn and the overall themes of the movie are pretty grounded and not wacky at all. If the multiverse aspects of the plot were removed you would have a typical premise for a drama about a struggling family of Chinese immigrants struggling to integrate socially and financially in the ruthless capitalist system of the United States. And that would be pretty Oscar-bait in itself with plenty of social commentary going on, which is fine. But EEAAO, having those dramatic components, uses the premise of looking at alternative versions of your life as a twist on that premise to heighten the themes in a pretty creative way.Mind you, the multiverse stuff is not just a gimmick used to make the plot seem or artsy, indie, or wacky for the sake of it. While I understand it may seem that way, what it actually does, besides breaking genre tropes, is expand the themes of the character story underneath and turn it into a more existential exploration of what we value in life, no matter how small or meaningless, of the need to reject nihilism, and of how a different perspective can change our whole outlook of ourselves and others. The movie just wouldn't allow for that if that part of the movie was excluded.That said, this is a big reach for a movie with a small budget and contained settings, so you really have to let your imagination run wild to embrace the concept as it develops and that might be a stretch for some. The editing is fast, cuts are even faster, the movie rarely slows down to fit it all in. It works amazingly well for me and is a testament to economic film making and sharp editing, but for others it came off as disorienting.It goes without saying that the acting is pretty damn good from everyone in this small cast, they completely buy into it and run with every crazy concept, which makes them land as they should. Additionally, there are scenes that are so incredibly hilarious in concept alone that it made wish I had such ideas.In the end, if this movie isn't for you, I understand. It is kind of absurd, very silly at several points, incredibly fast-paced and definitely unfamiliar to most audiences. But even if that is the case, before you judge it a 1/10, consider the scene with Waymond talking about how he fights, or with Evelyn reconnecting with Joy in the parking lot at the end of the movie. Because those, to an extent, embody the true point, the message of the movie, and solidify the fact that there is something being said here besides people with sausages for fingers, googly eyes and Ratatouille references (all of which are great jokes for me).Consider also, that even if you like movies that are more grounded in essence, plot and character, we have a lot of movies like Elvis (as an example only, I know Elvis is good), or Top Gun: Maverick (again, great movie, but it's a sequel, it's more Top Gun), or The Fabelmans (it's another Steven Spielberg movie, directed in the same way, with little innovation). There are not a lot of movies like EEAAO, it shares similarities with other multiverse stories in concept alone, but it uses that concept to explore entirely different things, in a different way, with a shoestring budget and somehow doesn't fall apart.That's impressive to me, it is to be commended, and it's how the art of making movies evolves and avoids stagnation. Just my opinion.",

Then came a level of saturation as I had my fill of weirdness but the ride was still continuing; only I wasn't enjoying it anymore.The film is about a middle-aged woman trying to make peace with her life choices and the miserable situation she ended up in. In another life, she could have been a singer, chef or even an actress and on the way to filing her taxes, she gets a chance to experience all those possibilities... at the same time. Michelle Yeoh makes this film work thanks to her diverse skillset ranging from martial arts to emotional sensitivity. Jamie Lee Curtis was another standout with the mannerisms and maniacal facial expressions.The chaotic nature of the film blends ridiculousness, Jackie Chan action and comedy which you might find enjoyable depending on your taste. The creativity is next level but as the film progresses, many of the elements begin to look weird for the sake of weirdness. The creators layered the story with philosophical and nihilistic elements but it's hard to pay attention to them when you have a chubby girl with a pig fighting people with dildos. It is also a parody of movies like Kill Bill, Ratatouille and others but instead of paying homage, it looks like one of the Scary Movies.Narrative-wise, they skillfully managed to present a complex topic in a digestible manner while integrating impressive action and humor. There was supposedly some emotion in it, but the lackluster pacing with 5 climaxes spawning endless new cycles diluted any semblance of heart, causing the actual ending to feel unsatisfactory. It is definitely a fun movie that people should see because of its unique premise and cool nature, I just don't understand why is everyone worshipping it.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV Show reviews.",

And there is no contrast here.It is action-packed, but again too much. The tension doesn't build up to explode, it is high all the time. But that is just not the way our brain works. You can't engage in a 2 hour long action scene, so you just disconnect every now and then.The script has interesting and original concepts about philosophy, mother-daughter relations and life as a whole, but those are just drops in an ocean that is too overcrowded, and thus they don't create the impact they should.It feels as if the whole movie were a plateau instead of a mountain (or a mountain range). It is high, but it is so flat it feels like a plain. So it becomes boring.All of the above combined is utterly irritating, and makes the movie hard to watch.On the other side, the cast is great, there are funny moments, and the whole concept of a middle aged wife as an action hero is brilliant.

The story is not great and a bit immature, the characters are 2 dimensional with (ironically) no character development. It's not really a deep film even though the underlying theme is the importance of love and helping each other.Yes, there are special effects, and it type of fits in the genre of super hero action films, but the story makes jokes around taxes, and has strong mother/daughter relationships theme as well as making a comment about accepting lesbianism (despite tradition), and accepting yourself even if you are rubbish at everything. So it covers allot of ethical ground.Given that there are people with hot dogs for fingers, a world with talking rocks (with googley eyes) as well as a bagel that's looked at with religious fervour, you can see why such scenes are reminiscent of Monty Python. However, it's not really a comedy, just flipant light hearted crazyness.Was it fun? Yes, but story wasn't great and to be honest the film is easily missable. Probably Michelle Yeoh's worst film, through no fault of her own. Will you regret watching it? Maybe not if you are not expecting something truly emotional or serious. Of course effects were good.. and I guess that's the point and the level it's pitched at.So, don't watch if you want something mature, but feel free to watch it if you are a teenager looking for something fun/light-hearted. I'd say for kids under 14 there's a bit where daughter is beating someone bloody with huge rubber dildos and plenty of fighting (but not gruesome), so wouldn't recommend for lower than 14.",

            "content": "There is too much to say about Everything Everywhere All At Once to neatly summarize it here -- and there's a good chance you've already heard everyone else mention it anyway. I've seen people call this their new favorite film of all time, and while I'm not prepared to go that far (almost out of protest, since the film has amassed a weirdly touchy fanbase), I can see why this has moved a great many people:The way that its relentlessly zany multiverse-hopping actually has thought behind it and stays largely consistent. The way it takes cues from the Wachowskis, Wong-Kar Wai, Douglas Adams, and even Pixar while still feeling original. The way it makes us teary-eyed at even the goofiest sights. The way that its initial craziness -- its full understanding of the fact that an infinite multiverse brings infinite possibilities of comedy and action (take notes, Marvel) -- eventually leads to oddly poignant musings on purpose, meaning, and the futility of worrying over what one's life could've been; in harping on the paths one could've taken, at the expense of what's already there; of endlessly pondering what power we have in the great cosmic comedy that might already have its ending planned when all you really should be focusing on is holding someone's hand (whether or not you inhabit a universe where everyone has sausage fingers).It's not that we're all \"small and stupid\" and that life is pointless in the grand scheme; it's that the point of life may as well be a simple one.And really, I think something similar can be said of the way that people connected with this film. For all the nifty things about it and all its \"grand\" ambitions, it's ultimately just a sweet movie about family.The mother-daughter dynamic at the center isn't new, but it's rare to see it mainly from the mother's perspective. She's played excellently by Michelle Yeoh, who is backed by a hilarious Jamie Lee Curtis, a cute-yet-menacing Stephanie Hsu, a similarly multifaceted Ke Huy Quan, and of course, the utterly legendary James Hong, still on fire at nearly 100.I'd say \"go see it\" but you probably already have.",

The premise sounded intriguing: a Chinese-American woman who can access infinite realities and use her alternate selves to save the universe. But the execution was sloppy, confusing and boring. The movie tried too hard to be quirky and meta, but it ended up being a mess of clich\u00e9s and nonsense. The characters were flat and unlikable, the plot was full of holes and contradictions, and the special effects were cheap and cheesy. The movie wasted the talents of Michelle Yeoh, who deserved a better script and direction. I don't understand why this movie got so much hype and praise from critics and audiences alike. It was a waste of time and money. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.",

            "content": "This film has great depth and the themes within it were great. It looks at such things as interconnectedness, family, personal power, free will, and the epidemic of the modern age - nihilism. In a world which seems determined to deconstruct absolutely every cornerstone on which society and humanity has been built, even down to the most intimate parts of ourselves e.g. Gender, nihilism to many feels like an inescapable black hole the devil pushes them towards and that they constantly struggle to avoid being sucked into. The Bagel is a representation of that lurking black hole that Joy has almost given into. Though many films have brooding or dark characters burdened by nihilism, Everything Everywhere is brave enough to build a film around it as the central obstacle for overcoming, and to have an open discussion about it, and is brave enough even to put forward an antidote - love. We need more films brave enough to offer people stories and forums for making sense of the challenge of finding meaning in our perplexing and chaotic modern world. So I enjoyed the depth within the film very much.It is also totally original in its style of execution and blending of genres. I've not seen a film quite like it before. It is a mix of superhero, sci-fi, action, comedy, and pulls influences from many places, often in an obvious and conspicuous way which makes it feel rather meta. It is a clear homage to such films as The Matrix, Police Story, and the MCU. It was so original in style that while watching it I was unable to form much judgment or grasp any familiar holds with which to make sense of it. I just had to watch it as if with a child's mind, to take it all in to make sense of only later on. So this part of the experience was also enjoyable and, as a film fan, the inspiration admirable.However, at the end of the day when all is said and done, I didn't get into the story or the characters all that much. The acting didn't match the ambition of the film, the jokes largely fell flat. And it suffered from what most superhero movies do, which is having way too many gratuitous action sequences.So overall, it has depth and enjoyable ideas and is definitely one to watch and has earned its place in film history with its originality. But it doesn't have the characters or emotional affect for me to be excited about watching it again.",

The message shared at the end is a message I agree with, the plot sounds interesting, the actors are amazing actors, and it's great to have some changes in the typical cast of Hollywood movies... but the movie's jokes and comedy scenes felt like they were aimed at teenagers (particularly a few scenes that I would definitely had laughed about with some of my friends when I was in high school).

            "content": "The Dans have managed a marvelous achievement with this movie, in that neither me nor anyone with me lost interest for a moment throughout its entire duration. \"Everything Everywhere\" is frenetic, feverish, beautiful, strange, and ambitious - and it reminds me why I love to go to the movies.I've just seen something the likes of which are mostly wholly original. A dash of culture clash for comedy, a sprinkle of family disconnect for drama, and a whopping platter of multiverse (just barely hanging on to science fiction) are familiar from other works. Yet in this concoction, it's bliss to my dumb little brain that aches to be entertained with something new each time I visit a theater.I loved the whole cast, but I'd like to note Stephanie Hsu, who proved she had chops in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel but enraptured me with her role as the complicated Joy. I enjoyed the honesty with which other characters were portrayed - their failures, flaws, and even kinks help illustrate (and illuminate) them. I was taken in by their chemistry and made to laugh at their weirdness. And anytime a legend like Jamie Lee Curtis holds nothing back, I know I'm watching a special production.The unfortunate thing is, I think many people will be put off by the colossal questions the Dans tackle. It's not like they were actually trying to solve the mysteries of the universe, but they do prod it and play with it in colorful fashion; and any time you dabble with existential confusion, it can draw away from concrete ideas that actually do have answers. I think the filmmakers achieve something beautiful with this film, because despite their exploration of \"the meaning of life\" (worded more accurately as \"our feeling like small pieces of $#!t\"), they manage to loop back to simple offerings. Such as, perhaps simple emotion, shared with a loved one, is worthy of our perseverance. Or better yet - perhaps nothing matters at all, so why not just enjoy our time here. There is brilliance in squashing high concepts into digestible thoughts, and it's done in satisfying fashion here. Credit to the performances who sell their emotions, because without them it wouldn't have worked.Then there's the pure joy of sitting through a hallucinogenic, action-packed, billion-colored stream of scenes, each one with its own hilarious Chekhov's guns and costumes and props of absurd variety. It's excitement you can cash in at the end and chew on for awhile.It's not a perfect movie, but who am I to point out its flaws? I thought the pacing was too delirious in the first act, but someone else might call it effective. Some jokes didn't land because of their goofiness, but a different audience could have laughed. I really have few complaints. It's rare to witness something so unique shine so bright. Sometimes I feel like I've seen every \"kind\" of movie, but then one like this (or Parasite, Her, Good Time, or the directors' previous standout Swiss Army Man) reminds me I'll never have seen it all.One thing I know for sure is that I'm buying a ticket to every movie these two men make for the rest of their careers. I can't believe this early season of movies includes a gem as lovely as this one.",

I give major props for the ambition and for showing me so many things I've never seen before. And the fight scenes, although scarce, are pretty awesome. Unfortunately this movie really doesn't work for me.The first major issue is the comedy. I laughed a few times but most of the comedy fell completely flat for me. Comedy is subjective, so others might feel differently. My audience laughed more than me but not nearly as much as the movie wanted them to.Another major issue is the weird factor. It goes way too far. Most of it is amusing but at some point it starts feeling weird for weird's sake. This is especially true when it comes to the story. There's not enough concrete to grasp onto. It starts feeling like a bunch of nonsense.Lastly, the pacing and narrative don't feel smooth at all. It was difficult to tell where I was in the movie (for example, nearing the climax). Here's my theory on why:Some movies will have what I call an epiphany moment. A moment where everything comes together, usually accompanied by heightened musical score and flashes to different moments. It usually happens in the climax and evokes emotion. In this movie, the epiphany moments comprise what seems like 35% of the movie. Scattered throughout the movie, not just at the end. But nothing ever comes together. It just keeps getting stranger with more questions.In the end I had a pretty bad time with this movie. And I'm annoyed I drove 40 minutes to watch it in one of two theaters playing it in the Chicagoland area, which has 100+ theaters. (1 viewing, 4/4/2022)",

And none of those are really the main storyline. The main storyline is a troubled mother and daughter struggling to connect due to a variety of factors. And it's later revealed that this issue stretched across multiple universes and realities to which it manifests itself in an absolutely bonkers way. The movie sometimes puzzles over what reality....is....man...you know. And how small we are, whatever we are.Overall I felt the pace and moment where the 2nd act meats the 3rd act was the weakest part. I felt like it the pacing near the last 45 minutes seemed too slow as well. I also think it might have been improved if one or two of the alternative universes had been cut to keep the story more digestible.But overall I had a fun time. I want to reassure people that I'm not someone who always loves crazy, artsy, sci-fi movies. I despised, the Matrix movies, Tenet and The Green Knight movies for instance. And all of those films have similarities to this one. However, this movie has moments which I found very funny. It doesn't treat the sci-fi concepts too seriously when they're clearly ridiculous. And it does take the family dynamic between the characters seriously. And that to me makes this movie worth watching and recommending. It's probably more fun to see while on drugs. I'm sure it has as a lot of interesting Easter eggs to spot on additional viewings as well. The acting and cinematography are great. The script is good given how many issues it could have had for how ambitious the scale is for this story. Overall, it's a film I would recommend.

Everything , Everywhere and All at once.Everything (Part 1) was the best of the three, the last part is only about 10 minutes long. If part 1 had ended the film, which it appeared to do , I think this would have been worthy of a 10 but part 2 kicked in and it was a bit long. You know when you start looking at the clock wondering when this is all going to get wrapped up. Don't get me wrong its still very good and the fight scenes are something to behold. Especially the one involving a butt plug (yes you need to watch this)/. So excellent film if it got a snip in part 2 it would have been a 10,",

What if we stopped equating tiny with insignificant? What if the more minuscule we discovered ourselves to be, the LARGER our world became, and the more SIGNIFICANT we felt? So it's not surprising that Daniels take us on the most inventive, overstuffed, relentless journey only to land us in the simplest, most heartfelt of places. That's the real judo-move here -- an infectious, goofy sweetness that extends even to the (hundreds? Thousands?) of action set pieces. Anyone can dimension-hop and fight the baddies.

However, I'm not really sure this movie feels like an artsy, indie drama/action flick. It feels more like a parody of one. In fact, this movie frustrated me so badly it nearly ruined the double date I was on because of how irrationally angry I was getting.There are some really, really weird decisions in this movie from a production standpoint, and plotholes so big you could drive a semi through them.How about why does the bad Joy always look like she hopped off the set of a Kanye music video and didn't even bother changing before filming her scenes? Her multitude of costumes didn't strike me as \"multidimensional\" so much as \"crackhead popstar\". Or are you trying to tell me that in the multitude of dimensions, Joy is only this woman's daughter in like two and a crackhead popstar in every other one?And did we *really* need a dimension based on the throwaway gag of \"raccacoonie\". Talk about taking me out the movie...except there wasn't much of a movie to be taken out from in the first place. I had literally forgotten the plot halfway through the movie and it wasn't until Waymond said something about the main character's plan working that I recalled what the was going on and it wasn't just more \"fighting bad guys time\". Honestly, half this movie felt like some drawn-out, never ending fight scene.In short, thin, fast-paced, muddled plot buried under flashy expensive visuals, childish humor and frustrating production decisions. Potheads with art degrees will probably say this is one of the best movies of this year. That's fine, everyone's entitled to their own opinions, but honestly I left this movie feeling like I could throttle someone I was so angry.EDIT: Now that I've had some more time to digest this pretentious mess, I think the main issue with this film is that it stretches the plot way too thin too fast and then piles on a nearly non-stop chase/fight sequence with flashy visuals and usually only sees the characters exposition dumping while in the middle of the action. Or told through fast moving subtitles that you will spend more time trying to keep up with than actually watching the movie.This movie should really be called \"Way Too Much of Everything Not Anywhere All at Once\" or \"ADHD the Movie\". I guess if you find kicking dogs and using them as weapons funny, you'll like this movie.",

I hadn't, and still haven't seen the Daniels' previous film 'Swiss Army Men', but the abundance of praise this film was receiving is what made me so excited to see it, reading some of the reviews I knew that, at the very least, I'd like it, but, in all honestly I wasn't expecting to love it as much I did; I had heard of the film's creativity and overall just unique feel, but I still don't think I was fully prepared for the madness that awaited me. The story, in its most simplistic description, focuses on a Chinese woman named Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) trying to do her taxes, and this very simplistic premise, which, by the way, does spin off into an utterly chaotic multiverse plot, is one of the film's greatest strengths, as, despite all of the hyperactivity and action, the plot isn't overstuffed, its very simplistic premises allows its more symbolic elements and emotional beats to flourish more freely, and, in turn, be more impactful. The film's humour was the thing I was worried about the most, as I am very specific, or, more honestly, very picky, when it comes comedy, the bizarre, in-your-face nature of the comedy in the film, as showcased in the trailer, anyway, can work for me, but typically, I prefer more low-key comedy. However, the comedy here surprised me by being both utterly bizarre yet, surprisingly the film's dialogue has a very sarcastic vibe to it, the film manages to combine to styles of very different types of humour to create a completely new and unique comedic experience. The performances are probably some of my favourites since 'Parasite', everyone brings their A-game, though, Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Qaun particularly stunned me. However, all of the stuff mentioned above wouldn't have mattered if it weren't for the Daniels' phenomenal direction (and writing, though I did already cover that) as well as the truly sensational editing by Paul Rogers, which brought the film together so well.'Everything Everywhere' is such a unique and special film, that already feels like a classic, and a testament to what filmmaking can be and do.",

I don't get how this movie got an 8.2 score, I even had doubts about the movie's file I've downloaded, I had to check the trailer on YouTube to be sure.The main problem of this movie is that there is no logic. The story won't remain loyal even to its own logic. The first 15 minutes is just irrelevant prologue about the lesbian daughter and stressful life of business and family. Then in the elevator scene we get informed that husband is from another dimension and there is no time, So the main character has to defeat an \"enemy\" in another dimension in the middle of an IRS meeting. After that, there is no destination or logic, just random battles and random dimension visits without any hurry. After an hour, comes the realization that the story hasn't progressed even a tiny bit and probably there is no story.So this movie is a great example of why movies should have stories, non-random-well-thought stories. A better title for the movie would be \"Everything everywhere all at random in favor of protagonists, because we couldn't think of anything more sensible\". From other positive reviews, I suspect that maybe you have to be a stoner or acid user (which I am not) to enjoy this film. With all said and bad acting, the only relatively positive side of this movie is special effects. Bottom line: This is a bad Kong fu movie with some stupidest sci-fi backstory, that some may enjoy.",

Well, it was special and I enjoyed it even though I felt like stuck in a nightmare watching the scenes and jokes repeating again and again. What sounded like a genius plot at first, quickly becomes an everlasting dad joke as the story unfolds.Ironically, the story lacks of dimensions. It felt like we are served a nice chocolate mousse as a starter and then the main course is also a chocolate mousse and surprise surprise the dessert is also a chocolate mousse. You still eat it because you like it but it does not taste the same at some point.One important disclaimer comes from the fact that I did not watch EEAAO in the theater, which I heard is a game changer. However, I do not believe that sound or visual effects could improve the flatness of the jokes.",

            "review_title": "A Revolutionary Game Changer in Profound Storytelling",
            "content": "Rarely does a film manage to explore so many themes about the multiverse all at once successfully, because the ones that do have to defy all plausibility to achieve a worthwhile story. In the case of Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert's latest feature Everything Everywhere All At Once, the endless imagination shown on screen has never felt so sincere. With the film having garnished critical acclaim from critics and moviegoers alike, one has to wonder how this movie managed to pull off an overly complicated multiverse premise. The answer, as simple as it may sound, lies in one unhappy woman in an unfulfilled life.The film stars Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Quan Wang, a Chinese American woman who faces a serious IRS audit. Upon discovering a more serious threat in parallel universes, Wang must connect with alternate versions of herself to prevent ultimate multiverse destruction. With that premise established, not even that synopsis alone can summarize how overly complex the storytelling is. By subverting this story of an unhappy woman's life in her failing business along with her naive husband Waymond and changing adult daughter Joy, the film knows how to balance its highly tense tone with a lot of absurdist humor and familial pathos. On top of that, there can't even be one genre to describe the movie, as there are numerous elements of black comedy, sci-fi fantasy, martial arts action, and even experimental animation. Of course, at the story's heart is a bittersweet domestic drama dealing with marital problems, immigration trauma and a struggling mother-daughter relationship. In the end, the creative elements cleverly service the swirling multiverse angle in lieu of a straightforward drama.In analyzing the meaning of life through generational nihilism and otherworldly profoundness, the filmmakers accomplished telling so many different stories while bringing them all back to the main focus. While the film can go on a bit long in its excessive imagination, it makes every scene worth the runtime with a fun mix of entertaining fluff and emotional substance. For all of the entertaining action choreography, gripping stakes and hilarious transition from one weird world to another, the craziness has a purpose in developing Evelyn past her mistakes in order to move towards being a better person. Given how much society tends to put down those who think outside our own universe, never has one whole movie felt like such a relatable palate cleanser. Maybe it might be from the cast's spot on performances, especially depending on the universe, but seeing so many different points of view on one subject matter alone makes the experience far more sympathetic than it might have been without everything occurring all at once. It's all out there in the best possible way.Of all the weirdly unconventional thrill rides of a motion picture in the history of filmmaking, very few seem to even come close to the absurd brilliance of Everything Everywhere All At Once. While it might seem like a lot to take in as far as tackling so much in more than two hours, it will surely inspire at least one human being to find proper meaning in their life once and for all. Regardless of who you are and where you are, I would recommend this to everyone in the world. It's a movie with a lot on its mind, just like how you will feel after seeing it. That alone is worth risking everything for just one view.",

This would be one of those instances where I would like to say best thing I have ever seen in years. I am a big franchise movie fan but this would knock all of it out of the park. It is a low budget movie so of course can't expect like Marvel level CGI or anything but the storytelling and the concepts were the real art about this and yes the acting don't forget that. So, the movie is basically about exploring the multiverse by switching personalities and being everything to protect the end of it from your daughter. Movie is separated into 3 parts, Part 1 being hilarious. I have never laughed as much as I did in this movie and so did everyone else in my theatre. Part 2, is emotional, drama and with epic fights and Part 3 the shortest 5 min with a really satisfying conclusion. The Daniels throw you in a loop, after Part 1 where you think it ends. The movie makes use of simple concepts like maybe wearing shoes on the wrong foot to explore multiverse. Though it might sound weird but it all pans out better than expected. They do follow all the multiversal rules.The movie also explores sexuality in a sense and inter family relationships and how to look at the positives. A lot of great scenes and don't forget this but the rock is one of the best and the plug is even better. Won't reveal the details. Michelle Yeoh is the best at this one. She is just marvelous and I can't get enough. Daniels makes a rather budgeted spectacle and I think the movies story is why RUSSO Brothers invested in this project.All in all, a perfect masterpiece.

She is in the process of getting divorced from her husband, her laundry business is struggling, she has distant relationships with her family including her own daughter and she is being audited by the IRS. On the day she and her family go to a meeting with an IRS inspector, her husband's mind gets taken over by someone from the Alpha Universe. Evelyn Wang learns that she needs to connect with different versions of herself in different timelines. This is because there is an evil entity named Jobu Tupaki that is seemingly trying to destroy the different universes. In the parallel universes, Evelyn learns different skills to fend off against her enemies which seem similar to her hobbies.Going into Everything Everywhere All at Once, I was pretty excited for it, but also a little worried that it might be overhyped due to the sheer acclaim it received over the past few weeks. Just from the trailer alone, this looked unique and stunning. It looked like the type of movie that I dream of seeing in theaters. Original, action-packed, creative and funny. I prepared myself for a movie with a bonkers story... and yet it still manages to stun me.I do not think there has ever been a movie that I have watched in a theater that left me speechless the way Everything Everywhere All at Once did. I don't think I have seen a movie as creative and original as this... ever, at least as far as brand new movies go. EEAaO takes its already insane premise and goes as deep as possible with it exploring different possibilities a single person could live, how it can all go wrong for them in seconds and how when a person decides to go rogue and stop caring, it affects the people they are around. Watching this movie made me think of all of the possibilities I could have had and what decisions I made led me to where I am today. That was one of the biggest takeaways I had from the story and the script does a wonderful job exploring this insane premise to its fullest.But of course, you cannot have a story like this and not have humor. This is one of the funniest movies I have seen. The jokes in this film had me cracking up like crazy. It can go from physical comedy to more subtle things like references and situational comedic moments such as making fun of the chosen one trope or how Evelyn's world keeps going from the Alpha Universe to her normal universe. That leads to some hilarious moments of physical comedy. For me though, the funniest scene in the entire film is a specific fight with Jobu Tupaki against a few of the security guards. That scene made my mouth drop like no other scene did. I could not believe the utter nonsense I was watching and I loved every minute of it. This movie is comedy gold as it is not afraid to push the boundaries at all.Despite the wacky nature of the script, the movie does not lose its way of the sad and touching moments such as Evelyn's relationships with her family and spouse both in this universe, and in the parallel universes. This leads to me Evelyn herself. Despite Evelyn's rude attitude and unpleasant nature, you cannot help but feel bad for her during this film. She is shown how successful she could have been, she seems to get frustrated about everything and everyone and she her relationships with her family are distant at best and disastrous at worst. However, you can still she has a caring and loving side and her experience through the multiverse shows her this side of her. In fact, the multiverse shows several different sides of Evelyn! She uses them in combat to go from being a confused and scared woman to being just as strong as Alpha Waymond. This makes Evelyn a very intriguing and flawed protagonist that I enjoyed watching develop.Michelle Yeoh is terrific as Evelyn Wang. Every single expression, emotion and line of dialogue she delivers are all on point. Yeoh captures the fear, confusion and fright a woman who is exploring alternate timelines of herself has while fighting against people controlled by others in the multiverse trying to kill her. I'm not too familiar with Yeoh's filmography, but this movie makes me want to see more of her films. Then there is Ke Huy Quan as Evelyn's husband, Waymond. This man has so much diversity in this role from a bumbling, but kindhearted family man who is struggling just as much as Evelyn is to a badass agent from the Alpha Universe. He is perfect in both roles and he is a great action star too. However, the scenes where he is Evelyn's husband work beautifully because of his sincerity and sweetness in the role. Quan shows how diverse he is with this role as the same man with two vastly different personalities.The rest of the performances are great too like James Hong showing great comedic chops as Evelyn's father while showing some hidden depths to that character, Jenny Slate as a bratty customer and Stephanie Hsu as Evelyn's daughter Joy and as the villain Jobu Tupaki. Just like Evelyn, Tupaki had some depth to her actions. Hsu captures the creepy vibe from her character as well as those depths that are explored. Jamie Lee Curtis as the IRS agent also manages to give a performance that shows a soft spot to her seemingly cold hearted nature which makes her shine. Finally, Harry Shum Jr. Cracked me up in his role in the movie, but I don't want to spoil it. All in all, this is a fantastic cast.There are even some martial arts fight scenes and they are a blast to watch. I love the editing techniques used in them. They make the fights energetic and fast paced without making them confusing and shaky. Each fight had me smiling because they involved wacky antics as well making them all feel different from each other. The cinematography is beautiful as well with many shots reflecting the situation Evelyn is in with her different dimensions as well as her fractured relationships. The sound design is what really shines though. This movie sounds amazing with how it sets up the tone of the film and how it portrays the fighting sequences as fun, but brutal. The soundtrack is awesome as well with a beautiful musical score and some great vocal tracks as well.Everything Everywhere All at Once is not only easily the best movie I have seen this year so far, but it is my favorite movie that I have seen in theaters in years. In a world where there are so many franchise films and remakes and reboots, this is the type of film I love seeing come out. It has so much to say about decisions, love, hatred and family while being hilarious, awesome and original at the same time. While I think some people may be turned off by some of the trippiness of the movie and visuals, I highly recommend this movie to everyone who wants to see a great original film. Seriously, if you have plans to go to the movies soon, this is a must watch. I don't think I will ever see another film like Everything Everywhere All at Once.",

            "content": "I was amazed at the reception of this film, seeing all the glowing reviews and praise this film was getting. It was encouraging to see plus the fantastic box office as well meaning it wasn't just snobby critics that liked this film but general audiences as well.Wow was I disappointed by the outcome after watching this film. I feel as if I have watched something completely different to what everyone else saw.Firstly I completely respect the craftsmanship this film is made with, it is very unique, original and bold. I have to give the filmmakers/writers credit with that. Cannot claim they are doing something boring and re-done many many times. I can also understand how that would resinate with people and become popular, plus the allure of an A24 production. Also what a boost this must be for the Asian community having such a huge film like this be so popular in \"western\" culture, huge win!It's all good being original, however its still got work as one cohesive film. That is why I do sort of feel that this film might be a \"me\" problem as well. I never got on board with the story right from the get go. Never got behind the characters, never felt attached to them in any way shape or form. This 100% feels like a film that needs multiple viewings to be appreciated and understood fully. However I was never enjoying myself watching this.........the multi-universe wall breaking concept, although fascinating, becoming very boring quickly! At some points it was almost cheesy, not a good sign!More felt like \"To much going on\" all at once! Nothing felt cohesive as if this film had like 20 writers working on it all at once. This film aims for stars, for me it facepalms the moon....... I can see where its going and its potential however for me I just never could get into the story. It introduces a new thing and then within minutes its onto the next, nothing gets to marinade and breath.Maybe I'll re-watch it again in the future and it'll click for me? I'm on the fence, I appreciate and can see the talent on had with the concept of the story and the directing....(acting is also fine in the film)......Sadly for me it doesn't work overall.50% out of 100.",

And let me just say that it was a mistake on my account.The storyline in \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\", as written by Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, was rather impressive. It was a very original storyline, one that proved every bit entertaining and enjoyable, as it was bizarre and hilarious. There were so many things going on in \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\", that the movie is well worth watching more than just once.I was initially drawn to the movie as it had Michelle Yeoh on the cast list, and she was spectacular in this movie. I dare say that her performance in this 2022 movie makes it worth the 139 minutes of watching the movie. Now, she wasn't alone in carrying the movie, because the entire cast performed quite well. It was a blast to see Jamie Lee Curtis in this movie and in such a role. The movie also had the legendary James Hong on the cast list.Visually then \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" is a trip in its own. There are so many things going on that it is hard to take it all in at once. And as such, the movie can easily be seen more than a single time. And the visual effects in the movie as spot on and look good, which definitely talks in favor of the movie.\"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" was a blast of a surprise and a very enjoyable movie. Keep in mind, that the storyline itself is a bit spaced out and out there, but it works so wonderfully well. This movie from writers and directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert is a movie that I warmly recommend you to watch.My rating of \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.",

It might have been predictable in some developments, unrealistic in others (even with the weird rules it sets for itself, but for obviously-fabricated-memorable-moments) and a few lows and slow-paced scenes. But it doesn't matter, because execution is everything! I was entertained, touched and excited as well. It does things we expect and but it also delivers something you probably have only ever imagined. And it works very well.

            "content": "Without spoiling you, basically this is just another nihilistic movie about existential crisis that states the solution for finding a reason to don't suicide is loving your family and your partner therefore this movie disappointed me. If I had known this movie has a such point of view I wouldn't watch it. I only gave 5 out of 10 just because of its sense of humour, otherwise the movie is very empty uninteresting movie. I liked cinematography, the style of the movie and the acting in general but these had no effect on my score.So, what if you cannot love anybody but yourself and you don't care about having a partner? That's why this movie is primitive because it assumes everyone cares about their biological programming. It's better to only love yourself and enjoy your life by enjoying yourself by being yourself no matter what. But according to this movie everyone would suicide when they don't have family and they don't have a partner which doesn't make sense.In detail, it just didn't make sense when people start to have existential crisis just because they could travel between parallel universes. And it didn't make sense why they started to believe \"nothing matters\". It doesn't make sense because if you are such a person you would believe \"nothing matters\" when you living your only one life so how being aware of living in lots of parallel universes can make you believe \"nothing matters\"? In real life people don't suicide because somehow they enjoy their life and they have no reason to suicide. It's not about what matters. It's all about they believe living life is better than suiciding even though they may believe \"nothing matters\".I also think the idea of \"nothing matters\" depends on the context. For example when you have a husband and a child who loves and needs you, your life and therefore everything matters because you have to be part of the family so you have to judge everything in the context of if it will hurt your family or not. That's how family works. But for example for me it wouldn't matter to do something to save the human race because the human race doesn't matter to me. They will die anyway so what's the point? In that regard I think \"nothing about the human race matters\" as well as \"nothing about my life matters\" but I didn't have to be aware of my lives in parallel universes and I'm not suicidal. Carpe diem, bruh. No reason to be emo about it. But I think Nacho Cheese Doritos matters because it taste so good.I think it was the right choice to make this movie have a decent sense of humor otherwise I would stop watching this movie after like 30 minutes because it was very boring but I stayed for the sense of humour. The Crazy random interesting sense of humour saved my day.",

The presentation was creative and clean (for the most part) and the multiverse system was consistent and well explained. The premise itself is refreshing and the themes around generational trauma, and the choice we have to choose what matters when nothing matters were cohesive. The absurdist humor was obnoxious, as well as the action sequences (fanny pack kung fu, pinky kung fu, etc..) though it was nice to see the Bruce lee standing punch. It makes no sense how Evelyn was able to take a beating throughout the film even with multiversal fighting skills she's still an older lady who shouldn't even be remotely able to take a punch unscathed.

It's constant throughout the film and it was really irritating me by the end\n2) I thought the film did well to establish set rules to how the multiverse hopping works, but then it throws this out of the window around half way through when Evelyn, with almost no training at all, is able to obtain whatever skills from the multiverse she likes just by doing random things. Waymond has to have a computer screen tell him specifically what action to do in order to get the skill he wants, but Evelyn can just do anything and it always works??3) By the end of the film I felt like it had thrown it's interesting conversations around nihilism and the meaning of life completely out the window in order to have a more smushy and heartfelt ending, even though that didn't really make any sense\n4) As the film goes on it just becomes more and more tiresome trying to keep track of all the different multiverses that Evelyn and Joy are running into.

            "content": "When Everything Everywhere All at Once begins, it doesn't just show you it's hand. The start of the film is a very sober look at Evelyn Wang's (Michelle Yeoh) complicated and largely grim existence. It could have been an indie drama at first glance, but if you're walking into this movie blind, you're in for quite the surprise. When we make our way to the movie's true genre (science fiction), we hit those universe hopping devices with Evelyn and we're going for a ride. This is both one of my favourite parts of the movie and my biggest complaint. You never know what's going to come next in this movie for better or for worse. There are some moments that perfectly accentuate the plot and the characters and then there are others that are going to leave more sensitive members of the audience either clutching their pearls or stomping out of the room. Everything is truly unpredictable from moment to moment, you can still plot the overall arc towards Evelyn's redemption but good luck determining where you're going next. These choices maintain the tension and the stakes so well but it undercuts the accessibility of the movie to everyone. This is a tradeoff that some people would gladly take but I saw this with a friend and it just didn't work for them with how scattershot Everything is (ALL HAIL THE BAGEL!).One of my favourite choices that the creative team made with Everything was that they didn't paint Evelyn as the hero with the heart of gold who just needed an opportunity trope. Evelyn isn't despicable or even off-putting but she's all too human. She enjoys playing the martyr, she's ungrateful, she's not accepting of her daughter's choices and she's extremely critical of those around her. They have to walk a tightrope with her character being too unlikeable but I found the movie knew just when to pull back minus one or two slips. My favourite character was her husband Waymond from the original timeline. I just wanted to give him a hug and tell him he deserved better but his compassion and his inner strength hidden behind his meek exterior was inspiring (more on that later). The central players also gain perspective as the movie goes along in a way that didn't ring false or feel too sappy which is an accomplishment all by itself.I'd call the cast of Everything recognizable but not truly elite. If you've been watching movies for the past 30 years, you know who Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis are but the names in the credits may not catch everyone's eye. It's nice to see Michelle Yeoh in a true starring role, she gets a character she can really sink her teeth into and she's great. I didn't recognize Ke Huy Quan but he was also noteworthy as largely mild mannered Waymond. I liked Stephanie Hsu as Joy, she played her character well but I do wish we had gotten to see more of a range from her instead of her being just sombre and snarky 90% of the time. Jamie Lee Curtis deserves a lot of praise just for doing so much of the ridiculous material in this movie. On top of that, she was able to do it without winking at the audience. She played her character seriously and I was ultimately impressed with her dedication.Even with all the kooky scenes and awe inducing plot beats, Everything is definitely a movie with a message and to it's credit, it never loses sight of that. Everything doesn't say something that you haven't seen in another movie but I was surprised that I connected with it so completely. As I stated above, Evelyn's dissatisfaction with how her life turned out is understandable but her negativity is sucking the \"joy\" out of life for those around her. Waymond is the real hero and he breaks it down for her about fighting the hopelessness of the chaos in life with kindness and sincerity and how happiness can be a choice even when things seem bleak and depressing. The overall thesis of the movie is that even if there isn't a purpose to life and we're all doomed to live and die in a what amounts to a drop in the ocean of time, we get to choose what makes our life valuable and there is limitless beauty in that idea. This such a wonderful argument and I almost got emotional when Evelyn uses this realization to stop being so selfish and heal those who she's hurt. Even if the philosophical ground Everything covers has been tread upon before, it presents it in a humbling and heartfelt manner. Even though I had to be patient and wade through some annoyingly crazy stuff to get there, it was still worth it.I feel weird endorsing this movie in the end. Normally, I would be the one calling it too obtuse to translate or too artsy to reach it's audience. But as much as I can't give it a perfect grade, Everything, Everywhere disarmed my preconceived biases. There are good performances, some insightful character development and a message that affected me as the end credits started to roll. Everything won't be a movie I revisit over and over again but it was a unique experience that I'm going to remember both for it's most bizarre and it's most touching moments. Based on it's quality, I'd recommend this movie wholeheartedly but I have to add the disclaimer that you have to be prepared to take what Everything throws at you. It's not going to be your average couple of hours of streaming content, it'll be both better and more memorable.",

            "content": "Everything Everywhere All at Once is undeniably awesome in its payoffs, but it just really isn't good at building those up. In this movie, Michelle Yeoh travels around the multiverse, looking at her different lives. Scenes often get thoroughly climatic, like the one where Yeoh's character bursts through all the different lives she lives in the multiverse. The way it was shot, with all the color flying before our eyes, was so adrenaline-pumping that I wanted to leap out of my seat and cheer. But the movie is rapidly losing its magic when this kind of scene is played for about the hundredth time. We have to go to all the universes again. Imagine my exhaustion.\"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" is a fair description of the movie's pacing. Scenes overwhelm us with flashes and blasts. Once in a while, Michelle Yeoh would showcase her performance when the script required her to give a heartfelt speech. Those are touching for the first time, not so much for the twentieth.A big selling point is the martial arts in the movie. Yeoh is obviously an expert, but the fights themselves don't get better than a Jackie Chan movie. I found them maybe too choreographed, and I didn't get the use of extreme slow-mo. The moves are predictable; when a bad guy raises a fist towards our protagonist, we already know that she will block it, and make a counter-attack. And so on.I do get why the story is so beloved: The protagonist doing taxes is a fairly clever idea, except a tax office is too bland of a place to have half your movie take place in. I struggle to take the whole multiverse aspect seriously. Everytime there is a smart idea, the spotlight of it gets stolen by a joke. Example: The backstory of the villain involves them experiencing every universe, every life all at once, but unimpressed by what they encountered. They decide to destroy everything with...a giant bagel. And this whole villain arc is solved by...that's right, another heartfelt speech. I acknowledge the creativity and craft behind Everything Everywhere All at Once, but I don't really buy its structure.",

There are alot of fight scenes and crazy visuals. The actors probably had no idea what they were filming so kudos for trust in the directors. Unfortunately, the directors failed them in creating any kind of flow or story-line. Mix that with the arrogance that the film needs 2 parts as well as 140m to tell no real story and you get 2022's most over-hyped film of the year. Avoid.",

This guy came back to Hollywood after almost 40 years and delivered THIS performance.The movie is fun, what can i say. Acting is just amazing. (Couple of side characters/extras could've done a better job, but that's another story.) It has crazy visuals, cool story and great message. That message is the literal heart of this movie. It is also written really meticulously, with attention to details and great metaphors.It obviously draws inspiration from a lot of stuff (The Matrix especially). It gives homages and winks left and right, it has some memorable lines of dialogue, and it really is, as Daniel Kwan said, them going all in with this, in case this might be their last movie. It shows. They went all in and they won.All that being said, it's maybe a bit too ridiculous and silly at times. The movie never lost me tho, and i was always engaged.",

            "review_title": "Audacious to a fault",
            "content": "When the trailer for this film was released, I didn't quite know what to think. As a strong supporter of A24 and as someone who appreciates Michelle Yeoh's acting skills, I was hoping this would be good, but also did not know whether its totally \"out there\" weirdness and tons of multiverse-related subplots would end up being a film more in love with itself than with its audience. While initially somewhat skeptical, I decided to see it after hearing ecstatic reviews and word-of-mouth from audiences. I'm certainly glad I did, as the film's unique audacity and strong performances make the film memorable, although it's not without its flaws.The film follows Evelyn, who helps run a laundromat being audited by the IRS. One day while working on her taxes, she is sucked into a multiverse with infinite possibilities of potential past lives she could have had. In the multiverse, she is confronted with family struggle spanning a variety of different \"verses,\" and can \"jump\" between them. One should not go in, if at all possible, knowing significantly more about the plot than this. The film's two co-directors, together known as \"Daniels,\" deliver a visually engaging feast given that the film has an economical budget. Blending high-octane martial arts fights with loopy, quirky visions and a heavy dose of stylization, you can tell the aesthetics of the film took so much talent to produce. It's so offbeat and strange that even if you don't love everything you see, you just have to admire some of the creativity--at least initially. The Daniels previously worked on directing music videos (including the one for \"Turn Down for What,\") and you can tell their attention to style continues to work wonders in their directing methods today. By blending action with \"verse jumps\" and stylistic motifs, the film's editing--when at its best--can be spectacular and may remind the viewer of other tightly edited, stylized films like \"Baby Driver.\" The acting is generally strong, as Yeoh provides a clear emotional range with unique degree of expressiveness and thoughtfulness.Viewers will initially be impressed by the level of originality on display here--at least at first, because the film doesn't feel as precise and unique in the second half compared to the first half. While some of the action scenes (such as the first one) are extremely well choreographed, they start to get a bit repetitive and exhausting after a while. They all more or less have a similar style--and sometimes that style can be unique (especially if \"verse jumps\" are involved in clever ways,) but at other times it can start to wear out its welcome. The pacing of the film isn't particularly disciplined, but given the infinite nature of the \"multiverse,\" that might have been partially intentional. Nevertheless, the gradual increasing in redundancy in a few scenes combined with the lengthy, not-always-consistent runtime definitely means that the film's length could have been trimmed, and that despite the high level of creativity, sometimes it's possible to have too much of a good thing. The film's dialogue and attempts at philosophical messaging are solid, but these elements are strangely not ambitious like its visuals and attempts at crafting a variety of narratives.While the film clearly works the strongest in its first half and may gradually feel a bit exhausting to some, it still is a thoroughly unique independent film that you certainly won't forget about after seeing. 7/10.",

Fortunately, though, once the real plot of the film began, I was blown away on a cavalcade of humour, wit, but mostly just ideas, that make the film a pretty unique experience.Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh) is generally disappointed with how her life has turned out. None of the three relationships in her life, with her husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), her father (James Hong) or her daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) is particularly happy and her laundrette is in trouble, and due for a tax audit. One the day of the audit, she's contacted by an alternate version of her husband who explains that he's been searching the multiverse for her, as she might be the only hope against a dark force.Already I feel like that's more plot than I'm happy giving to anyone who might be interested in seeing \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\". Once the plot starts in earnest it's really a film unlike any other - there are some elements like \"The Matrix\" and some a bit like \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" but to describe it as being like either film isn't really. It's a constantly inventive story, thrilling just to look at, let alone to follow along with. It's consistently funny, despite its moments of action and occasionally mild horror.It's grounded in a great performance though from Yeoh and terrific supporting ones from Ke Huy Quan and especially Stephanie Hsu. That grounded performance is paid off too, in a resolution that, without spoiling anything, is surprisingly profound and emotional.I can see why it won't gel with some people but with me it absolutely did and I was dazzled, amused and moved throughout.",

She's got many different tasks and people calling on her for her time - customer waiting to pick up clothes, another customer waiting to get a refund because the machine at his quarters, husband discussing divorce papers, daughter asking about something, father coming to visit - and all the chaos makes the audience feel very unsettled. I was very uncomfortable not knowing if she was going to be able to deal with each task in a timely manner. This is then exacerbated when she learns that she must spend some of her time in a parallel universe simultaneously; she can't concentrate properly and \"be in the moment.\" Eventually she is able to learn how to \"'verse jump\" by doing weird things (switching shoes to opposite feet, for example) but it's confusing. Then the movie makes the daughter the main antagonist and then everything turns preachy and sappy at the end. I think the filmmakers are trying to say something about the importance of understanding and forgiveness between people (and particularly between family members), but it felt contrived.It is good to see people of Asian descent portrayed positively and \"in-depth\" in an English language film, instead of as shallow cardboard-cut-out villains or other objects of derision.",

            "content": "Today I watched Everything Everywhere All at Once and on a second watch it made me cry againLet's bring up something here, I really didn't like the Daniels last movie I watched Swiss Army man. It was overly \"quirky\" and it's humor did not make me laugh very much at all, often making me cringe. I didn't see death of D. L. but I heard that movie is better than Swiss army Man, though that apparently is also divisive( I will get to it it's on my watchlist). To say the least, I was not expecting much here...But after letting this digest, watching it a second time, I can say this is definitely a masterpiece of film making. The Daniels have made something that is truly special and is so insanely relatable. Like this speaks to me on such a deep level. But even with the deeper meanings of the film, the film making elements of this film are... just... so incredibly unique and impressive.This movie is phenomenal, I love it even more on a second watch. Great cinematography, fantastic fight choreography, flawless acting. It's clear that there is heavy inspiration from the matrix, but inspiration does not stop this film from being completely it's own unique experience. This story is intelligent and interesting, the characters all feel so fleshed out and even though ridiculous... realistic too? It's so well done.It's seriously hilarious and it never stops, it just gets more and more ridiculous and you would expect that to take away from the emotions in the film but it doesn't. The way these directors effortlessly blended tones is just a spectacle, you can go from crying, to laughing, to crying while laughing in a minutes time.The best part of this film has to be the acting and action. Michelle Yeoh gave legitimately a career defining performance. She's gave it her all and it shows so much. Stephanie Hsu did incredibly too, she was very funny, and I loved the way she could change her personality on a dime. Ke Huy Quan was incredibly nimble and his performance was also stunning. Everyone did great. Everyone was super good at their action too, the way these people fight, it's so intense and I love the way the camera follows Certain fighting shots. Also the fights are very funny too, it's great.There is not a single element of this film that is bad, but if there is anything that could be improved it could be some of the music choices, some don't feel as effective as others, but this doesn't mean that the music is bad. I really appreciated 95% of the choices here but as someone who's trying to be as critical as possible, this is my only real critique of this film.Truly, this is an excellent piece of cinema that everyone should see. You'll learn something about yourself.I originally gave this a high 9/10, I wasn't sure if I wanted to give this a 10, but on a second watch, knowing what it is, I am happy to bump this up. I love this movie, it's become one of my favorites for sure.Low 10/10.",

It's generally well-produced, well-acted, and well-written--with a few plot holes still left in--but the narrative is rather self-indulgent and promotes a vacuous philosophy. The writers/directors unsuccessfully deaden their nihilistic bent with non-ironic, melodramatic sentimentality that rings hollow to the ears after all the pontificating that came before.

            "content": "Overwhelming in scale yet intimate in scope, 'Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022)' lives up to its title and is easily the best movie about the multiverse since Peter B. Parker crash landed in Miles Morales' world in 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)'. Daniels' second outing swaps farting corpses for sausage fingers, focusing on a woman whose world is cracked into an infinite number of fragments when an agent from an alternate reality informs her that she's the only thing in existence capable of stopping an upcoming cataclysm. The flick is as silly as it is sincere, playing with absolute absurdity but anchoring it within grounded relationships and character flaws. It's utterly ridiculous but oddly resonant, throwing so many high concepts at you that you're forced to accept each of them as soon as they come your way. It's very much a 'go with it' type of affair, even if its mechanics are surprisingly airtight and could be explored even further than they actually are. Just when it threatens to crumble under the weight of its increasingly out-there elements, the feature shifts gears and becomes a much more philosophical experience. Its first half is concerned with the what, while its second is concerned with the why. Tackling the bracing question of what it means to exist, seemingly alone, not just in an unfathomably large universe comprised of billions of galaxies, but in an infinite expanse of universes each as incalculably vast as the last is no mean feat. A trillion possibilities spiral into a trillion more until unfulfilled potential practically becomes as irrelevant as it is inevitable. It isn't a nihilist affair, though. It has an undercurrent of hope and, despite its heavy material, it never drags you down by feeling dour or sour. It dares deal with the existential questions guaranteed to have kept you up at night at least once, and it emerges with a fairly strong grasp on what makes life worth living. On top of that, the movie is just a ton of fun. It's an absolute riot with a quick pace, plenty of laughs and a strong emotional core. It's bright, colourful and incredibly inventive. It's also super stylish, presenting itself as a myriad of genres and changing visually each time it does. The most amazing part of all is that its visual effects were completed by just nine people - including the two directors - who learnt how to do them by watching free online tutorials. If that doesn't give you faith in the film industry, I don't know what does. In the end, the flick just exudes passion. It's an experience that feels hand-crafted to its very core, the rare example of a fantasy epic not stained by the obvious influence of studio interference. It's the sort of thing that puts a big smile on your face for its majority, especially in its more straightforwardly enjoyable first half. There are some truly fantastic action sequences here that evoke the wonder of Jackie Chan's early work, so much so that I'd easily say they're some of the best of their kind in years. That's not to imply the second half isn't successful in its own right. It has a genuine philosophical depth to it and its emotional underpinnings are properly resonant. Even though the affair doesn't affect me as much as it perhaps strives to in that latter regard, it still hits fairly hard and does everything it can to keep itself as down-to-earth as it needs to be for its impossibly elusive concepts to have any real weight. The real stakes are much more important than the just end of the multiverse precisely because they're actually much smaller. It's a really smart way of grounding the feature without dampening its creativity whatsoever. Creative doesn't even begin to describe this, either. It's such a bracingly original, thoroughly interesting and invigoratingly entertaining experience that it's impossible not to recommend. It's weird, wild and wonderful. Of course, it isn't perfect... but what is?",

Between daughter and mother, husband and wife, (grand)father and daughter. Expectations, disappointments, maybe lack of expressing love and emotion, all play a part in this film. It's framed in a sci-fi/fantasy thriller, that overall, doesn't QUITE make sense. I guess the director, who previously did the oddball Swiss Army Man, wasn't content with doing a straight up drama.I am leaning to the belief that what happens is more of a construct of Michelle Yeoh's identity crisis as she reaches a crossroads in her life and her business. She escapes into the alternate reality to process her feelings and emotions for everything. That's the only thing that makes sense to me anyway.The action was decent, but it's not the focal point of this film. There are scenes with fights, some really well done. There are some groan worthy moments, sexual innuendos during the fights, and so on. But overall, they're somewhat straight forward fight scenes. I guess Dan Kwan took some inspiration from the over the top CGI comedy of Stephen Chow's action films like Kung Fu Hustle.I'm not sure if this film resonates with non-asians. They might not relate to the cold, judging motherly character of Michelle Yeoh, and not understand why she is distant with her daughter. But judging from all the positive reviews, it sounds like it has appealed to a wide audience.Everyone does a great job in their roles. I can't believe James Hong is still acting. He's several years ago away from being 100 years old. And great to see 'short round' Ke Huy Quan in a movie. His voice hasn't changed much since his child acting days lol. The actress who played the daughter was also really good. And of course Michelle Yeoh sells the character, and all the alternate universe versions.At 2 hours, the movie flies pretty good. There were some moments that were silly, and probably could have been shortened or left out, like the rocks and pinata moments. Otherwise, an entertaining film.",

But overall, it's not an easy movie to follow, and was disappointed for the reason given why all the caos is happening. Its saving grace is the suberb cast. The movie is well acted (it's why I gave it 5 stars), but the story pace is all over the place. Very slow in the beginning, then fast, then slow, then even more slow. Some great action when it happened, but nothing new that we haven't seen before, and they (action) come far and few in-between. The interaction between the characters is not great neither. There is no chemistry with all of them. Although it was good to see \"Data\" and \"Short-Round\" (aka Ke Huy Quan), all grown up.I really wanted to like this movie, but in the end it just left me confused, and the journey to my confusing wasn't really as entertaining as I would have hoped.VERDICT: If you're a fan of Michelle Yeoh and like multi-verse type movies, then this could be your cup of tea.",

            "content": "The title describes itself perfectly because everything is really everywhere and happening all at once during 2 hour 15 mins.I kept asking myself 'What the hell is going on, what kind of absurdism is that ?' in the first hour of the movie. I even thought that, the directors were trying so hard to be philosophical and fathomless. I'm sure many people would quit watching it after a couple of minutes, which they SHOULD NOT !!! That's why I decided to shoot a review, as it may help others to appreciate the movie and not to quit watching. The movie asks for patience from its audience, but it pays the reward.It starts with a unique storytelling that I think, I've never seen in any movies before. It's absurd, surreal, and too complex to comprehend if it really tries to show something to the audience or just tries to be as it is. As I've stated above it's a must watch but hard to finish. The first half of it makes you smile a lot, and cringe a lot at, as some scenes are the goofiest ever, without spoilers, I could say the ways people use to jump from universe to universe linking another version of them will shock you.The second part of the movie (approx. After 1.30), the tone of it completely changes, when the story starts to unfold. All the philosophical tone, and absurdism turn to an emotional rollercoaster between generations. And here we have the most unique way of telling the story of most ordinary people (a Chinese immigrant couple on the verge of divorce who works a laundry in the USA dealing with daily issues of life). Without further ado, I have to say that I've never got so emotional for a long time, and I even cried, and tbh I cried a lot.I haven't watched such a unique movie since Parasite. I just loved the movie so much. I also loved the acting of all the cast, but especially Michelle Yeoh and Ke Hyu Quan. Michelle Yeoh deserves all the awards for which she has been nominated for her flawless performance. I think it's absolutely one of the best movies of 2022 (and all time) and best contender for Best Motion Picture Academy Award.",

            "content": "\"Everything, Everywhere, All At Once\" (2022, USA), is the Daniels' first feature film since their uniquely absurd \"Swiss Army Man\" (2016). Essentially the film focusses on one day in the life the matriarch of a Chinese immigrant family in LA. The first act builds a detailed picture of the contributing factors to her life having become empty and nihilistic, e.g., her conflicts with her husband, father, and daughter but also external pressures such as an IRS audit and a serious mid-life crisis. The second act is introduced by her suffering a meltdown / panic attack which forces her out of inaction. Her introspection is cleverly demonstrated through a deus ex magina process where she is both forced to and assisted in accessing the multiverse and to do battle with the physical personifications of her real-life struggles. The third act culminates in an \"acceptance\" of her place in the universe. The film is written and directed in such a manner as to create a multiverse which is unique, chaotic, absurd, and funny. The fight sequences are highly over the top and almost continues throughout the two later acts (picture Yeoh in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon). This however does not detract from the story and tends to underscore (similarly to the fight scenes in \"Sucker Punch\") the stubborn resolve of the matriarch and her \"battle\" to rediscover her persona. Direction is tight and focused and the cinematography top notch. Both Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis delivered sterling performances. 8.5/10.",

Everything Everywhere All at Once of course takes ideas and inspiration from other movies and books, but it mixes such a refreshing blend of mind-boggling entertaiment for your heart and soul, that it's hard not to walk out of the theater with a smile on your face after the movie (if you belong to the 99% of people that will enjoy this one).Michelle Yeoh plays the part she has been practising for the last 40 years. This is her movie. Such a powerful performance and it contains everything, every emotion, every move, every combination of interesting Chinese-English mix of words. And often time everything at once, everywhere on the screen.And then Ke Huy Quan - where have you been for all these years? Short Round from Indiana Jones is back, with a sweet vengeance! Amazing action scenes, and such a warm presence on the screen on the quieter scenes, and definitely some humour sprinkled in.Stephanie Hsu and James Wong and Jamie Lee Curtis are equally as good, and rest of the ever reacurring cast also do well, everyone gets opportunities to shine.Then the action, cinematography, set desing, music, outfit design, writing, directing - all comes together in such a satisfying way that this has to be Oscar winner in many categories next year.There are so many clever camera tricks, such well edited and original action scenes, so many weird costumes and the whole multiverse thingie is so clearly presented without it being just exposition.And the humour - you either love it or not, but me and my friends and the whole audience did. I could go on and on about details, but see for yourself :)And finally, the heart. In the center of it all is family, and love, to yourself and the world around you.

            "content": "It's an American trend, goofy lighthearted comedies carrying on their shoulders deep thoughts and delve into real philosophical issues. I already mentioned this trend when I wrote about Free Guy, though in that case these were philosophical issues straight out of the text book, while Everything Everywhere All at Once has thrown all text books away or maybe even burned them - in the best way. It is, as already been said by other reviewers one of the most original scripts ever written, as irreverent as they come. They push pure sci fi ideas deep into the realm of the absurd not to say plain stupid, without ever being stupid. In my opinion the stupidity or silliness is here in order to neutralize what would be otherwise sappy cliche, or borderline preachiness if said straightforwardly. This is so cleverly done the writing is almost genius - a term I don't often use. But it's the second bright film I see in a single month dealing with how destructive motherly love can be and how it's the only cure of its destructiveness, and I speak obviously about Turning Red who also chose the humorous approach but didn't go as far as EEAaO dared to go.This called for an entire cast of superlative performances starting with Michelle Yeoh who's a brilliant actress that I never saw in a role I didn't like. Same is true for Ke Huy Quan whom I didn't see since the Goonies in anything, what a waste, such an amazing actor with so few roles to his credit. Also brilliant are Stephanie Hsu Jamie Lee Curtis sinking her teeth into another juicy role and James Hong as Gong Gong for whom I'll always have a warm place in my heart since his role in Big Trouble in Little China.Bottom line: the creative team of the Daniels, as they like to call themselves has very little fear and steps without hesitation where others wouldn't dare looking. But they do it with style and wisdom that remind me of the very best. I'll be looking forward to their next creation. If you want to see motherhood deconstructed, to its core; if you want to find out about the amazing power of being nice, without ever risking an overdose of sugarcoating - this your film.",

And the actor that played the husband is an excellent actor and was the most believable in switching emotions. Even the guy in the wheelchair is famously known and played the main villian in 'Big Trouble in Little China'. So the movie got it right with the casting but there is another huge problem....story and pacing. While the story seems original, it is a mishmash of 'The One'(multiple universes) & Sense 8(grabbing abilities from other selves) & Matrix(alternate reality).The problem is the movie is trying to be all three while trying to be a comedy and family drama with the already science fiction/fantasy/kung fu elements that exists. Does that statement sounds confusing? Then you understand how this movie will be. It is extremely chaotic, jarring and the combination of drama, comedy, scifi, fantasy brings down the movie. There is so much going on and so much explanation needed to understand that the director should have slowed it down a few times in the beginning so that the audience can understand the rules. Instead each scene is explaining something new as if they are making it up as they go. After a while, you are tired and don't care anymore as the director tries to amp up the action and special effects of a scene without explaining why the scene is even happening.To put this in perspective, imagine Color Purple, Fast and the Furious, Jackie Chan movie smashed together and directed by Michael Bay and that is what you have here.",

The standout is of course \"Michelle Yeoh\" who deserves to win best actress at this moment in time. The action is amazing to look at. It's clever choreography and flashy editing make it more thrilling. The music fits the movies tone and atmosphere and also adds more thrill especially in the action scenes. The films cinematography is absolutely flawless. The lighting to the camerawork just make the film nice to look. There's plenty of long takes that just add that freshness to the film. Finally, the film is also incredibly funny. So many times me and the audience laughed out loud and I'm so happy that an original idea is making audiences come to the cinema more so that we can have a brilliant atmosphere.The negativesI can't find any big problems apart from tiny nitpicks and that's not affecting the rating.Conclusion\"Everything everywhere all at once\" is an incredible piece of cinema. It's story and characters are fantastic, the acting is brilliant, the action is thrilling and edited brilliantly, the music adds more thrill to the film and the comedic moments hit nearly every time. This is now one of my all time favourite movies for a reason and I encourage anyone who can see it to watch it.I'm going to give \"Everything everywhere all at once\" a:10/10.",

There's just so much to take and bear in life--and, it goes for each and every one of us. We all have so much going, and sometimes it all just seems overwhelming. Pressure, depression, responsibilities, bills, taxes, job, children, and on top of that the love and care you once had slowly dried out... is this the life we signed up? Is this what multiverse have to offer? No. Life is what we make of it, and that's precisely the message of this movie. A hard-working, dedicated, devoted yet not perfect mother, and how she copes up with her father-in-law, husband, and a daughter who is affected negatively by all her struggle. Because, she's too busy and bound by societal laws to even truly acknowledge her daughter's sexual orientation. Eventually, little dark cloud turn her too bitter towards life. She'd rather be a rock. And, trust me, when you get to this scene where they're rock--you too would be like, yeah, I want to be a rock too. Life's too much--everywhere and all at once, but there's still kindness and love if we keep it alive. It will make life worth living if we take a break from this world's nonsense we humans have enslaved to. All we need to do is take a break, look around, cherish those around us, and life will become once again beautiful and worth living.Yeah, I did cry quite a bit. Because, I too had these dark clouds hovering over me.A MUST MUST MUST watch. I cannot insist more. This is x1000 better than any blockbuster superhero crappy movies you've watched. It's truly a MASTERPIECE that you must own. I am going to buy and add it to my library too. BRB. :)",

Genuinely one of the most creative and heartwarming films to come out in a while. This film takes the multiverse concept that's been trending for the past year or two and takes it a whole new original direction. The incorporation of it works and I loved it. The Daniels did a fantastic job directing this. There is a funny and unique style present throughout the whole film that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. Michelle Yeoh, Key Huy Quan, and Stephanie Hsu are fantastic here and all 3 of their performances are somewhere on my 3 favorite performances of this year. Their characters are incredibly unique and interesting to follow and it's a great return to screen for Quan who hasn't been in a major film since The Goonies. They did a fantastic job playing all these different versions of themselves and making them feel familiar yet different at the same time. The emotional beats work so well. The film made me tear up on multiple occasions in the last 30 minutes because these characters are just so wonderful to follow. Any scene at the end manages to make you happy for these characters and the struggle that they have been through. The action and cinematography go hand in hand with amazing they are. There isn't an action set piece that feels repeated and every scene is so amazing in their own separate way whether it's really cool and badass or just really funny as well. This film manages to use so many different cool and fun colors that immediately keep your eyes glued to the screen no matter what is going on. The film's use of themes like existentialism and where we belong in this world work perfectly for this story and even we are no one, we are someone out there to somebody else. This is an absolutely necessary watch for anyone who enjoys movies. It's a masterpiece in every aspect of filmmaking and it 100% deserves the price of admission. Go see this right now.",

From the plot, story, screenplay and obviously brilliant acting from each and every cast , especially from Michelle Yeoh and Stephanie Hsu to the technical departments like cinematography, sound mixing and VFX, this is a work of art. A Chinese immigrant, running her troublesome laundromat business, facing audit for accounting malpractices founds herself in midst of a multiversal war where some superhuman villain named \"Jobu Tupaki\" is set to disrupt the balance of multiverse. Now she is the only one who can stop her.Since the multiverse has become a craze on hollywood, very few writers and directors chose to shed some light on the formation of multiverse. Decisions we take in our life , which shape our future can give birth to realities if they are taken a little bit differently. But be it in a same universe or innumerable universes , the life of us and people we know are held together in a basic thread of passion, love, hate, despair, ego. And thake emotions between the lead lady and all the other chracters are weaved so slenderly that those will keep a long lasting impression.One of the best movies of 2022 and surely a un- missable one.",

To me, It was shot in the style of The Matrix. Lots of fight scenes with fast cuts then going to slow motion.The story itself was quite original for about 45 minutes. They took you in all kinds of directions and it was hard to follow. Then they seemed to realize they needed to pick a story and they settled on a common, somewhat boring, family drama. They were still doing The Matrix style with more fighting, but it really didn't move the story along as quickly. The second half of the film ran out of steam.",

It's a very specific, unique perspective told of events that quite honestly, will never happen to most of us (read: any).Because, while Im a massive fan of Marvel, this film's clumsy take on the multiverse setting is either a cheap imitation or a poorly executed one. And overly complicated, as with the Marvel movies.Minorities: Probably I'm not allowed to speak of this, but just because you have actual Asian actors, doesn't mean you can use the same cliches: laundry store- owning, helicopter-y, disapproving traditional mom, slavishly beholden to her aging parents, poorly understanding the complicated American system... And there's more that I can't even think of now.But come one, much of this was cringey, and I'm not in the afflicted minority.

The film, mimicking typical Hollywood films, consists of two plus hours of unintentional ridiculousness and ham-fisted moralism about accepting people, regardless of how odd their oddities happen to be. The film especially lays it on with regard to child-rearing, specifically, how traditionalist parents have an obligation to simply accept their children's novel additions to their family's moral culture and sensibilities. It fails to so much as consider the question of whether children could be wrong or hasty in their changes (they are children after all), or whether the children should work with parents to evaluate them. Here, parents are simply obligated to \"get with the times\" and support the child's wishes lest they push the child toward evil.The two redeeming qualities of this film are the gravitas brought by the lead actor (she is excellent), and the strange sense that I experienced in viewing the actor who played her husband. I am going out on a limb in saying this before checking it, but I think he is the same person who played a little boy in \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.\" It was a bit haunting to hear him speak, now as an aging man, with the same inflections of voice and general mannerisms of the child of nearly forty years ago.

There were so many times I couldn't tell whether to laugh or just look on in horror, but I smiled consistently throughout.The strained dynamic between Joy and her mom slowly becomes apparent until a dramatic and tear-jerking conclusion.

But I will say that if you watch it once in your current mind and come out hating it or confused by it, ask yourself.. have you ever wanted to be more than one thing but felt you couldn't? Were you ever sad and felt that misery had to be the way forever? Do you ever feel stuck in your reality? That things can't be different? If you answered yes to any of these, this movie is for you. And if you don't get it, go back and watch it again, this time try and apply it to your current situations in life. I did, and it enlightened me greatly.I watched this at a pivotal time in my life/former relationship and while stuck in the thought process of hating labels and \"why can't something be more than one thing?\". I believe because of that and who I am, this movie hit home...real hard. I laughed, cried and got confused even. But at the end it was like the movie spoke in code that I well understood. Me and my now-ex watched it while struggling to figure out what our relationship was now that I wanted one thing and he wanted another, we couldn't find middle ground and were caught up with labels, expectations, feelings and the worlds reasonings.

I would say it's even a movie that has a time and a place in which you should watch it, for you to understand. My life was calling for this movie and was aligned with it when I viewed it. Therefore it spoke volumes. I hope it does and did the same for you.Everything Everywhere All at Once acts like a true therapy session and life lesson if you dig deep enough, let go and let it. There's no saying what lesson to be learned for you personally, it all depends on you. But it won't leave you empty handed, and if you feel it's left you so? Search for the message because I'm telling you it's there.The acting was superb as well as the animation and out-the box creativity. My soul needed this movie.",

Michelle Yeoh may be the star but Ke Huy Quan just steals the whole film for me by being the heart of it all, it was a triumphant return to Hollywood after years of child actor stardom and came back with a show stopper, representing every philosophy I respect, and he absolutely deserved that Golden Globe and maybe an Oscar nomination would be nice.That's all I have to say that hasn't been said before in other reviews.",

            "content": "If nothing else, Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (collectively Daniels) certainly must be credited with a truth in titling nod for their movie - It certainly (and repeatedly) lives up to its moniker.Scraping away all of the noise, EVERYTHING actually has a very basic premise which could have resulted in some poignancy. A Chinese-American couple, Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh) and Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), are having marital issues which extend to communicating with their daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). Adding to the discord are a crusty IRS Agent (an almost unrecognizable Jamie Lee Curtis) who has the family business under audit, and Evelyn's father Gong (James Hong; a fine presence here) -- who she also has parental issues with.Unfortunately, Daniels have piled on a Multi-verse plot which combines elements of THE MATRIX, SLIDING DOORS and the recent SPIDERMAN: FAR FROM HOME. Instead of having three Spidermen, we seemingly have dozens of iterations of Evelyn. What the Daniels don't bring are a clear clean narrative, genuine insight or a semblance of drama (something the other three pictures all had). Certainly, Daniels get points for a few amusing bits and pieces along the way, but no matter how many hot dogs, bagels, pet rocks and raccoons that are fetishized here, the characters get lost in the sound and fury. Also noteworthy is that any faintly clever notion will be repeated and repeated -- so it's safe to take refreshment breaks. It's like an old Warner Brothers cartoon, except that Chuck Jones and Tex Avery could express their craziness in a tidy 7 minutes, not the elephantine 132 here (a couple of times, audience members got up thinking it was over; and, at the end there was audible sighs of relief that it actually was).The cast is game (dozens of Michelle Yeohs isn't a bad thing) and the effects are quite good for a fairly modestly budgeted effects extravaganza. As noted at the outset, there is an actual family story to be told here (and, eventually, does), but for all of Daniels' fancy tricks, the ending could much more cogently been arrived at with little if any of the sound and fury. After all the convoluted metaphysical happenings the big takeaway is the simplest of homilies. Indeed, one could eliminate almost the entirety of the almost two hour SFX sideshow and arrive at the very same life lesson with only a couple of 'verses' - or, even just one.",

I don't know if everyone got the same message as me but the beauty of film is in various interpretations. It's such a difficult film to describe, if you go into detail (ie the award, if you know you know) people will scoff and think how can this be as good as it is.My brain is chaotic as a lot of depressed peoples are so maybe why I connected with this film, there's no agendas, no woke message, just about gratitude for what you have, how time is genuinely precious and that the grass isn't always greener, you can wish time away, coast through life but you will miss a lot and potentially on a lot of happiness, I've heard these messages millions of times but it hit me in this film, like I say, chaos seemed to just fit my head.There's beauty, humour, emotion, art, complex emotions, homages to so much pop culture, there's stuff for everyone if you give it a go, it may require you to let go, because if seen thousands of films and this is one of a kind.

            "content": "An unabashedly fun & unapologetically entertaining roller coaster ride of emotions that invites its viewers on a whirlwind adventure through spacetime without losing sight of its emotional trajectory and leaves them in an overwhelming state of sensory overload, Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of the most intriguing, imaginative & impressive concepts to surface on the big screen in recent years and is masterly steered by a fantabulous performance from the legendary Michelle Yeoh.Written & directed by Daniel Scheinert & Daniel Kwan (collectively known as Daniels), the simple idea behind the film's premise is of a parent not understanding their kid and how the divide from it can at times threaten the fabric of a family. Daniels start the story right by acquainting us with the characters and switch to next gear only after the family dynamic is established and a strong foundation is already paved. But once the multiverse aspect kicks into action, Daniels unleash a limitless assault on the senses with absolute liberation.The plot traverses endless possibilities, navigating from one universe to another with jumps that never allow the audience to settle down and keeps them invested in the proceedings with smart, surreal & spirited storytelling that mashes every genre into a rapturous, rambunctious delight to deliver the mind-boggling goods. Jam-packed with surprises & overflowing with acid-trip energy, it's not that everything hits the sweet spot but the story also never discards its boisterous vibe & core values. And then, there is Michelle Yeoh who steals the show with an exceptional showcase.Overall, Everything Everywhere All at Once is rightly described as a swirl of genre anarchy and is one of the finest stories about multiverses, existentialism, nihilism & intergenerational divide. It is chaotic yet cohesive, bizarre yet accessible, ridiculous yet evocative and thrilling yet thoughtful. As endearing as it is emotionally resonant, Daniels' sophomore effort establishes the duo as a force to be reckoned with and is absurdist filmmaking at its anarchic best. A powerhouse of originality, imagination & slapdash ingenuity that makes an essential plea for love, compassion & kindness in times of bitter conflict, this inter-dimensional odyssey is one for the ages.",

Good acting. Good action sequences. Amazing editing (should win an award just for that). But sheesh, it's so damn unnecessarily long.It could have been 110 minutes and told the same story. It's way too self-indulgent. Scenes drag on and on and provide no additional clarity to the plot. It seems like the filmmakers just wanted to include everything they shot regardless of whether it moved the story along. If the film had been more succinct and got to the main point of the mother-daughter relationship, I would have enjoyed it much more. It was like, 'Let's bombard the audience with absurdity. Throw in lots of butt plugs and dildos etc. Oh wait, we need to make it profound. No worries, we have 30 more minutes'.The length of this movie was it's biggest fault. Plus squeezing the 'message' in the finale seemed like an afterthought (it wasn't, it was just made to feel that way).I started the film feeling disengaged. Then it made me angry. Then I struggled to stay awake (seriously). Finally the 'message' roused me. It wasn't a particularly profound message for me personally but at least it was there.Oh, and I believe much of the excitement about this film is also because it references other movies. Cinephiles, critics and the film industry loveys adore seeing these insider jokes on screen.",

They do great work with the limited budget which they have, but other than that it's pretty bland.It's overwhelming and the multiverse-stuff doesn't make too much sense. If you see past the illogical stuff it's perhaps more of an enjoyable ride, but you could say the same thing about Marvel. The dialogue and humor is better than your average Marvel-movie, but the similarities are too similiar. This might aswell have been the sequel to No Way Home and it would make perfect sense.What message was the movie trying to convey? That life is beautiful? It wasn't delivered very good which made the climax quite underwhelming. Even though the movie has a far amount of problems, it is a enjoyable and funny movie. Go see it.",

            "content": "\"Every new discovery is just a reminder that we're all small and stupid.\"The rumours are true! Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of the finest pieces of film of all-time. An instant-classic, a movie you know will stick with you for a long time, something you'll be constantly referencing and recommending to your friends. This is why I love cinema, this is why people go to the movies, this is why strangers meet in a dark room with a giant screen in front of them. To be able to feel connected with everyone, to make sense of this thing we call life, to just forget all our problems for an hour or two and be transported to another universe.This did a lot for me. It really did. It payed my taxes, walked my dog, payed my university bills, took the trash outside, cleaned my windows and filled every single inch of my heart with emotion. I crackled, sobbed and was left in a beautiful state of awe. But then again what else would you expect from a Comedy/Action/Science-fiction/Drama/Sausage/Romance movie directed by the amazing, creative, evil geniuses 'The Daniels'.An overstuffed odyssey about fighting against time and fighting against Juju Chewbacca. A 2 hour and 20 minutes long movie about the insignificance of our existence and a 2 hour and 20 minutes long movie about the significance of our existence. Something that shouts at you that ''Nothing Matters\", but inevitably makes you leave the theather thinking about how everything actually matters, you just don't have to overthink it.There aren't enough words to describe Everything Everywhere All at Once and I feel like I want to dedicate my life to writting about this movie because from the moment I started to write this review I felt like I could never do this any justice.Michelle Yeoh. A name I won't forget. This woman gave one of the most dazzling, profoundly delightful performances I've seen on the big screen. An Hanniball Lector-Anthony Hopkins type of performance. She carried so much with her performance, from being an asian immigrant woman in the United States working her ass off to reach the American Dream to a care-loving preocupied mother that at the end of the day just wants to be in harmony with those around her.It has everything, an astounding, loveable cast, an emotional, strong and heartfelt soundtrack, one of the best works with editing and special effects I've seen in recent memory, a brilliant and a once in a lifetime writting and directing job from Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert and a redifined meaning of the multiverse that allows the audience to break any previous concept they might had about it.Everything Everywhere All at Once had a budget of 25 million dollars and looks more refined and expensive than any of this big-budgeted movies flying around Hollywood. Cinema is to be made with love for the craft, passion and creativity and when made like that I feel like it can move worlds. And I know this might not mean a lot, but this surely moved mine.Today I felt like I watched something I may never experience again and I just wished everyone could watch this too. This was indeed Everything! Everywhere! All at Once!",

            "content": "When it comes to almost universal praise, 2022 breakout hit Everything Everywhere All at Once is in a league of its own when you consider that audiences alongside critics from across the globe have bandied together to hail Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert's (aka Daniels) mind-melting experience an instant classic, a feature that once more confirms originality in the film industry is not in fact dead and dormant, in an age where arguments have been made that cinemas are now all about Marvel and comic creations, not content as loaded and downright insane as what we have here.With a swell of support in all forms, having finally had the chance to enter the darkened cinema and partake in what Daniels has in store for viewers (an oddness that is familiar to anyone that's seen their previous films), I can see why and how Everything has become the sensation it has been and credit where credit is due with the film managing such tricky feats as making us care for subtitled rocks or people sporting sausages for fingers, while also giving industry veteran Michelle Yeoh a role that she will long be remembered for and a chance at Oscar glory while also providing a grand re-entry to the big screen for 80's child acting legend Ke Huy Quan but as the age old saying goes, there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.Clocking in at over two hours and taking place almost exclusively in a coin operated laundry and an IRS office building, despite its many detours and snippets of other worlds and lives of our main trio, Everything is unquestionably unique and unlike anything you've ever seen before (trust me there are things here you can never un-see) but once its end game becomes apparent and you become overtly aware at its messaging and its running jokes, the films almost endlessly proceeding finale that literally spans a good 30 - 40 minutes ensures the films enthusiastic momentum and relentless energy that is so fantastic early begins to become more of a chore rather than a pleasure to sit through.Like a good party that overstays its welcome, Daniels could've easily packaged up their narrative and the procession of slow-mo action set pieces or repetitive ruminations on the pointlessness of life that is overridden by the love and friendships we can hold close to our hearts into a much more bullet like whole, one that would've pierced the heartstrings faster and more effectively as they look to take viewers on a surprisingly emotional journey that maintains that this film is much more than adult orientated jokes, inventive violence and concepts that don't hold up to much further scrutiny.Regardless of the fact, this wildly imaginative film (one could argue almost too imaginative with countless ideas and scenarios getting little breathing time in amongst the many varied angles the film takes) gets bogged down the further it runs in circles and messaging, there's an abundance of visual joy, sensory overload and good will towards characters that makes Daniel's film one that would be one impossible not to appreciate in one way or another.Whether you look at the film as a straight up comedy, one with dramatic depth tackling life's big questions or one that just reveals in its immaturity, Everything is something no matter where you look and one that clearly has hit a chord with audiences crying out for a feature that goes for broke trying to be incomparable to anything else available to consume.Final Say -With wild imagination, inventiveness and charm, Everything Everywhere All at Once provides us with what is likely to be the most out there and playful feature film of the year and while it loses steam in a notable way past the three quarter mark, this energetically directed and brilliantly acted oddity stands out in a big way from a marketplace dominated by familiar offerings.3 1/2 fanny packs out of 5.For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",

Speaking about multiverses, the film gives a proper detailed material about how multiverse works even the concept lacks originality as I already watched films with similar premise like The Matrix, Jumper and Lucy. The performance is a strong point where Michelle Yeoh finally reached her potential after years of easily ignored roles and Ke Huy Quan shines in his return to acting as Waymond. Unfortunately, the film is far from best picture contender due to unsettling elements such as too many quick cuts during the action scenes and forced LGBT references which involves Joy is in relationship with a girl.",

Figure that out.Update:\nAfter a few days of contemplation about this film, I wanted to add my more developed thoughts. I am so glad that I gave this a few days to settle.EEAAO is not a literal sci-fi, for those who may not understand. It is a metaphor for the meaning of existence, and it concludes that no one knows that meaning. Very simple. All the silliness and randomness is to open your mind to possibilities (much like hallucinogenic drugs).So, whatever meaning that you extracted from watching this, that is unique to you. That is the hallmark of good art. Watching this movie will shift your perspective if you are open to it. In other words, if you have an open mind at all to begin with.I have always considered myself to be very open minded, but came out realizing how I've become more closed over time. We tell ourselves that we understand the world, our purpose, our place. We become more comfortable and complacent over time.

And they all have a meaning. It was a roller coaster: you felt the crazyness, the despair and the sense of having given up and the dissatisfaction and lack of respect for the husband and basically everyone else, even for herself, the deep frustration and at one point ( as a woman) you wonder: is this what we women do... we drives us selves into insanity?The movie has some absurd very funny scenes mixed in with - or rather part of the insanity- and just as you were blown away by the fast moving action, you laugh and just as you laughed, you felt like crying and so it went on.As the movie moves on, we see how everything actually makes no sense, but still it does. The most accurate movie about being a daughter and being a mother, having been a daughter yourself, but didn't learn anyways. How many mistakes we make, being mothers. How hurt daughters get from their mothers mistakes. How it loops back to mothers being hurt, not understanding the daughters hurt is born from us. The story between the main character and her husband is so sad, how she blames him for practical her whole sad and wasted life, of all the lost opportunities. How he sees no other way to get in dialogue with her but to try to shake her up by filing for a divorce, as she won't see him or talk with him ( about serious matters) if things aren't put on the line.But at the end it all adds up to: we can only save the world from chaos if we stop fighting hard with hard and show kindness and love. Kindness and love conquers all. And chaos is to be expected, take it as a blessing and an obligation and opportunity to learn and grow.I \" just\" expected some fast action and a nice sci-fi movie , but I was utterly moved and I laughed and I cried deep down inside, this was a crazy achievement by this film crew.

            "content": "SCORE: 8.4/10Before reviewing this film, the fact that the \"Watched\" logo on Letterboxd is a googly eye is top tier. This film is the definition of originality. I've never seen anything like it, the amount of genres wrapped up in one movie is impressive, and the acting was unbelievable. Hats off to the directors, writers, actors, and the rest of the crew who were able to put something this creative together. With that said, I think Everything Everywhere All At Once is the best way to describe the plot of this movie.Is there something wrong with me? People are calling this the best movie of all time while I'm still sitting here confused at what was trying to be communicated. To me, the most compelling part of the movie was the bit about how her infinite realities were a result of the many decisions she made through her life and that each time a decision was made a new branch of reality would be created. As the audience member, it made me think about my own life and the thousands or even millions of places my life could've ended up at this point in time if I had made different decisions. It was very powerful. But, I feel like just as I was starting to grasp what was going on I was immediately confused again. I thought at the end it would finally all make sense, but I felt like all that was accomplished was that she realized how much of a jerk she was and she was like half sorry. It's very similar to the ending of Encanto where the Abuela realizes how bad she was being. Like that's cool but, as someone who appreciates a deep meaning in film, this left a lot to be desired.Overall, it was fun to watch and I enjoyed the visual effects, but the plot had me confused and it really was all over the place. It started with Evelyn disapproving of her daughter's gay relationship and then ending up in a gay relationship with Jamie Lee Curtis' character with hot dogs for fingers in a different universe. I get that the point of if all was for it to be Everything Everywhere All At Once, but I just found it hard to connect with the story.",

            "content": "Let's be frank: It's not possible to overstate how brilliant this film is. Filmmakers Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert have given us a movie that is, truly, everything and everywhere, scattered and all over the place, nothing and all simultaneously. There is no stone left unturned, no inclusion to outlandish, far-fetched, and absurd to lump together, no idea that isn't thrown at the wall. Kwan and Scheinert have given us a hodgepodge mishmash smorgasbord as outrageous as 1967's 'Casino Royale,' 'Beyond the valley of the dolls,' 'Attack of the killer tomatoes,' every most preposterous B-movie, every most senselessly pompous and grandiose blockbuster, and every hopelessly overcooked blend of genres all smashed together into one picture. By all reason, this should be a horribly sloppy, nonsensical, blustery low-grade fancy of the sort we'd expect to see from Jim Wynorski, Charles Band, J. R. Bookwalter, The Asylum, Uncork'd Entertainment, or gods know what else. Instead, it's one of the most singularly imaginative, ingenious, flawlessly well made, stunning, captivating, entertaining features that has possibly ever been made. 'Everything everywhere all at once' is an instant modern classic, a true masterpiece.There's no reason whatsoever why any of this should work as well as it does. Absurdism, surrealism, profundity, major drama, martial arts, science fiction, action-comedy, parody, satire, obscenity, racism, homophobia, animal cruelty, love, abject cartoonishness, family, universality, morality, kindness and cruelty, weakness and strength, nihilism and hope, unreserved bombast, art film loftiness, warmhearted sincerity, fierce violence - all this and much, much more, in a bizarre, kaleidoscopic cacophony of 139 minutes. Such far-flung notions apply to every single last aspect of the feature, even the aspect ratio. Sound effects, sound design, cinematography, direction, editing, lighting, costume design, props, effects, hair, makeup, production design, art direction, characters, dialogue, scene writing, the story, plot development, mechanics of the multiverse, music, choreography, pacing, comedy, messaging, tone, and more are all subject to the same wild whims wholehearted earnestness and indulgence, flipping in an instant from one mood or concept to another perhaps multiple times in the same scene. This is to say nothing of the acting, with everyone in this amazing cast giving extraordinary performances of arguably greater versatility than has ever been required of anyone in one other particular title. Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, James Hong, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jenny Slate, Tallie Medel, and all others involved turn in displays wholly unlke anything else they've ever done. I'm simply astounded.To discuss anything about this film, any one single element, would require a vast quantity of words far exceeding the space one is typically allotted. To discuss the picture at large, in substantial detail, almost seems like a Herculean task. All that I can say is that the title speaks as much to the content, and every small facet represents, as it does to the unremitting, all-consuming panoply of ideas that informed the work of the filmmakers, the cast, and the crew. From top to bottom, left to right, and inside-out, 'Everything everywhere all at once' is both overwhelming and not enough, wonderfully satisfying and rewarding but never leaving us sated, farcical and sensible, haphazardly kluged and precisely calculated - too much, and not enough. In recent years there have been multiple highly acclaimed and very popular movies that have played with the idea of the multiverse, and it's at best questionable if any of them have struck a chord of originality, a spark of genius, in the way that this has. While I heard nothing but good things about EEAAO and anticipated enjoying it before I sat to watch, never in my wildest dreams could I have been prepared for what it actually is. It's so over the top that I can't imagine it will appeal to everyone, yet crafted with such extreme passion and care, and bound up with such welcome, heartfelt authenticity and humanity, that it speaks directly to everything that audiences love about the medium in the first place. This is the type of picture that, love it or hate it, everyone needs to see at least once. I'm blown away. 'Everything everywhere all at once' is absolutely incredible, and isn't to be missed.",

In that way, yes it's an original and unique movie. But in that and every other way, I literally hated it.",

            "content": "Everything Everywhere All at Once is a film that is narratively wondrous. The film is centered around a Chinese-American family and their financial, and relational troubles. The story transforms into a science fiction quest around the multiverse to find purpose. Michelle Yeoh leads the cast as Evelyn Quan Wang, the Wang family's bitter matriarch. She is accompanied by a supporting cast that includes Stephanie Hsu as her daughter Joy, Ke Huy Quan as Evelyn's husband, Waymond, James Hong as Gong Gong, and Jamie Lee Curtis as the family's auditor, Deirdre. This is the second feature film for co-directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (the duo known as \"Daniels\"). Everything, Everywhere All at Once is a romantic telling of the meaning of life and love through a vivid and ingenious imagination.From top to bottom, the cast steals the show with their performance. The actors show a depth and range that is uncanny for a singular film. The cast plays multiple versions of their primary character from different universes. Each version provides a different emotional compass and a unique sense of being. For example, the film's primary Evelyn is dissimilar from another universe's Evelyn. Michelle Yeoh successfully captures each version of Evelyn through novel usage of body language and line delivery. Ke Huy Quan's portrayal of Waymond and his alternative selves matches the acting prowess of Yeoh. However, Quan's acting is much more emotional and sentimental. Each Waymond feels poignant. Primary Waymond is a touching character that serves as the family's glue. Stephanie Hsu's portrayal of Joy is characteried through melancholy, rage, and arrogance. Primary Joy is melancholic, whereas the alternate version of Joy, Jobu Topaki is filled with rage and self-assurance. Hsu's execution of Joy and Topaki is well-done. She is a bright spot in the film, serving as the quintessential heartbreaker. Jamie Lee Curtis and James Hong bolster the movie's depth. They each compliment the cast's performances. Their acting matches the tone needed for key scenes and moments. Largely, the cast triumphs in chemistry andAesthetically, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a marvel. Akin to the actor's performances, the movie offers are plethora of stages and scenery. Each universe is visually distinct. Various aspect ratios are used throughout the film to distinguish universes. Filters were also used to differentiate each universe. The movie's cinematography appropriately fluctuates from being lush to harrowing. Action sequences in the film were well-crafted. The fight scenes were captivating. Unusual objects were used throughout the Kung-Fu segments, offering a sense of levity and brutality. The movie is a visual spectacle that manifests itself as a potrait of clashing art forms.The Daniels created a multiverse that triumphs in the exploration of themes such as family. They used the complex concept of the multiverse to provide a simple answer to life's mysteries. Plain constructs such as family are used as a bridge to the disjointed structure of the multiverse. As directors, they flourish in capturing many genres into one picture. The use of comedy balances drama. Scenes and sections of the film are written as if they were an escape from each other. One scene is counteracted by another scene, yet the drama and weight of the story is maintained. What may appear to be difficult to follow, culminates in a narrative that is multifaceted in essence. Furthermore, the film is authenticated through its' use of Chinese culture and languages. Simply put, the writing is tangible and awe-inspiring all the same.Overall, Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of the most innovative and original depictions of family and the conflicts that come with relationships. The film traverses the unknown by using the known as a navagation tool. It is an unforgettable, yet picturesque amalgamation.",

We're filmed over a half a century ago. There were some good roles for the leads, but like the plot, they lose some of their punch when stretched over such a needlessly long film. It took me four days to complete watching the film because I kept falling asleep and had to stop and watch some thing else and then come back to try and digest another chunk. By the time I watched half of it I had invested enough time in it, that I felt the need to finish it and see if the film had any redeeming qualities. In the end, it's another empty-nester film. How do parents bring up their children to be independent from them and then actually grant them that independence, complete with a heartwarming, happy ending where everyone finds true understanding of themselves and others. Grant you there is the Chinese cultural overlay, but this story plays out in every culture in millions of families every year for hundreds of years and has been made into films and TV shows many times.

It does everything, goes everywhere, and it still feels grounded in it's deeply human story, exploring the strained relationship between a mother, her husband, and her daughter.

Her problems immediately escalate when another version of her husband from an alternate universe takes control of her husbands body and explains to her that she is the chosen version of herself to stop a great multiversal evil. She is then sent down a path where she sees the lives of alternate versions of her life and the roads not taken, and begins to understand the meaning of her own life and her choices.This movie is absolutely beautiful.

When you combine time travel, alternate universe travel with emotions and good character arcs you can make great movies. Although I cannot even imagine what character arc would mean when time is not linear. It requires a great writer to write that script. These guys weren't.First of all there were some really good ideas in the movie. Like crossing paths with the same guy and talking about alternate futures in the alternate universe. However the biggest 2 problems for me where the lack of any logic. You can create alternate universes but usually when you go beyond the lifetime of a person in any time travel movie, that person probably ceases to exist. So alternate branches of reality like sausage fingers and rocks should have been excluded. Also how did they achieve the same level of civilization without the ability to grab things. I though opposing thumb was one of the 3 key advantages over other apes.Second issue is that the daughter lives all alternates realities, experiences everything, realizes that there is no difference in being a rock or human. She realizes \"nothing matters\". Except the \"bagel\" of course. She cannot give up the bagel and she will destroy the universe just to prove that she likes bagel. That part is the propaganda needed for an Oscar. And the part that made this movie absurd. At times it looked like \"scary movie\" or \"epic movie\" series. Bunch of absurd scenes stitched together.",

            "review_title": "Sorry. What did you say?",
            "content": "See the vivid portrait that Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert paint with the opening of Everything Everywhere All At Once, of how language barriers can be used to intentionally and unintentionally wound others, of how first generation migrants strafe that liminal space between work and home, of how code-switching becomes a means of survival. Some might argue (and have) that narratives of intergenerational trauma and conflict have become trite, that the overbearing matriarch of Asian origin clashing against the modern, youthful world is overplayed. But these stories are still happening, and as time passes our artists will turn their attention from the journeys of second-generation migrants to their children, and theirs after that. Let's not be too critical of a slice of representation that's still in its infancy. We can have those other stories too; it's good to normalise them. Not everything has to be situated at the point of multicultural crisis, but in the same vein, we don't have to tear down one pillar to raise another.There are other minute details of this milieu which may seem insignificant but will resonate with those in the audience who recognise them. The tangled cacophony of overlapping Cantonese, Mandarin, and English that Evelyn wields to navigate another day in the life. How she crudely masks a semblance of care with insults in order to bridge the generational gap that keeps her daughter Joy at an arm's (and then some) length. And then there are other, more universal struggles that are glimpsed, like how she zooms from one situation to another with barely a glance or nod of recognition towards her husband or daughter (so distracted even divorce papers merit a mere half-glance), a toxic blend of unrealistically high expectations and disappointment that hints at the catalyst for the rest of the film's complications, in both her own world and in the Alpha Prime. And that's just the first ten minutes.In Michelle Yeoh, the Daniels saw the perfect actor to centre the narrative. While early drafts had none other than Jackie Chan as the protagonist, he's been the bumbling goofball before. Yeoh's always had the perfect poise, an international action star and beauty icon for decades. Placing a former Bond girl in a run-down laundromat was an inspired choice, drawing on all the wasted potential that bursts at the edges of the multiverse. One of Evelyn's alternate timelines has her living the Yeoh-esque celebrity archetype, a renowned film star who spurred her husband for a world of glitz and glamour. \"He (Waymond) needs to know how good my life could have been,\" she blurts out in almost desperation, coming to the realisation of all she has missed out on. To see Yeoh finally given the opportunity to demonstrate such range is fulfilling in itself; to see her melt into the role and give depth to the character, have her live out every possible life and outlandish existence she could ever imagine or aspire to and still choose to return to that laundromat, makes it all the more meaningful.In a more subtle meta-twist, Ke Huy Quan's turn as the unassuming husband, a side character in Evelyn's life, resembles his own career, a Spielbergian blockbuster high and then years of Hollywood neglect. Witnessing Waymond snap into action and take centre stage doubles as Quan's own return to the big screen, occupying that Jackie Chan slot himself in an spirited rendition of the daggy dad. Watch how costuming and props combine to accentuate this in his early action sequences, wielding a bumbag as if it were a deadly weapon (it's meant to resemble the Bruce Lee nunchuck). What better object to represent the Waymond worldview? He fights with kindness (and disarms with cookies), cares little of what others think of his appearance and naivety, and manages to find the glee in the everyday, whether it be dimension hopping or laundromat meniality. Evelyn's symbolic acceptance of the Waymond way in opening up her third eye, googly-style, is a bizarre promotional shot, but placed within context perfectly encapsulates the film's blend of silly sentimentality. Eat your heart out, Doctor Strange. It was the Daniels' masterstroke to lure us in with the grit of Alpha Waymond (quite literally an alpha male), only to swerve sharply and promote a different brand of masculinity. Quan switches almost effortlessly between the two, and sometimes crouches on their very edge; the chapstick moment is but one example. He gives life to the narrative, grounding it firmly into something to return to.Everything Everywhere All At Once's style is punchy and direct, a no-holds-barred approach to its brand of absurdist humour. What other film would unironically list 'proud father' as a skill for one of its characters? The same weight and earnesty is afforded to each line of dialogue in its Matrix-esque set-up, from \"She's off the grid!\" to \"She's gone home to finish the taxes!\" The action is given its snappiness through edits that enlarge each blow for impact: widening and shrinking the aspect ratio to signal shifts in timelines, dolly zooms to push in and exaggerate, visual puns and match cuts to link the worlds together (see Evelyn being 'pulled away' from his argument with Waymond, or the pizza spinner superimposed over her riot shield heroics). One of its biggest laughs sees the film literally pause in a record-scratch moment as Jobu Tupaki expresses her disbelief that queerness, not mass murder, is Evelyn's most pressing initial concern amidst all the chaos. But more than simply layering callback upon callback (the pinky becomes the cookie becomes the symbolic kindness of Waymond), the jokes are natural extensions of the script's philosophy, of the messy, zany possibilities of the multiverse once we (and Evelyn) realise the ramifications of reaching rock bottom and the potential that lies within. Every one of us know that yearning for lives unlived, opportunities missed, choices not taken; it is, pun intended, a universal concern. The Daniels merge that into their filmmaking, pushing the narrative alongside these sequences. I appreciated hearing the kung fu Evelyn's steps timed to Clair de Lune, and then later could barely hold it together when it returned in the climatic montage via sausage fingers to bring Evelyn's epiphany full circle.The story flirts with the avant-garde in its sub-climax which strips away all of the multiverse gimmickry to place mother and daughter atop a metaphorical cliff, conversing as rocks. Joy, whose arc has been smattered with imagery of depression and suicide ideation, elects to jump off and into the everything bagel, and Evelyn finally allows her the agency to do so. But the crux of the issue highlights choice as a key motif; even as Joy sits on the precipice of self-destruction, she still yearns for her mother's acceptance. In turn, Evelyn must come to terms with who her daughter is alongside all of the other apparent 'disappointments' of this universe, to find fulfilment in the laundromat and doing taxes. It was never really about Gong Gong but her own misgivings of a wayward path, which subverts what would be a conventionally uplifting moment because she's wielding her daughter's personal life for her own self-actualisation. Some have derided the script for its bite-sized exploration of nihilism and its end goals. Admittedly, the depth of the storytelling here isn't cavernous; for its 142-minute length, I would have liked it to have fleshed out Joy's angst further to give her decision to stay more weight at the expense of perhaps one of the timelines. Nevertheless, Evelyn's choice to stick by her family, and subsequently the Daniels' choice to situate the climax in a parking lot, resonates. The film's value in an ever-evolving cultural landscape might lie predominantly in how hard it is to define. We find worth in its uniqueness. Is it a kung fu action romp, or a domestic drama about the struggles of marital life? Is it an absurdist comedy about the meaning of life, or simply an allegory for a mother pushing her child too far? Yes, it's all of these, and more. All at once.",

            "content": "'Everything Everywhere All At Once' is a simple story about a family's search for meaning. It also happens to be a mind-bending, multiple-universe, kung-fu, sci-fi epic! Evelyn (Yeoh) and her husband Waymond (Quan - Short Round from 'Temple of Doom'!) run a laundromat and have some issues with their marriage, their daughter Joy (Hsu) and Evelyn's father, Gong Gong (Hong). What starts out as a family drama doesn't take long to turn into a fight to save the multiverse when another Waymond shows up to enlist Evelyn's help.From the directors of 'Swiss Army Man', \"the Daniels\" sure know how to do surreal well, but make sure there's plenty of laughs and idiosyncratic comedy. The alternate realities are explained quickly and simply - no time is wasted and the plot and action is always moving along. Yeoh, Hsu and Quan are all great, as is Jamie Lee Curtis in her role(s). Yeoh should get extra credit both for the stunts/fights at her age (it is 20 years since 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'!), as well as pulling off both a martial arts expert and boring housewife at once.While there's plenty of bonkers thing going on - Hsu's costumes are excellent, some hilarious sex jokes, great/unexpected use of \"Absolutely (Story of a Girl)\"- the heart of the film is the relationship between Evelyn & Joy and Evelyn & Waymond. There's some sad moments and some beautiful ones, especially the quiet desert scenes, but we're left with a great underlying message of love and kindness giving the world meaning.",

The other is a beautiful and wonderfully creative, intelligent, extremely original, and deep story supported by perfect directing, acting, and production. And extremely funny at the same time. A true work of art and love.I can fully understand and respect that this is not for everybody, but if you're tempted this type of unique films, you're in for a real treat. In my book it's the best in decades. It makes me both happy and hopeful that someone invested money in this, while I'm in no way surprised that none of the usual, big Hollywood production companies did.",

This film follows a main character who is the epitome of an average-Jane. She has money and family difficulties, wonders if she has made the right choices to land her in her current circumstances, and struggles to make the right choices for those in her life. It incorperates an action-fueled multiverse plot in order to tell a story about how we are all capable of an infinite amount of things, and that no one reality if superior or inferior to another. The life we live currently is indeed a result of a sequence of choices, but no life will be without its complications. In a search to find inner peace, happiness, and a sense of belonging and fulfilment, one must look within themselves and within those they love. Ultimately, if you live a life that is rich with love, that life is valuable. There was a lot of social commentary about how feelings of inadequacy, not belonging, and extistential dread can be improved by finding joy and peace in ones current circumstances, and within the small things that make our lives worthwhile. My favourite quote from the film was 'In another life I would have really liked just doing laundry and taxes with you'. This quote truly speaks to the heart of the message that we get too caught up on the meaning of our lives, what we can do better, where we went wrong, are we going in the right direction, when really all that matters is that we honour, cherish, and nourish the love in our lives.",

The switching between languages, rushed speech and lack of audio clarity can make the dialogue very difficult to understand. It's very frustrating trying to keep up with the story and this continues in the early multiverse introduction. Only later do you appreciate that none of this particularly matters, the entire plot is impossible so enjoying the mania at face value is probably enough.A synopsis cannot truly cover the ongoing across three acts, each scene progressively more zaney and inventive. Jumping between universes, scenes can be hilarious and immediately followed up by something deep and cutting. They all add something to the film, keeping it unpredictability and enjoyable throughout.The visuals cover everything needed without going overboard on special effects, and props and costuming deliver on every occasion. The cast is superb, the largely Asian-American roster switching between personas excellently, and wonderfully supplemented by Curtis.Not even the most famous 'Multiverse' film to be released in May 2022, but certainly the most unique and undeniably entertaining.",

A mash up of Matrix/Parasite/and any Jackie Chan movie you care to name, this film simply doesn't work. It starts reasonably well, however, and in the first 30 minutes shows great promise. But then it degenerates into a farcical parade of kung-fu style dance routines that are not only boring but incredibly poorly choreographed. The premise of the film - some sort of interdimensional slippage brought on by stress and self-worth (or the lack of it) - as only explained in the most convoluted and bizarre way that one can only assume it is because the writers don't really want the viewer to know what's going on (clever eh? Not!). The Jackie Chan throw away comedy is laughable in its obviousness and the sight gags are childish to say the least. The acting is pretty good but then, what ARE they acting? No-one knows, least of all it seems the writers and the director! I suspect this film is doing well at the awards simply because, like the emperor's clothing, no-one in the 'arts' world is game enough to say they didn't get it (to admit, if you like, that they are not clever enough to divine this film's 'deep and meaningful message'. Well, folks, the joke's on them because there simply isn't one. This is a self-indulgent film editor's wet dream masquerading as something profound.

            "content": "\"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" is a pretty new American movie released not too long ago and there are several languages included and unless you speak English, Mandarin and Cantonese, you will probably need subtitles for this pretty long film. It runs for 140 minutes and it is the most recent release by Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert as writers and directors. If you have seen Swiss Army Man, then you will know that their films are not exactly particularly conventional and I was not sure if I wanna see this one here because I really did not like Swiss Army Man at all, but after the raving reviews and this title's imdb rating going really through the roof, I got pretty curious. Not gonna lie. In the end, it was a good decision to check this one out, even if I cannot say I saw the greatness that many others experienced. In general, I think it is becoming more and more of a problem in films these days that they are going with the idea that the audience can appreciate the outcome without understanding all that is going on. I do not like this approach, but it is definitely one taken here. You can probably watch this film ten times or even more often and you will still struggle with certain inclusions that can only be explained by the statement: \"It's science fiction. It does not have to make sense.\" Well, it doesn't. Still there are more than just a handful creative inclusions and moments in here. I am not gonna lie, seeing Jamie Lee Curtis as some kind of evil brute stomping around and trying to kill the good guys was so absurd that it was funny again, even if I otherwise do not like the actress. But I should also stay with some of the basics here: Former Bond girl Michelle Yeoh plays the central character and this film is another win for her. She already received stellar reviews for Crazy Rich Asians not too long ago and here at least in terms of the film's appreciation, she even tops it the way things are looking now. She is surely a gifted actress. Soon turns 60. The actors who play her husband here and her daughter are not really familiar faces, at least not to people from western audiences like myself. Nonetheless, they all did a good job. Surprised to see how old James Hong already is. Oh well, he has been in some classic films too over the decades and I am not necessarily talking about Kung Fu Panda here.Back to this film now, a few martial arts scenes are also key in here. The Asian element must through I guess. There was also one brief moment when it reminded me a bit of Keanu dodging a bullet in Matrix the famous shot. Not sure if it was mere resemblance though or an actual tribute. As for the absurdity and also comedy that came with it, I could mention many scenes. This felt a bit like Scott Pilgrim meets Spiderverse and I could add other influences too with the Asian background and the protagonist's age. I shall leave it at that though as it is a film almost impossible to categorize and there is not really a need to anyway. You can decide yourself what is the most bizarre about it all. Maybe the stone/rock scenes? Maybe the Ratatouille raccoon approach. Maybe the very brief moment when the characters turned animated. There is a really a lot of conflict between mother and daughter in here. And Yeoh's character is far from a saint here as well. Look at how she is a bit of a homophobe. No perfect main character. She does have flaws. Same applies to the daughter who turns out to be the main antagonist even. There is a happy ending in store though, which may be a bit difficult to accept from a realistic point of view with all the power the daughter apparently possesses and how evil she is, but still. Her villain name also showed us how this film does not want to be taken too seriously overall. I am of course referring to the ways in which Yeoh's character keeps using a wrong name there. Many giggles in the audience. Most of all when Chewbacca came into play. The scene in which the protagonist randomly out of nowhere decides to tie her daughter to a chair and keep talking about the parallel universes etc. Was also a bit of a comedic highlight there because we knew she was right all along, but of course she sounded like a complete nutjob.I must also mention Ke Huy Quan. He played the biggest male character and maybe he even gave my favorite performance from the entire film. Effortlessly made the boring husband part work and also equally effortlessly he pulled off the cool martial arts fighter part. I really liked it a lot, not only that he got this tender kiss in the end, but also the nice words Yeoh's character had to say about her man and how he took care of her complicated self and deliver through calmness and patience. I guess the divorce is not happening then. Maybe not the best way to write male characters with depth because he went for the divorce initially and in the end he just takes it back. Well, we are not told, but it is pretty obvious that love prevails, even if the film is surely more about love between mother and daughter than between husband and wife overall. From my review, you can also see maybe that it was rather the comedy moments when I appreciated the film the most. The more serious stuff and supernatural elements did not do too much for me to be honest, even if I liked the elaboration on how we are just such a small inferior presence in an endless universe and let's not even get started how it is even considerably smaller if there are all these other parallel universes in existence too.One of the darkest comedic moments is probably when the daughter is shot, already in her evil form and seems to be dying from the bullet, but then makes a joke about how it is just organic and pulls a ketchup bottle. Pretty sadistic. This is surely also a film that fits in nicely with the current liberal mainstream in Hollywood. There is drug abuse, even if just very briefly (of course with Jamie Lee Curtis), several inclusions of same-sex romance (not just the daughter at the center of the story, but also between Yeoh's and JLC's characters on two occasions or so in an alternate universe) and we have a character briefly use two gigantic male genitalia as weapons to slap a (male, of course) character really hard. So the slightly questionable inclusions from perspective of moral are also depicted in a playful manner to avoid controversy. The \"Be kind\" statement was one of the more emotional highlights of the film for sure, but I must say the moment in which the alpha husband dies was something that did not leave an emotional note on me at all. Not one bit. So it is impossible for me to give this film a higher rating. If I had to decide, I would even say it is closer to 2/5 than 4/5 to be honest. It could have been 20 minutes shorter I'd say, maybe even half an hour if they manage to cut the right (i.e. Wrong) scenes and sequences.Finally, let me mention the extraordinary inclusions of bagels (okay, I was a bit off with the donut play on words in my title, but you get the point) and hot dog sausage fingers. So flexible. Unreal stuff. We even get an evolutionary elaboration there to explain how this happened. The film was really not scared of anything or the two people who made it I should say were not scared. It also shows that somehow you can really get away with everything almost these days in film if you don't mess up terribly. We also get premature closing credits at one point in the film pretty early and these are explained through one character sitting in a movie theater. Or how there are three sequences and the first is two thirds of the film and the third (final) one is basically just the epilogue. These segment titles also make the movie title. That is all then. I think it is a film worth checking out on the big screen and it is more enjoyable there than on television or your laptop screen, but I would not say that it is a film that really must be seen. Nonetheless, I find it interesting which directions Asian film has taken over the last decade, especially with a lot of the glorious success these films have achieved in Hollywood and with awards bodies, even if this is not a pure Asian film of course. It is American if we are strict, but the influences could not be any more obvious. Interesting though that two American filmmakers make a movie that has at least 50% foreign language. It is a good film here and there, but clearly also on the overrated side all in all. Maybe this is why many people think it is the ultimate film to watch when under the influence of a drug and I have heard that also about Swiss Army Man, but I personally think that you should always only watch a film when you are in a sober state and not in advance allowed any substance to enter your bloodstream. Same nonsense like these drinking games. Now, that is really it then. I give this movie a cautious thumbs-up. There are strengths and weaknesses and the former are slightly more frequent and dominant I'd say.",

My wife and I stared watching it, she gave up after just 10 or 12 minutes, too off-kilter and manic for her. I watched all of it but in three different sittings.The focus is on Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Wang. Over 20 years earlier she starred in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" and here she gets to use some of her martial arts skills. While I admire what the filmmakers did here, for ME it would never become one of my favorites, to re-watch periodically. Too manic and off-kilter and too many symbolic elements to make sense of.This comment by a reviewer reflects my own take:'Though I usually like high-concept creative films, this time I must admit I felt lost in all its odd layers of storytelling and couldn't emotionally get with such an incoherent film that just kept piling on absurdly illogical sci-fi things to its base plot until I ultimately had enough.'

Think Kung Fu Hustle x John Dies at the End with a backbone of Mr. Nobody if all were the best possible versions of themselves and had more heart than all three combined.Definitely one of the most daring, beautiful, and off-the-wall insane films I've seen in a long time.High octane action flits back and forth to heartfelt tearjerkers and the absurdly hilarious, possessing a raunchy randomness only Daniels can evoke. Give them the multiverse and the Russo Bros, you've got a cohesive epic with excellent performances from everyone.Genuinely moved by this film. Despite the exceptional components, it transcends these to become greater than the sum of its parts. I teared up on two separate occasions, all while the crowd was roaring throughoutI will need to see this movie a few more times to get every moment, as there is very little breathing and blinking room-one of my largest and only qualms was the lack of time spent exploring alternate paths to a degree I would like overall. This, however, ignores the message of the film which I believe has to do with optimistic nihilism or the idea that the meaninglessness of the universe is a chance to make your own meaning with what you have.It's an important message that we all need to hear every once in a while. Hug someone close and tell them you love them; for all we know we only get one path-but make sure you scream it in a language they don't understand because life is unfair and absurd (Then take them to go see Everything Everywhere All at Once, it slaps).",

            "content": "....but have options. Everything, Everywhere, All at Once (EEA from this point forward) had been critically acclaimed and is now been nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars (not that it means anything any longer). For me, that meant I had to view it-in its entirety- to give a fair assessment of the film. I had my reservations going in, I'm really not fond of martial arts- although I'm a fan of both Kill Bill films- and I view stories about the multiverse as generally offerings that use the concept as a crutch because they can not tell a coherent story based in the one universe we all live in. After hearing all the praise and accolades that were applied to this film across the board, I figured I would have to at least acknowledge that, although this was not my cup of tea, the film was pretty good. What a shock it was, then, to find myself embroiled in such a juvenile exercise with such a simplistic meaning. Two hours and twenty minutes of sturm and drang (all at volume 11) to come up with \"There's no place like home\"? There is actually a scene of two rocks talking to each other- seriously, two rocks- well there ARE two Daniels after all. Suspend your disbelief to accept thousands of other universes for \"All you need is love\"? When I suspend my disbelief, it comes at a price-EEA fails to pay that price and has a sophomoric sense of humor that one might find in the subgenre of porn/comedy (see Flesh Gordon)\nthat almost makes me think it's a neo-comedy (you know, the ones where you never laugh- because there's nothing funny). It's truly disturbing to see how the film has connected with so many younger people- although juvenile and simple is the way to go these days. This is certainly not a film for serious adults and my advice is: if you think you're going to hate this film, you're probably right- certainly DO NOT PAY in any way to see it, and have a back up film ready to watch that could save your movie night if you dare venture in. Just remember that Everything Everywhere All at Once could also be an accurate description of projectile vomiting (used in the film) or explosive diarrhea- wonder how the later failed to make the cut in here.P. S. The use of Debussy's. Clair De Lune in this film is an actual abomination- pearls before swine.",

First, I think the biggest theme is that while nihilism may be easy to succumb to and even a tempting comfort , there is so much more to life if you open your eyes to everything around you and cherish the simple joys of life.With regards to the movie itself, I wouldn't say that I was really enjoying it while watching, it is certainly overwhelming and difficult to keep up with, but all of its themes really made me reflect which certainly is valuable.For this movie you truly need to watch it yourself because your interpretation of this movie is probably impacted by your own personal background and circumstances more than any other movie I've seen.",

Filmmakers are afraid to tap into weird and absurd things nowadays because of the possible financial losses. Which makes this film feel really fresh in it's concept, it's storytelling, it's action, it's humour, everything is a result of peak imagination from the writer-directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert.Michelle Yeoh. Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, James Hong. Jamie Lee Curtis, each and everyone in the cast is so good that there is not a single loose thread in the acting. They're all just perfect.The story, phew. I can't really describe it to you but just to summarize, it's essentially a story about a mother who is a failure but doesn't want her daughter to be the same, but even if she's a failure, it doesn't matter because it does not change the fact that she is always gonna be her daughter and nothing in this vast multiverse can change that unconditional love a mother has for her child. Michelle yeoh literally travels the entire multiverse to save her daughter and is stubborn (as she should be) in not letting her precious child go.I didn't think this film would manage to make me cry when I stepped into the theatres to watch it for the first time. But so happened the first and, lo and behold, even after rewatching it today, I cried. The film manages to tap into every human emotion possible and makes you feel things. Makes me happy, sad, angry, surprised, bitter and so much more.The aspect which I loved the most? The editing. If this film hadn't been edited the way it has been. I think it wouldn't be able to achieve the status it has achieved as of now. It's so good, it's mind-boggling. I will try my best to recreate some of this in the future if I can because this film really opens up a lot of editing techniques which I've rarely seen before.Just watch this guys, it might become your favourite film of the year. A huge shoutout to A24 for producing this risky project and releasing it before the over-hyped Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness which, let's be honest, was barely about the multiverse and straight up disappointing.",

It is a ride that takes the audience places they could never have imagined they would go.

            "review_title": "The best film of the year?",
            "content": "Well, I was really looking forward to this film and probably it was even my most anticipated film from this year. Because the Daniels delivered a great film with Swiss Army Man, which quickly became one of my favorite films. Well, and together with A24 and the creative trailers, this can only go well. Nevertheless, I also have my problems with the film.But be that as it may, one thing is certain, because Everything Everywhere All at Once is undoubtedly the most creative film of the year. If not the most creative film of all time. This becomes clear in the first shot alone, in which you can see the family through a mirror in the film. And even if this shot is quite short, you already learn so much about the family. Well, and that also extends over the entire film, this incredible creativity. For example, when the characters talk and in the background you can see something that is actually much more important, but the characters don't notice it. And there are so many scenes that are brimming with creativity. But of course, this creativity comes to the climax when it comes to the multiverse. I mean, there are so many ideas that are simply unique and that you have never seen before. For example, if the characters want to gain access to another universe and then have to do something specific for it. The scene with the paper somehow hurts more than any fight scene and the same applies to the scene with the dildo. I mean, who comes up with such ideas? And then there are so many other ideas that you could talk about it for an eternity. Everything that has to do with Ratatouille is just so funny or the scene with the stones, with the pinatas. All this is just so great, so unique, so unforgettable and thus without a doubt probably the most creative thing I have ever seen.By the way, someone else noticed that the melody from \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" appears. It may also sound similar, but I could swear it's the same melody.Well, the fact that the film is so creative doesn't mean that the plot is good. In this case It does. Because Everything Everywhere All at Once is not a film about the multiverse, not an action film, not a typical hero's journey, it's a family film. About a family, for the family (even if some scenes are probably not suitable for everyone). I actually expected something different and rather a typical hero story in which Evelyn has to save the multiverse, but instead it's more about understanding what family really means, that you can overlook little manners, accept everyone as they are and should appreciate everyone who loves you. Well, there is so much more behind the creative facade. A damn multi-layered film that you won't soon forget.Another great aspect of the film is also the characters and the actors who embody them. All the characters in the film are just fantastically written. This is because they all have their weaknesses and are not perfect. I hate these films in which the protagonist is just perfect in every way, masters everything immediately and has no weaknesses. But in this film, every character has any blemishes, weaknesses and bad qualities, as every real person has. Nevertheless, all characters are likeable. Evelyn, for example, is a great protagonist. On the one hand, she is quite a big asshole to her daughter because she is still stuck to old values, but we understand her more and more the better we get to know her. Well, and she is also sympathetic because she is a bit clumsy and dreamy. This also means that she cannot do everything immediately. When there are fight scenes, it takes time for her to master them and manage to enter other universes. At least on purpose. She is a multi-layered character with weaknesses, with strengths and a great character development. And the same applies to the rest of the characters.But probably it's also due to the great actors who embody the fantastic characters. Michelle Yeoh is just great in the role and plays everything damn convincingly so that she could carry the film on her own shoulders. But fortunately she doesn't have to, because after all she also gets great support. Among others, of course, from Ke Huy Quan. Except for Indiana Jones and The Goonies, I didn't really know him, but he's probably the heart of the film. He is so naive and actually always in a good mood and always nice and he just plays a character you have to like. But Stepahnie Hsu is also great and always convincing in her role, even if I didn't really know her before. Well, and then of course there is Jamie Lee Curtis who can also be seen here in a completely different role than you are used to from her. Well, and what more can you say, except that she is also fantastic.But as already mentioned, not everything is so perfect in my opinion. There is the first act, which I think takes too long. The characters are introduced, their relationships with each other and the film is built up, but the first act is clearly the weakest. Or then there are other little things. For example, I am bothered by the fact that in a multiverse full of different possibilities, the good and evil are mother and daughter. I know it's about family, but I still found it a bit too constructed. For example, I would have liked it better if the antagonist had been someone completely different or Evelyn herself.Well, I'm just saying that the movie isn't perfect, but what's perfect? (Except Fight Club, of course) But even if something is not perfect, you can still love it and somehow that's probably the message of this film. Unconditional love.",

Visually this film is stunning, most of the shots are just so amazing to look at and must have taken quite some ingenuity to put together. The different universes are so well handled and all feel vastly different from one another but are also grounded in a somewhat similar reality. There are plenty of moments where I heard the whole crowd laughing as there wasn't a single line that didn't land well. The performances by Yeoh and Quan are very well executed giving life to incredibly fleshed out and relatable characters who you really empathise with and want to see overcome their barriers and obstacles they encounter. The overall philosophical message I took form the film was of Nihilism and how sometimes there is no meaning to what events happen, but not to get too bogged down so that you don't see what's truly important right in front of you. This was very liberating and refreshing to see. I've never heard of the director duo before but I know they're now on my radar and I am extremely excited to see what other works they will be creating and will surely dive deeper into their previous cinematic works. It comes to no surprise why this film was produced by A24 who have produced other amazing films such as Moonlight and The Lighthouse. This film is a must watch, you won't regret it.",

            "content": "This is a movie for which I came in with no expectations or prior knowledge, except something about googly eyes. Having watched the trailer after the fact, I think I still would not have been prepared for just how absurdly fantastic and out of this world EEAAO would be. This movie is probably one of the most unique films I've ever seen. It's not simply the visuals as others have pointed out that make this movie so different. It is also the direction, storytelling style, humor, and just the entire vibe of the movie, which blends and shifts between different elements and styles as fluidly as our protagonists shifts between versions of herself.The writing and direction here are top notch. While it does rush through the specifics of how the multiverse travel works, it explains precisely enough for you to follow along while not boring the audience with too many details. The main plot is laid out early, and is relatively straightforward, but still has enough twists and turns along the way to make it really fun and interesting. Our main antagonist and the main plot device are... fantastic, you'll see. The writing really shines when it comes to character development. This is heightened due to us of course seeing multiple versions of each character. We are able to see how characters differ in various universes, but also the core things that stay the same and really make each character who they are. More so than any other multiverse movie (which there are a lot of these days), this film really uses the alternate versions well as vehicles in order to further develop the main versions of our protagonists. A big part of this is the direction, and how the jumps between different multiverses are shot and timed. This is especially incredible during fight scenes, in which it will often quickly snap back and forth between the different versions of characters. It looked really slick and I'm in awe at how they were able to film it so well.As far as the acting - every single member of the cast was so superb. Michelle Yeoh was INCREDIBLE, I truly hope she gets nationwide recognition for her work here. She had amazing stunts as always, but also had scenes in which she could really showcase her acting and comedic timing. Ke Huy Quan, the actor who plays Waymond, was equally superb in my eyes. Some of you might recognize him as the little kid from Indiana Jones: Temple of Doom! His entire character is so unique, playing mostly a fragile man with a high pitched voice, but he really shines in ways you would not expect. He has one of the most memorable and well delivered scenes in the whole movie, which nearly brought me to tears. It seems he does not act much anymore but I would love to see him in more stuff. Stephanie Hsu, the daughter, was also fantastic and brought an amazing charisma to the movie. Good ole reliable James Hong did his thing as always. Probably the most interesting and funny performance to me was Jamie Lee Curtis as Deirdre, the IRS lady, who had some hilarious moments throughout the movie. All in all a stellar job from the entire cast.While I will likely need a second watch to try and fully grasp the message here (though not every movie has to have one), I did have a few takeaways on initial watch. I think this film really tries to tell us to appreciate what we have, even though it is quite literally focusing on the \"what ifs\" that lead to the alternate realities. Again without spoiling, each version of our protagonist has some flaws (some REALLY weird ones as you'll see) or some regrets. Applying this to just our non-multiversal reality, we tend to focus on what our peers around us have that we don't, when we should actually realize that everyone has things they regret or feel are missing. We should instead focus on fully cherishing the life we have and loving the people immediately around us. Another message, closely related to the first, seemed to be that we should sometimes slow down and just soak in what is around us rather than constantly worry about what is next. One particular scene involving silence and rocks especially drove this home. This soundless scene was placed so perfectly in the middle of a super audio-visual movie, and really made me feel how nice it was to just soak in the silence sometimes.A24 absolutely killed it with this one. I cannot wait to see what they have in store next. And I sincerely hope this film gets the recognition it deserves and wins awards. 10/10.",

It was a great action movie, a comedy and a drama all rolled into one - and in some crazy and chaotic way it just worked! The film often had me laughing, crying and ond the edge of my seat within minutes and didnt have a boring minute over its two hour+ runtime.Another thing thats amazing about this movie is that its the perfect counter model to all the boring and mediocre blockbuster movies of today: it risked trying something new instead of relying on old patterns. This is also reflected in the way in which the movie defies gender roles. Instead of a square-jawed male action hero or an infallible female lead we get to main characters with individual strengths and weaknesses who complement each other. It was amazing to see Ke Huy Quan's character being a hero in its own relatable way withouth relying on stereotypical male qualities. I just hope we get more movies like this in the future!",

I just feel like some ideas were awesome to begin with, but wore out their welcome after a while. And that if the film was a little tighter it would've popped more.

You will see a lot of scenes \"inspired\" by old classics, but it feels like the creators didn't see any of them, relying on the movie poster to understand what those classics were all about.

The underlying messages and references were nothing but a sweeping acceptance and self-acceptance thing. Not so much to think upon.I found the opening scene to be much more promising when it stayed in the realm of realism which made the title less literal and the story somehow deeper. Being everywhere all at once with no time for yourself to figure out what is happening in your life is a great theme and a more realistic portrayal of the situation would have led to the same amount of absurdity, only maybe more subtle than what it turned out to be.",

There were a few times I thought it was trying to do too much, but that idea would subside with each action sequence or poignant moment between the truly lovable characters.In terms of comparisons; it has shades of 'Matrix' (R. I. P.) but with far more heart, humor and creativity. There was a Charlie Kaufmann-esc depth to the script that ultimately drew me into this world of infinite imagination. Unlike Kaufmann, Daniels ('Swiss Army Man') have a dramatically more optimistic view of human nature that I found both refreshing and necessary considering the world we find ourselves in post COVID.The third act is transcendent in every sense of the word. Without giving away too much, I can say for certain that they stick the landing with such poise here that I found myself misty eyed and laughing for a solid 30 minutes. It's rare that a film -let alone a science fiction film with an unlikely combination of characters- elicits such a profound emotional response from me. From what I've been seeing and hearing I'm not alone there. A+On a related note, I would place 'Everything Everywhere All At Once' right behind 'Moonlight' and 'Ex Machina' as my top A24 film to date. Kudos once again to the greatest independent entertainment company in existence.",

A bit less of that \"ecstasy feeling\" or stupidity for the sake of it and could have been one of the greatest. Either way, a must-see and a film that can leave a mark on an entire generation.

But the film really does jump about all over the place and it is also at least 30 minutes too long. Michelle Yeoh is always worth watching and there is a good performance from Ke Huy Quan as her husband. But too many scenes are filler and not needed at all and it's a movie that will not linger in my memory.

            "content": "Some of the most important ingredients needed to make a film possible are passion, determination and craft- but most importantly it takes an immeasurable amount of CREATIVITY! If it's one thing I've learned with seeing films from both A24 and The Daniels, creativity is a quality neither are short of when it comes to displaying it out to the world. With all that being said the latest venture from The Daniels, Everything Everywhere All at Once, is one of the most extraordinary and pleasantly psychotic pieces of entertainment I've ever seen on the silver screen!!! This film fires on all cylinders when it comes to displaying the abundant amount of originality and creativity behind its premise, which I something you don't see very often in movies today. It's a real rarity when finding films of this nature that not only succeeds in whacky & absurd entertainment (being action or what not), but also finding the time to deliver a meaningful & and complex story that you're unlikely to forget anytime soon.Based on my observations from previous Daniels' productions, I came to expect the usual quirks and weirdness with their brand of humor but never did I expect for it to effectively blossom as it did on such a large scale. Tagging alongside the humor, there is a great amount of heart and feeling to further increase your emotional intake as you truly do feel just about 'everything'. The Daniels have found such a creative & moving method to demonstrate a vast array of emotions, which never feels like it will teeter too far in one direction. An immeasurable sense of fun stays with you all the way through- that's a feeling I rarely get to experience in such a consistent manner where it lingers onward after the screening. An experience like this one has managed to carefully and cleverly infuse so many emotions to feel when watching EEAAO, which can be easily trace back to the craftsmanship of this film's directing duo. All the plethora of feelings to experience here are attributed by the amazing direction & writing from Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, who allowed themselves to let their creative juices flow so openly and freely. Perhaps the only gripe I would have is that a few minutes could have been shaved off, which may not seem like a major deal at first but at times a few minutes more or less in a film can make a huge difference. As I've mentioned before, the majority of the time (practically 100%) I enjoyed myself during the screening, but it did feel ever-so-slightly longer than it needed to be. For me this was a very minor dent in the overall experience but it was not enough to damage the massive enjoyment and thrill ride this film was.With this film still being more of an indie flick, you would think there'd more limitations as to what they are able to do here, yet the production teams utilize what's available to them and more in order to create the wild spectacle presented to you. Both practical and special effects are demonstrated throughout the film, which is a quality that may go unappreciated at first but later on you could look back it and applaud for what these filmmakers had to work with. Budgets and finances for a film of this type don't usually happen often, but for the instance of EEAAO the money was used adequately across all areas whether it be production design, costumes, visual effects or sound. As an audience member, it's a great feeling when you see filmmakers like The Daniels who seemed to have used their film's budget wisely without making it look like they deliberately cut corners to save a few bucks. It's a discouraging feeling to go see a movie nowadays and you see a blatantly incomplete product right in front of you, especially, when you see the big price tag attached to the film. In the case of EEAAO, it looks like every dollar was spent accordingly and it feels as complete as it a film should be when you see it in a theater. On both the narrative and technical levels, a film of this nature finds itself in a cozy little spot to fully display its colors in the upmost confidence without damaging itself by means of nonsensicalness & outlandishness.Besides the filmmakers and rest of the crew, a cast makes up the other majority of creativity power behind a film. And this cast... is OUTSTANDING!!! We have here a lively and energetic group of performers that give their everything in terms of delivering dimensional performances, plus the energy behind their performances shows just how much fun they seemed to have tremendous fun while making this film. Michelle Yeoh & Ke Huy Quan are the major standouts among this cast, but it wouldn't be fair to not mention performances from Stephanie Hsu & Jamie Lee Curtis who also give some notable performances. The leading lady herself, Michele Yeoh, truly shines as an actress with her continuously impressive physicality and emotional range with a character like Evelyn Wang. Making leaps and bounds across the multiverse, Yeoh seamlessly jumps between comedic and dramatic moments with each of those showing her 110% devotion to those moments. Alongside Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan makes an explosive return to the silver screen as an optimistic hearted and fun-loving character that serves as so much of the soul among the whole cast. As to the antagonist here, Stephanie Hsu's Joy Wang acts as a good clashing figure to go up against Michele Yeoh's Evelyn. Joy's character is complicated and emotionally resonating as someone simply wanting to be accepted and loved while understanding the craziness of the multiverse, which Hsu does exceedingly well. Plus it's amazing to seeing actresses Michele Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis being given the opportunity to play characters like these at their ages and show off just how badass they can be.Creating something like EEAAO is a once in a lifetime kind of film where you get a meaningful and humorous story as well as a wildly entertaining spectacle that brings nothing but fun to all who watch it. A24 has done it once again as a studio known for creating new and original pieces that truly standout among the mass collective of films coming out every year. The Daniels have placed themselves in a special place in people's consciousness as filmmakers that will surely blow their minds with the unexpected and wildly creative imagination to come out of any two people's brains. It's an exciting opportunity to see cast of this caliber and creative vision this distinctive to shine as bright as it has in this very cluttered world.",

            "content": "You remember that observation that someone with a fancy car was usually compensating for \"something\" or shall we say, a lack of something?... I feel I could apply that to this film, but the fancy car in this films case is a stylish cinematic visual orgy, and what's being compensated for is (imo) the ability to visually and creatively convey human truth and touch the human heart. They tried, they really did, but it's similar to people who overindulge on self-help lifestyles, and throw every bit of hypocritical guru advice, 'spiritual' workshop, buddhist mantras, Alan Watts diatribe and the garden ornaments with the kitchen sink thrown in for good measure, it's just too much to the point the core of the intention is lost in the superfluous, crushed in the mass volume of input.This film has so much going on, that in places and at times it creates a sensory input overload, and by the time the lovely sweet, almost gushy but very meaningful beautiful message of finding love in the mundane and those around us, myself and I feel others who have watched this who saw through the glitz and glamour are left with a cinematic experience of a film who's heart suffers from existential density. It is dense because of the amount of matter shoved into a heart shaped chocolate box, filled with concrete.Let me suddenly shift things a bit, not unlike the films visual style... I have been a fan of Michelle Yeoh since Police Story 3. One of my favourite films I have seen her in is \"Sunshine\", which I think is highly underrated. She shined in that movie, even though it wasn't a major part for her, it really showed her talent in a short space of screen time. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, a beautiful experience, imo was the highlight of her career, a delicate but stoic performance underlining a powerful presence and impressive physicality and martial ability when not being played by a stunt-woman. With EEAAO, I'm so glad someone gave her a chance at centre stage, and throughout this film she was a pleasure to watch. But for me the real gem of this movie was Ke Huy Quan. It took me maybe 15 minutes to finally realise, \"Hey that's the kid from The Goonies!\". His performance actually managed to pierce my heart. This shows also a very well written character, which shows me 'The Daniels' can write impressive insightful screenplay, half the time at least. I feel the same about this movie as I do with their prior film, \"Swiss Army Man\", a mixed bag oddity of beautiful humanitarian concepts and deep social commentary and an interesting probe into the less visited parts of the human psyche, whilst simultaneously grappling with perverse visual humour and sickly gushy sentimentality. The same could be said of EEAAO, but the perverse over the top visual humour is toned down for most of the film, but still rears (excuse the pun) it's ugly head in the form of a giant dildo being used as a martial arts weapon, a scene where Michelle Yeoh is dressed as an adult baby and red substance is squirted on her as if mimicking blood which I found quite disturbing and completely unnecessary for any plot development and character unravelling, and lovers with sausage wieners for fingers which when bitten into leaked and squirted mayonnaise or custard or god knows what everywhere. To me, these things are perverse and disgusting, and just seem to be two guys with some warped fetishes getting their fix from sneaking this stuff into their movie (but hey maybe I shouldn't be so surprised, this is Hollywood we're talking about, I'm sure everything is normal about Hollywood social cliques these days). There is a lot of unnecessary things in this movie, including the reference to Wong Kar Wai's movie \"In the Mood for Love\" and similar, as much as it's nice to give a visual nod to their inspirations/role models, they seem to forget they have a story to tell. By this point in the 3rd act of the movie it was dragging on.... Much like my review.It's a visually impressive movie when it's not shoving things up it's own a**, but takes too long to get to it's most rewarding point. Great performances by all actors involved, some inspiring moments both visually and emotively, but overall a cluster pluck of mostly needless martial arts cliches and what seems to be a ridiculous competition to see how far jokes and meaning can be pushed before it all becomes meaningless. Yeah, the rocks were cute and funny, but by this point, I wanted a landslide to come along and push them to the end of the movie.",

Wtf happened to people???My guess is Tik Tok has ruined people's brains and attention span and so this is the kind of movie they enjoy: cheap comedy, very short scenes that make no sense and shallow 'philosophical' ideas. Totally depressing. I was expecting to at least see Yeoh performing some quality martial arts scenes, but not even that. They've added so many ridiculous special effects that the fight scenes become embarrassing to watch. They're not funny at all. Disgraceful. I'm giving a 1 in order to maybe save some people from having high expectations as I did and wasting their money in the kino. Total garbage that may please social media addicted adolescents, that's it.",

            "content": "In Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert's Everything Everywhere All At Once, Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) is an aging immigrant going through the daily struggles of life. That is until Evelyn learns from her other multiverse husband, Waymong Wang (Ke Huy Quan), that she is the only one who can save the world from a multiverse evil and she must fight this evil by hopping between multiverses using the skills of her other versions and also learning what she could have done with her life based off the chances she didn't take.The movie surprisingly blowed me away. While watching the film I was quite surprised by the quality of the VFX as I had learned that the movie was a highly rated, low-budget indie film. I assumed the VFX would be fine, but did not expect it to so believable and feel as if I was a watching a big-budget popcorn flick. It's an impressive feat to be able to deliver such good CGI on a budget of $50 million.The film has an intriguing screenplay with the first 15 minutes giving zero hints about the surrealism about to be experienced (I personally didn't even view a trailer and just watched it based off recommendations, so it truly blew me away). From the point the surrealism and the multiversal activity begins the pacing picks up and entirely hooks you in, although the drama that came prior was just as interesting. The film feels like it's movie a little slower during the final third of the film, but it's sealed off with an emotional climax that churns the heart.The writing of the film was very deep and this is noticed by the many layers, peeling off the layers towards the end of the movie you realize that this movie used the tool of a multiverse battle to give us a deeper message regarding how we should look at all the possibilities we have at hand and never look back with regret. The movie touches on other topics like the generational gaps, stereotypes regarding immigrant parents (particularly from Asia), and homosexuality in a very organic way such that it never feels like it's forced in to send the message at the end. In fact, the final emotional message sent seems to organically originate our of the character interactions and the metaphorical multiverse battle. When you complete the movie and ponder about what you have seen is when the layers come off that the movie was largely filled with metaphors about how to look at life.Overall, this is a deep movie which on the surface gives you a fun, beautiful multiverse battle, but peeling open the layers shows you that there are multiple metaphors involved and that there is more than that meets to the eye, giving us a new outlook on how to view life. It will be a movie I also will be highly recommending to others.",

I think the directors aimed for this movie to have a deep message but im kind of unsure what that is. My interpretation is basically the obstacles the mother has to go through on her own why also learning to let go of her daughter, let her be her own person and live her life. The mother seem to have a hard time doing this because of how easily her own father was willing to send her away. In the end the movie was long and drawn out I do not recommend.",

We begin at following the Evelyn in the laundromat. She eventually gains a power to be in every universe simultaneously at the same time. Therefore she has infinite amount of joys and worries in her world. At the same time, she has 15 kids she has to worry about, at another she's locked away in prison, and in another she has the 1 child, Joy, and husband, Raymond. In the end of the movie it tried to conclude by saying that she chooses her daughter and husband. But how it could it be that simple? How can she \"choose\" anything when she is everything. There are universes where her daughter and husband don't exist. There are universes where her daughter and husband are abusive to her and her choosing them would be the worst possible thing. In the movie we see into universes where her daughter doesn't seem to exist, the hotdog universe and chef universe. I guess you could argue that she chose happiness in each universe what ever that meant to her. But was she not choosing happiness before? Happiness is very subjective, so how can you say someone just decided to choose happiness all of a sudden. Nevermind the fact that everytime a decision was made in that movie a universe was being created. There are universes where she chose to kill her daughter. Universes where she died. Universes where she went into the bagel. The movie seems to act as if only 5 universes exist and completely glosses over the infinite universes. Additionally there is no resolve. Joy and Evelyn still have the power to be in every universe at the same time. Where is the conclusion of the movie, what changed?",

He marriage is basically over, her daughter just came out as a lesbian, her ailing father, who lives with her and constantly criticizes her, demands attention. The family business (a laundromat) is failing, the IRS is harassing them, and she is haunted by her failed career as a singer. In the alternative universes she has superhuman strength and is a martial arts expert. That's a good thing because she's also being pursued by an arch-villainess who is determined to kill her off in every one of those alternative universes. There are a lot of fight scenes (mostly CGI). There are also some laughs along the way, but nothing truly hilarious, unless you like jokes about sticking objects where-the-moon-don't-shine. I guess it comes down to the fact that this is just not my kind of movie. The audience I saw it with was composed mostly of young people who seemed to enjoy it enormously. The makeup was outstanding.

With outstanding performances from all the cast, with Ke Huy Quan especially. As the song states, This is Our Life.",

That's certainly what a lot of people will be feeling, after seeing this movie...no..sorry... \"Piece of art\" I should say, that meets silliness on an abstruse level. Rarely did I ever experience such an emotional rollercoaster, where it goes from silly stupid joke, to intense philosophy, back to an obscene joke, reverts back to social criticism, building up an intense emotional fraction, just to rip you out of this again with a dumb joke.I love movies, that are dark sheep, disguised in Pikachu yellow cotton candy, so you really need to wait for some fine British drizzling, to see the actual dark core of the satire here.The chemistry that Ke Huy Quan and Michelle Yeoh have is simply amazing and I would be VERY surprised NOT to see her winning an Oscar for this, even though dramedies tend to get robbed at the Oscars! This goes as well for an INSANE amount of editing work, that needs to be appreciated. With only 2h17 runtime it does feel almost twice as long though, which is not a bad thing, it is a long journey! You could probably write your master thesis in philosophy and social psychology completely based on those two hours, there is so much you could write about this, but I'll end it here, just go and watch it for yourself and form an own opinion.This is the most bizarre movie you have seen in the last decade or so and the bold level of abnormality this movie delivers, while still being so meta....that's simply an accomplishment of art!",

            "content": "This is a unique sci-fi/action/comedy, with a captivating twist on the parallel universe theme. Incorporating several Kung Fu action scenes which also come with unusually comedic twists. The story is pretty deep but not in an overly pretentious way, and while there are a few brief moments where the writing crosses the line into cringe, for the most part the story is excellent. It's definitely helped by the superb acting by all of the main characters, and in fact the entire cast of this movie did a great job.There's not really a single slip up from any actor in the entire movie. This may be, at least in part, due to the director being able to bring the best out of the actors. Cinematography is also great although it's clear to see the directors have experience in music videos so expect a little bit of that aesthetic at times.If you've seen parallel universe movies before, you'll already know it's best to just go ahead and watch it instead of hearing about it described in a review.This review was written using precisely-squirted ocean water on the blazing hot sand of a nudist beach. It was later transmitted to this universe for the sole purpose of appearing on this website.Now back to the beach..",

The action scenes are incredible and the music is used very well.In addition, it is definetly the most creative movie I have seen in a long time. The whole cast is awesome. In my opinion, Michelle Yeoh should be nominatet for best actress.The multiverse is handled much better than in other movies that came out this year (e.g. Dr. Strange). The attention to detail impressed me as well as the wonderful use of colour and sound.Unfortunatly, the plot in the second half of the movie is not as focused as it is in the first one.Nevertheless, the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat until the credits roll.After Swiss Army Man I had very high expectations and I am happy to say that the Daniels easily subverted them.",

Is the movie playing by its own rules or is it being sloppy? Even if you pay attention, you won't be able to tell. But maybe that's the point.If you were to ask: What is this movie about? I could give a pretty long list. It's about love, family, suicide, life, pain, confusion, the meaning of life, anger, happiness, kindness, being OK with imperfection (see title).Relatively early on, we hear the phrase \"Nothing matters\" and we feel how true that is. Then, the movie tries to convince us otherwise. Successfully? I don't know. But it makes us feel that in this one moment in this character's life, some things matter even if in the infinite span of the universe it may not.I feel that I should not be rating this movie, but instead giving it a N/A rating. It's not perfect, it can't be, but it does make the viewer emotional and think. I've watched a ton of movies in the last couple of months/years and my first reaction is to point out all the things wrong with them. But with this one, I feel like that's not what it's about.

Nah!The movie obviously had some impressive scenes and dialogues but they were really a few. And as the title of the movie says it is literally about everything all at once, but is that a good thing? I mean mentioning so many concepts at a very superficial level? Is it good? I think that is why I couldn't emotionally connect to the movie or it didn't make me think that much. Adding so many ingredients to a salad doesn't necessarily make it delicious, maybe you can show off with that but still it's not delicious! I feel the same about this movie, it was just too much and not that enjoyable and not that deep. One other thing I didn't like about the movie is that I think it was like a collage of many other movies and animations. There were many scenes that they reminded us of other movies, (Rick & Morty for example) which I don't think is a good thing. Also sometimes during the movie I thought it doesn't make any coherent sense that I felt like the directors must had been on drugs. :DBut I kind of liked the way they showed parallel worlds, it was a bit overwhelming at the beginning but I think this theory itself is overwhelming so they did an okay job on this, even though I'm waiting for a better movie about multiverse!

It can encompass profound truths; wrapped in comedy, absurdism, philosophy, action and drama all at once. It is brutally sincere in the best ways while stretching comedy and taste in the complete opposite direction. It is a movie that wears both its title and it's heart on its sleeve in a way no one could possibly predict.At this stage it is almost impossible to talk about its influences or compare it to other works of art, authors or directors because the influences are both overt and subtle. Yes it is if Douglas Adams wrote a script about the motherwound directed by Michel Gondry. But it's also Ang Lee directing the Matrix as if it was a parable of generational trauma instead of coming out as trans. It's an insanely wild ride that has the power to heal and change the people watching it for the better.It's almost impossible to overstate its power. I have personally seen it help a hardened friend come to terms with their depression and loneliness, and soothe the grief of a couple losing their first born to a miscarriage.It's art at its most life changing purest and that's the highest recommendation I can give.",

With an extremely unique way of addressing the multiverse and in a way I feel it pokes fun at marvels multiverse which is ironic when you see who the producers are (spoilers it's the Russo brothers the men behind Endgame. Which was the introduction to the multiverse in the MCU) as the film was about to end I had the question \"is that it?\" Not because it had a cliffhanger ending as a matter of fact it's ending feels like a closed book. But because I wanted to keep watching the reality jumping chaos.One thing that should be noted is that everything that's happening on screen through every reality is happening at the same time as each other.

But it beats the Marvel multiverse movies that cost 10 times more. And the reason is simple: the script is better. The characters have emotional arcs that mean something. You really don't know how the tension will resolve until the end. And the end is moving and profound. There is real feeling here and believable, imperfect characters.The multiverse isn't just there for inventive, fun visual effects. It is there to allow us to explore character, motivation and, remarkably, deep philosophical choices. Somehow the characters explore deep issues of free will, choice, alternative paths for their lives and whether all those infinite choices mean absolutely nothing is meaningful. For a moment, the lead characters flirt with a nihilist resolution. But choose something different. Not a trivial resolution where good things happen and everyone lives happily ever after, but a realistic acceptance of the good things in a flawed, imperfect world.The first time I watched it I thought it was a great movie. The second time I realised it was also a deeply moving story. The third time, I realised I had still missed a lot and it deserved an unequivocal top score.It reminded me of some of my other favorite oddball movies.

Well, I'm glad I didn't. The movie had so many awkward moments and it tried to send a message of some kind the whole time, but somehow I did not buy it. It reminded me of some other multiverse movies(it borrows from them too), but does its own, I call it goofy version, which I did not enjoy at all. I haven't seen it mentioned here, but there's something about it that made me recall Cloud Atlas. Maybe because it involved same characters in different scenarios? I can see the effort put in it and the acting was quite good, but after it was over I felt like watching some random fan fiction parody. To me it does not feel like a complete movie and it is understandable considering the smaller budget. However, there should be a fine line between cheap production and just having low budget. A real masterpiece is the one you can never guess the budget for it. The movie is okay to watch even if a bit long, but doesn't come even close to TOP 250.",

It is both poignant and laugh-out-loud funny.

Its wildly imaginative and has a radical new take on the multiverse concept. Its endlessly imaginative and really feels like a film where literally anything could happen. Its also really well crafted, especially for its budget. Its even more of an achievement given that it was made during the pandemic. Despite this I did find myself wishing there was more use of animation perhaps with the racacoonie sections.Its by no means perfect though and has some significant flaws. It at times, like with the films of Wes Anderson, finds itself stylistically being quirky for the sake of being quirky due to a desire to have a unique and signiture auteurist style. This maximalist, post-modernist fever dream aesthetic is at times quite detrimental to the experience. One find themselve overwhelmed and confused, and the swifty pacing can makes it difficult to keep up. This sensation is also contributed by it being bursting with too many ideas and I think it should have been cut down. It definitely feels detrimentally long which is in part contributed to by in the third act every scene feeling like its the grand finale.Overall its a brillianly funny and imaginative film which poeple will be talking about years from now. Despite its flaws I would highly recommend watching it. There really is nothing like it.",

The way in which it delves into the concept of the multiverse is truly breathtaking from both a visual and symbolic standpoint. All of the costumes and locations are vibrant and meaningful to the main characters in more ways than one. This makes every setting and every decision these characters make feel extremely important throughout the entire movie. There's a ton of multiverses that are explored too and the same can be said about the symbolic messages and \"hidden\" meanings behind this film. The story was executed so brilliantly that there's plenty of time for audiences to adore every single character, provide intense sci-fi action, tons of humor, and serious tones/themes together seamlessly. One minute you might find yourself laughing pretty hard, the next you might be trying to hold back a tear or two. Everywhere All At Once has a lot to say regarding the human condition yet somehow manages to still be a sci-fi epic. A24 movies aren't for everyone but the originality and amazing execution from a filmmaking standpoint is simply undeniable here.",

What differentiates this movie from say, a movie like \"the matrix\" is that it's as profound as any, say, Dogme 95 film while keeping the fantastic imagery top notch throughout.The movie reminded me so much of \"mother!\" by Aronofsky, it had some big shoes to fill indeed and filled them very well.

All this while being fun, funny, and emotionally captivating. There are even callbacks to humorous moments, both comedic and dramatic, that still manage to heighten the stakes. The scope of the story is ultimately small; at the end of the day it's about a family dealing with financial difficulties, a possible divorce, and a distant daughter. How the rest of the events unfold is up to the viewer's interpretation, but I like how it works on multiple levels like that. I really don't want to say much else, just go see it. There's something for everyone and it's hard for me to think of another recent movie that works so well on essentially every level. It may sound clich\u00e9d, but I laughed, I cried, it got me thinking, this is what cinema was made for. That's saying something coming from me.

            "content": "The premise of this movie is great and I really enjoyed like the first half of it, despite some flaws. But then it completely loses its plot and falls apart. Feels like this was even written by an AI, making it an incoherent mess.Weirdness is always fun for me, but it needs to be coherent. Douglas Adams or Terry Pratchett were masters of coherent weirdness and it feels like the writers were going for something like that here (especially thinking of the Improbability Drive). But the difference here is that the weirdness isn't smart. They could have come up with so many strange and wonderful universe ideas which could have had at least some logical explanation how they evolved. But what they did was three or four ridiculous throwaway gags like hotdog fingers or a stupid Ratatouille spoof which make no sense whatsoever and which they loved so much that they repeat them over and over and over again throughout the movie when they could have explored endless possibilities. And no, a universe where life didn't evolve has no telepathically thinking, moving rocks with googly eyes or even a blue sky.Then they introduce the very dangerous antagonist who can mix universes at will, giving her incredible powers with awesome on-screen effects. The heroine then, against the pleading of the people who gave her the ability to jump universes, intends to learn the same powers, but not falling into the dark place where the antagonist went and using them to stop her.Which is a nice concept and completely forgotten for the rest of the film. Don't know if the budget was gone or if the AI who wrote the movie just doesn't have long-term memory to come up with a coherent plot over +2 hours. But the antagonist basically doesn't do anything from then on and they just talk, jumping between the few universes which have already been introduced. Which has some interesting philosophical thoughts thrown in - after all I went into the movie expecting some philosophy and meaning behind the craziness - but they could have done that while keeping the plot alive.Then, after lots of talking and jumping, the relationships are kind of fixed (or back where they started) and the movie ends. If this isn't the most anticlimactic last half of a movie I've ever seen, then I don't know.All in all, it's a very frustrating movie. I love the basic concept and was looking forward to what the Daniels would do with it, especially after I loved Swiss Army Man. Very disappointed.",

This might be my favourite 2022 movie. I'm so glad I saw this in a full theatre.This is a proper multiverse movie. When you see the idea of multiverse in superhero movies, it's cool and all but it's never the main focus of the story. This movie on the other hand, really explores what it means for a person, if the multiverse really exists. It asks you, how would you deal with that fact? Let's say every choice you make just creates another universe where you, and everyone else live with that choice. Let's say there are millions of versions of you who are much better off than you are today. Maybe, because of some bad choices you are where you are today. How would you deal with it? Or does it even matter what choice YOU make anymore? The movie brilliantly nails in this feeling of \"Nothing matters\" into it's characters, and it's viewers. And still, it gives out a very optimistic message. It redeems those emotions in a satisfying finale.It might sound that this is a very serious movie. Trust me, this movie is hilarious for 90% of the runtime. It asks all these serious questions in the most entertaining, hilarious way possible. It's full of jokes and has some intense, dark yet ridiculously funny action sequences with great stuntwork too. It's the sort of movie where you'll think \"what's even going on anymore?\" and not in a bad way, in a very funny way. It's like whatever bizzare, offbeat thing came to the director's mind, he just did it. And I love when creators fully express themselves without holding back. The movie is very fast paced too, full of energy. The editing in particular, is very, very creative.To make this masterpiece with just 25 million dollar budget, it's a rare feat.",

But this movie can't decide when, or how, to incorporate elements of those genres. Hot dog hands as a serious plot point? Raccoon-head man as an empathetic character? Waymond as a 007-type?

So many things happen during the runtime of the film that there's always something to love, and you'll come out with several memorable moments to joke about.The title Everything Everywhere All at Once describes the viewing experience perfectly.

While most of them seem to be relegated to comic book adaptations (like Loki, Spider-man: No Way Home (2021), and Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness (2022)), by far the best one to emerge from this pile of parallel universes is Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022). It is the most bizarrely funny movie I've seen in some time, which just goes to show how films released by A24 are of a higher caliber than anything else.Most multiverse movies play it pretty safe when exploring branching paths of the known universe. Everything Everywhere All at Once throws literally everything at the audience, and the result is hilarious. Office equipment mechas, Human Ratatouilles, Rocks, Bagels. I honestly can't come close to describing the rapid-fire series of absurdist realities. Some moments were straight laugh-out-loud funny to me, and others were...a bit more adult in their ridiculousness. I definitely suggest going in sober for this film, as you'll need all your mental faculties to absorb it.At its heart, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a movie about family. Mothers and daughters. Spouses. Grandfathers. The only reason I don't give this movie a full five stars is because the core of the movie is a little lost by the end. After all the weird stuff thrown on the screen in two hours, coming back to a semblance of a normal reality felt hollow, even if it was necessary to tie everything from everywhere back to the plot that started the movie. Yes, it is a heartfelt ending, but it's difficult to take it seriously after dildo fights and hot dog fingers.The best multiverse movie to come out in ages, I give Everything Everywhere All at Once 4.5 stars out of 5.",

She is incredible in the first twenty minutes of giving off the day-to-day chaos energy the universe throws at her.I'm sorry, but not surprised, to see so many negative reviews here. This is a purposefully chaotic, strange, and whiplash movie that so rarely graces the screen these days and is so refreshing to see Hollywood still has some originality.

            "content": "Everything Everywhere All at Once, the latest offering from A24, is set to go down as one the most innovative, heartfelt, and nonsensical movies of the year. Starring Michelle Yeoh, the film follows Evelyn Wang, a woman who learns she has the power to exist in parallel universes tasked with stopping the person trying to destroy them all. Evelyn is feeling an increasing amount of pressure as she preps the paperwork for her and her husband's dry cleaning business to go through an audit while also prepping for a Chinese New Year party as well as dealing with her distant daughter. When an alternate version of Waymond appears to tell her the multiverse in trouble and she's the only one who can save it all, Evelyn is swept up in events beyond her control as she finds a way to save everything, everywhere, all at once.While the premise may sound outlandish (because it is), at the heart of the movie is the generational trauma and interpersonal drama between the Wang family. Evelyn's rejection of her daughter's modern sensibilities, her ever-growing distance from her husband, a looming threat of suicide, and the baggage of any number of past decisions haunt the film from the first frame to the final one. All this is balanced deftly with the sci-fi elements of dimension hopping and universe-spanning adventures. The best science fiction is that which uses the genre trappings to tell a human story and directors Kwan and Scheinert have managed to weave a story that is exactly that. Is the science part of the movie a bit wonky and hand-wavy? Absolutely. But using it to tell the tale of a family on the verge of shattering that is funny, shocking, emotional, and impactful while also finding clever ways to pay homage to classic movies like 2001 and In the Mood for Love makes Everything Everywhere one of the year's best movies.Michelle Yeoh finally found a vehicle where she could let her talents fly, and fly they do. Without a doubt, Everything Everywhere is firmly her film; all the elements and themes flow through Evelyn Wang and directors Kwan and Scheinert have given her avenues to show both her comedic and dramatic chops. While we've seen these before (think Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or her role on Star Trek: Discovery), it's rare we get to see such a substantial amount of both at the same time. Her martial arts acumen is well documented; seeing that combined with the dizzying array of other gifts she presents here reminds us that Yeoh has been a consummate performer for three decades and while there isn't a weak link in the acting in this film, no one else is holding a candle to her.Stephanie Hsu comes pretty close, however. While Yeoh is the film's main focus, Hsu's Joy is handling a lot of the subtle work throughout the film. In a movie that can only be described as ostentatious, Hsu's muted performance makes Joy one of the standout characters. Carrying the brunt of the film's anguish, Hsu is marvelous as she traverses through makeup and costumes as both Joy and the antagonist Jobu Tupaki, the person willing to burn it all down. Hsu and Yeoh's chemistry is electric as the two play off each other, ending in an aching moment of emotional catharsis that is equal parts relief and revelatory. Yeoh and Hsu sell these final moments, the crux of the entire movie, and thanks to their performances, the film rockets from good to great.Ke Huy Quan, better known to some as Data from the Goonies or Short Round from Indiana Jones, has less to do in the movie than Yeoh or Hsu but is no less important. A main part of the cause of the breaking family that is the Wangs, Quan's Waymond is the paragon of hope and optimism. Contrasted to Evelyn's depressed where-did-it-all-go-wrong mentality, Waymond's ebullience is both infectious and nauseating. While both Evelyn and Joy get multiple opportunities to shine, Waymond gets one great scene with Eveyln towards the end of the film that makes his character's entire trajectory worthwhile. Jamie Lee Curtis appears throughout the film as well as Deirdre, the IRS inspector set to take all that the Wangs hold dear. As a constant antagonist through the film, Curtis is great in her I-could-really-give-a-shit demeanor as a woman who's just doing her job, albeit at the expense of the Wang's livelihood. While the Wangs are the centerpiece of the movie, Curtis manages to compliment them in every scene she's in. James Hong, in less scenes than Curtis, is a delight to see as always as Evelyn's dad and brings a sorely needed gravitas to his scenes that are necessary to keeping the movie anchored.Directed by The Daniels (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert), Everything Everywhere is a follow up to their equally inventive Swiss Army Man. Whereas Swiss Army Man presents a more surrealist type of story, Everything Everywhere pushes the envelope even father in terms of inventiveness and creativeness. The main strength of the film, and in The Daniels' storytelling, is the focus on the main issue: a dysfunctional family. Regardless of every bit of nonsense the directors throw at the audience, from our characters portrayed as rocks to a world where everyone has hot dogs for fingers, the story always reverts back to the Wang family and their interconnected struggles. Technically, Everything Everywhere is a masterpiece, managing to consistently shift through genres without losing sight of the objective. Be it the brilliant makeup Hsu's Joy is decked out in or her outlandish costume designs, the level of detail that went into creating the film reveals how well thought out and meticulous The Daniels and their crew are.Overall, Everything Everywhere All at Once will go down as one of the most impressive displays of creativity and imagination on screen. Daniels Kwan and Scheinert's ability to pull off a zany, darkly comedic sci-fi movie while interweaving a poignant family drama is nothing short of amazing. By far Michelle Yeoh's best role to date (as well as Stephanie Hsu's), Everything Everywhere shines a dazzling spotlight on the actress' myriad talents and specialties. An outrageously inventive premise, combined with strong acting and brilliant direction makes this a phones down, all senses dialed in must watch immediately.",

            "content": "It is quite rare that narrative techniques are not only perfectly utilised but invented for a film that does not stand upon nor shed the light on such techniques for the sake of positive critical appraisal but rather to immerse a wider range of audience ending up with some sort of family movie.The risk lies within the fact that this could have been taken for what it really wasn't. The narrative 'mistakes' used on purpose were hit or miss, but in my opinion, work on so many levels.It never relied on ironic humour but rather 'silly' humour which was not amusing to a lot of people. Now, my take is this was not part of a comedy bit but a meta bit. The whole movie was actually meta, referencing many sci-fi ideas commonly used and turning this from just a fun movie into much more than that, for those who are into it anyway. It was messy as Joy said; it was really weird how every adjective that could've been used to describe the narration was mentioned by someone in the movie. I'm kinda sure they did it on purpose.A take from the story was that it's okay to be okay with silly. Silly and simple is okay sometimes and so were the jokes. A silly husband like that one may not be someone we meet every day, and those are not the random jokes expected to be in a sci film, but here we are. We understand how silly this whole situation is, we understand how silly everything is.The movie was messy just like Joy and Evelyn but it was consistently so. It consistently delivered imperfections that were already vital takes from the story.It could be argued that there was no specific point of climax but more like half an hour of a climax and it is a valid point but also valid for the writers to execute. They did an incredible job at delivering an experience of everything, all at once. It is what life is like after all.This was somehow never confusing at any point which many directors could have taken an advantage of the feed those who are satisfied watching complicated non-linear storytelling but they didn't; they took the risk to take it further. They took the risk to turn it into this bagel of a project of a film.I loved how the stories or realisations of mistakes blended in together so seamlessly. It was so many genres and ideas in one simply made and easily-understood movie. This, somehow, worked?Profound. Tremendously relatable. Absolutely real.This is a 10/10 not because it's perfect for perfect does not exist but because it's beyond original, it's here to revolutionalize the film industry.Will be deserving next year's best picture.Absolutely Phenomenal.",

But if you are trying to watch it while looking down at something you are working on you will miss important elements, and that would be a shame.The acting all round was superb, serious where it had to be, exasperated, incredulous, sympathetic, angry. Just about every actor here put in an above average or incredible performance. Some bits were, well weird as hell, but that was really just to make a point. And even those weird bits were often of high emotional impact.The directing choices were on point, the pacing was neither to fast or to slow, and the character development was well done without making anyone a caricature of themselves.

            "content": "A little known piece of movie trivia. For the 1978 film Superman, when Marlon Brando was first hired to play Jor-El, father of Superman, he spooked the producers by explaining that, as a Method Actor, he was not sure if he should play the role as a giant bagel? What is it with Hollywood and metaphysics and bagels? This one of a kind film uses clever writing and excellent actors to explain Quantum Theory. Which, for those who care, is not 100% compatible with Einsteinian physics. The film is a wonderful experience, but is not truly entertainment. For example, it takes an entire half-hour just to connect with the viewer, runs too long, and is not likely to be your first choice for a re-watch. But it does take its special place in film history, and it definitely lingers.

One thing, however, is clear: it is better to give this meaningless existence a try than go mindlessly into the void. This longing to exist is unique to this sort of nihilistic storytelling.I see... ironically I need more characters because rules exist.

I should've listened to my instincts.If you want a \"fun, silly\" ride, this ain't it, at least not for me. I recommend watching RRR (Rise Roar Revolt) instead. RRR was delightfully absurd and over-the-top but in an enjoyable way that leaves you in a great mood. I was similarly skeptical with that film at first, but before I knew it three hours flew by and I was only disappointed it had to end.I had similar hopes for this film. Nope.In comparison, EEAO is a flaming dumpster floating down a flooded street in a hurricane of pretentious nihilistic post-modern suck, that just leaves you feeling like you finally escaped an intensely exhausting ordeal with someone having a psychotic break.It was painful to watch from beginning to end.The family of characters is introduced, and they are cliche, irritating in different ways, and unlikable. You may hope that will change. It won't. The plot is paper thin with no room or time for them to believably change.The film gradually ramps up with increasing absurdity like a bad acid trip, and once it's fully off the rails, it stays there for what seems like an insufferable eternity.The humor: So outlandish, vulgar, and immature that even my raunchy-comedy/adult-cartoon loving partner grew tired of it very quickly.The action/fighting: Relies heavily on the absurdity of the above humor rather than exciting originality or execution. It's stunningly dumb and unbelievable, which in turn makes it boring and unimpressive to watch. As an action fan, this probably pained me the most. I won't even mention how many films it ripped off, poorly, even as a parody.Take the comedy, the action, and add in an extremely shallow, barely fleshed out concept of a multiverse to disappoint the sci-fi fans, and then beat it to death over and over because apparently the audience is too dumb to get it the first 50 times. It's as if the filmmakers were so utterly impressed with themselves for being 'So creative! So quirky! So edgy!' that they just couldn't stop, move on, and get on with it.Then in the last half hour or so, the filmmakers suddenly remembered they were supposed to be making a movie and clumsily shoehorned in a bad attempt to have a point and character development. But it was too little, too late, feeling completely forced and frankly unwelcome after the pile of garbage I just endured.I've lost a great deal of respect for anyone involved with or involved with promoting this film. I hated virtually every tortured minute of it.",

Directed by the duo known as Daniels, this film takes you on a journey through multiple universes, and let me tell you, it's heck of a trip!Michelle Yeoh stars as a badass middle aged woman who discovers she has the power to travel through different dimensions. And who knew that power could come in so handy when you need to fight off a bunch of bad guys? Yeoh's performance is nothing short of amazing, and it's a testament to her talent that she can make kicking butt in multiple universes seem so effortless.But what really makes this movie shine is the incredible supporting cast. Ke Huy Quan plays Yeoh's husband/mentor, and He is simply amazing, and of course their daughter Stephanie Hsu? Well, let's just say that if you're looking for a laugh, she's got you covered. Between the three of them, you'll be laughing, crying, and cheering throughout the entire movie, and not to forget about the one and only Jamie Lee Curtis who played completely different character comparing to her other movies and oh my! She nailed it.The special effects in \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" are mind-blowing, and the way the film plays with alternate realities is pretty trippy. I mean, there are moments where you'll feel like you're on an acid trip, and that's a good thing! (Not that I even tried it, but I heard from people who did!!) The cinematography is also gorgeous, and every shot looks like it was plucked straight out of a surrealist painting.But what I really love about this movie is how it balances the absurdity with the emotional depth. Yes, there are moments where you'll be scratching your head and wondering what the heck is going on, but there are also moments where you'll be moved to tears. This movie has heart, and it's not afraid to wear it on its sleeve.In short, \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" is a movie that defies description. It's a mash-up of action, comedy, sci-fi, and drama, and it somehow manages to make all those genres work together seamlessly. If you're in the mood for something completely bonkers and unapologetically weird, this movie is for you. Just make sure you buckle up, because you're in for one hell of a ride.",

And then there's also a theme of a change. That no matter how grounded we are in our beliefs, our outlook on life and rules the World is guided with, we should never stop questioning them and looking at every situation from all available angles. Because perhaps, what we consider good, right and appropriate may very well be precisely opposite and just not visible from the bubble of our perception that we're locking ourselves in. And last but not least, it's about dropping all the prejudices, all the opinions based on what we heard, read or saw and just making our own. Based on how things really are and not how they're depicted by others (or even media, but that's more of my observation than what's in the movie). After all, most people are good people who just made the wrong turn, willingly or otherwise, somewhere in their life and even though they may appear to be bad or beyond saving but hardly ever it is the case. One just needs to leave one's own comfort behind and just make that extra effort.So yeah, I hate this movie because of what it did to me. But I also love it for what it may do, what it may mean, if more people would see it. And even if only some of them will take that extra minute or two, to try to understand what they really saw afterwards and reflect. It will be a success. For humanity.",

I had to rewatch it like 3 days after the first view so I could feel it in completely.It's the same time a great, time traveling adventure, with a bonkers plot, comedy, and some truly insane sci-fi concepts, but, most importantly, it's about love, caring about the most important people in our lives, the tiny moments, that make up our most memorable memory, and, at the end of the day... depression.Joy is depressed, she's overwhelmed, she's lost, and for most of the movie, the most important person in her life, her mom, doesn't seem to even care, or even acknowledge her presence sometimes. It's imo, an allegory for how we are constantly splitting our focus in a dozen different stuff nowadays, tying to be everywhere, but ending up been nowhere. She is stressed, and out of her mind, that she doesn't even realize what her daughter is going through. And, in a metaphorical way, she needs a interdimensional being to cross the multiverse, for her to finalize realize, she's losing her kid and to help her.Of course, she doesn't do it alone, and, in figure of the father, Waymond, she learns that, she has to stopping fighting people, stop trying to change people, and actually, just be kind and give your love to the ones who need it, however they might need.So, this movie is great, I loved it, as you might have noticed. It's so smart, funny, and out of the box completely with its concept, it's breaking of the fourth wall of sorts, and playing with the audience expectations a little bit too. Everyone is great in it, specially Stephanie Hsu and Key Huy Quan, who have to play multiple versions, completely different, from the same character, and they nail every single one of them. Michelle Yeoh is also really solid here, with by far the best performance I have seen from her.Anyways, I love how it shines a light on mental health. And, at the end of the day the message is that the world is crazy, and most days, it probably doesn't make much sense, but... so what? We should enjoy the moments that do make sense, and share the found memories we have with our love ones.To sum up, Everything Everywhere All At Once, is a great movie, with a complex story, with some serious underlining themes going on, if you want to see it, but at the same time, manages to be a crazy, and innovative movie about multiverses, with great action scenes, production value, and creative. Loved it, and highly recommend watching it. I would sum it up as Pixar movie, but in live action, and that, for me, it's one of the highest complements I could give a movie.",

The most destructive force in the multiverse is a round piece of bread, kept behind a curtain, at the center of an altar-like structure, surrounded by followers with black marks on their foreheads. Gee, what could that possibly represent?At its heart, this movie has the same old boring axe to grind that we've seen countless times before. The small box we've created around \"what's right\" is keeping all of us from having the one thing that each of us needs to actually make us happy. Especially our lesbian daughter! But we can do whatever we want. So we should open our third googly eye and embrace compassion.I think we've heard this lie before in Genesis 3 where the devil says that our eyes can be opened and we can be like gods, deciding what's right and wrong for ourselves. In reality (any of them), what we really need is the source and giver of all truth, goodness and happiness, Jesus Christ.Sadly, at the core of all the great storytelling in this movie is a lie as empty as the center of a bagel.* Note this review was removed once by IMDB with no explanation offered.

When they announced the nominees for the Golden Globes, I decided I should give this film a watch.This film has a perfect cast. I know that might sound a bit of an exaggeration, but it's true. Michelle Yeoh is great as Evelyn. It's a protagonist that you want to root for. Yeoh deserved her golden globe win, but I believe she deserves an Oscar nomination. Yeoh's not the only cast member that deserves all the awards this season. Ke Huy Quan plays the husband, Waymond, and I loved the character from the get-go. Waymond in the home universe is an interesting character, but it Alpha-Waymond who steals the show. Huy Quan's versatility allows him to go from a loveable husband to a man trying to save the universe. When I first heard Huy Quan's voice, I thought, \"Where have I heard this voice before.\" After a little investigation, I found my Data. No, actually, I found Data. Huy Quan is the Short Round from Indiana Jones and Data from the goonies. I love both characters and didn't even realize Huy Quan had retired over twenty years ago. I'm glad he came out of retirement because he should win an Oscar. Jamie Lee Curtis and Stephanie Hsu also deliver solid performances worthy of Oscar nominations. The film appears all over the place, and that's what makes it so wonderful. You never know where things are going; you're always guessing and trying to figure it out. I hope this film wins all the Oscars it's nominated for; it's that good.10/10 One of the finest films released during 2022.",

The best thing was that the story line all hangs together and comes together beautifully to bring an overall much deeper meaning to the entire premise of the movie.

I'll always be trying to imagine what in the universe is install for all of us next ! Go watch this !",

Why are you trying to find an exact explanation to such a confusing movie? To each their own on the meaning behind this movie, but I enjoyed it because (SPOILERS) I found the connection between the mother and the daughter beautiful. I'm very close with my mom so this movie hits deeper for me. I view it as the daughter essentially thinking her life is too overwhelming (from the overstimulation of so many realities) and that her mom doesn't love her, to the point where she wants to commit suicide (going into the \"everything bagel\") She is extremely stubborn like her mom, but her mother proves her love by following the husbands words of \"be kind\", (which the way she discovers that her husband is her soulmate is so beautiful to me as well) and the daughter does not enter the everything bagel. Not only that, but I enjoyed watching the entire family and the IRS lady (Jamie Lee Curtis) grow. On top of the main reason that I found this movie so great, this movie is entertaining, unique, and everyone can make their own different meaning out of it. I really haven't seen such an interesting film that's made me cry this much in a while.",

I would never again come close to this movie even on late night horrible cable and drunk out of my mind. I sat thru it in the theater just to see if anything decent came up and it did not.

An accurate emotional accounting of what we experienced living in the 90s and early 2000s. It was a painful and wonderful period of time that America might never have again.Maybe I'm looking into this too much, but it doesn't matter because this is what it means to me and I know I will continue to watch and rewatch this movie probably for the rest of my life.

Its not awful but it's certainly not a masterpiece either.It relies on an attempt of great mature storytelling, trying to explain the true purpose of life, which is fine.

It is a visually stunning film; I was kind enough to myself not to read about it so I could sustain the sense of surprise that is mandatory in these kinds of events. His idea is not original and we are used to the self-reference of the producers: the same directors of Avengers Endgame play with the concept of the multiverse in a more humorous tone, obviously linked to another work of theirs: Community. With a reference also to The Matrix we can then affirm that the creative sources are clear. What the film does stand out in is technical and acting. The main cast is competent and stands out with solid performances in what is undoubtedly a high-level challenge; there is material here for several Oscars. But the problem is the script: the youthful character that triggers the delirious arc of the film is severely unsympathetic and the mother's subsequent reactions are terrible. Here the delirium is dressed in morality and it is impossible to accept the sentimental conclusion of the script because it is unacceptable and dangerous. The basic idea is a young woman who wants to be accepted by her family and what follows is a journey of love and relationship recovery. To this sounding boring they added extraordinary elements that fortunately make drinkable something that would otherwise be unbearable. I was happy to see two of the most famous faces of the Martial Arts Club in their roles as security guards. It is a light but powerful film. It can be seen without much expectation.",

It's like Charlie Kauffman meets kick-ass.Its artful, warm, cosy, funny and profound. And yes, the message is super cliche: \"love, not hate\" but packaged so well, in an action flick even, it feels new and fresh.Not that the movie is completely perfect, it's not, but it doesn't matter, it's about taking something away from it that made it impactful for me and of course the beautiful arty approach.The biggest thing I got from it is: it doesn't matter. People that make big or small things so important, are pursuing power and wealth etc. What does It all matter If you get sick, die or hurt good people along the way? All the rules people tell you to follow or feelings to feel are just not important. Just love each other for who they are. White, black, gay, it, them etc it doesn't matter if you don't hurt one another. We're all different and the same at once.And yes, I also look at the woke community and the cancel culture they're building. Stop doing that! It's an unfriendly and inhuman approach. People are not out there to get you. One person doing a bad thing doesn't mean they're all bad. We are all victims of bad people. Talk about it, try to change it, but do it right. Don't become \"them\" that you hate so much.I feel this movie targets everybody. Look in the mirror, try to be nicer. Why do so many people think there's more important things than that?Thanks for this trippy and revealing experience.

I thought I was watching Tom Cruise's film.Yeoh's acting skills. I don't think I need to explain anymore. We all know that she can act. What I want to talk about is Ke Huy Quan, who plays Waymond. I haven't seen any of his films before or had no impression of him, but after watching this film, I don't think I will forget him again.However, I think there are still some shortcomings in this film. In the last plot of Waymond in multiple universes, he expressed his feelings and influenced Evelyn, which is the turning point that makes Evelyn not like Jobu tupaki. I think there are too many explanations in that plot, which ruins the beauty and depth of the film. Although there is no need for so many explanations, through the accumulation of the previous plot and the connection of their feelings, the audience can understand what the film wants to express. Such overexpression makes the film dull, just like a good joke that doesn't need to be explained.At the end of the movie, one of the scenes is when they all return to the laundry, Evelyn is handcuffed to a chair. She asks Waymond how he persuaded the tax officials to extend them for another week. Waymond says \"I just talk\", which makes me cry in a heartbeat.I think this is the most amazing part of the whole film. In a chaotic world, there is the most real emotion. In all universes, everything may change, but the emotion will never change. This movie tells us that this emotion is called love.In conclusion, this is a very excellent and epoch-making film.",

It has an unpromising opening, with drab images inside a laundry operated by a Chinese-American woman, who is suffering from relationships with her meek husband, her cranky father, and her annoying daughter who happens to be in a same-sex relationship with a non-ethnic Chinese. You got it. This is a soap opera, but dressed up with a very sloppy sci-fi scenario about time and space travel, alternate universes and such. The main visual inspiration seems to have been \"12 Monkeys\" but that is a much superior film on every level, including the musical score. The musical score here consists of sotto voce pizzicato strings and randomized sounds with emphasized sound-effects. The problem is, whatever music they could have chosen, likely wouldn't have saved this movie. I walked out after 30 minutes. If you read the reviewers who gave this only 1 star, you'll see they are angrier than I am, because they stayed the length, lol. At this moment, the naysayers on this film seem to be a minority, but that is only among the small number of reviewers; the majority when you consider that most of the public, is ignoring the film; and we'll have to see if it even manages to break even.

Among all the crazy, it's clear there are some beautiful messages that I took from the film, do not stay stuck on thinking what your life could be and acknowledge its potential, in this mad Universe we are but tiny particles navigating through the cosmos in a rock, put things into perspective and realize that we do not matter that much to the Universe, be kind always and no matter how insane things get we can't help but stay close to the things and the people that truly matter.So this for me was the movie strength, the powerful messages, the execution while original, amazingly well done and hats of to the whole cast, sometimes is just too weird. I get it, the possibilities are infinite in a multiverse concept but for humor purposes they showcase some really weird and nonsense stuff, which personally for me didn't quite work, but still most of the movie is highly engaging and as whole experience I really enjoyed it.Thumbs up for having the guts of making the film partially spoken in a non-English language, we need more of that!",

I had to look up the directors to make sure they were both over 18 because I felt a lack of maturity.I will commend the actors for what they put into it despite all the stupidness going on around them. Still they couldn't prevent it from going off the rails. Great to see James Hong tho'. Like always, he eats up every scene.Unfortunately I can't pull out examples because I really didn't understand what was going on for 90% of the film or what they dubbed \"Chapter 1\".

By the end I had a better idea of what was going on, but the first half of the movie was so fast and whacky... and in 2 languages. The rules of the story world were explained so quickly that it didn't give us any time to process them. The film had what seemed like 4 climaxes, one with the dad, one with the husband, one with the IRS lady and then one with the daughter. It's an extremely complicated movie, and I'm sorry, just because it's complicated doesn't make it \"brilliant\". It was EXHAUSTING. I found myself nodding off constantly throughout this film. Kung Fu alone isn't enough to keep me awake. It's like the daughter said towards the end: it's all just a bunch of random stuff flying around that doesn't mean anything. That's the same reason I couldn't get emotionally invested in the film. It was too chaotic to get me invested. So by the time we finally started to try to go somewhere towards the end, it just felt very melodramatic. It's a Wonderful Life knew how do build up to what this movie eventually builds up to, but it prepares us for it flawlessly. This film had a very hard time finding its way getting to that point where it could reveal a much similar theme. It was long and exhausting. Writing non linear stories is extremely tough... and visually, the film is a technical achievement. I just wish it wasn't so convoluted. I see what they're trying to do... in the end I got it, but was it worth it? I'm not so sure.",

Maybe a little because their sad little struggling existence in the beginning looks a lot like one I've lived. A lot because the movie has so much authentic emotion and that it breaks and fills up your heart. A lot because it's so imaginative and joyous that it had a profound effect on me that I would just get so overwhelmed watching it I'd tear up. It's so original and on top of it so many Asian faces. It means so much that there's so much Asian culture and experience in such a big movie, but that Asian-ness is no more consequential than if they were Irish. It's a part of who they are, but it's not all they are. It makes us all the more connected despite our differences. But the last thing is the idea that we all have so much potential. So many possibilities. And maybe we always have, possibilities. Shortround, all these years later is BACK. In real life. So that message rings true. And he is wonderful in the movie by the way. After all this time he found his potential again. Everyone does personal best work in this film, especially Michelle Yeoh. One of the great film performances. Ever. The effects and editing weren't more of the same thing we've seen and gotten spoiled by seeing often. All that production and detail instead applied to sights we've never seen in places you'd least expect it. It might not have the same effect and affect on everyone, but I thought it was just beautiful. There's so much humor and originality and unbridled imagination and the ability to take ideas, that like the multiverse has been done many times, but make them feel fresh and new. We're lucky if we have people to walk through the world with, and even at our worst we can remember there's still something to love in us all. How beautiful is that?",

It's because of movies like this I love cinema.Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert directed Swiss Army Man, one of the most creative movies of 2016, but in my opinion, it's limited by the need of explanations and very expository dialogues. But in Everything Everywhere All At Once, it's precisely proposed the lack of sense and logic, giving the gap to be debated philosophical questions and develop the relationship between the characters.Evelyn is a tired, exhausted and unhappy woman because of the decisions she made and the life that these decisions resulted. She has many problems and you can understand these problems. And throughout the movie, when she is presented to the idea of multiverse, she realizes that even the worst version of us can be happy.Michelle Yeoh. This person must win all possible acting awards. Yes, I'm talking about Oscar. His acting here is just the most perfect performance I saw in years. The scenes of kung fu, drama, comedy... She is just perfect in everything. With all due respect to Jessica Chastain and other Oscar winners, but THIS is an Oscar-worthy performance.I want to highlight the work of editing, that's very important to organize all this multiversal mess and make that all these scenes in all these universes be fitted and connected by the message the movie wants to pass about identity, purpose, apprenticeship, family, to live the present, to forget the past, to not think about the future, to be satisfied by the life we have.I don't know how someone can have the idea of making a movie like this. It's incredible how Daniels could make all these crazy parallels plots be so well-developed at the same time and pass so many lessons and messages all at once and that doesn't get tiresome (at least not for me). I think It's almost impossible what they make here, just a quite creative and genius mind could make this movie happen. It's because of guys like them that the cinema never dies.A24, make this movie be in the Oscar!",

            "content": "I've never left a theatre so desperate to rewatch something as I did with Everything Everywhere All at Once. From the very first scene, right the way through to the end - Everything Everywhere All at Once is an assault on the senses in all the best ways. It's quite hard to know where to begin; after all, this is a movie about everything, everywhere, all at once.Let's start with the story; this is a movie about Evelyn, and the relationships she has with her husband, her daughter, her father, and most importantly - herself. You see; Evelyn is a woman constantly asking \"what if...\". What if she'd been a doctor? Or not moved to the USA? What if she'd been more than she is? I guess this doesn't really explain the story at all, but I don't really want to spoil the magic for you. This is a movie about Evelyn, and how she finally learns to love the life she has. Of course, this is a significant oversimplification.Moving on; this movie is a visual treat. The visual effects range from the fantastic to the basic. There's everything from well-choreographed fight scenes (including a very memorable fight where the weapon of choice is a fanny pack), right the way through to a hilariously under-puppeted raccoon. The jarring contrast between the hyperreal and the clearly-fake could've come across as crude, if not unprofessional in any other film. Here, though, it's a well-executed mishmash that works because it's part of a larger collage of pictures equally out of place.I think the other think that helps meld these two disparate styles together is the fact that, beneath it all, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a comedy film. It's easy to focus on the more sentimental aspects of the movie, especially given the main theme of \"acceptance\", but it'd be a genuine disservice not to acknowledge the movie as a comedy. From malapropisms, to Michelle Yeohs' excellent delivery - this movie is one of those laugh-a-minute types that never quite gets old. Leaning heavily into the absurd, you can never quite anticipate what might come next. Clearly, absurdist humour isn't for everyone, and there'll be more than a few people who come away from it with a bitter taste in their mouth. However, in my opinion, Everything Everywhere All at Once does a fantastic job of delivering risqu\u00e9 jokes without ever delving quite into pure vulgarity. It is, of course, this same absurdity that manages to carry some of the films more tender moments. On paper, two rocks conversing mightn't be the most riveting of ideas; but Everything Everywhere All at Once manages to sell this concept with gusto - to the point where the theatre I was in was loud with laughter most at this point in the movie. Indeed, this is the kind of movie that has you connecting emotionally with two rocks. This, though, isn't the most absurd moment in the film, but to delve too much further would do nothing but dip into spoilers. All I can say is; this doesn't feel like absurdity for absurdities sake. A lot of the time, absurdist comedy can come off very - \"hAhA iM SO random RAWR xD\". Here, though, it feels much more in service of the point the film was trying to drive home.Ultimately, I really could sit here and praise this film for hours.I guess if I had to criticise any aspect, it'd be the world building, which felt a little thin at times, but once I stopped questioning things, and simply watched it for what it was; I found those complaints dissipate. If you watch Everything Everywhere All at Once with an open mind; you can't go wrong. I can't wait to see it again, and you bet I'll be buying the blu-ray the moment it's on sale.10/10.",

It grabs you from the get go and never lets you go until the very satisfying ending. However, it only works successfully because of the outstanding performances of the entire cast. The Oscar nominations earned by newcomers Stephanie Hsu and Ke Huy Quan, and by veteran Michelle Yeoh and the grandest veteran of them all, Jamie Lee Curtis, are all well-deserved. Their faith and joy in the parts they play are evident and remarkable. Yeoh is just terrific and Curtis is a real scene stealing hoot here. The direction gets fast and furious as the rather complicated shenanigans play out, but ultimately, this is a beautiful and moving story about how the human spirit of friendship and family can always survive the worst obstacles that life throws at us. Brilliantly executed and acted by all involved. Certainly deserves its 11 Oscar nominations and its rank as the most Oscar nominated movie of 2022.",

            "content": "I want to say that Everything Everywhere All at Once is completely unexpected, but if you saw the trailer for this film or watched Swiss Army Man (the previous effort from this creative team,) you kind of go in expecting things to be extreme and odd. The film is delightfully off-the-wall once the action gets started, and I was ready for anything. What I can say completely surprised me about this film is that it made me laugh more than I have in a theater in a long time. When sitting in a theater with a dozen other people who clearly weren't getting the same enjoyment out of the film, I felt no guilt whatsoever when I was all the only one laughing like a fool at so many of the crazy moments. I know humor is extremely subjective, and there were a few things that some might find offensive instead of funny, but I was tickled by it repeatedly. I also think they abandoned some logic in order to embrace the insanity. Discussing logic might seem like a fool's errand in a movie like this, but there is still an internal logic established that should be followed, and I'm not sure that was always the case here.The cast was remarkable in Everything Everywhere All at Once, particularly since they are all playing so many different versions of the same people. I struggle to think of anyone who could have done as much with the lead performance as Michelle Yeoh did. She is brilliant and crushes every insane thing she's asked to do. It was fun to see Ke Huy Quan doing his best Jackie Chan impersonation in a role that seems like it was clearly written for the latter actor. I haven't seen Quan in many films lately, so it was great to see him crushing it here, and holding his own. This was the first time I've seen Stephanie Hsu, but she did a great job playing the daughter, who becomes a vital character in the plot. Jamie Lee Curtis was almost unrecognizable, which worked great for me because I had no idea she was in the film, so I got the slow recognition as I started to register I knew that actress. I will say, one of the coolest things about the film is that there were so many powerful women driving the story, although that's diminished slightly because it still required the man to fix things.I think part of the reason Everything Everywhere All at Once is being highly praised is the way it tackles some heavier topics despite the insane premise. I wanted to be overwhelmed with the way they delved into the complexity of the relationships in the movie, but it never quite brought a tear to my eye. I feel like they undercut some of the emotions by handling it through such odd visuals and a number of weird worlds, so when they returned to normalcy it didn't click as much for me. Although it's possible I simply didn't like the way it was resolved at the end. There was a moment earlier in the film that totally worked for me because I connected with the lesson that the protagonist learned, but the conclusion didn't pack the same punch. I also wonder if the filmmakers (and most of the reviewers I've read) think the movie is far more profound than it is in reality. It's hard to say, as I've only seen the movie once, and there's certainly a lot of crazy stuff to digest. Perhaps on further viewings I'll get more from Everything Everywhere All at Once and rank it even higher.",

            "content": "What a bonkers, insane, emotional and hilarious ride. This film proves that Disney may have all the money but that is nothing in the face of good writing. Disney's multiverse movie (Doctor Strange: ITMOM) had a budget $200 million yet is trounced in every aspect by Everything Everywhere which has a budget of $25 million. It's all in the writing.The film seems to start off as a conventional family drama film, with a past-her-prime mother running a small business, who is struggling to make meets end, her husband who she becomes more distant from, the daughter discovering herself but moving away from her parents in the process and the grandfather whose views are dated. The film starts off like this, but then goes absolutely bonkers, delivering some insane action-sequences and dropping a ton of information on the audience. Yet it all makes sense. At no point are you lost in the madness. You're invested the whole way through with strong characters, excellent performances and excellent handling of themes such as nihilism, existentialism, regret, love and kindness.The acting is top-notch across the board with particular praise going to Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn and Ke Huy Quan as Waymond. Their relationship is central to the movie and the actors give it their all and deliver some truly stunning, inventive and bonkers action sequences. The visuals are also fantastic, with excellent uses of colour, lighting and camera tricks to give the film its own unique style.The biggest takeaways from this film are the lessons it teaches. You feel like a better human being for having watched it. Despite all the madness, the emotional moments still hit hard and by the end all the pieces fall into place, leaving you satisfied. This film doesn't need to lecture the audience on modern world problems, or explain that because of its diverse casting it is some cultural moment. No. All you need is good writing.Overall, Everything Everywhere All At Once is best described as indescribable. It has to be seen to be fully appreciated. The characters are wonderful, the acting excellent, the visuals and action are wacky in all the best ways and the deeper emotional meaning of the film really shines through.

            "content": "Everything Everywhere All at Once is the second film written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, you really see how they have grown as filmmakers and storytellers from their previous feature film \"Swiss Army Man\". Everything Everywhere All at Once has been described by The New York Times as a \"swirl of genre anarchy\" and incorporates elements of comedy, science fiction, fantasy, martial arts films, and animation. It's a unique movie and the interesting thing is how Kwan and Scheinert had researched the concept of the multiverse as far back as 2010, and they began penning the screenplay by 2016. So it's been like a passion project, in a way. Before watching this film, I thought it was supposed to be this action packed sci-fi film, but I was wrong. Everything Everywhere All at Once is actually a bittersweet domestic drama and a marital comedy, a story of immigrant striving and a hurt-filled ballad of mother-daughter love. Then it incorporates multiple other genres into the film, thus giving us some impressive sci-fi sequences but also some superb action sequences which are choreographed in such a great way. It's just 139 minutes of entertainment. Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert have created something special and worth watching.An aging Chinese immigrant is swept up in an insane adventure, in which she alone can save the world by exploring other universes connecting with the lives she could have led.Michelle Yeoh plays the lead role in such a brilliant way, showing her impressive acting range when she ultimately ends up portraying different versions of her character. The same would be said about Ke Huy Quan who plays her husband and Stephanie Hsu who plays her daughter, but Michelle Yeoh is terrific and her performance is one of the film's highlight. Meanwhile the supporting cast has names like Jenny Slate, Harry Shum Jr., James Hong, and Jamie Lee Curtis.The film explores the concepts of the meaning of life and nihilism, also themes of existentialism and Asian-American identity. Anne Anlin Cheng wrote in The Washington Post: \"It's not only that the multiverse acts as a metaphor for the immigrant Asian American experience, or a convenient parable for the dislocations and personality splits suffered by hyphenated (that is, \"Asian-American\") citizens. It also becomes a rather heady vehicle for confronting and negotiating Asian-pessimism\". The theme of meaning of life and the deep story regarding the relationship of mother and daughter and the marital themes was my favorite parts of the writing, well all the themes really were brilliant.Everything Everywhere All at Once is a complex film that encompasses a variety of subjects, but it does justice to each of them with a superbly written script, spectacular performances, and plenty of bizarre humor that doesn't drag on too long to counter its bleak story. It's a film with a deep message that executes its themes perfectly, making you think and reflect about them. It's directed, edited and written with such brilliance. Acted perfectly. The humor might not be for everyone, sometimes it was too bizarre and extreme, but it works if you get immersed enough into the movie which was easy. Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert has a strong imagination, the film wouldn't have been as good if it wasn't for just that, their imagination. Beneath the bizarre humor and over the top sequences lies a film worthy of everyone's attention, it's deep as it's extreme, it's a masterpiece that could have easily been a failure. But it became a box office hit (A24's highest-grossing film at the domestic box office) but also universally acclaimed by critics and audience.",

My head hurt so bad after.It's always fascinating to me how much people's opinions differ. Contrary to the laudatory reviews, the film has very little substance and message. The creators laid the foundations, but did not fill it with content, the conclusion is quite a cliche, and yes, in the end, life is a bunch of old truisms that can be deep and charming in their simplicity if the road leading to them, is real. But this film quickly gets lost in a madly spinning merry-go-round of colors, movements, words, and sounds. You can cut half of the movie and it won't change the message or the ending, the movie is 40 minutes too long. This isn't coherent vision at all and it just leaves you confused and with a headache. Someone may say that this form is intentional because that's exactly how life is, but sorry, the creators can't get a pass so easily. If you claim you made a movie with a real message it's your job to make the audience care, to show something that is raw and true not bore people to death and just throw random things around over and over again.Everything Everywhere All at Once is in the end tedious and loud, and it leaves you with very little not some grand wisdom.It's absolutely not an 8, 9 or 10. It's technically and visually well done, but the story itself pretends to be more profound than it really is. This is def one of the most overrated movies this year.",

In the history of movies and TV shows, there are so many shining stars. 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' is destined to be one of the stars.MusicThe music goes hand-in-hand with the story and emotion development. Take the first 12-minute intro clip as an example, it goes from stressful, disordered, conflicting and confusing music to spooky and mysterious music, and then to calm but sad music. In the meantime, in every little highlight / climax in the plot and emotions, background music was left blank to allow the audience to focus on the key conversation and get ready for the next chapter of story or a different feeling / atmosphere / emotion with a different feel of background music.All of these brilliant uses of background music in the first 12-minute intro clip of the movie, together with all other things make me feel an immersed emotional experience in the character and life of Evelyn as an audience.Dual StorylinesI see 2 storylines in this movie. One is the entertaining sci-fi storyline and another one is the touching family interrelationship repair and self-salvation story. It feels like a top quality double-side sweater. You can wear it with either side and all the threads are intertwined and woven together. Most lines can be read with two different meanings that serve well for both storylines.So Many Elements with Different TastesCommercially, I believe it will be a successful movie as well, because I can see so many elements in this movie, which will satisfy a wide range of audiences.It has so many fun setups and humour, such as the jumping pads that are only triggered by the weird stuff.The fighting scenes are comedy action style, which remind me of a lot of the Jackie Chan classics. Plus the good amount of martial art performance experience of actors and actresses here make the actions more legit, like Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, Andy Le and Brian Le. Plus plus in some side shots of the actor Ke Huy Quan (Waymond, the husband), he really looks like Jacky Chen somehow. As an audience, I really enjoyed every fight scene in this movie, which certainly brings up the energy level of the movie.This movie touches so many topics, such as family member relationship management, especially from generation to generation, self value, communications and interactions with other human beings, and depression, which are all embedded and integrated well in the plot and get me as an audience thinking more after watching. Especially the two highlights like Waymond saving Evelyn and Evelyn then saving her daughter are really engaging, moving and encouraging to think more and beyond the story itself.With so many elements, the crew doesn't turn the movie into chaos or a stitching product, but a greatly balanced movie.Using Peter Marshall's definition of a good movie, I think this is an excellent movie because it tells a compelling story with believable characters who make me feel Everything Everywhere All at Once.So at the end, a big thank you and many congratulations to the Directors and Writers Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, all the talents, performers and every production team member who made such a brilliant movie for everyone!",

I know that doesn't make it right but it's how it is in the culture.The movie can be chaotic but that's what the point of the storyline is all about. The world is chaotic. Our life is chaotic. Even the ever expanding universe is chaotic. It can be exhausting to watch the movie with that crazy pace. But isn't life is just like that?This movie is a love story. Between man and woman. Between parents and their kids. Between friends. Even between strangers. The messages might be cheesy but they are always true and they can always be applied to the life and relationship. It was wrapped in absurdity and outrageous scenes. And that is life. Even in the crazy world we are living now, the messages will always be true. That kindness, understanding will always the right way to deal with chaotic life. Some of the lines really hit home for me personally. That 'I would have really liked just doing laundry' or 'that's how I fight' are so poignant.I really like Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. I was excited to see them in one movie.

Playing a character in a movie with this kind of storyline and mix of several different genres are surely not easy.I do genuinely love this movie.

            "content": "Pro's:\nImagine a movie that has the imagination and mind-bending impossibilities of the Matrix, while also pulling off the reality-jumping acid trip of Dr. Strange. Well, we have one and it's called Everything Everywhere All at Once. It's hard to describe the movie without simply retelling the story, as it truly transcends any traditional film genre. It's not an action movie per se, but it's packed with action. It's not a family drama per se, but you'll feel shades of Beautiful Boy. It's not a comedy per se, but there are genuine laughs peppered in. The movie successfully rolls the best of all of these genres into one and executes. It's also wise enough to not get mired down in any one of the subplots. It keeps moving, often at breakneck speed, too busy warping through absurd and awesome scenarios to get stuck where lesser movies would. The action and effects are thrillingly done. The production value is blockbuster level, a fact quite astonishing considering a team of only 5 people produced all the digital effects for this film. There's a lesbian daughter, but at no time does it become a \"message movie\" about that. There's a predominantly Asian cast, but at no time does it harp on how \"important and brave\" it is to tell their story, it just simply tells it without patting itself on the back. The film falls for no traps, it's interested in the plot. The runtime is on the longer side at almost 2 and a half hours, not that you would ever know. It practically crashes and bashes through to the end once it takes off. A ton of thought was put into the visual design of the film, too much to go into here. But of note is the motif of circles, which appear all over the set and costume design, representing the \"too much-ness\" of everything happening everywhere all at the same time. The movie opens on the image of the family reflected in a circular mirror, the daughter's \"everything bagel\" is a black circle (echoed when Jaime Lee Curtis circles tax forms with thick black circles), googly eyes pop up on multiple surfaces including main character Evelyn's forehead. Even the family's laundromat is a room stacked wall to wall with the circular washer doors surrounding the characters. This attention to detail is present in everything, everywhere, in the film (pardon the pun). All performances are strong and well done. Veteran Michelle Yeoh's makes her stressed laundromat owner Evelyn a real person. And in a surprise comeback is Ke Huy Quan as dopey husband Waymond. You'll remember him from his 80's stint as \"token goofy Chinese kid\" in The Goonies and Indiana Jones. And the first half of the movie might have you thinking he's back now to simply put on his \"goofy Chinese man\" hat. But by the end of the movie he's delivered the most heartfelt moments to the audience, and expanded into a layered, wise character. Rarely does a film deliver on an interesting and inventive plot, thrilling action, and real drama in a way that lands without getting distracted with any of the aforementioned pieces. It's simply a treat.Cons:\nThere's not much to pick at here in terms of weaknesses. If we're feeling fussy I suppose there may be a consideration, not a plot hole, that could have perhaps led the characters to a solution a bit more expediently than they pursued. Without spoiling major plot points it involves the reality jumping aspect of the film and having access to all possibilities. It seems that maybe certain avenues weren't explored that could have been in order to solve their problem. However, we as the audience have the benefit of sitting back and thinking up scenarios and solutions. Without Monday morning quarterbacking, a different (possibly better) solution may not have occurred to us in the moment either, which the characters must live through in real time and don't get to sit back from removed from the scenario. Especially in a movie like this with the adventure whizzing by at lightning speed. One other, more legitimate, quibble has to do with the Matrix-esque skill acquiring Evelyn is able to do. From what the movie tells us, that should be perfectly possible mentally. But physically, it doesn't perhaps make immediate sense why her body itself would gain or lose functionality (floppy hotdog fingers and hulked-out pinky fingers, alternately). Played more for laughs here, but still. Something to consider.Bottom line: This is without a doubt one of the best movies of the year, as well as one of the best movies of the last few years. Genres are blended and transcended with astonishing finesse. The action comes fast and creatively shot, the drama is grounded and real, it's funny when it wants to be and it will freak you out when it wants to get freaky. It's one of those movies you just have to see to experience this strange but effective blend. It's a little bit of everything, that will take the audience everywhere, all at once. 9.5 out of 10 stars.",

            "content": "I heard a lot of great reviews going into this movie and was very excited to watch it; unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to my expectations.The movie starts with about fifteen minutes of introduction to Evelyn's and Waymond's characters, the laundromat they run, and their daughter Joy. It was a great start to the movie with interesting characters, relationships between those characters, and unique circumstances.Then we moved to the IRS office, which brought with it the start of the shenanigans. We are given the same infinite multiverse theory that every sci-fi show proposes, and at first I rolled my eyes.I hate this theory because--while it could be true--the vast majority of universes would consist of us doing stupid and abnormal things like switching your shoes to the wrong feet or eating chap stick... I loved that this movie leaned into that idea, utilizing the bizarre possibilities to access other universes. This is when I really started to enjoy the movie.Then we meet Jobu Tepaki, the main antagonist of the film. I feel like we meet her way too early. There could have been a tense build-up to a reveal of her identity--Joy--but instead it was anticlimactic and predictable. I suppose this gave Evelyn reason to maybe kill her own daughter and instead decide to become another Jobu, but something about it made the pacing rough for me.I will admit that I didn't realize this movie was a comedy until I was watching it. There were parts I really appreciated, like when Jobu says the Ketchup is organic--that was very funny. I appreciate one-off jokes like that, but am not a huge fan of big plot points being gags, like the Bagel being the end of everything, and I don't love comedy just being absurd concepts, like the hot-dog-finger universe. Also, instead of being a throwaway bit, we also got probably at least 5 minutes in that universe across the movie, which seemed rather excessive and got stale fast.Call me a hater--probably true--but I like a solid, serious plot to really get me into it, or I need it to be a full comedy. I'm not saying there can't be a balance of drama and comedy, but I'm not a fan of dipping so far into the absurdity while trying to maintain a serious and emotional story line.I enjoy when a movie has a bit of a moral; usually it's a bit subtle and more of a theme then blatantly telling the viewers what to get out of the movie. But in this case, they bombarded us with multiple blatant morals: Waymond says several times in a row to just be kind, which is a good message, but felt super random and unnecessary; Joy talks about how we only have specks of time with each other; the rocks say how we're all so small and stupid. I just felt like they tried to pack in all these takeaways like homework at the end of a college class.Also, the infinite multiverse theory says that anything that can be done has been done in another universe. But does that actually mean it would be possible for our consciousness to be in a rock or a pinata or a 2D animation? Seems like a stretch to me.I felt the pace was off from when we first met Jobu, but that was especially felt during the last 20-30 minutes. The movie felt like it was wrapping up for almost half an hour, but kept throwing us into different tangents before finally coming to a close.I won't deny there were things about the movie I really enjoyed: (most of) its take on the infinite multiverse theory, a lot of the cinematography was interesting or downright beautiful, and there were definitely some parts that made me laugh out loud. Overall, though, I couldn't take the stakes seriously because the villain's terrible creation was a freaking bagel.",

Our girls, both about the age of the daughter in the movie, were decorating Easter eggs. One of them got the idea to put GOOGLIE EYES on some of them. Earlier in the day, I was filing an amended TAX RETURN, while my wife was doing a lot of LAUNDRY, mostly for our youngest, who came home from college for the Easter holiday. For breakfast, my wife offered our youngest a BAGEL, but she opted for something else.We then saw the movie not realizing in advance any connection to it and the above seemingly trivial events from earlier in the day. For those who saw the movie, I am sure you can see the connection....and it has us amazed. Yes, apparent random events in our lives can, by coincidence, also show up in movies we see.....but for this movie?...given its objective and that our trivial events happened within our family? Something is going on here! (I changed my rating from a 9 to a 10 because of this insight---see yeah, it's a 10 for me purely for personal reasons given the course of events that led up to seeing the movie)If randomness *weaves* a web of events, is anything truly random?For the movie itself, one reviewer elsewhere suggested you 'strap in' and hang on. This movie is a wild ride successfully attempting to give significance to our own seemingly trivial lives if only for a few brief moments in this one particular universe. In the end...be kind.",

Even with such a great leads with Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan at the helm of this sinking ship. There is no turning the tide. This is one ship that needs to be torpedoed, as at 139 minutes, it is taking far to long to go down.

            "review_title": "One of a kind",
            "content": "\"Everything...\" is groundbreaking in creating a new genre, for which it may well be the only movie ever made. Nothing before; nothing after.Following the title, this 140 minute movie is divided into 3 parts, quite arbitrarily. Part 1, Everything, starts at the beginning, needless to say. Part 2, Everywhere, comes somewhere in the middle. Part 3 All At Once occupies only the last 10 minutes.Underneath the multiverse cloaking, \"Everything\" is an exceptionally affecting family story, \"exceptionally\" because while dysfunctional family stories have been told often (perhaps even too often) this one does it really well, thanks, among other things, to its brilliant cast.In the center is Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh), a traditional Chinese immigrant who is now running a reasonably successful laundry business. The three people closest (albeit sometimes feels most remote) are daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu), husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan) and father Gong Gong (James Hong) which means grandpa-on-mother's side, from Joy's perspective. The issue she has with each of them I do not need to elaborate here. You'll find them very familiar.The multiverse adventure in Evelyn's life really starts in an IRS auditor's cubical to which Evelyn, Waymond and Gong Gong have been summoned. Acting a conduit to the various parallel universes is Waymond, who shifts at will between the timid husband we know and a hero of sorts from another universe, \"Alpha Waymond\", who tries to save all humankind in all universes, from an ultimate evil called Jobu Tupaki. This ultimate villain soon manifests in the body of Joy. Right there is your glimpse of the abundance of allegories in this movie. In real life, mother and daughter are often nemesis personified.Alpha Waymond triggers \"jumps\" that take Evelyn to other universes. When this happens, we see two Evelyns engaging in parallel activities in two universes. These actions often mirror each other to some degree, in one way or another, more or less, give and take........ That is about the best I can do to deconstruct.After endless searches, Alpha Waymond finds our Evelyn, who is the worst (loser) among the universes. Because of that, she is the best for the job of challenging Jobu Tupaki. Another allegory? You bet.What happens in this titanic struggle in the assortment of different universes is beyond your wildest imagination, bizarre, silly, outrageous, allegorical, funny....and a lot of martial arts, which reminds us that at 60, Yeoh is still in top form. With emotions coming at you like tsunami waves, the dynamic duo Evelyn and Joy appear in every shape and form imaginable and unimaginable, including two cloth puppets hanging from tree, or two pieces of silent rocks in inaudible dialogue carried as on-screen texts. Yeoh is beyond amazing but then Hsu matches her scene for scene, scene after scene. Quan and Hong are solid supports.Playing the tax auditor is Lamie Lee Curtis, described as \"unrecognizable\" by some lazy critics. Colin Ferrell in \"The Batman\" is unrecognizable. NOT so for Curtis in \"Everything\". Even after four decades and under a silly wig, her facial feature are easily recognizable. It's her persona of a stereotyped bureaucrat that is, ironically, quite refreshing.",

At its core, the movie is a theatrical debate between Nihilism and Absurdism, tackling the challenge of finding meaning in an uncaring universe. The fight between \"Nothing matters and we might as well die\" and \"Nothing matters yet despite that, I find meaning even though it doesn't make sense\" is particularly relevant in today's world, where both ideas seem to be increasingly common.But it's not just the philosophical depth that impressed me - the movie also contains some of the funniest gags and jokes I've seen in years. I especially loved the bit about racacoonie.My only minor critique is that some parts of the movie drag on a bit, which is why I'm giving it a score of 9 instead of 10. However, considering that it was made by such a small team, the movie is a true marvel and incredibly well made. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a blend of humor and philosophy in their movies.",

I enjoyed also the same scene where they was near the restaurant and the laundry store and the mother let her go without being with her and seem really careless and we can really relate at the scene when the mother immigrate to China and her father didnt tell anything when she leaved the country without holding her or something. The message of the let it go whatever our choices we made in life. The comparison of the mother life with the different universes that make us understand that they are not perfect choices but just choices and whatever they are lead to some consequences and thats all. Live with indifference because sometimes we dont really know and we need to be gentle with ourself. I found also the movie pretty funny but the \"jump\" in other universes was just an excuse to make some sexual scenes and pretty extravagant ones. And we have some pretty unexpected scenes with that Racoon and Chad and the way that man needed the racoon to be someone, the two rocks on the cliff, the hands's sausages. Was very funny but the sci fi genre get me off sometimes of the movie and the too much comedy was sometimes annoying but except that the message behind the movie its pretty exceptionnal and we can really relate to our choices in life and the consequences and the way that we idealize always other lifes if we did this or that and really was suprised by the authencity of the movie in that side.

The most notable thing this movie exceeds is its uniqueness due to its amalgam of genres and visuals. From the writing, cast performance, and visuals, these components, under the guidance of the writers and director, created one of the freshest and over-the-top films of the year. Reviewing this movie in detail seems like an impossible task, for many factors contribute to this movie's level of success. So this review will dissect the thing that stood out the most.The movie has incredible diversity, not only a variety of people but also visions. The movie focuses on the theme of life, people's dreams and choices in life, as well as the theme of family. A film that explores the idea of the multiverse is truly represented when the filmmakers make us see the different universes, where it seems like we are watching another movie. The visuals are amazing, from its practical effects mixed with VFX, in most scenes and its action scenes. This movie blends a lot elements from it's various set pieces, costumes, and even character design. However, despite all the other elements, the film revolves around a single lesson: everybody always has a choice every day.The film grasps many themes like passions in life, optimism, family relations, and the idea of nihilism. However, all of them are connected with the idea of the choices we make. On the side of passion, Evelyn is shown countless universes where she is succeeding in life and not working on a laundry mat. Furthermore, she feels she wasted her life and has certain regrets. Her daughter Joy has her struggles, thinking her life is meaningless and wants it to be over. However, not for her sake, but for bringing burdens to her family. Both Evelyn and Joy are burdened by the weight of family expectations. But thankfully, there is Waymond. Let's say his answer in the vast universe is being optimistic in life. Where life can bring you down, you smile up above.Overall, this movie has a lot of things that can be explored. But one thing I love about this movie this feels like a love letter to cinema with pure maximalism. By handling different tones and settings, this movie is one of a kind. Although part 1 of the movie is rough, everything else is near-perfect. Everything, Everywhere, All At Once invites the audience to have an overwhelming experience of emotions with its artistic endeavors but never strays away from the message of choice. And the people who made this movie made many right decisions, and hopefully, you will choose to watch it.",

The main negative is that the production value is sometimes low, and a couple of times you can tell. Don't get me wrong, they do a fantastic job with a limited budget and this outshines all the superhero movies, but imagine what they could have done with double or tripple the budget? The only other \"complaint\" I have is that I want more. This should have been a 10 hours movie or a 10 seasons TV show and I would eat it all up. I feel a bit cheated that there is no more.The movie is however pure brilliance. The acting is fantastic, the directing amazing, the story so unique and original that I hope all of Hollywood feel ashamed. Music and sound design is brilliant, and I cannot remember when I laughed and cried so much to a movie before. The emotions are strong with this one!Fantastic movie that should win at least 5 Oscars, but I would not surprised if it wins more.

            "content": "Well, that was a lot. I guess I shouldn't be surprised considering the title. That being said, it seems odd to critique a film for having too much going on when that's kind of the point, but I'm gonna do it anyway. There's a lot of fun, entertaining, and even emotionally resonant stuff going on, but there's also too much going on to allow the kind of focus on any one thing to have the kind of impact this could have had. Is it about mothers and daughters? Finding connection in the world? Finding meaning through other people? It's all of these things, but emotional resonance happens when attaching these ideas to characters and their stories in a specific way to actually let the ideas flow through them while giving us the emotional connection to the characters going through it, adding intellectual depth to something that pulls at the heart strings. Having roughly five different variations on the same idea compete for attention undermines them all.Okay, enough complaining for now, because while I do think the film needed a good bit of cutting down, there's so much to enjoy.Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh) is the co-owner of a little laundry in Los Angeles with her husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan). They have one daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu), who has a girlfriend Becky (Tallie Medel), a situation that they are trying to hide from Evelyn's father, Gong Gong (James Hong), visiting from Hong Kong. Evelyn's life is a mess. The laundry is failing and in massive tax problems. She has this propensity of picking up new hobbies and then filing the expenses as tax deductions. The strain of the whole situation has led Waymond to gathering the paperwork for a divorce that she's too busy to even notice. There are regrets that she has made the wrong choices in life to lead her to that moment.They have an appointment with Deirdre (Jamie Lee Curtis), a tax auditor at the IRS building, but as they go up the elevator, Waymond suddenly removes his glasses, starts speaking differently and with more confidence, while scribbling out random instructions for her to follow (including putting her shoes on the wrong feet). Sitting there with the auditor figuring out the sad, pathetic story of their lives through their receipts, Evelyn figures that there's nothing to lose, so she tries it, and she's suddenly in something much, much larger than a tax audit of her laundry. Alpha Waymond, the form of her husband from an alternate universe, has reached out to her because she is the one version of Evelyn that will become powerful enough to defeat Jobu Tupaki, an incredibly powerful being that has been moving from universe to universe killing Evelyn's all along the way.The painting of the portrait of Evelyn's life is wonderfully (and perhaps overly) detailed, providing us with a very clear picture of the miserable little life she leads. It becomes ironically funny when we find out that she is literally the most pathetic form of herself across the entire multiverse, failing at literally everything, which, in handwaving logic, means that she has the capacity to become the greatest version of Evelyn to face off against Jobu. Her discovery of the multiverse is both fun and frustrating. Fun because the rules established are so consciously absurd (doing something completely random and out of character slingshots your consciousness in the right direction of another version of yourself that you then tap into in order to gain some kind of skill that you don't already have like, say, the mastery of kung fu), but frustrating because there is a lot to explain. It's not just the rules, but also the central conflict which gets treated opaquely for a while until the movie just gives up and lets you know a couple of moments later.Jobu Tupaki is another version of Joy from the Alpha universe where Evelyn was one of the great scientists and discovered how to communicate with other universes. She pushed Joy to the breaking point where she became able to jump between universes without the aid of technology like everyone else, and there's been a race to find the right Evelyn ever since. What Joy actually wants with Evelyn is never as clear as it should be, I think. What she wants overall, though, is just the logical application of nihilism: she wants to commit suicide. This gets manifested in another of the movie's intentional oddities, a cosmic everything bagel that will consume Jobu and erase her existence.The second half of the film is Evelyn slowly growing in power and also becoming more like Jobu herself. There are a lot of fights as Alpha Waymond works with Evelyn to try and keep her safe. She ends up at war with herself, mostly manifested with her desire to lose herself in a reality where she is a big movie star, but it also happens to be a reality where she never left Hong Kong with Waymond. So much time is spent on this that one would imagine that this is the central conceit of the film, but the antagonist is a version of Joy. So, this is about her connecting with her family, right? I could buy that, but then there's Deirdre. A surprising amount of time in the lead up to the finale is about connecting with Deirdre, mostly in a universe where people have hot dog fingers (an idea alternatively funny and really gross) and connecting with her. So, it's about relationships being what's really worthwhile? That makes sense, but this is where we're getting really diffuse. Oh, and then there's the Ratatouille parody called Raccacoonie where Evelyn works in a hibachi grill with a great chef who's hiding a Raccoon under his toque. I mean, it's funny, but it just goes to show how overstuffed this film is.Why does that matter if it's funny? That it's funny is what saves it from being a drag at all, and it's obvious that most audiences feel like that's enough. I just get frustrated when there's obviously a point and the film can't get to it. In fact, it throws everything out of focus when there is a point and the film intentionally obfuscates it. Does that make it a bad film? Not at all. The movie is so filled with attempts to entertain and an eagerness to as well, that I can only hold this narrative frustration against the film so much. Still, it's there.So, I've complained enough. I really do like this film. It may be overlong and overstuffed, but it's fun from beginning to end. Its colorful, light, and energetic approach to its concept overcomes a lot, especially when combined with the quality action choreography. Both Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan's talents are on full display as they fight their way all around the large IRS building set. Quan's early fight with nothing but his fanny pack is a real highlight. It should also be noted that virtually the entirety of the film (I'd estimate about 90%) takes place on two sets (the laundry and the IRS building), while never feeling constrained. Finding new places to film within the sets while messing with lighting help really give the small-budgeted film a much larger sense of scale than expected.Yeoh carries the entire film on her back, and she is the film's foundation. She gives Evelyn in every reality a sense of life from her lived-in exhaustion early through to her bewilderment at discovering the larger universe around her to even her take as herself at a film screening, she's imbues the whole film with emotional truth. Quan reveals himself to be far more than Short Round or Data several decades later, easily alternating between versions of Waymond, one weak and wounded the other eager, smart, and proactive. Hsu as Joy is solid, and it's always a joy to see James Hong, especially while decked out in a mech-suit made from office equipment.It's really not hard to see why Daniel Kwan's and Daniel Scheinert's creation captured the imaginations of so many people. It is Joseph Campbell's basic hero journey given a crazy, unique skin. At its core, it tells the kind of hero myth we've been telling each other for millennia told well, with energy, and uniquely. That it's overlong and overstuffed doesn't seem to bother most people. It just bothers me a little bit is all.",

You won't get any good reasons as to why this movie is special in the first few scenes, and even when things begin to unfold, it's still not entirely clear why so many have responded so strongly to it. Over the course of the runtime, however, you are bombarded with an endless series of unusual, unique moments that just keep coming, right through to the end. Just when you think this movie has gotten so off-the-wall that they can't possibly throw anything else that unexpected at you, they do. The main drawback is that during the final third of the movie, we get too many drawn-out, overly sentimental moments of reflection that really needed to be trimmed down to be effective. It gets a bit repetitive, to the point that I am hesitant to re-watch the film, even though there is so much to like. I still have to praise it, however--there haven't been very many movies that have gotten as bat-s%#$ crazy as EEAAO.",

            "content": "It has to be said that, for all its originality, it's still the same three-act movie Hollywood has been making for decades, the only one they'll ever make, this time spiced up with sentimental chinese psychedelia. A24 is still part of the industry. But, for a moment, it really is fresh, fast and fun. Michelle Yeoh is a star, the action is great and there's one of the funniest scenes I've ever witnessed on a screen.Some very strong film-making. However, at one point, the film disintegrates. First, it struggles with the task of actually explaining what's going on, and suffers from it. Next, it struggles to maintain an ever-increasing momentum, throwing at the viewer, well, everything all at once. Like making a cocktail with everything at the bar, nothing sticks, it becomes something on your screen for a period of time (sorry). And yet, some occurrences, such as the raccoon, are still absolutely irresistible.My main issue is in the end it shifts priorities, it becomes worried about being taken seriously as a thoughtful piece of drama with pseudo-philosophical musings. That hurts the film immensely. I was disappointed, checking my watch, wondering why this movie suddenly was trying to over-explain basic human emotions. I guess a big part of the audience needs to be reminded of what makes them human. I'm ok with it, though, I'm not going to complain about a possitive message, the problem is there is so much noise the emotional climax is non-existent, or maybe I was numb.Of course, as expected, there is a subtext of criticism of the Chinese family, supposedly severe, diligent and demanding, contrasted with the permissiveness, communication and affection of the \"new\" American family. The daughter is eventually the one being right, conveniently English-speaking.It will undoubtedly be one of the most powerful films to come out of USA in a few years, it's got everything to please today's film fauna. I enjoyed the first half greatly and I personally hope it soon establishes itself as the best multiverse film because that would mean no more are made.",

It's a sci-fi, it's a kung fu movie, it's an absurd comedy, and it's a family drama. It is, quite literally, \"everything, everywhere, all at once\".It's the best Matrix film since the first one, it's got a beautiful anti-nihilist message, it's an exploration of Asian-American identity and generational homophobia, I laughed, I cried, and it's that rare kind of film that just makes the world look a little better to you once it's over.I realised when I rewatched The World's End that I'm always more impressed by a film that's doing so much stuff that should not work together on paper, and this is like Daniels took that idea as a challenge. Can we make a film that's like Rick And Morty, Police Story, The Matrix, Inside Out and Monty Python And The Holy Grail all had a massive orgy and produced a baby that should be a mangled heap of organs because of how much none of those things should work together, and yet it goes on to win Mr Universe (and hopefully more than a few Oscars too, unless they decide it's too interesting for them like they probably will.)And as if all that wasn't enough, the performances are all incredible, the narrative is somehow tight and consistent to no end, the directing, editing and cinematography are gorgeous, the dialogue is hilarious, the characters are all extremely interesting...really the only thing I could possibly complain about if I had to is that the beginning is a little slow.It definitely does all need to be there to set up later events in the film, but I did find myself wondering where it was all going and wishing it would get a bit more unique - which, well...needless to say that wish was fulfilled in absolute spades. Maybe the next time I watch it that'll be more entertaining now that I'll be expecting it, who knows.But even if that remains an issue for me, I couldn't possibly call this anything other than a masterpiece for the sheer amount of stuff it's doing all at the same time and doing it all so well and perfectly balanced.Well okay, I will also call it a work of sheer sodding genius.

In all its forms.Nothing has been taboe in this highly entertaining whirlwind of visual excellence.Original in many aspects of cinematic storytellingCould we have experienced the upper layer on a simpler way? Yes ofcourse. But that would not have original nor does that do justice to what most people feel in these situations. Fact and the matter is that most dealing with issues and inner conflict with a rollercoaster of emotions and a storm of thoughts.This film does justice to these periods and in this way all what you weirdly feels very relatable.In short:\nEverything everywhere all at once\nA 9 from me.",

            "content": "Usually if I watch a film that is so obviously divisive, I'll expect the mix of reviews but I must admit the reviews here baffle me. I'd love to ask the people rating this film 1-3. What did they see? Because it wasn't this film.It feels so rare to see a film that is it's own thing. Even when paying homage to films you've seen, this film feels completely new. A few reviews try to argue it's ripping off The Matrix, or The One or a film with a multiverse... it's none of those things. It reminds me of Bo Burnham's Inside in a strange way - it felt completely new, and like I can't believe someone hasn't done it before, but also can't imagine how one would even begin to create something like this.I don't understand many of the criticisms, like the plot being all over the place. The plot is really straightforward and clear - I guess some people zoned out.One review even criticises Stephanie Hsu's performance which is baffling - she was exceptional.Some called it toilet humour or crass - I was actually thinking how funny it was to have the occasional sex toy into a fighting scene without it being vile.Maybe it's an age thing. I think I would have enjoyed this film for its creativity and originality in my 20s, but I'm not sure it would have had the same impact that it's had on me now, as I speed past middle age. This film taps into something that so many people can relate to especially as you get older - what if all the decisions you've ever made have led you to the worst possible version of your life? What if you've fallen into the trap of passing down your own damaged relationship with your parents to your child? Does anything actually matter, really?This film asks you to consider all of this and yet it seems some viewers did not - they just checked their watch and waited for the next funny action scene. So much that's glossed over or criticised is a huge part of the point.I'm so tired of unoriginal content. I'll take this over another superhero movie or requel any day. It's not perfect - I think it could have been a little shorter, some scenes could have been trimmed down. But seeing what filmmakers can achieve with limited budget, their imagination and some YouTube VFX tutorials is truly staggering. This film says yes, you could make a live action Lion King or yet another Batman movie - but what if you made something new? Even if the film weren't great, that alone would have me praising it. Fortunately the film is great, and if you want something that's both action-packed and introspective, this will serve you well.",

            "content": "This movie was a fantastic telling of a Chinese migrant's story in an English speaking country. It's the story of my mother, and many others like her.These women left all that was familiar and known for a country where they did not speak much of the language, or understand much of the culture. They left when most people are in their prime, when their potential was just about to blossom, and went to run a small business and live frugally so that their children could have a brighter future. But that future is a sea of unknown possibility, one that cannot be controlled, or even necessarily understood.Michelle Yeoh does an incredible job (as she always does) of portraying a woman who is coming to terms with the internal conflicts of her past sacrifices, emotional trauma, cultural expectations, the love for her daughter, her relationship with her husband, and the harsh, unforgiving realities of running a small business in the US. Ke Huy Quan similarly amazes with his acting ability, becoming switching between different versions of the same man at the drop of the hat and portraying the typically misunderstood and underestimated, quietly spoken Asian man to perfection.The story is about how our internal conflicts can both hinder and help us on our path to reconciliation and becoming the best versions of ourselves through choice and acknowledgement.As a first generation migrant to an English speaking country from Hong Kong, I want to thank the entire movie team for their kind, nuanced, entertaining and heartfelt telling of our mothers' migrant stories. For telling this story in its messy entirety, and not just settling for a hygienic, polite version reiteration of migrants achieving the American dream, you have done us all an enormous service.",

It is rare to find a film that manages this balancing act as beautifully as Everything Everywhere All At Once.The film tells the story of a middle-aged woman who is trying to save her business and her family from ruin when the responsibility to save the world from a terrible adversary is thrust upon her. The film makers embrace the absurdity of the premise in a singularly ingenious way. By all means, this is the story of an existential crisis on a cosmic scale, and it delivers an exhilarating resolution to the crisis.Casting in this film is beyond perfect. Michelle Yeoh's protagonist feels real which is the highest praise I can muster and Stephanie Hsu matches her in every way. The cinematography in this film is surreal and trippy which goes with the territory of making a film about existentialism and the multiverse. The film jumps from fast paced action sequences to absurdly calming moments of quiet and calm all of which is made possible because of wonderful editing.In conclusion, there are many reasons why this is a great film but I give it 10 stars because it left me with a deeper understanding of life and relationships. I will eagerly wait for the Daniels to come up with more absurd projects. They have made me a fan for life.",

The quirkiness and craziness is definitely it's selling point which makes it unique in its own way but gets cringey as it tries to hold its momentum and maintain the chaoticness for the grandiose finale. Felt very Scott pilgrim-ey, Edgar Wright would have loved to make this movie, I also thought the whole multiverse thing was really pushed in the wake of this new marvel narrativev and the Anthony/Joe Russo producer credits make that a little suspect.

Beyond that, the movie is a drawn out, somewhat ponderous effort.Have you ever asked yourself, are there only so many stories that can be written and only so many songs that can be sung? Have all the ideas been used up? If so, what is left, and what would you need to do, to grab someone's attention?That's what this movie feels like. When all the ideas are gone, lets throw absolutely everything at the wall in a blinding kaleidoscopic mish-mash of so many half-baked ideas and details, that nobody will notice that there is no real story going on and nothing really happens.I'll grant it a '5', because on first watch it's odd enough to maintain your curiosity, rather than simply switching off.

The film brilliantly combines a bombastic backdrop of multiverse mayhem while also delivering an intimate family drama that will leave the audience in tears of laughter and in emotion. The film is filled to the brim with imagination, creating a world that feels original and fresh. The performances are stellar with Michelle Yeoh delivering one of her finest portrayals providing heartfelt emotion and relatability to her character. The fight sequences are entertainingly choreographed, with editing and vibrant camera movements that allow the audience to be immersed in the excitement. The comedy in the film is also done well, granting the film the ability to be silly and quirky while never overshadowing the overall dramatic narrative. Despite how much of a blast this film is, the runtime may drag in areas making the film longer than it needs to be. However, the film is an overall joy from beginning to end.

It's firing on all cylinders, hitting all the points in the holy trinity of what I think can make art special: it's entertaining, it's creative and there's depth to it's message.Not taking on the dreary, self serious tone of typical award winning films, first and foremost, this is a fun movie. It's loaded with fast paced fight scenes, and jokes that had me genuinely laughing out loud. It's a high functioning adventure comedy that's anything but boring.It may not be the first to explore multiverse themes, but it's wildly inventive in it's approach to them. As proven by Rick and Morty, absurdism is part of package, and Everything Everywhere All At Once doesn't miss the opportunity to get gleefully ridiculous.It's not all just an excuse to be weird though, and all the insanity is clearly intended to have greater significance. The film feels pretty clear in it's intent, though it's open ended enough to allow you to pull your own meaning from it. Whether you focus on the family dynamic and emotional themes of finding love and purpose in a sea of possibilities, or are drawn more to the existential questions of staring down nihilism in the age of the information overload, it's certain to give you something to think about when the credits roll.It's got all the basses covered before even taking into account the marvellous acting, editing and effects on display.

Until the same \"verse jump\" theme is played over for the 35th time and you're wondering how, during filming, that the actors weren't slamming speedballs on top of 5ths of Vodka to stay sane. Maybe they did have unlimited Peruvian flake for the cast and crew. That might explain things. 30 minutes in, I was done. I was seriously contemplating standing up in the theater and screaming something unhinged about 1.5 hours in.Then I looked at the online reviews.

Which is precisely the reason why many of the negative reviews I've read here speak more about the viewer than the movie. If you can't find humor, warmth, empathy or just appreciation for the originality of this brilliantly written story - then you need to stick to marvel movies.In short, it's nothing shy of brilliant and for sure one of the best movies of 2022.

            "content": "If you've ever force-fed peanut-butter sandwiches on a group of strangers, you'll recognize that most of the group will consume it as a hearty snack, while a small percentage of them will literally die. The absurdity of that hypothetical scenario is exactly the problem with Everything Everywhere All at Once. Of about 25 people in the audience, 4 left partway through, and after the movie 2 were seen in a comatose state of tears and deeply in need to be held while the rest of the audience was busy repeating the mantra that it was the best movie they had ever seen (in stark contrast). The ubiquitous positive reception by the majority only adds insult to injury.This comedy is a story of nihilism and the mundane constancy of 'laundry and taxes' (aka death and taxes). In the story, a mother who owns a 'laundromat', which serves as a symbolic place for hundreds of 'machines' or 'multiverses' to cycle constantly in a pointless cycle of life and death, is audited at multiple levels for her worthiness to rescue her daughter (and as a consequence the multiverse). It meticulously and powerfully makes a concerted effort to reconstruct the mind of a victim of depression inside the minds of the viewers. It intentionally overwhelms the senses and adds increasing doses of chaos until a conglomerate of elated misery and confusion is fully formed in the mind of the viewer, much like in the mental state of a person who suffers from depressive trauma. It then makes a feeble attempt at dissolving this toxic construct with a caustic fallacy that long term depression can be solved with love. It invites those who have truly felt depression to reawaken any past horrors and then face them with no warning or preparation, and to be left with an aftermath of feeling worthless whilst asking them to contemplate suicide. All within a guise of fast-paced hilarious scenes that make it highly appealing, much like rat poison covered in frosting.Most unfortunately, the comedy is well constructed and the narrative is cohesive, which makes it quite a powerful and well-made story. However, with great power comes great responsibility, something which is tragically ignored. The writers welcome us to contemplate the meaninglessness of life in this free ride to hell. Any who have inner demons will be snatched out of there seats and into an introspective trial with their worst horrors. All else will be able to pass this off as a light-hearted comedy with mediocre story. This is why food with peanuts comes with allergy warnings.",

Against this backdrop, the film explores issues of communication, understanding, and acceptance within family and society.While admittedly ambitious in scope, this effort quickly devolves into a frenzied, farcical, sometimes ludicrous, acid trip of disjointed ideas and imagery, and plays like an exhausting looney-toon mashup of \"The Matrix\" and \"The Mask\".Is it creative and original? Certainly. However, these alone don't make a film enjoyable or praiseworthy, and this hodgepodge quilt of interesting ideas, pieced together with duct tape and bubble gum, ultimately falls short of anything which can be called \"good\". Hardcore cinemaphiles may enjoy the experimental storytelling, but I expect most others will likely be disappointed, and perhaps even disturbed.Due to mostly solid acting, originality, and a few laughs, I'll give this 3 stars, despite its otherwise near unwatchability.",

However, in this case, I would like to make a rare exception by citing \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" as a Chef-d'oeuvre, a Masterpiece.Not only the concept but the entire demonstration is on a whole another level.

Stephanie Hsu and Ke Huy Quan both have a blast playing various versions of their characters, and James Hong is always great value.Above all though, this film is about the phenomenal, poignant, delightful and absolutely captivating performance from Michelle Yeoh.It's impossible to overstate just how hypnotically watchable Yeoh is, anchoring rather than owning every scene with presence, grace and generosity. Her character act is perfect, and she makes every scene entirely believable, no matter how absurdist the movie gets.The very slight flaws can all be forgiven because of Yeoh's magnificent performance - you'll be utterly spellbound by every look, every gesture, every word, whether she's saving the multiverse, or doing her taxes.",

The whole multiverse topic acts more as a comedic and symbolic tool to help portray these.To be precise, the topic is a constant tug-o-war of pessimistic nihilism vs optimistic nihilism:\n\"Nothing Matters.\"\n= Nothing matters, why bother at all?But also,\n= Nothing matters, and that is okay! Why not just enjoy the little moments anyway.All this is portrayed through various wacky, comedic and action scenes, with various highly emotional scenes in between. You juggle from highly mundane everyday-life moments, to colorful and over-the-top multiverse-theme moments.To understand this movie and its message, try to think and feel things from both the daughter's and the mother's point of view. What would it feel like to be everything, everywhere all at once?Along the emotional road, assuming you have even the slightest sense of humour, you'll probably die laughing.I must say I'm rather surprised by the barrage of negative reviews on this movie recently.

As the theme of multiverses spreads through pop culture and TV like a flame on peat, few manage to flesh out the concept as well as this film. The different universes are so varied that at points it seems overwhelming until you are reminded of the main story and how they tie into it. The writers carefully treaded the line between chaos and order as they told the story of a mother chasing her daughter through infinite realities while maintaining a struggling marriage, running a business, fighting the IRS, and trying to impress her father. The cyclical structure truly shows the change Evelyn went through over the course of the film. In the beginning, she is paranoid about throwing a new years party as she files taxes and argues with an IRS agent. However, as we return to the familiar setting of Miss Deidre's desk at the end of the film, she is still preoccupied with thoughts and is still distracted, but this time she is content with her family and life. The cinematography is amazing. The transition between realities is seamless and not at all like Marvel's flashy CG graphics. The lighting, costume and set design create a malleable clay to forge an incredible narrative out of. I especially enjoyed the brief change from live action to pi\u00f1atas and crayon drawings and then back. The soundtrack is brilliant and its fluidity accompanies the dramatic changes in the plot. The choice to accompany Deidre and Evelyn's relationship with Clair de Lune was creative genius. Overall, I believe that this film is well worth your time and will satisfy your craving for a great film in a sea of modern mediocrity.",

Despite the hype and the buzz surrounding it, the film failed to live up to my expectations.One of the main issues with the movie was that it lacked emotional resonance. Despite its ambitious story and large ensemble cast, the film failed to create a strong emotional connection with the audience. It was difficult to feel invested in the characters' journeys, making it challenging to care about their struggles and triumphs.Additionally, the movie suffered from pacing issues. The narrative felt bloated and uneven, with some scenes dragging on for too long while others felt rushed and underdeveloped. This made it difficult to stay engaged throughout the film's runtime, which clocked in at over two hours.Another problem with the movie was its overreliance on clich\u00e9s and tropes. The film attempted to subvert and twist these familiar storytelling elements, but ultimately failed to do so in a meaningful way. The result was a story that felt derivative and uninspired, lacking the freshness and originality that it was striving for.Finally, while the film's visual effects were generally impressive, there were some notable missteps. Some of the scenes were visually overwhelming, with too much happening on screen at once, which made it difficult to focus on any one thing. Additionally, some of the visual effects were distractingly cheesy, which took away from the immersive experience the film was trying to create.",

            "content": "People treat this movie like it is groundbreaking but really it is a lot of things we have seen before rebranded. It sets up a lot of concepts that it doesn't fully understand, it wants to be like inception or tenet in it's high concept deep confusing layers but it doesn't have the intelligence in it's writing to follow through on it, anyone that really thinks deeply about the logic of it all will feel it fall apart, it feels like someone has tried to write the trippiest thing ever over the top of a really basic story cashing in on gay culture. It has strong themes of generational trauma and having regrets of where life has headed as well as LGBT themes, and it follows through on these themes with very little nuance. A big problem is once things are clear what the metaphors are for example the mother accepting the daughter sexuality or the daughter being depressed it destroys much of the depth the scifi elements created, it removed all tension, I didn't even see the daughter as depressed? But the plot needed her to be to retaliate against her mother, but what was she retaliating against? What nihilism did she feel? They set her up as a character that was comfortable with her identity surrounded by family that didn't understand but it didn't make sense for her to be depressed and it broke the concept really. The idea of an interdimensional evil that took no form and was able to surpass all dimension limits was good, but they didn't know what to do with it. The getting skills idea was good but stolen from the matrix, the multiverse ideas stolen from other films too, really all they did was repackage it and not well. The divorce too felt unbelievable, they layered up all these conflicts divorce and auditing and it was all so intensely forced that it felt shallow and not earnt. They layer on top of all this constant weirdness and sexual humour, it felt like when people say Rick and Morty is the smartest show ever. Just because it's random. Just because it has social issues like sexual orientation. Doesn't make it a good movie. I give it points for originality and visuals, the performances were good too, but overall it wasn't a good movie, entirely unsatisfying but by pushing an agenda it falls in this territory of films like 'Get Out' where they are immune to criticism and don't have to make sense.",

I'm not sure how much more of the plot I can give away, because the shock absurdity of it all is a big part of what makes Everything Everywhere All at Once tick. Suffice to say, it's every bit as oddly, magically confounding as the directors' previous film, Swiss Army Man, which featured a fart-propelled corpse skimming waves and dispensing profound life lessons.Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan, collectively known as \"The Daniels,\" have carved themselves a distinct niche with these two films, alike in their polished visual excellence and strangely potent sense of sentimentality. After the sheer, gargantuan silliness of these concepts has essentially disarmed you, they posit, you're ripe for a deeper, more resonant message or two. In this case, the despondent store owner (Michelle Yeoh, who's fabulous) addresses the strain of a parent-child relationship from both perspectives and comes to terms with her own abundant, unrealistic aspirations and expectations. It's deep, powerful, universal stuff, which just so happens to be spread across a series of increasingly wacky, music-video kung-fu action scenes and random, contorted pop culture references.Put simply, this movie is a trip. The first act is demanding, a dizzying rush of big exposition and long elaboration that whirls between English and several subtitled Chinese dialects, but that lengthy setup is essential to unlock the delightful insanity of the next hour. Once the real ride is underway, it's an uncontrollable snowball of fanny packs and razor blades. Riotously entertaining; you've gotta see this.",

There's no doubt that the film offers a lot to take in a single watch, but this is one of those works that warrant multiple viewings.

I feel like Evelyn was kind of week at the very end, everyone else was good.In a movie that normally is bloated when they literally try to do everything and try 100 different genres/art-styles, it helps when you have one basic message to structure everything. SO in the end it kind of get repetitive when you get the \"THEME\" of the movie, but it's done in such an enjoyable way, that you forgive the fact that it treats you like a child and repeats the message like 15 times which is how long they say with rote learning it takes to memorize something.Was a great movie, could easily recommend and A24 is really cementing themselves as the new powerhouse for indie.

The visual effects and cinematography pairing was superb and genius for this story. I also loved the symbolism of the Evelyn and Waymond's relationship via Evelyn's uncertainty of the \"Waymond\" who was present at any given moment.

Most of the movie was visually pleasing.The idea of doing something out of place to jump between these paralell universes was quite original.Cons:\nThe world was both overexplained, and not explained enough. It seems like they haven't really developed how the world works, so they just threw in some scientific sounding mumbo-jumbo.It was unbearably cliche at every point, no smart ideas or twists.There were some points where I thought we might get some insight into the mind of either the protaganist or the antagonist, but nope, because the movie couldun't stay serious for five minutes straight without some comedic relief character entering.Now to my main critisism: the humor was awful. Not just simply bad. It tried to mimc \"gen z humor\" but it was off in so many ways. The absurd jokes weren't absurd in a smart way (by smart I mean a joke that would have surprised me). The best way to describe it is cringey.Who could've guessed that love saves the day?The weirdest part was that almost everybody around me was laughing their asses off. I was with friends and the whole way we were laughing at the people laughing at this garbage. Maybe thats what everybody was laughing at? Its harf to say.",

            "content": "Once a popular film ends up this widely praised for its deep profundity and philosphical explorations one can only become suspicious of what could possibly be hidden beneath such a grandiose pretense.Turns out that beyond the appearance of meaningfulness this picture presents an almost shocking level of narrative conformity. In essence the movies plot boils down to something eerily closely resembling the typical Spielbergian family melodrama which omnipresently haunts the hollywood consumer whenever he feels the urge to indulge in any sort of VFX action spectacle. But unlike the classic action blockbuster this movie (apparently quite successfully) tries to hide its banale message of compassion and acceptance in a contrived martial arts and special effects orgy which despite its obvious attempt at creating some sort of aesthetic diversity feels thoroughly uniform stylistically.Like many recent movies the cold and calculated fast pacedness and incorporation of the already stale multiverse premise undeniably tries to make up for the fact that there is just not that much there. It's a simple story about family and generational conflict which in itself is not a bad thing and could, if well written, undoubtedly provide a template for a good and original story. In EEAAO though, every character seems to be the most unoriginal played out trope version of their respective role. The mother is your typical \"strong woman who feels like she could have been more had she not settled for her silly but loveable husband\", Said husband, the stereotypical \"too honest and friendly for his own good and not assertive enough modern beta male\" character and the daughter your run of the mill anxious and mildly depressed teen. Then, of course, the movie goes on to show that all these characters who, in the beginning, feel atomized and alienated from one another, in the end, realize that they are truly \"in the same boat\" and reach a corny reconciliation after finally talking to one another about their feelings, which of course could only be achieved thorugh an overwhelmingly ridiculous odyssey through the infinite alternate universes of played out hollywood cliches.Sadly this movie is just another addition to the seemingly never ending stream of modern films which don't even warrant the criticism of \"poorly written\" since there seems to be barely anything written. And it's not that there's a problem with it being focused on appearance (\"style over substance\") it's the fact that it tries to make you think it isn't. Rick and Morty Season 1 Episode 8 demonstrates how to deal with the same premise in a more engaging, honest and funny way and does so in less than 25 minutes. We seem to have arrived in an era where all the intelligent writing has ended up in the adult fart comedy cartoon sector.",

            "content": "Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022) :\nBrief Review -The real multiverse of madness that Marvel failed to make. If Nolan was asked to make a high-concept absurdist sci-fi flick, he would have made this film. Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert had an idea for a multiverse flick way back in 2010 - the same year when Christopher Nolan made \"Inception\". However, it took them a long time to gather things, and then we saw Marvel entering the multiverse zone with one of their most popular superheroes, Doctor Strange. It is strange that Everything Everywhere All at Once released in the same year when Doctor Strange and Wanda decided to go bonkers in the Multiverse of Madness. However, the film couldn't live up to the hype. But if you are amongst those who weren't satisfied with the Strange vs Wanda battle due to weak writing (like me), then make sure that you catch this high-concept entertainer. This absurdist sci-fi flick is expectedly weird, wild and awfully rubbish, but doesn't fail to entertain you with some crazy ideas and amazing sequences. The film tells the story of a Chinese woman who discovers that she must connect with parallel universe versions of herself to prevent a powerful being from causing the destruction of the multiverse. There is much more to it that can't be spoiled, but yes, you can be warned and made prepared for emotionally intellectual topics like existentialism and Nihilism, with some absurd and yukk-ward moments. Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan and James Hong have given good performances along with the brilliant supporting cast. Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert deserve a big round of applause for their out-of-the-box thinking and audience-friendly vision. Neither Nolan nor Marvel could manage to deal with this high-concept topic by arranging the comedy in a perfect manner. The 2 Ds have done it. Except for children, this one is strongly recommended to everyone who loves watching unique entertainers.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",

But just before I did, the film offered me a lifeline in the form of an idea:If Evelyn can choose what matters to her, if she can choose to find significance in the connections and compassion of her loved ones and their lives together, why can't I?This is the message in the film that resonated with me, but read these reviews and see the other messages that resonated with other people. See how other people choose/find significance in the nihilistic chaos and how it is different for each one.For some people the message was about the selfishness of our world/culture today, with a message of hope that we are all human, all with our struggles and successes and a reminder that kindness breeds kindness.For others the message was that when we are spiraling out of control with too many things to think about or focus on, focusing on one thing that truly matters to us can help us regain our control and find some peace/power in our lives.See people choosing what mattered to them.TLDR:First, this is a film that requires you to be in a receptive/reflective frame of mind to enjoy it fully, if you aren't there or not that sort of person then you probably won't enjoy it as much ( I am so glad I waited until I was in that frame of mind).Second, Everything Everywhere All At Once will ask you questions, the answers you find will probably change your way of looking at the world and yourself.Third, even if the film doesn't connect with you on a deeper level, the comedy, action, and dialogue are all top notch and I would recommend the film on those alone.Nothing matters, but it's ok, because it doesn't matter.",

            "content": "Everything Everywhere All at Once is a fantastic movie. The multiverse premise is utilized extremely well, as each universe is meaningful to the story. Beyond delivering great comedy, these variances all bring a respectable amount of heart to the arcs and themes developed within. The writing is therefore brilliant, as the filmmakers even stick to the established multiverse rules. This being said, the suspension of disbelief is stretched thin by some moments where the fantastical abilities start to feel overly-numerous. Fortunately, this does not impact all too much of the awesomely creative plot. The film is otherwise comedically, emotionally, and technically proficient. The humor throughout is hilarious, from how lines are delivered to the wackiness of the many universes shown. Nearly every joke works and simultaneously aids the emotional caches of the plot. What makes the story feel so wholesome, though, are the performers and their respective characters. Yeoh is amazing in the lead as the flawed protagonist who profoundly, yet genuinely grows. In support, Curtis, Hong, Quan, and Tsu are very good. They seamlessly go from one variant to the next, somehow proving convincing in each role. All of these characters are highly likable, too, especially as the story progresses and motivations are made clear. Even the villain is sympathetic. The dynamics between all of these characters is what ultimately produces such an emotionally resonant picture, though. Various themes within result from how these relationships are resolved so thoughtfully. The resolution is therefore quite satisfactory. However, a somewhat major flaw is apparent in the closing sequences. The universe the plot begins in is most certainly not the one it ends in, which does take from the impact the movie has. More so, it is disappointing not to get a true resolution to this original universe. On a technical level, though, this film is perfect. The editing is expert, between the wonderfully cut action to the overall pacing. On that note, the set pieces are excitingly choreographed and highly creative. Cinematography is just as inventive with such colorful backgrounds and intriguing shots. The score is fitting to every moment, too. Ultimately, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a great film on all fronts, only featuring a few missteps.",

The plot can be a bit all over the place but I think that's part of the movie's charm.I think I would recommend it to those who are willing to experience a seriously life reflecting movie, that also doesn't take itself too seriously. You don't really know or have certainty on what is going to happen next. Except constantly expecting the most ludicrous scenarios like (a universe with people having hot dog fingers lmao), but it is an emotional theatrical masterpiece. Very well made special effects, lots of funny scenes and it's ultimately a movie about life and the choices we are too afraid to make.Again probably not for everyone but I typically like action films and enjoyed the fight scenes. I really think this movie is underrated and an amazing job in making me feel deeply. Very few Hollywood movies are able to do that for me. And why it gets ten stars from me.",

            "content": "Every scene and sequence connected to the next one in this exceptional movie directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert. Both also sat on screenplay, adding to the consistency and clever plot-layering that can only come from minds who vibe in unison.Son Lux's musical scoring was an underrated gem in this title. Larkin Seiple's cinematography was great. Paul Rogers's editing worked wonders. Jason Kisvarday's production design was noteworthy. Amelia Brooke's art direction was quite good. Kelsi Ephraim's set decoration had a lot that needed balancing, and she did.Shirley Kurata's costume design was aces. The hair-makeup and stunts teams did outstanding work in \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\". The VFX and special effects teams are deserving of high praise.Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Wang was everything I never knew I needed. Her performance was amazing, versatile, natural, and memorable. I've always been a fan of her work, and it was nice watching her do something so different yet so ideally tailored for her.Joy Wang, played by Stephanie Hsu, was perfection. Waymond Wang, played by Ke Huy Quan, was another underrated talent in this production. Chad, played by Harry Shum Jr., was notable.Playing Deirdre Beaubeirdre was none other than Jamie Lee Curtis, who was splendid. She was funny in a subtle way, and compelling in every other.I was surprised when veteran Chinese actor James Hong came on the scene. He played Gong Gong, and it was great to watch him do something distinct from his usual work.\"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" covered the travails of what it means to be a Chinese immigrant in the United States of America. A fantastic twist, and quite literally, came about where Yeoh's Evelyn had to save the world, again quite literally.The visual precision of scene-work in this film was akin to the sharp cuts of a master couturier. Not a single boring moment prevailed throughout, which itself was a testament to Kwan and Scheinert's direction.A layer of original storytelling was spread carefully, almost lovingly, through the script. There was action, drama, humour, love, family, and fantasy all in one neat package. It was also one of the most deeply philosophical films of the year - of the past few years, even.\"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" has to be seen by movie enthusiasts particularly because of how skillfully it managed to evade clich\u00e9s - despite the underlying 'Matrix download' and 'dark Alice in mad-land' elements - and provide viewers with one of the most thematically satisfying movies of 2022.",

There were ingenious things, as well as totally stupid ones, but somehow they all work. Definitely not a movie for everyone in my opinion. Just like the dualistic style in which they shot the film, (something like a mix of commercial and indie cinema), the content is just as bipolar, ranging from touching and quiet moments and total stupidity and weirdness.The beginning hooked me a lot, drew me into the story, the multiverse, etc., somehow the gas pedal wasn't pushed yet and everything that was happening was easier to follow, more natural flowing. That's why I really liked the first half. But towards the end, Daniels retreated too much and hampered the situation a lot. And the climax wasn't strong or interesting enough to justify the weight in which the third act was burdened. It's just that a hell of a lot of ideas, one after the other, a hell of a lot of dynamic editing, jumping in different scenes, places, each one more and more crazier than the other and it exhausted me. The bombastic length of 2 hours and 20 minutes didn't help either. At one time I was so exhausted that I seriously was wondering if ot would end soon, I had the feeling that the film lasted 5 hours, although I was fascinated by what was happening.For me, if they had cut at 15-20 minutes, there would not have been so many stretched plot threads, excessive use of slo-mo, etc. The film would have been much tighter and have more punch. But in the end, in terms of authorship, originality and imagination, they just killed it. Great study of a family relationship, mixed with crazy multiverse story. An original idea, which was shot with incredible splendor, mastery, love and heart. Special praise for the editor, because his work was definitely not easy at all \ud83d\ude04 I don't want to see the film file, because it will definitely give me a headache. I also don't know how much their budget was, but it was definitely very well balanced in terms of CGI, practical, etc.All in all, a wonderful job for Daniels. If they continue in this way, they will surely become powerhouse directors. And once again, I'm super happy that so many original and relatively indie films are appearing. Lately, there seems to be a renaissance of auteur cinema that can only make me happy.Rating: 8/10\nP. S. - Quite an interesting coincidence that we have a second film in a short period in which there are so many similar elements. The multiverse , I understand, it's not a very out there subject, but the third eye puzzled me a little. Somehow I'm still fresh from Strange and now seeing it here again... I got a bit of a dumb feeling, even though I realize that they are totally different movies. Perhaps, unfortunately, we will continue to witness more and more such coincidences in the future, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to be surprised by things.",

At least that's where the characters in writer/directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, collectively known as Daniels, new film \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" find themselves initially. That is, until they take an emotional, philosophical, and deeply weird trip through the looking glass into the multiverse and discover metaphysical wisdom along the way. In this love letter to genre cinema, Michelle Yeoh gives a virtuoso performance as Evelyn Wang, a weary owner of a laundromat under IRS audit. We first meet her enjoying a happy moment with her husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan) and their daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). We see their smiling faces reflected in a mirror on their living room wall. As the camera literally zooms through the mirror, Evelyn's smile fades, now seated at a table awash with business receipts. She's preparing for a meeting with an auditor while simultaneously trying to cook food for a Chinese New Year party that will live up to the high standards of her visiting father Gong Gong. On top of juggling her father's visit and the tax audit, Evelyn's sullen daughter Joy wants to bring her girlfriend Becky (Tallie Medel) to the party and her husband wants to talk about the state of their marriage. Just as Evelyn begins to feel overwhelmed by everything happening in her life she's visited by another version of Waymond from what he calls the Alpha verse. Here humans have learned to \"verse jump\" and are threatened by an omniverse agent of chaos known as Jobu Tupaki. Soon, Evelyn is thrust into a universe-hopping adventure that has her questioning everything she thought she knew about her life, her failures, and her love for her family. Most of the action is set in an IRS office building in Simi Valley (which, as a Californian, had me in stitches), where Evelyn must battle IRS agent Diedre (Jamie Lee Curtis, having the time of her life), a troop of security guards, and possibly everyone else she's ever met. Production designer Jason Kisvarday crafts a seemingly endless cubicle-filled office where everything from the blade of a paper trimmer to a butt plug shaped auditor of the year awards become fair game in a battle to save the universe. Moments of love and camaraderie. Sometimes they happen over time. Sometimes they happen all at once.",

While I admittedly didn't get it all with this viewing, I felt this movie is special. There's so much more I didn't see and can't wait to upon inevitable multi-viewings. This is why I'm glad I chose to purchase this (unseen) vs. Renting it or getting a free trial/one month of Showtime just to see it. Now I *can* rewatch this enough times to absorb it all.Hard to describe the plot, but it boils down to an everyday Mother/Daughter/Wife with extraordinary worries/responsibilities/troubles and her unexpected journey of self-discovery through...the multi-universes. This could be the unofficial Scott Pilgrim vs. The World sequel I've always wanted.It's also like The One and, of course, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. It is better than Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and a hundred times better than The One, but I still do prefer Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World more.Everyone in the cast is excellent - not one single bad performance, but I will give the most kudos to both Jamie Lee Curtis and my personal favorite of the cast/characters: Waymond Wang played wonderfully by Ke Huy Quan. I instantly felt his warmth, charisma and boy, was he adorable. Plus, a good fighter. And OF COURSE, Michelle Yeoh did great. That 100% goes without saying.One thing I did not expect: this is a straight-up comedy first. I did laugh out loud so...many...times. Sure, there is action. Beautiful, exciting, fun and wonderfully choreographed fighting. And there is heart. Like a ton of it. But, overall, I really saw this as a comedy-drama with some incidental action.I don't think I'm gushing over this as much as I believe I will with additional viewings. There's a LOT to take in. Like more flashes/subplots/characters/directions still dancing across my brain from this and the movie ended a while ago. It is one of the most original pieces I've seen in a long time. And it's not just the script. Everything Everywhere All at Once...on the screen.Jury's still out if I'll raise my initial 8/10-star rating as I've been known to do. But this I know: I will be revisiting the Wang's multiverses again soon.***Final Thoughts: Naturally, I'm not going to spoil the ending, but it was 100% the ending I was hoping for. I didn't expect it would happen and I was so very pleased with the payoff. I cannot wait to see this again.",

The quirkiness didn't grow on me at all, the humour fell flat at my feet and everything (all at once) felt rather forced.If I were generous I'd say it's a movie that wasn't made for my generation, but since I'm snobbish I'll rather assume that 15 years of formulaic Marvel franchises have severely lowered viewers' standards for this movie to receive such rave reviews.",

Soon after the start of the movie, we are transported into various alternative universes in which she resides, all of which are created by the decisions previously made in her life. Essentially, the setting in this movie is similar to a choose-your-own-adventure book.Evelyn is called upon by people in other parallel universes to defeat the villian, who is eventually identified as her own daughter. As Evelyn moves through various universes, she sees how her life might have turned out had different choices been made throughout the years and millennia. The movie is filled with irreverent humor that had some moviegoers belting out hearty guffaws! There are elements of the over-the-top type of martial arts scenes you might find in spoofs of kung fu movies. But at this movie's core, we find that it is a story about how you can choose to love the life you have and embrace it completely. As Evelyn is shown all of her different realities in the parallel universes, she still comes back to love the one she is currently living in with all of its problems and flaws.The movie drags on just a bit long. Jamie Lee Curtis's role in this movie adds to the quirkiness. The visuals are presented as a sort of dream sequence at times and they provide constant stimulation.It's definitely worth a watch and is truly a unique movie that incorporates a lot of common thematic elements.",

But eventually you realise that what is thematically a most banal, simple plot folds out as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of the century. It is one of those rare cases where a film can give you so much that a book cannot, as the surrealism eventually grows on you to become a condensed hyperrealism that nails you to the seat for an emotional rollercoaster ride of an experience.

There is some action throughout the film, if we can call it action at all, the description says it's an adventure, but I didn't see any trace of adventure here. It's immediately obvious that this definitely is not for everyone taste. I'm bothered by the bilingualism that drags through the film, it's somehow disorienting and uninteresting. The actors did their job properly, the only thing I don't like is the portrayal and characteristics of the character played by Stephamie Shu, that role sets the film back quite a bit and makes it uninteresting in parts and boring. All in all, I partly see why the rating of the film is so high, but I think that the rating is definitely not fully justified, this is a mediocre time killer with some boring and uninteresting scenes and nothing more.",

            "review_title": "Conservative",
            "content": "The film's incredible importance lies in its unintentional depiction of what it means to be lost and confused (both artistically and practically) in a world of destabilized values.Along the \"whacky\" journey, certain themes emerge: histrionic pity/compassion, tawdry humor, fragile weakness, the exhaustion of spirit, and the frightening, crippling fear of characters partaking and marginally succeeding in barely achieving the average/mediocre life. In essence, it therefore represents a narrative that dangerously projects a common ideal as if it is superior and noble.In all the commotion, tiresome tricks, and \"shocking\" artistic choices (rocks, shameless sexual humor, etc.) the narrative does not fail to argue for its own set of specific values (weak kindness, categorical acceptance/tolerance, passivity, etc.). These values do not reflect courage, to me, but rather the voice of an exhausted nihilism.As a whole this film desperately searches and lunges for something meaningful among the \"wild\" (not that wild) \"multiverse\" (not that multi). However, it forgoes any chance for meaning because it does not take the time and energy to create meaning itself.Instead it shuns the responsibility of meaning to the viewer: please make something of this madness for me! In my opinion that is its appeal. But, the meaning made, the final conclusion of the audience is ultimately one and the same: there is no great standard for judgement anymore.Perhaps worst of all, this film fails to realize that the inclusion of all things is precisely what it partially argues for. But, the inclusion of everything is itself the creation of meaninglessness since distinctions and judgements are necessary for making meaning. Ironically, that very meaningless it unintentionally creates is also what forces it to settle for the average as its goal.Finally, its main contradiction is the second thing the film argues for: its own exclusive ideas which I touched on above (kindness, etc.). Therefore it rejects any complete concept of \"everything.\" For example, it has a tendency to include the loud, unpredictable, overly-sensory, etc., but excludes the subtle, graceful, patient, delicate, confident, proud, healthy, tasteful, or beautiful.In the end, despite its rowdy favoritism towards 1) over-stimulation 2) timid adventure, 3) cheap novelty, 4) the debasement/confusion of the human, and 5) alcoholic escapism, it only drifts back to common conservative values. In that it resembles an accidental advertisement for conservatism.",

What a triumph!There's so much going on in this movie that I'll have to re-watch it a few times to really appreciate all of the small details that were lovingly & painstakingly put into this.I read somewhere that the movie was shot in just over a month, too, which is mind blowing in itself, given all the different sets, costume changes, re-shoots of same/similar sequences in completely different settings, etc...The acting all around is great & the action is, likewise, amazing. Such a fun, seemingly chaotic but actually well thought-out storyline, but the editing really brings it all together. I'm glad the directors had a clear vision of what they were doing as I reckon the actors would have been pretty confused most of the way through it & probably only pretended they understood how it would all pan out, until all the madness was finally stitched together for the theatrical release.Great movie.

The set design, hair and makeup, visual effects, and cinematography will undoubtedly warrant this film consideration come Oscar season. Everything Everywhere All At Once is a film that will be enjoyed by everyone, as it's artistic elements are sure to intrigue any cinephile or film student, and it's accessibility is sure to entertain any average movie goer.

If you find plot devices like people having to do statistically improbable things like inserting a butt plug in the middle of a fight scene, or beating someone with a pair of oversized artificial genitalia funny, then by all means you may find this entertaining.

Michelle Yeoh finally gets a chance to do something in addition to just action and she delivered; comedy, drama, sadness, everything! So does Ke Huy Quan, but the standout IMO was Stephanie Hsu, the daughter. *slow claps*The cinematography, editing and sound design deserve special mentions.I still have more reading to do about this lol but if you want to watch something totally out there and yet entertaining & moving, don't miss this one.

I love Michelle Yeoh as an actress - I have followed and watched her screen career for many years - and it made for the only reason I watched this; having read the film synopsis in the press outputs, I was not impressed and would have given it a miss but for her being in it.The trouble with the film is that we are given no reason whatsoever (neither at the start and right to the finish line) as to why everything was happening and, the causes that led up to it. It just jumps straight into a 3 parts cacophony of riotous confusion. The comedy throughout was very few and far between, though a couple of scenes gave rise to a big smile from me, and therefore, I can only assume that all the reviewers are very easily amused by scenes that were meant to be comical but just lacked that sincerity and timing. With the complexed plot it was attempting to draw the viewer in with it should have had a far better explanation.I was also very disappointed to see Michelle Yeoh in a film with the \"F\" word in it (she never does that kind of film work as far as I am aware) and, to be honest there was no real reason to use it here; something like, \"Oh crap!\" would have sufficed instead!I, if asked by my circle of friends, would only tell them to not expect anything hilariously funny, logical or reasonably enjoyable and, to forget about any forewarning insight into the unfolding plot. Its a very well presented digital visual of technical excellence (the reason why I have given it a 5 star) but, its a dull 2hr:12mins and the worst film I have ever seen Michelle (Yeoh) act in.",

            "content": "Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022) follows a woman struggling with day to day life, who soon finds that the fate of her universe, and all of the multiverses, are in her hands. I enjoyed this film a lot! It was so much fun and had a lot of emotional weight to it, I'm glad it's getting the attention it deserves.The cinematography for this film was truly brilliant, and I can't even pick some shots that stuck out simply because ALL of them did! It's so visually pleasing and really pops, definitely worth seeing in cinemas for the visuals alone. I really used the advantage of having different cinematography for each universe very well.A big stand out for me were the characters and their actors. The film is packed full of character development that is well written, and realistic relationships between them. Ke Huy Quan absolutely stole the show as Waymond, his character was so pure of heart and it was IMPOSSIBLE to dislike him.The humour is very slapstick and silly, which works most of the time! However, some of the jokes got a bit repetitive for me. I understand how people may like this though so I just think that's my preference!The score was amazing too, and so energetic! I loved listening to it, it added so much chaotic energy to the action sequences and really helped to keep my interest constantly. It's used very tastefully too, with more slow tracks used in mellow scenes.Lastly, the pacing is good and is king enough to flesh out the story and plot properly! I liked how it was split up into sections that explain the title, and it was very clear in it's storytelling. It dragged a little bit, but I wouldn't say it's much of an issue at all.",

            "review_title": "Escapism--a sci-fi/action packed version of Pan's Labyrinth",
            "content": "Of course my opinion doesn't matter. They've swept the awards season just like Squid Games did last year, and Parasite did the year or so before, and Crazy Rich Asians did the year before. (Noticing a trend are we?)Scratch that. Who cares if they won awards! My opinion DOES matter!Now I am reviewing this as I watch. Currently, the film gets 10 out of 10 because I think I understand exactly what it's saying. So far, 30 minutes in, I think we are looking at this film from the main character Evelyn's perspective. She is a detached daydreamer. She has an intense inner world, she has wishes that her family members were saviors and adored leaders, when it reality they are the banes of her existence or vice versa. In the other dimensions or \"verses\", her daughter's alternate versions existing in every other dimension has killed every version of Evelyn, and the final one is the version we see, a worn down Chinese-American immigrant and mom and pending divorcee with insurmountable debts and a laundromat that is about to be foreclosed (or something like that). I will change my rating as the film goes on if necessary, if it gets too messy and makes this more complicated than what I think it is.I also give the movie 10 stars for its perfect coloring, thus far. One thing that annoys me is when a movie has saturation and a color palette that doesn't match the energy or plot or characters (for instance, if a movie is about--I don't know--teenagers running away and encountering dangers in a big city while on acid trips, I'd expect a very colorful and heavily saturated movie with sudden cuts and zapping imagery etc. The movie would be boring if it were in black and white). However the colors here were great. It made the film look literally \"cool\" with its cool saturation yet not boring due to a colorful wardrobe from bold yellows to vivid patterns to earth tones to pastels in one frame.This movie is very intelligent, but its fraught with pretentious sci-fi jargon like \"alpha, omniverse, cosmic, variations, matter\" and other scientific mumbo jumbo and philosophies. I can imagine that its default target audiences (sci-fi fans--and Asian Americans being stereotyped as the nerdy high achieving model minority) totally understand it all, and so the film was unapologetically stuffed with the same information and vocabulary that had everyone else running screaming out of every science and math class in our past, while the target audience and it's bystanding social justice warriors rave to everyone else head scratching. And out of that, the film created this concept of \"verse jumping to another version of yourself.\" But all of that is neither here nor there and very unnecessary and an overly complicated way of showing us someone who daydreams all day, maybe driven a little mad by the sudden realization of what her life is. Right in the elevator, right before she heads to the IRS office to learn her fate, her life flashes before her eyes. It's a moment of providence. She wonders and can suddenly see--how she ended up in mountains of debt in the USA. But the movie shows it, instead, as illusory \"verse jumping.\" It's not. The visuals make it seem as if this is another superhero movie with divinely intervening alter egos that are whipped out right when they need to be. But I think this is satirical. The film takes place at the IRS office, a place where I'm sure anyone who winds up there wishes they could teleport away, of course, or inconsequentially beat up the facility staff and security, and disappear in time during the manhunt, and have their rebellious, wayward and maybe even broke or criminal relatives who you normally are ashamed of just swoop in and suddenly save the day and make you proud finally. Or, during an uncomfortably difficult discussion where the truth hurts too much, and you never have a reason to escape without looking crazy or making that person angry, but then suddenly you can \"verse jump\" or teleport away and proceed in another life as a better or just different you. Something you can only daydream about. I don't need the silly sci-fi storyline. Maybe other people than just Michelle Yeoh's character are also \"verse jumping\", creating the film's universe, a \"multiverse\" of everyone's daydreams/alternate versions interrupting or intercepting.The movie decided to explain these feelings scientifically with action packed visuals and heavy synth action music and FX, rather than tell the same story spiritually or philosophically with whim and fantasy and atmospheric, natural orchestras--such as what Pan's Labyrinth did in a far less confusing and complicated way. It, too, in a more noble way told the story of someone who juxtaposed daydreams with reality during moments of fear or helplessness.While people are wowed by the graphics and the adrenaline rushing pace, they don't seem to take any food for thought. Of course I'm still only 30 minutes in, but I can tell already what's going on. Her daughter is a professional verse jumper, and thus a force to be reckoned with in every world, in every dimension, in every universe. Whereas in the universe we all know about, her daughter is an insecure, grungy, depressed, inarticulate outcast. The fact that her daughter is an unstoppable verse jumper means two things: that her daughter must be so depressed that she daydreams A LOT, and/or that her mother is so ashamed and unhappy with her daughter's outcome, that she daydreams up a better daughter.There was one moment where the film crew must have either been either so aware/worried that the film is in fact confusing regardless of your level of intelligence that they figured we'd need an analogy of omniverse jumping to toppings on an everything-bagel... and while the following moments were weird, I think they needed to be, to depict just how bizarre our daydreams and dreams can be. At least I hope that's what they were going for, and not that they actually took that moment seriously and thought it would be \"deep.\" Because I'm currently unsure, I bring it down to 8 stars.Ok. My interest level has diminished. Ironically, the zane and absurdities can't keep my attention. The moment they got hot dogs for fingers and some of the guys had to sodomize themselves with random office objects in order to \"verse jump\" is when I've decided to put the viewing on pause for another day. I will now submit this post and verse jump to another movie.Side thought: I was just going to comment that her husband Waymond sounds just like the kid from The Goonies. I looked it up, and it's the kid from The Goonies lol all grown up. How cute.",

Now, the hype has died down, and I finally got the chance to watch it.And from what I've say, it absolutely lived up to the hype. My only few problems were that it became a bit too wacky at points, and I thought the misunderstanding between Evelyn and Waymond about the divorce papers were a bit contrived. But besides that, this film is an absolute spectacle.The Daniels did a phenomenal job directing the film. So many scenes and shots throughout the film are shot with attention to detail, with so much personality throughout it. The editing is the best I've seen this year. The visual effects are great, especially for a $25m budget. It also manages to utilize a minimum number of sets, and still manage to utilize those sets to their potential.The movie is also immensely clever, both intellectually and emotionally. The writing for the multiverse was very well done, introducing many concepts and ideas, such as the verse-jumping, flawlessly. And I adore the many messages of the movie. My interpretation of the theme was how even if life does seem worthless, and doesn't make any sense, the one thing that we can find sense in is the people close to us, and embracing each other.Overall, my few gripes with the film hold it back from a perfect 10, but it is an amazing film, with fantastic directing from the Daniels, a profound message, and while I didn't mention it, Michelle Yeoh, Key Huy Quan, and Jamie Lee Curtis are all able to deliver subtle nuances in their performances, and I feel like all of them at least deserves a nomination.",

            "content": "Oh, wow, where do I even begin with this movie? When have I ever seen a movie where every single scene surprised me, and almost every scene had some sort of shock factor. 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' is not just a movie; it is a cinematic experience!Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh) owns a Laundromat. She lives with her husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Qua) (who wants to divorce her), her Father, Gong Gong (James Hong) (who is very sick), and her daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu) (who is in a lesbian relationship). On her way to tax inspector Deirdre (Jamie Lee Curtis - like you've never seen her before!), Evelyn's life is about to change. In the blink of an eye, her normal existence spins out of control and she finds herself in an alternate universe, being called upon to save the multiverse.If you thought 'The Matrix' was complex and confusing, just wait until you see 'Everything Everywhere All at Once'. The difference with 'Everything...' lies in its presentation. This film is so incredibly unpredictable and every scene is absolutely magnificent! The stunt choreography is jaw-dropping. The visuals are mind-blowing. The costumes are amazing. The editing is inane!!! Editing this film to obtain the desired effect must have been an absolute nightmare. But it looks STUNNING on screen.As Evelyn jumps through the multiverse - referred to as Verse Jump - she encounters characters out to eliminate her, and in the process she must protect those she loves. The fact she can't trust anyone - not even her own family - makes her task a daunting one, to say the least. The film's antagonist is Jobu Tupaki (who is Joy in another universe), who could destroy the entire multiverse with a black hole she created.There honestly was not a single dull moment here. This film surprised me every step of the way. Never before have I seen a film with so much going on - non-stop - and entertained me every single second. There's some really funny humour here, and then also a dose of slapstick. But the presentation was so astonishing that the slapstick didn't bother me as it generally would. The funniest thing by far, was the fight scene with huge dildos, and the butt plugs!!!! Absolutely hilarious!! The 'talking rocks' scene was just as funny, but also thought-provoking.I'll admit, I didn't understand everything here, but hell, from an entertainment perspective, I was so entertained that it didn't matter. I will no doubt be watching this again several times, and I'm sure it will make more sense with every repeat viewing. I was completely and utterly enthralled by 'Everything Everywhere All at Once'; I was glued to the screen for its entire running time.",

            "content": "There are times when a film can be so unabashedly creative and original that it can be hard to collect your thoughts or even pigeon-hole it into a genre. Sometimes, perhaps with films such as \"Swiss Army Man\" (2016) or \"The Lobster\" (2015), the creative overflow can convolute the tone and diminish the overall impact of the storytelling. However, when filmmakers can strike the perfect balance and deliver something that is a visual spectacle, gut-wrenchingly hilarious, and emotionally impactful, it can be true movie magic. \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" is of the latter and it is one of the best films that I have seen in years.Michelle Yeoh stars as Evelyn Wang who, in a day where her family's laundromat is being audited by the IRS, is sucked into the multiverse where she must work with other versions of herself to save the world. Multiverse narratives seem to be the new hot writing trend in Hollywood and can been seen everywhere from superhero flicks to sci-fi dramas. I think that it will be a real challenge to find one more masterfully created than \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\".The film was written and directed by The Daniels and if sci-fi, comedy, drama isn't the best word to describe the film then how about this: CRAZY. We are talking dildo nunchuck-wielding, Mad Max on crack level of insanity, but, they somehow make it work. The action is beautifully helmed, the editing is perfectly chaotic, and the explosion of creativity is expertly realized. I have never seen a movie like this in my life.Perhaps some of the action relied too much on slow motion and perhaps the first act was slow to start because of exposition but, honestly, the more I try and nitpick the more I realize the choices all serve the tone of the film. The real magic of \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" is not the impressiveness of the Multiverse storytelling, but how it is used to serve the overall theme of the narrative. Family, marriage, maturity, parenthood - these are all themes that have countless films under their umbrella, but none of them are like this. Get out and support this film - it deserves your attention.Grade: A+",

But that's not only that. I found out some days before going to the theatre that the directors are the ones that made \"Swiss Army Man\", a great movie that was able to explore the sense of life in a very original way. At that point I didn't expect to find profound themes in \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\", but I was open to the possibility. And it was the case. Indeed the multiverse is used also to have the possibility to talk about love, family, life, choices and so on. Some moments were truly impactful and moving.

The direction and writing are similarly superb; really there's not a department of this film that isn't working brilliantly, in sync with all the rest.

Letting go or not, and how sometimes expressing love can heal or start the journey towards healing, is shown through breathtaking graphics and beautiful acting! Very rarely a movie makes me this happy and this joyful!",

The writing was excellent, the dialog AND story. The acting was perfect, no one was lacking and no one over acted either. To top it off it was casted perfectly, Jamie Lee Curtis is amazing, it was funny to see her take on a more light hearted role in this film. Michelle Yeoh, what a star, her career is making a come back and this film is proof that she is deserving of it.Great cinematography and film sets. I loved how the film majorly took place in about 6-7 rooms in total but it felt far more than that.Such creative ideas for all the fight sequences and designs. When it comes to the story it starts off making you think it is just another typical storyline, the big bad wants to kill the main character. But it turns Into something far more powerful.9.0/10 from me.",

It was also unnecessarily confusing, too long by about 40 minutes And from what I can figure out quite illogical in its use of multiverse theme. It also didn't help that the hardware they were using to zip around the Multiverse looked like it was from a 1980s science-fiction movie. Some of the fight scenes were cool, but had a lot of unnecessary slapstick comedy thrown in which really doesn't work for me and seemed very out of place. Worth a watch though.",

To go into too much detail about this extremely unusual plot would be unwise; it's best to go in cold and with no expectations. That way, you just might get the full effect.For the most part, it's a fun film to watch, with surprising effects, jumping through different alternate realities coming together into one big plot. This movie keeps you on your toes with surprising ideas and sometimes unwanted or try-too-hard jokes, which can sometimes go too far for the average taste. The film's weirdness is its proud ethos; the mayhem and anarchy are the film's heart and soul. The meandering, unwieldy narrative actually fits in with the unstructured multiverse. But underneath the film's chaos, lack of logic and unapologetic absurdity, lies a twofold wholesome principle: believing in the strength of the mother-child bond and finding the good in every individual, in spite of the world's cruelty and insanity. For all the film's unruliness, there's nothing remotely misanthropic here. Far from being a grim morality tale, it's more along the lines of hard-earned wisdom. Once you understand it in that regard, it's safe to say it will stay with you.Michelle Yeoh as the protagonist Evelyn just crushes it again; she has proven to be one of the most underrated actresses for quite some years now and with an incredibly vast range of acting. In this film, she turns an unremarkable, workaday character into a bona fide superhero whose abilities might have no limit whatsoever. Fair warning: This film will be an endurance test for some, but not without a hilarious and/or philosophical respite here and there. Recommended for everyone who wants to stretch their comfort zone of the familiar way of movies and is up for something truly different and off the beaten path.",

This is the best original film IP, that I have seen or experienced, since the first Matrix film came out in 1999 ( for different reasons of course ). Now it shares a spot in my Top 5 films of all time ( right alonside The Matrix actually ).I can't say the film is for everyone, as I've already seen some saying they \"walked out\" of the film or \"The film sucks\" or \"its overrated\" or \"Its ass\". These people are completely missing the incredible storytelling and social commentary of the film. Its a Multi generational family drama, that is placed inside of a euphoric, wild, insane, action packed, and visually stunning multiverse film.The films deeper story and meaning, touches on real life subject matter and themes such as LGBT, Depression, the curse of comparison, family trauma/relationships, Existentialism, Nihilism, and Asian-American identity. Michelle Yeoh leads an incredible cast of people, who bring this storytelling masterpiece to life.As someone that has been a fan/mark for Michelle Yeoh, since first watching her 1985 martial arts classic \"Yes Madam\", along eith all of her Hong Kong work in the 80s & 90s. This is the magnum opus performance of her career and that is saying alot! It would be the stunning robbery of the year, if she's not walking home with an Academy Award for Best Actress.All in All this is all time great cinematic film, that deals with alot of real life subject matter and delivers one of the most insane and emotional trips in decades ( and for sure should win Best Picture ).

The moment you think you know where the movie is headed is exactly when the makers will pull the rug out from under you, creating so much hysteria and mayhem that you are rendered as confused as the protagonists on screen.We follow superstar Michelle Yeoh, who seems to be a bored laundromat owner called up by the IRS for a tax audit, only to have her world turned upside down when she encounters a mysterious, multiversal version of her husband who asks her to join him on a journey down a rabbit hole of epic proportions. Tasked with taking down a seemingly megalomaniacal villain named \"Jobu Tapaki\", Yeoh's character traverses the many universes using a technique called verse-jumping, rendered immensely believable and enjoyable by the cutting-edge CGI and visual effects employed by the makers.The immensely relatable Ke Huy Quan is terrific as Yeoh's ever suffering husband while Stephanie Hsu is a revelation as her troubled daughter, who constantly disappoints her mother despite her best efforts. Yeoh's world renowned martial arts skills and prowess as a decorated character actress are harnessed with equal aplomb by directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert to tell a core story of the lengths a mother will go for her daughter, albeit with multiversal consequences at stake.\"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" is an absolutely mental sci-fi adventure that blends comedy, fantasy and heart to serve up an immensely entertaining mashup that achieves the multiversal aspirations which \"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\" set out to accomplish and failed. Michelle Yeoh makes a triumphant return to a mainstream role, with a performance for the ages. Highly, highly recommended!",

The storyline lacked coherence and meaning, making it difficult for me to follow along.The long running time also didn't help matters, as it made the experience even more tedious. What was particularly frustrating was the awkward explanation of the filmmakers' intent, which only added to the confusion. I couldn't help but feel that the movie was trying to be too pretentious and showy.Another issue I had with the movie was the characters. I found them to be annoying and uninteresting, which made it even harder for me to engage with the story. The ending was sentimental and, in my opinion, a way to forget the painful experience of watching the movie. It felt like the filmmakers were trying to wrap things up quickly and make the audience forget the confusing and lackluster journey they had just gone through.Overall, my experience with this movie was negative.

The comedy in this film is bonkers and so weird & I loved it, reminiscent of those Stephen Chow's legendary Hong Kong films. The action brings back the flavor of Chinese KungFu movies, so well choreographed. So many philosophies are discussed, the multiverse becomes a reflection of a human's unfulfilled hopes & dreams & possibilities. It dwells on nihilism, absurdism & depression. And all these are bound by strong emotional familial ties and superb performances. Ke Huy Quan is the heart of this film, playing a goofball husband who always disappoints his wife.

Being an A24 film is what initially intrigued me about this film bc other than SLICE and The Blackcoats Daughter, I've really enjoyed this film company's films. It's title is BEYOND appropriate because it encompasses soo much. This must've been an actors' dream job: showing so much range and wearing soo many different costumes. Yeoh is outrageously great, Hollywood should've put her in more varied roles previously. The humor could come off as juvenile at times (I'm personally not into anal play) and as others have said, the 3rd act is slightly long winded, but if you're open minded you definitely check this out!",

But as it is so overhyped and overrated, I kind of start to hate it.But to not waste a lot more time on this nonsense, I will just point out the main reasons why the movie failed for me.1.) The movie failed to establish an emotional connection between the viewer and what is happening on the screen i. E. in the movie. One of the reasons for that being: the movie was driven by nonsense. Whenever the main characters are stuck in a situation, the have to perform some nonensical bullcrap, so that they can crazy-deus-ex-machina their way out of the situation. Again and again and again and again and again.2.) The other reason for the failed emotional connection is that there were no sympathetic characters given to connect with. Everyone is just a self-absorbed a-hole or douchebag. What they are fighting for is a chaotic piled up mess (because they are unable to fix anything and to improve, so they prefer having a meanignless mess to having nothing).So, my main problem was: I just didn't care for anything happening in the movie.If you think that it is a profound philosophical question to ask how your life would be if you would have sausages for fingers (just to give you an example), this may be a movie you. But if you think that such a question is just stupid and stopped being funny since you turned 8 years old, maybe you should avoid spending timeor money on this movie.But there are some few reddeming qualities of this movie, hence I did give it 3/10.Which are:\nThe cinematography isn't bad.It doesn't look like a trash movie production-value-wise.Some of the acting wasn't too bad, if you can look past the garbage mess the actors had to work with.It has some funny moments, if you can take the nonsense and the stupidity.But again, at the end of the day, I didn't care for the pile of nonsense that the movie is.",

            "content": "This film intrigued me as soon as the trailer for it came out in December 2021. I was curious how they were going to handle their own multiverse concept. And the fact that the film was actually produced by MCU's Russo Brothers made me even more curious. And now having watched the film, I can understand why this film was produced by them.For an A24 produced film, this film actually feels more like a blockbuster film rather than an indie film. The plot was fast-paced, the action choreography shames even most of the other recent summer blockbuster films, and the vfx were well done. Hard to actually believe that the budget spent was only in the region of $14 million. But I guess it makes sense when you look at the small number of cast, which was integrated nicely into the story. And also why it's currently A24's highest grossing film ever.They didn't even waste any time in moving the plotline. For a film this long, it's actually refreshing (in a way) that a film uses all its allocated time without lingering too much on anything. The film's plot is also quite easy to follow, even though the concept is supposed to be complicated. I was not confused once while I watched the film.I love all the homages they managed to place in the film. From the action choreography scenes (which was surely inspired by Jackie Chan's films and old kung-fu films, probably even Michelle Yeoh's own Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) to romantic scenes that is obviously a nod to Wong Kar Wai's films like In the Mood for Love, for instance. It is definitely a love letter to the Hong Kong film industry.I guess if there's a weakness in the film, is that for a film with a multiverse concept, it's actually quite simple and shallow. I mean, I'm not saying it is shallow. But it isn't as complicated as, say, Predestination. The message is powerful, sure. But it's the usual feel good message you see in almost every film. It kind of makes the film feel a bit lame.But that doesn't take away the fact that this film is a good film. In fact, this is a great film. It's a joy to watch from start to finish. And it will make you experience a ton of emotions throughout the film, albeit a little brief. This film has a pretty high mass appeal. It is the most accessible for anyone who hasn't seen an A24 film. A jumping pad, if you will *wink wink (if you excuse my pun).",

While the acting awards seemed justified since the acting was good, I have very strong reservations about the best picture bit. The movie described in Wikipedia as an \"absurdist science fiction comedy drama\" is extremely difficult to sit through and a torturous watch for most of the time. It can be described as inane, bizarre, aweful, nonsensical, chaotic, crazy, strange, trite, mind numbing, cringe worthy and basically an assault on the senses which drains you physically and mentally. After the first 40 minutes starts the madness which gets worse with time. The fights, the VFX, the fast paced martial arts, the high decibel music are okay for some time but it gets excruciating if one has to sit through for 2 hour 19 minutes of runtime. I was disappointed big time. The background of a parallel universe with virtual reality didn't help to make things interesting and made it look strange.

That trope is old and overused. & rlly, this movie is as deep as elmo's voice.I walked into this film purely because of the high ratings and had no expectations. It was not it. If you think randomness equates to funny and liked Pulp Fiction then maybe you'll like this film. As for the plot, this felt like the adult and more chaotic version of \"Turning Red,\" it's the same general message about the mother daughter relationship.

A touch of the Disney idiocy that infects and ruins an awful lot of modern cinema.And yes it tries too hard and tries to push too many things into a too small container and goes on too long. But unlike almost all modern cinema it actually tries to push the boundaries . And succeeds in many places and many different ways.And you simply cannot miss it. Miss Yeoh is truly spectacular. A depressed and anxious middle aged owner of a failing laundromat with a husband who wants a divorce and a daughter who seems to hate her, harried by the IRS in the person of Jamie Lee Curtis (worth the price of admission all alone), she finds that she exists in a parallel universe where she is the glamorous, rich, uber successful Kung Foo goddess Michele Yeoh. And exists also, somehow, in many, many other universes as many of the paths not taken in her life.And it is hysterical in parts. In fact it is so good so often that one is forced to think the family values jam larded over much of it was forced upon the directors by the studio or the backers.",

So, no respite or opportunity to regroup. It just keeps jerking you around without mercy. I was able to stay with it for about thirty minutes, then I had to just turn it off.

In an impressive act of creativity and filming techniques from a limited crew, Everything Everywhere All at Once features an incredible myriad of visual ideas and alternate characters that all serve common themes. Near the beginning, the execution was nearly flawless - we get to know Evelyn and her daughter Joy, there is a palpable sense of mystery and creative fight scenes bring in the multiverse concept. Later on, however, the film gets bogged down with too many sides to each fight, very slow pacing and weaving too many thematic threads back together. One theme is intergenerational acceptance, which has been common in recent films like Encanto and Turning Red. Another is battling nihilism by choosing to love specific individuals, much like the rose in The Little Prince. Others include enjoying the surrealism of the universe, being comfortable with our choices and exploring the opportunities in front of us. By the end, the bagel that is Everything Everywhere All at Once has become overloaded.",

The film is very powerful and impactful. After watching, you want to sit down and think again, what if nothing really matters in the end? But it is very good that the end of the film answers this question, that everything matters and any change affects the fate of people in different universes, but the most important thing is that there is love and joy in everyday life that is worth living for.The film evokes a lot of emotions and makes you think about it a lot. Watching the whole movie is like feeling all the emotions - from laughter to tears, but those moments that make you cry are very effective. For example, Evelyn tells her daughter, \"Maybe it's like you said. Maybe there is something out there, some new discovery that will make us feel even smaller. Something that explains why you still went looking for me through all of this noise and why no matter what, I still want to be here with you. I will always, always, want to be here with you.\" Joy tells, \"Here, all we get are a few specks of time where any of this actually makes any sense.\" But Evelyn refuses to let go of her daughter and says, \"Then I will cherish these few specks of time.\" And it was after this moment that I couldn't stop crying.Actually, a lot can be written about this movie, but no words will describe it, because it is not only a movie, but it is like an experience that will remain in the memory for a very long time. So if you haven't seen this film yet and are wondering if it's worth watching, trust me, it's worth every minute you spend watching it.",

I could tell immediately how smart and clever it was going to be, however I didn't expect the amount of laughs I got.The film is long at around 2 hours and 20 minutes and it can get a little overwhelming if you switch off even for a moment.

The pressure becomes so paramount Yeoh is visited by another Kuan from another universe who explains her heightened state may fracture time & space as she knows it. Fighting both physically & emotionally to keep it together soon runs the gamut of the film's run time (a bit too long for my taste but my viewing partner loved it) as the inventive directors, the Daniels (Swiss Army Man), throw everything & the kitchen sink at the screen (love the parody of Wong Kar Wei films) to bring this phantasmagoria to existence w/all the actors game for the lunacy (especially Kuan who pretty much retired from acting but came back for this) w/a nice showcase for Yeoh who steps up to the challenge to steer a picture by herself.

            "content": "Everything Everywhere All At Once perfectly manages to tell a multiverse story, juggling MANY different genres, from sci-fi, martial arts, black comedy, action and family drama without losing their tone or direction. It somehow manages to tell a realistic and relatable story about family without becoming bogged down by world building when creating its version of the multiverse.Speaking of the Quan family, the film does a wonderful job giving an accurate and all-too-relatable representation of Asian family life in North America. The way Evelyn constantly nags Joy about being \"too fat\", having tattoos, being rebellious and having a white partner is relatable for any Asian kid growing up in North America. All of Evelyn's disappointments in Joy eventually led to her becoming depressed, hence creating the bagel. Hollywood has a long track record of Asian misrepresentation, so to see the struggles of an Asian American family being accurately portrayed on screen is so refreshing to me.Along with the realistic and relatable Asian representation, there are some heavy themes revolving around depression, existentialism and nihilism. Just look at how the Everything Bagel is treated; it is a multiversal black hole because Joy pretty much had a psychotic break in one universe and came to believe that nothing truly matters in life. I personally saw this as an allegory for depression as everything about Joy's personality was placed on this Bagel and could never find the good in it, eventually leading to her to enter the black hole as a way to find peace and stop agonizing over a meaningless life.These are without a doubt some of the best performances of 2022 so far. Michelle Yeoh was extremely convincing as a woman who's basically always in crisis mode, dealing with her family and business trying to get through an audit. But the true star of the show, is Ke Huy Quan, which is apparently his first movie role in almost 20 years. He is a simple man who is quite happy with his life and is very personable, choosing kindness in the face of negativity and puts everyone else before himself.Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of the most original films of 2022, delving into family dynamics, mental health, existence, and presenting realistic Asian representation for mainstream audiences. An epic and very personal story with excellent acting, gorgeous cinematography and inventive editing created a movie going experience I have never had before.

            "content": "It's safe to say that \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" is a film that fires on all cylinders. It blends together elements of Kung fu cinema and postmodernism in the same vein as \"The Matrix\" except this film focuses on concepts of the multiverse. Not only is this a great action film but it's one of the funniest films I've seen this year.Michelle Yeoh, a veteran actress in martial arts cinema, plays a housewife whose estranged relationship with her daughter forms a rivalry across the multiverse which causes everything to fall into chaos. Interestingly enough, the mother-daughter relationship is thematically similar to Pixar's \"Turning Red\" except the plot is reversed. However, in spite of the film's incredibly bizarre plot, the storytelling is done exceedingly well. The film manages to be very emotional despite being surrealistic and hilariously over-the-top which makes this one of the most unique movies of 2022 and perhaps a candidate for best film of 2022. Veteran stars Jamie Lee Curtis and James Hong also make a return as a supporting cast in the film. Jamie Lee Curtis plays one of her best roles yet, an antagonist who's genuinely frightening and hilarious at the same time which matches the tone of rest of the film. James Hong, now 93 years old and still active in Hollywood, continues to deliver a great performance as the aging father of Michelle Yeoh's character who cares deeply for his family yet feels conflicted over his daughter and granddaughter's choices which clash with family tradition.Overall, the film is a story about a clash of generations which is executed surrealistically and in a way that can be described as a perfect mish-mash of Kung fu action and postmodernist cinema.",

Her elderly father keeps criticizing her, she fails to show any affection to her delicate husband who wants to divorce her, her daughter feels misunderstood regarding her sexual identity and her poorly aged business is facing bankruptcy. Just as everything seems to be falling apart, Evelyn Wang gets the opportunity to experience different scenarios based upon important life choices she has made. The elderly woman experiences her career as a famous actress, as a martial artist or a lesbian with deformed fingers. However, all these alternative realities are menaced by the anger, deception and despair of her daughter. Evelyn Wang must find a way to connect with her daughter in order to find her way back to reality and solve her numerous problems.On the positive side, this movie convinces with creative, fluid and unexpected storytelling. The different realities are colourful, exotic and funny. The movie comes around with multiple surprises out of left field that will keep the audience watching until the very end. The acting performances keep the movie together as especially the veteran actresses and actors convincingly play characters with depth, heart and soul.On the negative side, the film's storytelling can at times be overwhelming and needs a lot of acceptance, focus and patience to be enjoyed to the fullest. The story itself is walking on thin ice and filled with quite a few stereotypes hidden by the bubbly characters and alternative realities.At the end of the day, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a movie that will divide the masses. Some might call it pretentious nonsense offered at a headache-inducing speed while others will praise its unconventional storytelling and unique characters. No matter where you stand on the issue, one thing is undeniable: this movie is unlike any other you have ever watched and therefore worth everyone's attention.

A simplistic sandwich with unorganized space in between propels us into all the emotions the human body can comprehend.You could sit a million people down and have them watch this movie and you'd get a million and one different perspectives and outcomes from this richly symbolistic experience.I find it quite interesting that it starts with a young girl who deeply feels pain from her mothers lack of acceptance and comprehension of who she actually is. Her deep pain catapults into a whirlwind that sends her mother on a quest to understand her whilst uncovering her own pain within her soul.A canvas of possibilities left me feeling healed, heard and seen with my own life path. For our realities are but a moment that seeps into the continuum of time, whisping by if we float along. I learned these things from such a journey...\n1. Do not for a moment believe you are unloved or alone. There is always someone out there who cares, and sometimes that person may be you looking from a different light.2. Generational approval and love is deeply rooted within our emotional human genome. It drives us incessantly in every direction, all at once, even if we may mock our desire for such approval. Think about how you treat those you are closest to, for one small act can change a heart that perceives it's sinking\n3. All decisions and thoughts build us into who we are. You are in control of your life. Not in every aspect of our lives but the richness that can be uncovered within, for we are the ones who can control how we act when the world around us moves. It is the human races super power to do so and it's a beautiful thing.4. The fragility of life teeters on everything literally all at once, all it takes to move in one direction or another is choice. And that choice is yours wholly. Make it count but if you feel you have failed, get back up and try again... and again... and again until you have fulfilled your rightful purpose here in existence.5. Do not for one second believe that your efforts are without. You are the one who depicts the outcome, even if it may take a lifetime to unfold. The mothers' efforts were not without. Your efforts are not without and never will be, it just may be that time needs to be fed for the flowers to blossom. Do not lose hope, for that is not a life worth trudging through. Hope is found in all walks of life and in all experiences. Believe in yourself and believe that hope is possible at every turn.A poetic way of showcasing the chaos found within the human experience is simple, unexpected, humorous and beautiful. Life keeps moving past until we are the ones that change its course. That is the secret ingredient for life, making decisions for ourselves to make life richer than before. For we are the masters of this so called world, it's just waiting for us to comprehend the power we have within our being.Absolutely beautiful. Absolutely honest. And absolutely real when we feel everything everywhere all at once.",

            "content": "Everything, Everywhere, All at Once is a very deep film that touches your heart. It keeps the audience hooked from beginning to end. However, many will argue with me and disagree but I really don't get the hype over it. I see the film as a very normal film with a typical story, nothing special or new at all. The film has great humor, not going to lie when I say that I was laughing the whole time. A great sense of humor in a great time and in a good decent amount. Not too much but too little at this time, there is a great balance. There weren't any great shots, a film like that can easily be visually stunning as the director had a huge chance to allow some great shots but nothing was there. In addition, the runtime might seem a little bit too long, especially towards the end. I started to struggle during the last act because my attention span was expired.The film has a great plot and the writing is so well done and balanced very well. The script is solid and put together in a way that is hilarious due to the creative ideas the film had in which the things that were included won't come up to any writer's mind. The film discusses the idea of the multiverse in a way that will never be discussed in any other film or tv show which is why it's a unique film. Audience members get to witness a long, funny, and great journey with the characters as they will stay hooked and will want more due to how amazing the story is.A great acting performance from Michelle Yeoh as she plays the struggling mother. She was able to show that struggle in her body language, voice tone, and facial expressions. As well as Ke Huy Quan with his transition from one character to another (I'm not going to dive much into the two different characters that he plays to avoid spoilers). But, his shift from one character to another reminded me of Oscar Isaac's great performance whenever he shifts from Marc Spector to Steven Grant in MoonKnight (2022 - ).In conclusion, I was, unfortunately, a little bit disappointed as I saw the high ratings. But, when I watched the film, I kept waiting and waiting for something special to happen but I realized there was nothing. The film didn't touch me at all and I didn't feel empathy toward the characters or the story. I wasn't feeling the way that the writers wanted me to feel and the same way that else felt while watching it.Perhaps this film needs a second watch (at least for me). It needs to be given another chance as some might get lost in terms of keeping on track with the story or the concept of the film as it explains some heavy stuff in a way that might feel like a fast pace for some.My rating is 8/10\nWatched in the theatre.",

I understand what it is trying to express, and I have no problem following the story (if you call it that) throughout the plot. BUT, the story is no doubt weird, and at times, unnecessarily gross and slightly disturbing. I just think the philosophical questions that the movie is trying to explore can be done in a MUCH more relevant way (like, fighting with dildo's? Making universe jumps by poking your own ass? .... really?) ... you wonder how sober the script writer was.And when i watched the movie, I couldn't help checking my watch cause the movie felt slow and boring, and I noticed quite a lot of people left the theater half-way through too. In hindsight, I should have too, now that's 2 hours I can never get back in my life.",

            "content": "Greetings And Salutations, and welcome to my review of Everything Everywhere All At Once; here's the breakdown of my ratings:Story: 1.50\nDirection: 1.75\nPace: 1.75\nActing: 1.25\nEnjoyment: 1.25TOTAL: 7.75 out of 10.00.Here's the thing, this film isn't that brilliant. However, what's clever is how the writers and directors wrap up a simple moral premise within an outrageous and semi-entertaining narrative and movie. They then smack you around the head with two iron bars that hold the virtuosity inscribed upon them; just to drive it into your noggins.The moral - Open Up And Fly: open your ears; open your eyes; open your hearts; open your mind; But, most of all, open your mouths and talk to one another, especially your loved ones. This process is your standard fundamental enlightenment, which many of us stupid humans fail at, myself included.Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert wrap up this nugget of comprehension in the tale of a dysfunctional family living in America. The mother, Evelyn Wang, is teetering on the brink of a breakdown. She's overworked and overrun by everything in her life. Her sick and dying father has moved into their small apartment. He's an old-fashioned Chinese who always wanted a male heir; a daughter was never good enough. She's unsure of her feelings towards her husband, Waymond; he's changed over the years and is no longer the man she married. Her daughter, Joy appears to be stuck in the teenage angst years, moping about all day and pouting. Even though she's not unhappy about her daughter's sexual preferences, she can't bring herself to tell her old-fashioned father that his granddaughter is homosexual. And then the intimidating, iniquitous IRS decides it's an ideal time for an audit. So things are looking as bleak as they ever could be for poor, ageing Evelyn. And they're not going to get any brighter. Evidently, before enlightenment shines, you need to stand on the verge of, and stare into, the abyss of the obsidian bagel of everything everywhere all at once. To get Evelyn to this moment of realisation and change, the writers bring in a multiverse of other Evelyns and her family members. They brought each of these Evelyns into life by using her choices. For example, in one universe, she ignores her father when he tells her not to run so fast and ends up falling, head and eyes first, onto broken chopsticks, leaving her blind. In another, she chooses not to elope with Waymond, remaining at home with her parents, she becomes a top martial artist and finds fortune and fame in the Chinese movie industry. It's one of these other multiverse hubbies that tack this \"Worst Life Ever\" Evelyn down, hoping she can halt the disruption Jobu Topaki is wreaking across the multiverse. This initial meeting is the start of Evelyn's great-awakening journey. The two Dan's do a superb job of multiverse building, and though some of them are super-silly, you never feel confused about what is happening in the story. Another bonus is the strong character-building they achieve. Everyone in the tale feels real. Moreover, they come across as believable. I knew this when I began to get the niggling feeling that Joy and Jobu needed a good smack to set them straight in their miss-thinking ways. Getting me to feel this shows the strength of their creations. Well Done, Dan and Dan. However, it's not all light and joy for the double D's. They have a failing - Comedy. There are moments when it works and many when it doesn't. It comes down to one reason, puerility. The story is strong and mature, yet sadly, the buffoonery is adolescent toilet humour and pretty unfunny, neigh, I'll say cringe-worthy. Worst yet, it spoils all the fine work they'd done before and after. I'm talking about the buttplug power to fight better and the dildo slap of death. Both of these could have been funnier if handled better. One element this film displays is America's terrible at double entendres; or that Jamie Lee Curtis's comedic timing and punch are woefully lacking. But I'll put it firmly at the feet of the Double D's as they wrote the truly unamusing and lame \"hotdogs as fingers\" sketch.That aside, they are entirely different animals behind the lens. And this juxtaposition makes the movie more entertaining and powerful. The two Dans dare to try both simple and tricky camera antics to intensify the viewers' excitement and hold their attention. The fight scenes are beautifully blended. They take the cutting to the next level as they utilise everything. What I admired most is how many fights had pauses dotted throughout them. Making them rollercoaster rides within the major coaster ride of the story. Jackie Chan used this feature a lot in his combat sequences. It allowed the director to add in extra human touches, like running out of breath, feeling pain, etc, which also added humour, before the incredibly breathtaking punches and kicks flew again. The Dans employ them to display a character's thoughts and realisation and multiverse flashes. In fact, the only place they stumble is with the puerile humour. For me, it's shot too crisply and cleanly, which diminished its power to make me giggle.I've always been a fan of Michelle Yeoh, right from her early days when she starred alongside Jackie Chan in Twinkle Twinkle Lucky Stars. And though that movie had some cheesy moments, her performances never stunk. And neither does her portrayal of Evelyn. Everything Everywhere All At Once shows what a dynamite powerhouse she's become. But this movie wouldn't be so enjoyable if we didn't have Ke Huy Quan as Waymond. Quan superbly shifts from cuckold wimp to kick-arse hero mode flawlessly. If he'd been unable to sell the credibility of either character and the transition between them, the film would've bombed, and fast. And I can never say a bad word about the excellent James Hong. He's another stalwart actor who's seldom given a poor performance. The cast would've been perfect had Stephanie Hsu given her character more oomph. Even as Jobu, when she's all peacocked up, she's drab and dull. This fault may stem from the Double D's idea of her characters. However, more personality wouldn't have gone amiss. She's so tediously bland that she's nearly nonexistent - Jobu! The worst villain ever.Remove the horrid humour, and you have an engaging and entertaining moralistic story and film. As such, I'd highly recommend it to both Martial Arts fans and Sci-Fi nuts. I'll be returning to it soon, though it'll just be to watch Michelle Yeoh kick arse. Just remember the moral and open up, speak out, but do it respectfully.Now you've finished watching this self-help picture for the Department of Mental Health, sit down, take a deep breath, and please read my IMDb lists - Holding Out For A Hero, The Final Frontier, and Just For Laughs to see where I rated Everything Everywhere All At Once.Take Care & Stay Well.",

This movie has a plot and action sequences rivaling the biggest budget marvel films and some of the most creative fight sequences ever imagined. The plot and its subsequent action sequences and dialogue is so inspired and endlessly inventive. The filmmakers took the idea of a \"multiverse\" and used it to craft one of the most entertaining (and hilarious) stories to ever grace the big screen.Everywhere you look, this film is thoughtfully written with profound human experiences, deep, relatable characters and strong moving moments. Throughout the flashes of multiverse madness we are shown such a gripping and powerful story about family and relationships that is so brilliantly acted by a cast that is able to jump from one beat to another, broadcasting a spectrum of colorful emotions all while soaring through character arcs so wrought with emotion you may even find yourself tearing up.All at once, this movie is profound. This movie is as deep and intelligent as it is bonkers and emotional. The centrifugal force pulling all of this together is the movie's philosophy. This is one of existential meaning; touching upon the surface of our daily interactions, all the way to our complex personal relationships, and even deeper down to our universal purpose and the meaning of every one of our actions. This movie is as much a dissertation of philosophy as it is anything else. There are so many movies and shows exploring the idea of \"the multiverse\" but by far this is the most critical and complex to date. It uses this theme to dive straight into a theory of everything, exploring the age old of why we are here.I can't recommend this movie enough. It's so richly inspired and so delightfully fun, moving and thought provoking. This movie is Everything, Everywhere, All at Once.",

The script has the mention-then-use rule. Inadmissible deductions in the audit foresee her alternate realities.

It can be hard to demote a film to \"second favourite,\" especially if it's held the #1 spot for some time, but every so often you see something that challenges for that title. I seriously doubt that I'm the only one who has found a new favourite movie after this experience.I do very much mean experience, too. EEAAO will have you laughing, crying, and laughing again on repeat for more than two hours. Every genre imaginable fits perfectly and purposefully into the film, and you never feel like the plot has left you behind. The story pulled me through from start to finish as light speed and left me feeling a mix of sonder and joy.As a clear early front runner for next year's Best Picture (sorry, Dune 2), this movie will make you feel something, everything, everywhere, all at once. Go with a friend, go by yourself, go as many times as you damn well please because nothing matters. Just see this movie.",

            "content": "Everything Everywhere All at Once literally places everything everywhere all at once. As a result, it's just a big, dizzy and prolonged adventure-comedy with lots of humour, touching morals and imaginative messes. There's also frequent changes between spoken languages that can be slippery to catch up with and it would've been best at a runtime of under 2 hours, but 110 minutes or more would do the trick. So like most people would highly disagree on and be able to make fair points that overshadow the not-so-great things in the film, it's a bit of an overrated movie, but is it worth watching?If you have plenty of free time on your hands, Everything Everywhere All at Once is an action-adventure-comedy loaded with plenty of imaginative sci-fi stuff written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert. Their film is very trippy, original and completely weird, which is the entire point. It centres on an interesting but aging Chinese woman who happens to be an unlikely hero as she must fight the creative dangers of the multiverse to save the world. Give it a shot, because it's either something you'll love or hate, and you can usually tell the pacing at the halfway point.This movie presents a ton of extremely weird, utterly strange and very trippy visuals and effects during the main character's insane adventure. And it's really just an adventure film, although there's frequent moments that are brutally hilarious, like the hot dog fingers and the other crazy stuff. Thankfully, the story is original and that makes sure to entertain you. But to look at the touching elements, this movie does shed light on some parent-child issues and leaves very nicely. Watch this film is you are looking for a bizarrely weird adventure-comedy, but it's just overhyped.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

Beautifully paced with brilliant acting from the whole cast who clearly love the concept and the characters and it all forms into this beautiful unique film. There's a lot of love and heart behind it and there is weight to every action. Try and go in knowing as little as possible and allow the universe(s) of the film to envelop you. I hope Michelle Yeoh gets all the exclaim she rightfully deserves after all these years in the industry and Stephanie Hsu shines on the screen getting the opportunity to bring a lot to her performance. Ke Huy Quan and Jamie lee Curtis give so much love and excitement to their performances as well. Everyone is at their best in this film the actors, the directors, costumes, and the score by Son lux (with a great song featuring mitski and David Byrne) brings a lot of dynamic energy to the film. Everyone was truly giving it their all for this film and clearly held a lot of love for it when they made it. I look forward to seeing it again. In a sea of familiar obvious ideas this film stands out as a island of its own.",

Frank Baume's The Wizard of Oz .There's the same zany We're All Mad crazy characters in Alice even a drink me eat me scene the Sci Fi film noir worlds of The Matrix and the No Place Like Home journeys end of Oz.Which brings me to mention the humour in this movie featuring Pythonesque comedy fun with raccoons ,butt plugs, hot dog hands ,and pelting pooches and pet rocks.The producers wanted to keep the plot to this film under wraps before release earlier this year so the description just read a woman tries to do her taxes.The woman is Evelyn Wang played by the wonderful International star Michelle Yeoh . This film even features her red carpet glamorous catwalk scene in one of her other famous films Crazy Rich Asians when Evelyn experiences what fame can bring in another life choice.Evelyn Wang is stressed to her limits with her laundromat under audit , her daughter Joy's lifestyle choice a problematic marriage to husband Waymond played by Ke Huy Quan her family woes also include her elderly demanding father Gong Gong played by Veteran actor James Hong.Most of action of the first part titled Everything of this unique Fantasy Sci-Fi Comedy of the Absurd takes place in the Office of the Internal Revenue with Evelyn's stress increasing by the second as IRS Inspector Deirdre Beaubeirdre interrogates her . Deidre the IRS Inspector is played by the wonderful Jamie Lee Curtis in her greatest comedy role since her 1988 role in A Fish Called Wanda.No spoilers from now on\npart 2 Everywhere takes us and our heroine Evelyn on a journey to an alternate universe to explore what her life may have been like .This is a world where even her daughter is an alternate character Jobu Tupaki and her enemy also played by Stephanie Hsu giving a superb performance in this dual role .I advise even if you don't like the frenetic first hour of this trip stay with this movie it's worth it. You wouldn't get off a train half way if you knew you were on your way to a beautiful destination would you?Part 3 All at Once is a beautiful and emotional journeys end.I'm so pleased the Daniels replaced the choice of Jackie Chan as the lead to Michelle Yeoh as I think a woman with family and life stresses has a vulnerability that a male character would have lacked.I was very interested to read that the writers directors Daniel Scheinart and Daniel Kwan originally intended for Evelyn to have undiagnosed ADHD.Daniel Kwan researched the condition and discovered that he himself had undiagnosed ADHD.I really loved this movie as it has a strong message for me about the world we live in today where the pursuit of excellence and high achievement seem to have left the battlers and ordinary achievers behind making many doubt themselves and the life choices they've made in other words it's ok to fail we can always have another try . Kindness and empathy for each other are better qualities than prestige and power.I can't wait to see it again hopefully on a Cinema Screen.",

It's a film that I'll need to re watch.It's also one of those film that required a lot of thought to think up and just as much work, if not more, to pull it off. Whilst it probably won't click for everybody, some parts are really over the top, it's worth experiencing at some point especially if you are looking for an action/sci-fi film outside of the MCU and DCEU.

I was asking myself that question over and over as EEAaO kept astonishing me with inspired whimsy and outlandish sequences. So, what are the cinematic problems with EEAaO? First, the opening drags and drags. I know there's a goodly amount of setup / intro needed but there's actually too much setup for what's to come and the pace is glacial. This contrasts with many later moments of sublime stillness in the middle of manic action that make perfect sense for overall pacing. Second, there's a Disney-sized dollop of sentimentality and sui generis La Familia a la Chinoise that hits you over the head, particularly later on and it's 100% telegraphed. That said, the movie has jaw-dropping moments of cinematic bluster and choreography. If Michele Yeoh doesn't get an Academy nod for best actress there truly is no justice. So, if you like over-the-top movie moments and can tolerate the underlying family-centric group therapy session thrust upon you, get ready for an amazing ride.",

It was the score in that scene that actually put it over the top for me.That's a good transition. \"Over the top\" is the best way to describe the 3 missing stars. It tried to take itself way too seriously at some points for something so zany overall. In my opinion if the heartfelt scenes and the moral messages could have been less heavy handed, I think it would have had a better impact.I hate to say I found myself bored at times and the run time could have been shortened.

That clutter defines the film for me, while the two-fold adjacent universe of life/work offers a simple hint of adjoining \"universes\" to be explored through-out the long, but enjoyable movie.My 19 year old boys loved the film, I appreciate how it flirted with philosophies, before finding a pretty safe space in humanism. Although the existential rock by rock shots had an extra appeal for me. Wong-Kar Wei fans will be happy here, and while my kids might not want to hear it, this film stretches quantum and cinematic strings to connect to the superhero genre and MCU.You want CGI and choreographed fight scenes, you got 'em. Jokes are very carefully thrown and land gently. The use of a surreal gesture for escape velocity in channeling between universes might have been a bit overused. Perhaps the filmmakers subscribe to ultimately to the Cosmic Joke.The universe(s) here are big, and beyond those for me the film tries to do too much, for too many people. Both my kids and myself really enjoyed the director's previous foray, where they were mostly confined to an island grotto. Yet there was still plenty of room for the outlandish in that smaller but purposeful \"Switchblade\" of a film.The notion of a metaverse seems to be ramping up more and more these days in various forms, whether to feed a supernatural hunger for teens weaned off religion, or offer some sense of justice that too often feels pay-walled off for those imprisoned here in the lower quanta of society. I feel an agnostic reaction welling up inside me.Probably overthinking it, but the film does invite such overthinking...even if it serves best as a giant mental rollercoaster, and you wind up exactly where you started.",

            "content": "Asian Canadian here. I heard lots of good things about this movie from my friends and decided to give it a shot and even took my parents to see it. I must say my parents and I all came out of the theatre utterly disappointed. The movie does not live up to the hype by any means. This is yet another movie conveying little depth while perpetuating archaic, hackneyed Asian-American stereotypes. Not all of us live in Chinatown, work at Chinese restaurants or own laundromats. It's time we move on from these stereotypes already.The cinematography is absolute chaos. The plot is a drawn out drivel filled with predictable, schmaltzy dialogues and trite themes. The director might think he is putting on some splendid display of avant-garde post-modern artistic ingenuity, when in reality, what I see as a spectator is a big ball of spaghetti mess that is lacking in both creativity and sentimental depth. There were too many moments that were unoriginal, unfunny, and downright cringeworthy. The whole \"love saves all\" theme was delivered in the most cliche way possible. Not only so, the movie was fallacious on many levels. Just because Joy is a lesbian doesn't mean she needs to adopt a nihilistic view toward life - those two things are completely unrelated and the movie didn't draw a logical connection between the two. The movie may have turned out to be better if they had focused less on all the silly and childish zombie fight scenes and more on exploring Evelyn's alternate realities and how things might have unravelled differently for her.The only scene I really liked was the rock scene. I thought that was quite clever.I should have just gone to see Top Gun next door instead. There are far better films in this world, you do not need to see Everything Everywhere All At Once unless you want to waste 2h+ of your life. If this is what people deem to be a masterpiece, then I weep for modern cinema - we are at a cultural dead-end.",

Or any Mockbuster movies thats a low budget version of a big name production movie ?This Movie was kinda confusing here and there but when you reach the end it kinda hit me that this movie can be a metaphor for multiple things related too Real Life and a very good one. It was well directed with amazing Marvel movies style CGI quality and great acting with some nice fight scenes.

Shooting on Panavision I think was a smart choice specifically for the colors the sensors provide. An interesting and really good choice was the DP switching between anamorphic and spherical glass to differentiate universes. Very subtle, but had a huge impact on the visual story. The lighting was alright. There was the one cool effect that was achieved by triangulating Astera's Titan Tubes which gave quick-moving light that keyed different parts of the face. Other than that, I thought while stylistic, the lighting lacked originality. Besides the Triangulation of the Titan Tubes...that was cool, and definitely a striking catch-light in the reflections in the eye. I liked the use of soft lighting mixed with hard back lighting. It made the fight scenes pop and feel \"marvel-esc\" out of nowhere. Overall, great work by not only Larkin Seiple, but the entire G&E and PD.",

But this one worked brilliantly. It was the mix of dark humor and the film not taking itself too seriously in some dimensions(....) but taking it seriously in the right ones. Its a fantastic screenplay and one that will be hard to beat this year for sure. Seriously I dont know on what substances the writers were but it was the right mixture.The acting was outstanding as well. Michelle Yeoh has never been better and for a veteran actress like her that says a lot. I really hope she gets her dues this year. A great discovery was Stephanie Hse, who surely will go her way after this film. A great supporting performance that is memorable on many different levels. It was great to see Ke Huy Quan return with to the movie world with a bang like this. Many remember him as Short Round or Data in some very famous 80s classics. He turns into a very versetaile and demanding performance as well and manages those challenges fantastically. Last but not least there is Jamie Lee Curtis who obvioulsy had a lot of fun playing her role and puts a lot of energy into it. She was great, as she played against character. Sometimes a bit too cartoonish, but then again... thats the character.The cinematography, the score and especially the editing were top notch and make this a visual masterpiece. It works on so many layers and the re-watch factor is very high as well. I did not expect that I will love this movie is much as I did. Glad there is still braverty in the movie work to produce a wild ride of creativity like this.",

This isn't one of those movies where they just shoot generic coverage and throw it together in an editing bay. This movie understands the human soul. I've seen complaints that the humour is too \"lol so random\" at times. These people don't get it. This is a movie about the absurdity and infinity of reality. The strangeness is necessary and re-enforces the themes of the film. The Raccacoonie gag is about how we create our own world, sometimes by accident.

And the message, well i don't want to give anything away but that particular sentiment has been around for years. It's a nice one though and quite timelyWhat makes this movie great is the acting. It outshines the \" acid trip experience\" by far, especially Stephanie Hsu, who was required to switch from a harried twenty-something to an Interdimensional Empress at the drop of a hat and pulled it off exceptionally well. While all the Space/Time stuff added a couple levels of fun, I would like to see these actors perform in a movie with some of the same themes in a more realistic setting sometime. They had great chemistry.Of course, with Michelle Yeoh on set, the action was superb.Side note, there is a scene where a woman uses a small dog as a weapon in a fight.

It's definitely one of the best movies of these past couple years.I enjoyed it very much, but the only reason I'm giving it an 8 and not a 9, is because I didn't really have the emotional connection that people seem to have with the ending of this movie, and the ending, although great, I didn't find it mind-blowingly amazing to warrant it a 9.I usually cringe when a conflict, especially a world-ending one, is solved by the power of \"love\"! And I really hate it when this trope is used to end a story. But in this case, it really worked for this movie and I have no complaint about that aspect of it. Just that I wasn't too emotionally invested in their relationship, or better to say that the mother-daughter relationship didn't resonate with me that much. I don't know, it probably would've worked for me better if it was a father and son. And I'm not saying that just because I'm a man, I'm saying that because I know that that worked better in a movie like About Time. Or maybe it's because they showed that father and son relationship just a teeny bit better that made me invest in their characters and relationships better.I probably will change my mind on a second or multiple viewings, but for now, I think it's a solid 8. Although it's automatically a 9 since we hadn't have a movie this good in so many years. (Except for Parasite)\nAnd it looks like that a lot of people, understandably, compare this to Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, but I don't think it's comparable. One is a stand-alone movie that wraps up its own story in the runtime it has, and the other is like an episode to a cinematic universe that should be watched like a tv show. So why not enjoy both?And it's fair if you don't like how Marvel movies work and that you have to watch lots of other movies before a \"sequel\" to a movie that came out in 2016, it's your choice and opinion, you don't like the way they do movies or you don't like the movie at all. But let people who enjoy both movies enjoy both of them and don't start a war over it.Although if we were to compare these two movies with each other, EEAAO is definitely the superior movie. It has better visuals and editing, and the story and how it is told is definitely better here.But I enjoyed the horror and gothic aspect of Doctor Strange too and really had fun with it, and even though I gave that one an 8 too, it's actually a 7.5 for me and obviously lower than this movie, but I still enjoyed both of them for different reasons.One thing I didn't really find that great in this movie though, was the score. Now, the music and the sound mixing was great in this movie. But for some scenes, especially the ending, I thought the music could've been used in a better way. It's the only thing I think this movie is lacking. And like I said, it might be become better on a second-viewing.And although they did a good job of explaining how the multiverse jump work, I am still confused about somethings, especially with the Bluetooth headphones they have.All in all, it's a great movie and definitely the best movie since 2019.

And I wish I saw this in theaters but never went for it. Go into this as blind as you can, it's worth it.The mix of adventure, drama and comedy is so well balanced, it's inspiring. The acting is phenomenal, the score and music is top tier, the vfx, the directing.. I could go on praising this movie and to be honest I guess I'm just on a high a.t.m. And can't so a lot of faults. But are there many? Besides the whole multiverse complexity, sure it becomes so complex at a point you have to really remove logic from the equation. At first you try, but it quickly tells you to just accept it.The only negative I could notice whilst watching where some blatant ''telling the viewer what's going on'' moments. With the complexity it's understandable why they did it, but to me it felt like ''yes, I know already'' This was in the early part only though. But that's like... the only thing I could find and imo is nitpicking.It's a 2+ hour movie and it feels like that but also doesn't feel like that. Because of it's unique moments and editing choices it will make you aware of the time. Which leads to it. I loved the choice, but it also had it's repercussions.Special shoutout to the VFX work and directing/editing. It's so incredibly creative, the backstories, the methods of how they show things, the simple but brilliant scenes. Conceptually this movie ranks extremely high. The main story is touching and emotional, but the movie never forgets it's a comedy, but you'll hear tears in your eyes and laugh at the same time. It deals with Chinese parenting traditions/stereotypes in quite a obvious way but the dad made all the difference in it becoming repetitive.I have yet to see other works from these directors but I'm acing to watch anything they come up with next. This movie truly felt like a work of art and passion.This is a special movie, and up there to be watched again.",

I'm willing to compensate for the fact that every once in a while there will just be a movie I don't like that will win Best Picture; too artsy, too smart, stuff like that. But this isn't that.

Sort of feels Oscar baity at times.The action scenes are impressive and it is neat to see a bad*** female lead. The performances from Michelle and Jamie are STRONG. But I think Ke is the true scene stealer in this entire film!

So I'm just going to repost it here.I usually write these from the parking lot of the theater right after I see the movie. With this film I needed time to digest everything.........cause its a lot. On the drive home I was deep in thought wondering how I was going to write this.First some background. Before Wednesday this week I didn't even know this film existed. I didn't see any trailers, I didn't know what it was about, I didn't even know who starred in it. I went into this movie COMPLETELY blind. A dude I work with invited me out to see it. (Thanks man)#EverythingEverywhereallatOnce is the story of Evelyn, an over worked wife and mother who runs a failing Laundromat, while taking care of her elderly Father. Her life takes a sudden dramatic and unexpected (in every sense of the word) turn when while at the tax office she is contacted by her husband from an alternate universe.This movie is Bonkers, balls to the wall insane, 0 to 100 in a millisecond, turned up to 11 crazy ride. It has the feel of a #EdgarWright film in some parts a Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor film in others with some #WesAnderson sprinkled in. This movie is Hilarious, irreverent, touching, insane, hopeful, gross, confusing, and moving, throughout.The performances from the Actors were all top notch most notably #MichelleYeoh, #KeHuyQuan and #StephanieHsu. I've never seen Michelle Yeoh in a film like this before and its so cool to see that she's still got it. Ke Huy Quan's character is easily my favourite of the three. The heart of this movie. It was also cool see #JamieLeeCurtis on screen again this time as a minor villan. Last movie I saw her in was #KnivesOut. Great performances all around.While the story is hard to follow at first, and the transitions are very quick and jarring I have no problem recommending this movie. Its an gem of a film and I'm glad I got to see it. I enjoyed watching this and had a ton of fun. Movies like this remind me of why I like watching movies in the first place. High praises all around.",

I was smiling, thrilled, and weeping all along the movies. The film uses the endless possibilities of the multiverse to teach the protagonists to understand, appreciate and accept who they are, what they have and those around them. The exterior shell of the movie may be weird, but the interior flesh is kind and humanThe production was exactly as bizarre as everything else. The film has a budget of around 1/8 of the Multiverse of Madness. And they managed to make their multiverse as madness as Marvel's. So, if you've been considering whether or not to see this film, now is the time to do so. Perhaps you will discover one of the best films of your life like I did.",

            "content": "The Good: You know a movie is special when the impeccable action scenes, unmatched creativity, and incredible performances aren't what stands out. It's the deep, unapologetic humanity and character dynamics - so realistic and raw - that really puts Everything, Everywhere, All At Once over the top for me. It's also a film that reminds me of what science fiction is really about: using these out there concepts to comment upon the human experience. This film is really a metaphor for adult life; how we often have to juggle so many things pulling at us and lose sight of what really matters: people, relationships, and the time we have with them.To say Michelle Yeoh is great here is an understatement. She's truly remarkable and excels in every role she plays in this movie: she's funny, she's a fantastic martial artist, she's glamorous, she's relatable. Maybe the Daniels had some fairy dust in their pockets or something, because almost every actor here - required to play multiple versions of themselves - are OUTSTANDING. Key Huy Quan's Waymond is perhaps my favourite character of the year so far; he's so effortlessly lovable and brings so much pathos to this role. I also want to shout Stephanie Hsu out; she's not getting a ton of attention but her performance is so good the scenes of her and Michelle Yeoh almost brought me to tears (I'll freely admit Quan and Yeoh's scenes LITERALLY brought me to tears).But, of course none of this is what people are *really* talking about with this movie. This movie's energy is on another level, I've never seen anything quite like it. It's both quick and snappy, but makes complete sense. Just when I was getting a bit bored with the setting, the film transitions at the exact right moment. The ending feels earned and in line with the film's themes. Everything just clicks...everywhere and all at once.The action is next level. This movie was apparently written for Jackie Chan and I have to say, Yeoh and Quan are amazing stand ins for him. The influence of Hong Kong action films is palpable and unmistakable. In an era where I usually go into passive mode watching action scenes, EEAO had my eyes glued to the screen. It has some of the funniest, most interesting, and dynamic action sequences I have ever seen. Every time I thought I knew what was gonna happen, something entirely different did.And if this movie couldn't be even more intricate and well made, its very existence if reflective of the Asian American experience. You couldn't have this movie without China, yet it's still clearly a very American movie. God, I freakin' love this movie.The Bad: Honestly, this is one of the movies that I'd be nitpicking if I had to go through what was \"bad.\" Maybe one or two scenes i think didn't need to be there, maybe some dialog that's a bit on the nose. But nah, this thing rocks.The Ugly: 2022 is shaping up to be a truly amazing year for film. I'm so happy that we've seen a new generation of visionaries take centre stage, and I can't wait to see what the Daniels' do next. If Swiss Army Man was the appetizer, Everything Everywhere All At Once feels like the main course, a statement film that (I hope) elevates audience expectations as to what mainstream film making can be. No scratch that, it elevates expectations as to what life can be. I felt myself just a little happier, just a little more appreciative of my life and the people who are a part of it.With all the stuff happening in the world, I'm happy I'm in the universe where this film exists.",

With every decision I make, another universe is born. In one universe I turn out to be a piano wizard, in others I'm a knife wizard, a martial arts wizard, a wizard of wizardry. There is an endless amount of glorious roads my life could take and thanks to the invention of parallel universes, some version of me is taking each and every one of them. But still, I, myself, I am the most important one. I didn't achieve much in my life, all my potentials still lie dormant, an explosive mixture, just waiting for a spark to ignite it.I'm a quirky person. People love that about me. Sometimes I start to sing, sometimes I start to dance, or whatever. This movie about me is a quirky movie. Lots of fun stuff from science fiction movies, horror movies, kung fu movies has been thrown into a blender to create something that is as multi-faceted and fun as I am. So don't you dare to nitpick! Don't be a smart-aleck! This movie is not about logic. It is not about you!This movie is about me realizing that even if I didn't do much with my life, I'm actually everything, everywhere, all at once.My name is Evelyn, God of Gods! Look at me, you mighty, and despair!\"---As I'm not Evelyn, I found the whole thing a bit boring, actually. This crazy, trippy, far out stuff wasn't my cup of tea. But obviously there are lots of Evelyns out there who really love it. So just ask yourself one question: Are you an Evelyn? Well, are you ...?---The funniest joke of this movie is the cardigan with \"PUNK\" written on the back that Evelyn wears. Vivienne Westwood, eat your heart out!",

Not only would it be great for the Asian community but this film had a ridiculously low budget and small team and that kind of originality from a small group of creatives needs to be supported and awarded for all to see.

And it's mostly fun.Definitely different which in today's safe cinematic world of proven brands in the way of endless sequels, spinoffs, reboots and remakes is an absolute godsend. It deserves an Academy award for Originality.Sadly the Oscar's are now only about virtue posturing and not quality filmmaking.One thing is for certain, any film over 2 hours better have a damn good reason for doing so. This type of film would be far better served being under that benchmark.The first hour particularly, is quite repetitive and would have made a much better and more enjoyable experience if it were more concise. The second half works much better but still it is over long and ultimately damages the film as a whole.Still very enjoyable and quite funny. It just doesn't always hit the mark and can be tiring at times. In others, it really is impressive.Great acting chops for all the leads. Jamie Lee Curtis was a riot. Great to see Short Round back too. His character actually had a lot of charisma and it's a real shame he hasn't been on screen as much in recent decades as he really lights it up every time he opens his mouth.Kudos to the filmmakers.

The sub-plots get also lost here: the gay daughter coming out of the closet to her conservative grandpa, the immigrant Chinese family, who had to adapt to the US and is struggling with the IRS. There's stuff here to tell a real story, and no need to flashy visual effects.Add to this dubious production choices. Both main characters are portrayed by actors who are Cantonese speakers, but in the movie they are depicted talking in Mandarin to each other and in Cantonese to the grandpa.

The title of the movie is actually pretty accurate given the story line and the very thin plot.It turns out that the problem with the multiverse is that this very harried mother is ignoring the feelings of her daughter, not to mention claiming a whole lot of improper business costs on her Federal business tax returns which somehow makes the IRS examiner an evil ally of the all-powerful daughter.Huh? What?If the script writer and director were TRYING to make the audience as confused as the movie's heroine then they succeeded.Sorry, confusion does not make a movie good.This movie is not like a mystery, tho, where you somehow follow clues to the solution at the end of the movie. Random random stuff keeps getting thrown at us because our housewife heroine is constantly being attacked by random forces which pop out of the multiverse. There is no time to try to think along with the plot. It's just attack, attack, attack . . .In the end and just in the nick of time, of course, our heroine gets it and starts paying attention to her daughter's feelings and the multiverse is saved.Probably there is supposed to be some sort of metaphor here about the multiverse being contained in a single soul, so upsetting that soul throws the entire multiverse into chaos. Blah, blah, blah.I had to sit through an entire movie to see something which should be taught in Parenting 101, namely:Pay attention to your children's feelings. Those feelings may or may not be reasonable given the child's circumstances, but the feelings themselves are very real and need to be taken care of with love, truth, and care.Too much action.

Nothing special, nothing particularly interesting. The humor is uncreative and lame: there's a Ratatouille spoof called Racacoonie (it's a raccoon); in an alternate universe, people have hot dog fingers; there's a bagel with literally everything on it... it feels like there's not a single idea that wouldn't fit on a Venn diagram crossover between dad jokes and things a teenager would think up while high.The ending is the worst part. We know what's going to happen. We've seen it a thousand times before. But it just drags on and on and on. It could've easily shaved ten minutes off in the last half hour.

Before time runs out, she must learn to use her skills to fight off evil doppelgangers of her friends and her IRS officer (a hilarious turn from True Lies' Jamie Lee Curtis) from other universes!Doctor Strange could take a lesson or two from the mouth-dropping visuals this films throws at the viewer, with the CGI and SFX blended seemlessly between quick, witty and relevant dialogue, majestic fight scenes, and surprises behind every turn! A feast for the eyes!The cast playfully carry this film on their comedic, dramatic and kung fu-trained shoulders, all at once!

I think this movie has accomplished a very rare feat, especially in the current day and age: Finding the perfect length for the story it is telling.I'm for sure going to rewatch this movie many times, it's just such a joy ride and yet it managed to bring tears to my eyes. It's deeply meaningful and absolutely silly. It's original and raw, wild and meticulously crafted. It's literally everything everywhere all at once. Well, except for boring or predictable.Best film of 2022, and it's not even close. This film deserves nothing less than Academy Awards for best picture and best original screenplay.",

The story is astonishingly well crafted managing to be both totally thrilling to watch on face value and also completely captivating to see the bigger themes unfold. A multi generation chinese-American family are struggling with their lives and relationships and get the chance to explore alternative realities where their lives have taken very different directions. The film is a triumph of both big and small scale story telling while never feeling trivial or pretentious. It was fun and action packed, showing off mind-blowing editing and filming techniques as well as spectacular martial arts amongst some truly surreal ideas. The ambition and expansiveness of this film is huge and somehow expertly woven together into something that not only makes sense but is a real wonder to behold. There is also a really powerful emotional core to the film, particularly with the mother daughter relationship as well as proper laugh out loud comedy moments. The cast do an incredible job with so much to do and multiple characters to play and I hope Oscar nominations are on the horizon.",

The plot really doesn't matter too much; the movie does offer a lot of explanation, but I think you could turn your brain off and not think too deeply about the plot and still get the gist of the movie. The setting and acting are fantastic: a laundry-owning chinese immigrant on the brink of divorce having to save the multiverse from her family feel incredibly original. There was a lot of special effects in this movie - most of it CGI - and most of it really great looking. The sets (especially their house, with all its knick-knacks) were incredibly ornate; I feel like I could have paused in some scenes and just spent hours looking over the scene. The acting was top-notch; I would never have guessed that the main actress was 60-years old. There were some references to other movies and lots of comedy; a lot of it didn't land for me. Most of the humor is a bit too Marvel-ish (goofy/campy) for me. Overall it's an easy movie to watch; might be worth rewatching in a few years to see if it holds up.",

I don't know the actors or the directors, there is nothing personal. I even had high hopes for the movie as it was highly recommended to me, but I don't see how this movie can have more than one star.Also, maybe some will want to call me a boomer or something. To them I would clarify that I have seen quite absurd movies before. From the top of my head I can think of: Pink Flamingos, Begotten, Nirvana, Crash, A Serbian Film, Ebola Syndrome, Even Dwarfs Started Small, Mermaid in a Manhole, Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky, Nekromantik, Schramm, La Matanza Cannibal de los Garrulos Lisergicos...\nOkay, I don't find them good, but I think they are better than a star, well, maybe not the last one...Going back to the movie in question, some say it is deep and meaningful, but there is certainly nothing deep in the pseudo-philosophical and pseudo-scientific plot. There is not the slightest hint of a new idea or a new perspective, never mind a good exposition of what it purports to be.The argument is tedious, absurd, illogical and also predictable. The way the creators of this movie want to avoid the above is by introducing absurd elements that want to distract you from the childish plot. The film ends with the classic Hollywood clich\u00e9 where love finally triumphs.If you want an original movie, you won't find it at Everything Everywhere All at Once. If you want a pretentious, nonsensical plot that aspires to be edgy or deep, you might be in the right place. This movie is completely forgettable and I'm sure no one will talk about it in the future. It's just a gimmick that will pass with the tide.The only reasons I could give another star is the original music and the acting. The acting is heroic considering how bad the movie is. It's fascinating how well the actors managed to do ther job, so kudos to them. Maybe I could give it another star, but the movie is too bad for the reasons stated.Anyway, I find it fascinating to read the comments, especially those who say that it is one of the best movies ever and that it is in their top 3 or 5 of favorites. I bet they'll almost forget about this, their 'favorite' movie in a couple of years.",

There are some absolutely amazing cinematography and fine editing skills... but that's about it. Some of the lines were cool and many scenes funny .. and that's it.It's like a big ol hot fudge sundae or whatever.. which you relish only once.

Had it came out in late 90s or early 2000s it would be considered \"competitive\". I mean this is what Hollywood (Hollowood?) is supposed to be!! THIS should be the baseline. This is the orignality and creativity we expect with ALL movies.Guess public is numbed out by dumb boring ditzy Marvel movies and boilerplate formulaic action movies like Grey Man with Ryan Gosling and Last Seen Alive, that we are acting we saw the promised land.

Yes, so it's not a completely unique or original story, but that doesn't make it bad. That's just kind of how storytelling works : )",

The scenes in the first half of the movie appeared incoherent and it was hard to understand what was going on. But then I discovered that this incoherence was consistent, like some mathematical constant and came to realization that maybe I should not approach this movie with logic and I should not try so hard to understand it, but rather let the movie take you in for the ride and get into it for the sensation of it all and see where it goes. And oh my, how it delivered. I wasn't expecting such an epic emotional rollercoaster experience, even with all the crazy over the top things happening on screen, it blended very well together. It literally included everything, everywhere, all at once that you ever wanted in a movie. This was a masterpiece of a movie.

And if it doesn't, then what's the point of it all? Why are we even here? What does it matter what we do with the time that we have?Existential questions like this have been plaguing me since March of 2020, and they are at the very heart of Everything Everywhere All At Once-a whacky, over-the-top, surreal masterpiece of an action-adventure-it dares to ask these questions, it doesn't pull it's punches, and apologetically answers with a tale as old as time:Love.And that is the word I have for this marvel of a movie. And, like Marvel, the plot takes us into the Mulitverse, but not with grand spectacle and superheroes, but with the mother of a teenager.I've said it before, and I'll repeat it now-Michelle Yeoh, isn't just a national treasure for those countries she holds citizenship in, she's simply a treasure and has delivered, probably the best performance of the year in this movie.The Daniels (Dan Kwan & Daniel Scheinert) continue to hit project after project out of the park, and I can't wait for what they have in store for us next.There's one last person I need to talk about, and that is Ke Huy Quan, who returned to acting after finding fame as a child star in movies like The Goonies, and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and he is brilliant-and deserves all the awards as well.On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being \"don't see this movie,\" and 10 being \"you should buy stock in it,\" I give it a 15.",

And probably the best one I will ever see.It's not superficial. If you just want to relax with some popcorn then this is probably not the best thing for you at the moment.I think the movie has many layers. For me, it is about the meaning of life. Why live. Very deep and brave.And it's not boring either. Without that frustrating \"just accept things and be happy\". As if that's easy!!!Even more, the movie has quite a bunch of fun action.It is a very wholesome, multi-layered and rich piece of art with a life-affirming message, especially for the brave ones.I feel deep gratitude to its creators.Will definitely rewatch. And show it to my son when he grows up a bit.I would rate it 11 out of 10.",

Not everywhere all at once though ... just the third act (whatever that actually is) ... or the last third of the film, let's say.We both lost grip of the 'sense' that the film was doing a good job of explaining (and making) so far. But then ultimately it's not clear exactly what the black bagel is ... but Joy seems to have created it and it will destroy all the multiverses. Is this planned or what? Not clear. At least not to us.Then ... why is the Evil Joy searching for the specific Evelyn (mum) that we are following and trying to kill her. Then, when she does find her, she's not trying to kill her now?A confusing but entertaining film, so for that reason I'm giving it a seven.71/100.",

What I did know was that the movie was being considered for several Golden Globe awards and starred a talented cast. I love Michelle Yeoh, the return of Data, Po's dad is always a joy, and the mom from Freaky Friday is my secret crush, what is not to like.The minute Waymond, the young patriarch of the Wang clan, starts his parkour across the family-owned laundromat, the viewer gets a glimpse of the impending frenetic multiverse that guides the movie for the next few hours, helping it live up to its title... it really was everything, everywhere, all at once.Throughout the movie, the director quickly and sometimes confusingly trapses through familiar plot elements that will resonate, if the viewer can pull back the curtain of the hyperactive and manic effort from the characters at play. We get glimpses of family strife, parental discord, personal discontent, disappointment, resignation, joy, redemption. To this concern, viewers, please be warned, in an effort to stay in line with the quick moving story or to just relive some of the more bizarre twists, you may need to be prepared with a thumb or forefinger ready on the pause, rewind, go back 15 seconds button. One might offer that it, in fact, adds another level to the multiverse experience. In the end, the movie slows down enough to allow the viewer time to catch-up with the plot and message before the credits roll.For some this movie will be an exciting ride, one in which the viewer will spend with their hands in the air, exhilarated at every quick twist and turn. Amazed at the intense action fight scenes, giggling at the absurd and over-the-top visual elements chosen for various alternate worlds. For others, it will lack the needed depth to stay connected to the characters and storyline, instead wishing they could opt for an alternate universe in which the viewer decided to skip the movie and catch-up on some streaming binge worthy show.",

            "content": "EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE (Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, 2022) is, above all, a breathtaking cinematic experience, which summons almost all of our senses to enjoy it in its fullness.Michelle Yeoh leads with unshakable mastery the group of no less efficient actors who transpose the Daniels' vision to the big screen. Newcomer Stephanie Hsu is surprisingly convincing in the role of Jabu Tupaki; Ke Huy Quan (the boy from INDIANA JONES AND THE LOST TEMPLE and THE GOONIES) proves to be a talented and versatile actor; in turn, the legendary James Hong, who is already 93 years old, and Jamie Lee Curtis, who manages to be, at the same time, hateful, comical and touching, show that without committal and without complexes, as in any profession, there is no way to get good results.The film itself requires concentration and open-mindedness, as it is unlike anything I've ever seen. Assuming that there are several universes and that it is possible to jump from side to side, accessing the selves of other universes, the story unfolds at a hallucinating, captivating, touching and even philosophical pace, launching lines of thought such as \"Nothing matters\" ; \"kindness\" as a form of struggle; see the good side of things as a life strategy, not necessarily as naivety. Almost from an existentialist or Beckettian perspective, we can consider that what the film proposes is that at the base of our existence there is nothing and it is our choices and the freedom to choose some things over others that define the human condition.The film uses impressive special effects, which serve the story, but without neglecting the message it intends to convey. And here, the one that seems to me the most profound is related to the fact that the protagonist believes that she has done nothing with her life, because when she gets to know her other selves from other universes, she considers that they had fuller and more interesting lives (although they lacked the most important thing: a family). In fact, when someone tells the protagonist \"in another life, I would have loved to do laundry and taxes with you\", we have the film deciphered.",

It doesn't go out of its way to be funny, the comedy is presented in a fluid way.The other thing that this movie does excellently is presenting the female protagonist! They, not once, shove it in the audience's face that she's a woman, they simply present the character and their path towards strength. So many directors mess this up and use exposition or arrogance to make their point about a female character, but here, it's characters being portrayed perfectly, even the old people are portrayed well.10/10.",

It's not mind boggling, head spinning confusing either! Even the 'strange outfits' are symbols of what they are feeling or what universe they're in!! It's very obvious that at the end Stefanie hsu's character is dressing in her emotions, weather scattered and confused, or depressed. They implement these emotions in her outfits that's why they're 'strange'. Now i must admit the beginning is 'boring' but it's starts like that because there is not yet a conflict and it's even said in the movie that she is living her worst version of herself ! This movie doesn't outright spell things out for the viewer but it doesn't hide them from the viewer either. This movie is incredible to watch but it's for the more excepting open minded people. I personally don't really write reviews but this movie broke me emotionally when i thought it was going to be bad due to these reviews.If you watch this movie brace yourself emotionally because you will cry.Also don't watch if you're close minded and don't pay any attention to detail.",

There's a false \"The End\" part way through the film and I thought, \"Thank god this drivel is over\", but then there was more.It could maybe have been a good movie if they just dropped the juvenile comedy that didn't work and either replaced it with more grown-up humour or just left it out.",

The themes that it is able to extract through the pure stupidity and joy of it makes it so absolutely incredible to watch and view and the journey it took me on was one I will never forget.The plot of this movie is so incredibly convoluted and so much is action is packed into this one film but the way the story progresses you truly never feel lost. This is absolutely insane to think about considering how this movie is shot and how quickly it moves but it however a plot that anyone can reflect on and examine for how incredible it is\nPlot:2/2The ability for the actors in this film to shift from serious to funny roles is absolutely amazing but the most major props must go to Michelle Yeoh and Stephanie Hsu. There constant clashing weather as mother and daughter or as mortal enemies creates such a wonderful dynamic and one that everyone watching can feel drawn too. However, major props must also go to Ke Hyu Quan whose role as Waymond may be one of the best as well. His ability to quick witted and campy whiles also being one of the biggest drivers of the plot during the third act makes him as well every other minor character so incredible and crucial to the plot of the film.Acting:2/2This is the absolute craziest story I have ever seen and what I should have been throughout the entirety of the film was confused, grossed out, and bored and yet I was captivated for every minute of the film. This film gave so many incredible camera shots and artistry throughout the film that it just keeps you on the edge of your seat and brings you closer to these wonderful characters whose lives you feel so intwined with.Storytelling:1.75/2This film has creativity in spades. The simple family drama mother daughter story has been told so many times but this one did it in such a unique way that it can and will never be replicated again. The fact that someone even thought of a story like this and to tell it in this way makes this story so absolutely wonderful to digest\nCreativity:2/2From the costumes to the music to the cinematography, every little minuet detail of this film bring it to the next level. You can tell that every decision was purposefully placed in order to make this movie the absolute best it can be and while there are so many moments when this movie shouldn't work but everything is done so particular that it ends up being perfection\nOther Factors:2/2This movie should have never worked and yet it might be the greatest family drama trope ever told because everyone can relate to this film. Everyone can relate to asking why are we here and why this life and that's what makes it so wonderful. This movie shows our purpose for why we live the way we live and the over the top campiness only adds to the overall enjoyment.Overall:9.75/10.",

And then I suddenly it turned into a storyline which I couldn't follow anymore. I really wanted to be sucked into the whole plot, but it didn't work out. I had a feeling that too much attention was put into the costumes and action moves which resulted in the lack of any depth. I couldn't connect to the characters. It felt like they were having the same dialogue over and over again, although the scenes were changing rapidly. All in all, I was bored and couldn't wait for the movie to end.",

            "content": "It may be a bad idea to do a brief review of a movie this nuanced and deep, but I'll give it a shot.This Sci-Fi Comedy takes you on a journey of a Chinese family in America, jumping between alternate realities and timelines. Ke Huy Quan's character calls upon Michelle Yeoh's character to save the multiverse by defeating a dimension-hopping being hunting her down and attempting to destroy all of reality. Michelle's character might defeat this being by jumping between parallel realities - becoming different versions of herself in different timelines. And that's just the setup.The first thing you'll notice is that this movie is filled with lovable actors playing endearing characters. Michelle and James Hong are legends of the screen and effortlessly pull off their action, comedy, and dramatic sequences. Ke Huy (the Asian kid, now adult, from The Goonies and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) oozes kindness and charm. Jamie Lee Curtis also brings her experience to this movie as her presence is always both ridiculous and intimidating throughout.This is significant because these actors play at least 5 - 10 different characters in the movie, spanning every mainstream Hollywood genre. There were artistic liberties in some of these alternate dimensions Michelle goes into. I wish this fictional world had more rules so it isn't just \"Anything can happen, so let's throw up whatever we want on the screen!\". It's fun but also seemingly art for art's sake.The real story is a family drama caught up in this dimension-hopping chaos. There is meaning in pondering what could have been if you had only made different choices earlier in life. This movie challenges you with accepting the choices you've made up to this point and enjoy your current life despite the mistakes you think you've made. Michelle's character is faced with this challenge multiple times, and it's truly a wonder to watch.Enjoy the acting, the colorful visuals, the action, the comedy, and the philosophical and thought-provoking dialogue all at once. Or not. This isn't your all too familiar genre film. But I'll thoroughly enjoy watching all the awards this movie will inevitably get.",

This is certainly not a huge budget blockbuster. It sits more within a decent budget indie film.The Chinese elements of the film ring true in terms of family and tradition and it would seem the idea was to give it all a bit of s slap around the chops. ( With a dildo ?.)Some of the ideas used are truly absurd and silly which may be too much for certain audiences whereas others will revel in them.I was somewhere poised in the middle thinking \" well thats new \".There are however deeper meanings to the movie to ponder and the issues sit real and are presented with integrity even if they are not world changing ideologies they are certainly relatable.The science presented in this film is not to be taken seriously so try not to take it as so.Overall this was a fun and enjoyable Chinese centric romp about family choices and destiny.",

There was so much I enjoyed/appreciated about this film; the camera work, the lighting, all the unique little quirks that set it apart from other cliches, and the fact that there were DIFFERENT ASPECTS RATIOS IN DIFFERENT UNIVERSES. Waymond was easily my favourite character, just because he's really the kind of person I want to be. Although, I think my favourite scene was one of the few with only Joy and Evelyn. The scene in the rock universe. It felt similar in tone to Spirited Away's train scene (with a hint more comedy) just because it allowed us to breath and reflect on how the characters have grown and changed. The comedy was pretty hit or miss for me, and there was some that was just a little too much, and I am sad that it fell into some of the chosen one tropes that I'm just a little too tired of but overall it was a really fun film. 9.3/10 live like Waymond.",

I recommended it to my family (mom and dad and my sister and her husband) and they all stopped watching it halfway \"calling it the biggest load of rubbish\".There is a scene mid-way that made me tear up with laughter. I laughed so hard I though I was going to have a heart attack.

Compare it with modern martial arts movies, it is brilliantly reverting to martial arts essence and gets an 8... Compare it with revolutionary Sci Fi franchises, like The Matrix, it is an upgraded version, that is and is not new in the same time - not sure what rating applies.The thing is this movie is a bit of every of the above, and others more, therefore should probably be rewatched, and what glues it together and allows a possible rating would be the note that is most constant in the aftertaste, repeatedly, and its value within that cathegory, if it is not one completely devoid of competition. The producers have however mentioned Rick and Morty, and there are other movies concerning multiverses, or game universes, so maybe it is a cathegory in the making, being populated as we speak.What can I say, without rewatching?*for the moment I do not know if I even want to rewatch it, the feeling can be described as sort of a brain hangover\n*it aims to help with some of the disaster felt by young generations, like giving instructions on how to deal with chaos better, because chaos itself ain't gonna be solved soon\n*it provides similar help for older generations that served as a bridge towards what is going on, although in the story, it was their fault for rushing things and in fact they are the ones who caused chaos and all the pressure the young have today\n*it feels more like a family centered drama, or a generations centered one, than a Sci Fi\n*could have skipped the sex-related elements, but I guess they are sending a message for all those who went to this extreme in their quest for meaning and purpose, or just for effing feeling something again in what they perceive as a world devoid of sensorial stimuli\n*brilliant reintroduction of martial arts, after the mess made by all the commercial movies depicting them - martial arts are NOT originally sports, but energy manipulation, triggering physical effects\n*lots of concepts from India and Asia mythology and spirituality, weirdly unexplained - I saw interviews where the movie team claims certain names, visuals and gestures are just gamified, jokes or creative randomness - why do they lie?! Mythological motifs of chaos and certain entities that rule it, or generate it, abund, and the movie's elements can be traced back to some of these. And it does not just happen, because they have details - the way Jobu steps aside her mother's head on the stairs, in closeup, is a reminder of how Kali stopped in her destruction after stepping with her right foot above her husband... but I am not completely familiar with these motifs to be able to understand exactly how they used them.. Just noticing they are in the movie, and not \"by chance\". Also the Indian movie playing on the screen, I would have to know what movie or story is that, to understand a bit... so, more things to find out. Maybe they claim randomness because the young would turn away from \"we're repacked for your understanding some very very old things\" - maybe...\n*someone here concluded that the message is \"set aside what could have been, and just strive to be happy with what you have, even modest\". I think not! There is a complicated explanation in the movie of why this Evelyn is the one needed to solve her daughter's entanglement with the chaos, and it is completely different. I am making an effort here, but by abandoning one dream after another, this Evelyn lives her \"failure\" version of a life with her eyes wide open, making herself available to see it all from the outside, being herself mobile in concepts and strong when it comes to aknowledge other versions exist. She is un-lodged in one type of life, non attached or less attached to a fixated truth, as her better more successful versions are, therefore open to seeing the possibilities and able to understand her daughter's story\n*the message IS an empowering one, although hard to pin down; what do you do when there is nothing stable, secure, predetemined and calming around? And it is a fact, beyond the bull*it of \"you are just troubled because you have to change the way you think\" psychanalytic mantra... what do you do when the world is bluntly going down the drain, as you used to know it? What do you hold on to? The movie wants to help with getting an answer, which could be, I imagine, understood by each viewer in its own way.",

Actors starting from Michelle Yeoh to Ke Huy Quan to Jamie Lee Curtis and everyone else have done such a phenomenal job with their performance that it just makes you want to focus on the story going forward and forget everything else. The story itself from start to end stays very chaotic but even among that it manages to express itself beautifully. Editing, cinematography, and other departments have put in so much staggering work that your wondering just doesn't stop at all. Directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert have created a harmony that has too many things stacked and packed in it but the way they have delivered it on the plate with a desert, in the end, is enough to keep you sitting until the end to taste it.

The husband and father roles performed by James Hong and Je Huy Quan were equally strong. The film both mocked and praised the action world of super heroes. Ultimately admitting that stories about alternate universes, like our own daily lives, make little sense. It encourages us to admit that we have little control over what works and what doesn't work in business, relationships and love. In the end Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh) must learn to stop fighting and pushing others away in an attempt to achieve standards of middle class migrant success.

But this is all to the good, and I did enjoy it immensely. Everything taken to its absurd logical conclusion is by definition a failure.What I didn't enjoy is the kung fu. At all. I usually love long films but this is padded out by far too much kung fu nonsense, IMO. Though perhaps this is the ad absurdum subtext of that particular theme in a film that reductios all its themes - evidenced perhaps when credits roll halfway through, conning the viewer into frantically summarising the experience so far and questioning the sense of an ending happening at this point.The early eruption of casual violence also jarred and reminded me of the essential dilemma of Hollywood's glamourising of violence and guns, the easy and compulsive recourse to violence instead of action, depicted by those who often speak loudly from the other side of their mouths about gun control, violence etc. But I might be mentally concussed by all the screen violence though, and 'it's all good' - somehow.Having said all that, I loved the carnivalesque feel, the hurly burly family framework, and of course, Michelle Yeoh. Her gritty portrayal as the alpha female is great, drowning in duty yet somehow staying afloat. It's a tribute to her that she is exposed so relentlessly and exhaustingly throughout the film, seemingly never giving up. The ad absurdum of the sausage fingers timeline is interesting - their first scenes contrast to their recurrence later when Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis as lovers are using their feet - as if a mid project focus group had suggested that the absurdity needed to be clawed back - although why I am not sure, considering the hit and miss two boulders timeline - but feet playing piano - sure, ok . . .James Hong is an absolute legend. And interestingly, while the portrayal of the husband as a beta underperformer is the post modern standard for Hollywood, in other timelines he is a successful identity, so they did create a measure of complexity for the much maligned male stereotype. In the end though, the promise of the start seems to diffuse out into excessive kung fu and portrait art, long after we have grasped the 'message' that is being transmitted in sometimes epilepsy inducing cutting. I did like the crayon art scenes - very nice and totally reductio.For many not into hypermanic and infantile Pixar nonsense, (sorry fans!) the racoonie bits don't work. At least the bagel harks back to medieval Poland, apparently, symbolising a long life and good luck in childbirth.That's the beauty of a good film. You watch it, don't get some references, do some research, watch it again with a greater appreciation, noticing all the effort going into the art work and the role playing.",

The film had me laughing, crying, and feeling so much hope and joy and I truly believe it will go down as one of the best films of the decade. This will be the film you see added to the Criterion Collection years from now, and will definitely be in the top 100 films of all time list. To put so many moving elements together (comedy, sci-fi, action, drama, mystery) all in one and make it work shows how talented the directors are and the cast was a cherry on top. Ke He Quan's performance was heartwrenchingly beautiful and what a truly wonderful comeback for him after a 20 year hiatus. An Oscar would be the most deserving award for him, especially after he thought his acting career was over despite being a child star. Stephanie Hsu is truly pheonomal and as her first major role, she takes the spotlight and gives so many layers and dimensions (literally) to her character which really showcases how talented she is and I hope she too can get an Oscar win. Lastly, Michelle Yeoh is brilliant. Perfect casting and I must give credit again to the Daniels for making a 50+ woman the lead protagonist in the film and really showing the world what a talent she is given her longevity in the film industry. This is the first film I've seen of hers but I have so much respect for her.

At first I thought the cast was mid but after this film perfectly characterized each person so well I actually came to really like them. The only thing that I would've liked/ preferred is if the film didn't act as a comedy so much as some of the jokes came off as cringe or unnecessary. I can not think of any other films to compare this to this is truly one of a kind and a much watch to anyone who can comprehend complex ideas such as this. In reality the concepts portrays are way more complicated than what was shown the film does its absolute best with the format its given to expand while staying consistent tot he main plot as possible. The film seems more as a summary since each alternate universe could be its own side story but the movie does. This can easily be a film series or a TV show on its own but compacting it all into one movie while also getting your message across is near to an impossible task for most people which is why I believe this movie should be made mandatory to watch by everyone.",

People who aren't unsure should maybe check out the music videos those two guys directed first to give you a hint. I'm saying that only because I have seen audiences leaving the cinema halfway through the movie, which is a great sign in my opinion. But it is also a double edged sword: it cuts really deep, but sometimes less is more. There are a lot of over-indulgent parts, especially when it comes to running jokes and the 4th act. I think this could have been edited down to a good half an hour, since the catharsis overstays it's welcome.It's still a great movie regardless, since I always prefer highly original material. Although there is a huge amount of hommages from many famous movies, one that stuck with me after the movie is the editing. There is an element of Satoshi Kon's editing style in how previous scenes are being re-contextualized in a collage of time and space. It's a concept Kon was famous for and Nolan seems to be still striving for. It's really interesting to see other diretors applying this concept. Since I watched Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness two weeks ago, the comparisons came up necessarily while I was watching. And I was wondering why this movie feels so much better than Doctor Strange in that regard. Obviously there are characters you truly care about here who amount to more than quips.I honestly prefer Swiss Army Man over this one, but I'm glad that DANIELS is back and hope to see more movies from them in the future. It is truly a great ride once you embrace it.",

The role of Joy Wang could have been better portrayed, while Ke Huy Quan gives a very decent supporting performance. The combination of multiple roles and capabilities of the main character, and the swift switch between those roles, sometimes with absurd overlaps, makes this a worthwhile watch even if absurdism doesn't interest you.",

            "content": "I'm still reeling from having seen EEAAO. There's almost certainly a parallel universe somewhere where Old McDonald had a film called EEAAO, as the old nursery rhyme has it. If I had ever taken mind-altering drugs before, I might have been on familiar ground, but as it was I think the film makers took those drugs for me. I don't know they were on something at the time, but how else do you explain this incredible concoction?One of the things I liked best about it was the unashamed willingness to be a vehicle for monumental silliness. If you don't like ridiculous humour, this film might wear thin very quickly. Luckily, I do enjoy it when done well, and for much of the middle act of the story the ludicrous spectacle was relentless, and hilarious. You just never know what's coming next.But happily for some there's much more to EEAAO than absurdity and comedy. It's also quite touching, and charming, and has a few serious points to make about life, which avoids being mawkish or overly sentimental (just), thanks in part to leavening with the aforementioned silliness.It's also incredibly imaginative. To combine the mind-expanding elements with the utter mundanity of a woman struggling with her taxes, and make a coherent story that ultimately pulls all the loose threads together for a surprisingly satisfying conclusion, is quite an achievement.There's also quite a lot of subtitled Chinese dialogue, which switches back and forth from Mandarin to English and back to Mandarin again, because the main characters are all Chinese living in America, and speak both languages. This can make it hard on the brain at times, but stick with it; it helps to expand the mind!Oh god, I've just had another flashback!

The cast includes Michelle Yeoh (Evelyn), Stephanie Hsu (Joy), Ke Huy Quan (Waymond), James Hong (Gong Gong), Jamie Lee Curtis (Deirdre) and Tallie Medel (Becky).The hype surrounding this film has been huge, with many social media posts about it. I didn't want to see the trailer, reviews, or even read its synopsis. I went to check it out knowing nothing about Everything, Everywhere All At Once. By the end of the projection, I was impressed. It's a great movie.Anyone who knows me knows how much it costs to rate a movie a 10. Everything, Everywhere All At Once was the eighth film that deserved a 10 for me out of the nearly 3,000 films I've seen throughout my life.The film is perfect in every way. Original script, although with the feeling that I had already seen a lot of the things that were in it. It also could, because the writers-directors mixed several genres in the same film. There's adventure, there's kung fu, there's science fiction, there's comedy, there's drama, there's suspense, there's blood, there's beating, there's melodrama, there's everything. And this mix works really well. Everything connects.The cast is fantastic, with an emphasis on Michelle Yeoh, who should appear on the best actress candidate lists at the awards for the 2022 films. Jamie Lee Curtis is a luxury supporting actress, which works very well to increase Yeoh's brightness in the scenes where the two are together.Costumes, makeup, hair, production design, soundtrack, everything connects to form a uniform whole. Even the exaggerations in Joy's costumes have a reason for being within the script and don't bother.The script still plays with this year's recurring theme in blockbuster movies: the multiverse. The story takes place in several parallel universes, where Evelyn assumes different identities, such as a chef, a singer or a laundry owner.I also highlight the insertion of inclusion and diversity in history. There are Chinese immigrants who are small businessmen in the United States, there are LGBTQIA+ characters, there are elderly people, there is female empowerment, it touches on the importance of maintaining cultural traditions of a people (there is a Chinese New Year party).The directors show that they understand a lot about cinema and that they are passionate cinephiles, as I identified several references to successful films, such as Kar-Wai's In The Mood for Love, Tarantino's Kill Bill, current Marvel movies, Brad Bird's Ratatouille, Hong Kong kung fu B-movies, Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey, Forbidden Desire (film with three stories about lesbian couples), horror B-movies, slapstick comedy, John Carpenter's Halloween ( just having Jamie Lee Curtis is already a reference to this horror classic), among others.And the ending reminded me the ending of another film that scores 10 in my evaluation, Blue Velvet, by David Lynch, with a happy ending that can be interpreted as an irony by the directors.It's a movie to watch and review again and again as there are so many layers and nuances to discover.",

Most will generally yield to life's difficulties where comfort is sought in the meaninglessness of existence.

            "review_title": "\"I Got Bored One Day and Put Everything on a Bagel.\"",
            "content": "One of the most intriguing facets about the brave new world of film currently being pioneered is watching history repeat itself. Specifically, watching studios become prominent markers of a film's quality, second only to the filmmakers at the helm. In the early days, audiences knew what they were getting just by looking at the opening logos: the MGM lion signified luxury, the Paramount mountain meant a foreign touch, the Universal globe predicted cheaper productions and monster movies, etc. Etc.Although the trend certainly isn't as strong as it was, there are a few studios synonymous with the films they make and distribute. One such example is A24, a studio known for some of the most creative, complex, and outside-the-box fare today.It's not that A24 films are universally beloved or hyper-consistent; they have their share of duds and usually cater to one niche or another. Rather, the studio is a prominent signifier of quality to cinephiles because the films they make and distribute never pander to a broad market or tick boxes on an executive's soulless list. The passion of the filmmakers involved is always evident, and a purposeful vision usually drives the creation of the art. This is more so true for A24 than any studio today, and is most evident in their biggest, brashest, and most successful film to date, Everything Everywhere All at Once.The film follows Chinese immigrant Evelyn during the course of a very unusual day. While turning in paperwork for her accountant to comb through, Evelyn is suddenly thrust into an adventure concerning the multiverse, a concept involving the existence of an infinite number of universes. She must learn about all the possibilities the multiverse presents while battling a great force that threatens its existence, all while trying to connect with her teenage daughter, Joy.It's easy to see why the film has been universally praised. There are hundreds of different effects but little CGI, resulting in a breathtakingly grounded film. Everything, Everywhere is a grandiose and complex film, a patchwork constructed and assembled with invigorating passion. Many of today's superhero films are just as visually dense, but Everything, Everywhere doesn't boast a room full of animators to yell at and whip for faster, grander results.With respect to CGI artists, who are woefully overworked and underpaid, this film isn't just digitally synthesized - it's filmed. It's impossible to state my feelings of gratitude when a film feels like it's truly unfolding before your eyes, when it boasts a concrete foundation of verisimilitude, and Everything, Everywhere clears this benchmark with a story that seems like it never should've. It's resoundingly refreshing.A24 deserves its praise, but the impetus for Everything, Everywhere's creative explosion comes from Daniels. Daniels (Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert) are young, but they're already blazing a path for uncanny, surreal filmmaking, demonstrated in their freshman and sophomore efforts Swiss Army Man and The Death of Dick Long. Their direction is kinetic and all-encompassing, a veritable barrage of places, characters, ideas, and impressive action that assaults the viewer unrelentingly.One of the film's most special characteristics is the scale of its time; most of Everything, Everywhere takes place during a full day, but also, as the title suggest, transcends time and space, reaching into infinite worlds to set up several intrastory vignettes with their own structure, stakes, and pacing. Daniels do a remarkable job keeping focus and clarity despite the explosion of storylines and emotional stakes. There's a pristine clarity to everything, everywhere, all the time.The film is chaotic and explosive, but it's the editing which truly sets it apart from other equally boisterous fare. While the overarching story moves at lightening pace, it's also allowed to breathe and steady itself, further orienting the audience during the calamity. Nothing is too stylized either, like, say, Run Lola Run; there's a nice balance of quick cutting to maintain the kineticism and longer takes to envelope the viewer into the world. Whatever editor Paul Rogers was paid to work for Daniels, it wasn't enough. Everything, Everywhere has been lauded for a smattering of reasons, but I truly think the film lives or dies by Rogers' hand - it lives.Everything, Everywhere is the grandest, most elaborate, most painstaking film of the year, no question. It's size and quantity are easy to admire but it's not without its hiccups. Because of the film's size, scope, and genre-mashing, Daniels can't avoid giving viewers whiplash across the film's many storylines, emotional arcs, and tones; they go about eight layers deep and no moment is anything but fleeting. The lulls are brief but so are the film's many highpoints.Giving proper credence and pacing to the material would take approximately five hours of runtime, and the film is whittled down to an explosive two and a half. Because of this problem, and not despite of it, the film feels overstuffed. There's so much to get to and so much crazy, random nonsense happening at any given time that Daniels feel like they're rushing to give everyone and everything their due.A golden film rule for creators is \"kill your darlings,\" which is shorthand for \"delete every millisecond of material not essential to telling the story\". I can't even comprehend that there were scenes deleted here, either from the film or the script prior. There's just so much of it...probably about fifteen percent too much.Speaking of the script...it's a bit unwieldy. The story begins relatively slowly and quietly accelerates, a nice method to introduce the context and subtext of the madness before fully diving in. However, the film also lacks structure, eschewing satisfying cause and effect to instead introduce random concepts and characters throughout. The practical use of the multiverse invites a strong inclination toward randomness, but Everything, Everywhere sometimes oversteps the boundary, hurtling, at points, into the arbitrary.In a macro sense, the viewer rarely knows where they are in the runtime or how much of story is yet to play out. This lack of sense is most clearly demonstrated during a clever gimmick in a theater, at which point Everything, Everywhere feels like it's finally winding down and will be over in the next five or ten minutes...it then goes on for another forty-five.The performances are pleasant all around. In the spotlight are Michelle Yeoh and Stephanie Hsu as Evelyn and Joy, the mother-daughter duo at the forefront of the conflict. Each plays off the other nicely and they establish a tense but loving chemistry.Key Huy Quan plays Eveyln's husband Waymond, a sympathetic figure who walks a fine line between put-upon and pathetic. James Hong plays Gong Gong, the patriarch of the family. Every actor also plays a plethora of other roles from other universes, staying grounded and convincing in all manner of costumes and characterizations.Altogether, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a ridiculously large and raucous film. It maintains impressive focus on character and theme, never letting its central conflict become rote or lost in the hyper speed of the action. If it's ultimately too much of a good thing, it's still the most unique, creative, and ambitious film of the year, and the Daniels deserve significant praise for dreaming it up. I'm sure every eye will be on their next project and there will be considerable attention on this one throughout the year and into awards season. The film has been met with a startling amount of hype, but mostly delivers on every piece of praise it's received. Absolutely worth seeing in theaters.",

It is unique, and it looks like it has a much higher budget than it had, but ultimately it felt like a tornado symbolizing the supposed joy behind embracing a collective loss of meaning. There were a huge amount of cuts in the film making it seem like a music video more than a movie in some places. The action was well choreographed and there were some genuinely funny moments, but it felt as though it was selling and celebrating a nihilistic philosophy that assumes that all of one's actions are of no importance. That said, I predict that this will resonate with many people, and will become a modern classic as it is quite original, as well as acting as apologetics for postmodern living. There was a lot to like about the film, but I couldn't like it overall due to its terrible messages.",

I might have tolerated the surrealism but then we add the extra ingredient - the 'humour'.Some of the humour was hitting the mark - like Jamie Lee Curtis's accountant/assassin - but when the childish humour started, I was struggling to remain engaged.The first example of this was Michelle Yeoh's daughter using dildos as nunchakas. OK, fine. Mildly amusing. But it didn't stop there.People can jump into alternate versions of themselves by performing certain actions. In one scene, we see these jumps taking place as one person relieves themselves sitting on a toilet pan whilst another is masturbating. Then another 2 characters insert objects up their backsides. Honestly, maybe I'd have laughed if I was a giggling twelve year old but I'm not and this was crass.Buried underneath all this there was a heartwarming story with flawed characters finding a way to become better people.

There's no great evil here in spite of all the fighting between her and an unknown bad guy. There is an enemy but not a great evil. I can't reveal any more without giving away the ending. Now it is a fun movie and you get a kaleidoscope of universes and some enjoyable fight scenes. Sometimes it's a little much to my mind but you do get a happy uplifting ending and some funny bits. I particularly liked the Tax Auditors award. The only other thing I will mention is often in the movie they are speaking Chinese. Suddenly you have to read what they're saying. I notice they didn't show any of that in the trailer. I would suggest if someone is making a movie for both English and Chinese markets why not overdub or even do some manipulating so you can have both a fully Chinese and a fully English version.",

Really though, this movie is beautiful, from the writing to the special effects to the acting. The way it plays with different universes really hits the spot, especially when we saw the 2D one or the rocks-- don't get me started on the rocks! The relationship between the family is really heart-wrenching and relatable. While I wish Evelyn could have become the perfect doting mother by the end, the more realistic ending we got makes the conclusion all the better.",

Alas, the lack of emotional resonance and a bit bloated runtime are the reasons why I choose not to give 10/10 but rather an 8/10.The movie is full of fun references that probably demand multiple viewings. At it's core is a very personal story to carry the crazyness trough to the end.There is a lot to praise. The pure imagination and originality. The direction and cinematography. Abiding to basic dramatic concepts such as Chekhovs gun (or should I say 'plug'). The Acting. If the runtime were a bit tighter or if the movie made me care about the characters a bit more I would have been awesome. Still, it is very good and very recomended, though probably polarizing. My wife for example didn't care for it at all and I can't see some of my friends enjoying this. Give it a chance.BTW. The 'Husband' seemed familiar the whole time and I couldn't figure out from where do I know him. I never realized I was watching Shortstop from the Temple of doom :D.",

Not very original, but very wholesome nevertheless.There is also a lot of physical and slapstick humor that doesn't really work. They reference a lot of films and we even hear a little something from Zarathustra.

Not only is the movie about the multiverse but also about emotions and family. Michelle Yeoh was great in the movie along with her on screen husband and daughter. The film makes you relate on levels with all three characters and feel what they feel. It's a very deep film that will make you think hard after about what you saw and how you feel about it, in my personal opinion you could learn some lessons from this film about life. It's so unique and stands out from any other film it's guaranteed to make you think and feel something. The visuals in the movie are also stunning it's an absolute visual feast! So the end of the movie, after watching the main character jump universes and kick ass, the end of the movie was so unexpected. I really did not expect the movie to hit me so hard. Probably the most I've cried in a cinema, tears going down my face as I was watching it all unfold with the emotions with the characters and hitting me so hard even when I don't relate with everything it is just so human which was so surprising going into the film.

I don't get all the the ass plugs and dildos either- humorous\nat first, but overvuse made it annoying, and showed lack of imagination. I get people go for shock value, but that was the stale icing on a moldy cake. We only got 1/2 way through. I like the premise, but could've been delivered better. If you enjoyed it in any way, Hardcore Henry is much, much better..",

            "content": "This movie is summed up in one word: AMAZING!It is a definite, must-watch, need to pay attention to, much needed fantastical film of this entire year! I love this movie so much! It struck a chord with me and I have laughed and cried and stared in disbelief at the screen and felt my soul moved by the entire performance of the actors and actresses. Please watch this movie! It will touch your soul too.Semi spoilers ahead!*******This movie centers around an Asian American family: Evelyn, her husband Waymond, their daughter Joy, and her father who is named Gong Gong which is the Chinese word for grandfather if I'm not mistaken.Evelyn is a stressed out, hard-working mother who owns a laundromat business. She is burdened down by her father disowning her for marrying the love of her life. Her father, in old age, is sent to America to live with the family. Waymond, however, is seeking a divorce that Evelyn is unaware of yet. Their daughter Joy is gay and has been dating Becky for three years and wishes nothing more than for her mother's approval. And in all this chaos, the family business is being audited by the IRS, the agent assigned to them is the incredibly talented and amazing Jaime Lee Curtis.On the way to the IRS agent meeting, in the elevator, Waymond suddenly acts weird and tells Evelyn he's from another universe and that he needs her help to save the multiverse. She doesn't believe any of this, of course, but during the course of the meeting, Evelyn's curiosity takes over and she reluctantly follows the set of directions that multiverse Waymond tells her. Evelyn finds herself split into two as her mind is in two universes at once and meets with multiverse Waymond who explains what's going on.Multiverse Waymond is actually from the Alpha universe. He explains to Evelyn that there's a great evil they're seeking and he believes that Evelyn can help them balance out this evil and destroy it with good. Evelyn, not believing, sees the IRS agent, Deidre, kill the version of her in the universe where she spoke with Waymond. Terrified, Evelyn makes decisions and mistakes that lead her on a path of experiencing other universes in order to fight this evil.The movie is amazing. The cast and characters are well written and thought out. The movie is perfect, in my opinion.You see Evelyn, who gets to see the different life paths she lives because of the choices she's made. She gets to see that every choice leads to her having a better life than her current one.You see Waymond, who is a goofy but loving husband who is seeking a divorce from Evelyn. There is an understanding that he loves her very much and desires to grow old together.You see Joy, the daughter who is never good enough in her mother's eyes. Filled with depression and hopelessness, Joy seeks for someone to tell her that she matters, that her life matters.You see the grandfather, someone who spent a lifetime being upset at their child so he chose to abandon her. Yet, in his late life, has to depend on her to take care of him.You see Deidre, the IRS agent who somewhat gets a sadistic kick out of making other peoples' lives miserable because her own is pretty miserable.And you see how each decision, and each indecision, has led to something different, to a path that spawned an infinite multiverse.This movie deals with several issues that human beings have: why am I here, why do I matter, and can my life be better if I did things differently.I don't know how to explain it, but the movie makes you ponders these questions and answers them for you. You're here because you're important. You matter because you're worthy. Your life can always be better.But the focus is greatly upon understanding that in all the infinite multiverses, the one you live in, the life you live, every decision and every choice you made, all of it, everything, matters. The appreciation that you learn to have for yourself, your life, and the lives of others around you, helps to establish that this here, all this, is important. You see your life in a different way: not in all the failures and setbacks you had, but in all the achievements and the life you have.This movie is amazing for me. It's so much and nothing and everything all at once. I have a deeper understanding and appreciation of myself and others around me since watching this. I suggest everyone should watch it at least once.",

            "content": "I wasn't even gong to look at the trailer. The overlong title and the psychedelically jumbled cover screamed, \"Silly, self-indulgent screenwriter\".However, the high reviews AND the inclusion of Michelle Yeoh, Malaysian action actress first notice in the West as a Bond character, and then noted for her role in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and, more recently, Crazy Rich Asians.It was not to be.First of all, the casting reinforces popular depiction of Asians in the US as a) first generation immigrants, b) speak like demented cookies, c) are usually laundrymen, and d) come from very old-fashioned families that stifle their US born children.The reality is that Asians now represent some.5.5% of Americans, a proportion greater than those who self-identify as Jewish. In terms of representation, the first is greatly underrepresented, and the later over represented.The Census also includes Indic origin people (Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, and other nationalties like South Africans, Britain, Malaysia or the Caribbean with Indian ancestry), and who make us about 21% of \"Asians\". Apart from Mindy Khaling, Kumar and the actor with Sheldon, there is no significant role in popular media. I don't count Prianka Chopra who is more \"Indic\" in cluture but only portrays whitewashes characters with a foreign accent.About another 4 million Americans list Asian as part heritage, which isn't surprising since the rate of intermarriage between US-born Asians and other is about 50% for females. So, if further immigration from Asia were stopped, within 3 generations (grandchildren) there would be no discernibly distinct group of Asians. Philippinos who make up the next largest group often intermarry with Hispanic Americans, and highly educated immigrants of any race, tend to marry White Americans.Yet, only stereotypical of \"fresh off the boat\" portrayals of Asians in the US persist. It's as if one continued to portrays Jews as they had been in the 1940s and 1950s, or Blacks cast as servants or tribal Africans until the 1960s.So, I have an issue with the casting of an American film with no lead character who speaks English well. While Michelle Yeoh has a foreign accent, she is nowhere as clueless and inarticulate since she is Malaysian, where schooling is in English; she is illiterate in Chinese and had to learn her lines phonetically for HK or Chinese films. Her husband who played the annoying Chinese boy in Indiana Jones, also seems tongue-tied, despite the actor's US background.The psychedelic, multiverse, implausible plot also is un original.Why on earth did Michelle, and, I believe, Jamie Curtis, agree to this film.",

The colors are vibrant, alternate realities imaginative, and characters interesting. It's also way funnier than I expected, both in dialogue and physical action humor. Really brings the action comedy of Jackie Chan into a contemporary reimagining.Cast is solid, with the actress for Joy being far better than I expected. She demonstrated a wide range in this role and nailed every end of her emotional spectrum. Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy. Quan, and Jaimie Lee Curtis also do an equally commendable job, but that's not as surprising coming from seasoned actors.The movie's long and though there's little fat & all loose ends are tied up, you're still left wondering how far into the story you've gotten at every turn. There's not exactly a definite fix here, but it was one of the few things I think this film could have improved on.It's a creative story even if it was confusing for me, solid action, great comedy, fantastic actors, and a reasonably compelling set of character arcs.",

People just immediately started excitedly talking about what they had just experienced.Image if Picasso made a film that combined the Matrix with Cloud Atlas. It tells a very profound but relatable story about the importance in a seemingly meaningless world of valuing kindness and family/friends over all else, even if it doesn't always make sense.It does this by shooting a firehouse of storytelling twists and visual imagery at you for 2.5 hours that at times starts to feel exhausting but in the end...you realize was a necessary metaphor for the complexity of life and the infinite set of choices we make in life.This is a kind of movie that comes along once every 20 years.

Easily the best part of the film, she is spectacular in every scene, with every motion, in every universe she inhabits. Truly a magnificent performance. Ke Huy Quan is also strong in a mostly meek, often comic, role. Beyond that, well, it's a lot of overwrought emotion and bad martial art set pieces. Not a particular fan of sci-fi or martial arts films myself, I can only surmise that the slo-mo and sped-up fight scenes could not possibly represent state of the art technology, as it was more cartoonish than action packed.Given this kind of science fiction film, with its unabashedly childish conception of what the constitutes a 'multiverse', a significant heap of suspension of disbelief is required. But even at that, the weirdness-for-weirdness sake (which the film freely acknowledges) just kind of falls flat. Even as the film shares a wink with the audience at its own absurdity, the humor plays more as mitigating audience expectations. As if to say 'we're really just joking about his schlock'. And after it all, the message is essentially the same as you get in reading Kurt Vonnegut, but with fewer laughs.I would absolutely recommend for anyone who wants to see Michelle Yeoh in a beautiful performance.

Like Matrix film franchise which came before it we see originality. The screenplay must probably characterized by smash cuts and jumps. The stunt choreography is impeccable and would be cherished by all. Going by a word from the movie's title \" everything \" we are met with various genres everything from comedy to action and even Science fiction. Giving a positive remark may not be all that good for this day and age as the film despite it being original is not that unique in it's own path but however we all learn or derive our objectives from learning from others.Its a wonderful movie despite it made for fun it addresses the subject matter of LGBTQ lightly.

In the end, some viewers might find that it wasn't really about anything, in a straightforward kind of manner. In this regard I might give it a 7.From a novelty standpoint, I think it's really a fantastic piece of art, somewhere at a solid 9. We've seen multiverse stuff going to the extreme, e.g. In Rick and Morty, where nihilism, metafiction, and identity play a role as well and the \"everything happens\" part is interpreted in a very, very literal way, but much more doesn't come to my mind. Moreover, in non-cartoon cinema, it really feels like a first. The shots where they cycled through what felt like a good 100 frames of different incarnations of the main character where crazy, not just from an editing point of view but just as the experience of the viewer. It literally feels dizzying to watch it, particularly on a large screen.For the themes, the directors didn't shy away from ambitiously trying to incorporate many layers (as far as I interpret it). One obvious aspect is the Asian-American experience that is highlighted a bunch in the beginning. As Anne Anlin Cheng put it, the movie plays with the Asian pendent of Afro-pessimism (which has gained some traction recently), Asian-pessimism. I'm sure she would have a lot to say about it, and I can only figure how in analogy to Afro-pessimism, the confrontation in the film tries to stipulate the 'yellow woman' as Cheng might posit the Asian body as she does in her work, as a mode of transport of vaguely liberal identity-based analysis (similar to the slightly topical book by Charles Yu, Interior Chinatown, 2020). This mode of transport is questioned and in the film ultimately left only touched upon (e.g. The scene of the hot dog universe where the main character has a relationship with the tax accountant), emphasizing the internal redemption with her daughter.Another more or less straightforward interpretation is the depression mother and daughter go through, most of the imagery serving as an underscore of the various facets of said depression. Not only does nothing matter, but while it seems to matter, we witness its decay, the horrid circumstances that lead us down the path to death (the bagel as a dadaist-nihilist image), even making redemption ultimately impossible. Unless, well, spoiler alert, in the end redemption was possible in some sort of Dan Harmon-esque \"let's watch TV and not bother\" way.One last bit that I really liked was the metafictional scenes, where the main character was playing herself, dragging me, the audience, literally into the boat, making us think about our own place in the multiverse. Ending the film with some credits in the middle of it (as did The Simpsons in the The Simpsons movie) was great and works every time for me, even though some viewers might find it a bit trite.All in all it's really worthwhile, even if you are not into (vaguely) experimental stuff. There are so many themes going on that there will be enough to talk about for everyone. And if you hate overinterpreted/overinterpretable postmodern cinema, watch it for the crazy-ass pictures and fantastic soundtrack.",

            "content": "Profound, heartfelt, surreal, absurd, and hilarious. Acting is top-notch. Absolutely worth the hype.A beautiful look at relationships between people: the complexity of mother/daughter relationships, the wonderful love story between Evelyn and Waymond, the fraught father/daughter relationship Evelyn has with her own father. Waymond (in his many forms) was a standout character in a film full of standout characters - he's an important re-definition of both Asian male masculinity and what a good life partner really looks like.EEAAO captures the immigrant experience perfectly (there were multiple times where I felt \"yep, that's exactly it!\" while falling off my chair laughing), interweaving universal themes of regret, nihilism and love (both familial and romantic). Its central thesis is that 'life' is less about the destination than it is about the journey and the relationships we build on that journey - a point the film underscores in its constantly self-reflexive arcs.Standout scene: Waymond with the bum bag and the chapstick. I can't say more, it'll ruin the scene.Every actor is phenomenal - Ke Huy Quan as Waymond zips through different Waymonds without a hitch, carrying the heart and the strength of the character in every iteration of Waymond. I read that Quan went into production as he struggled to find acting roles for Asian men in US cinema - given his performance in EEAAO, it's truly our loss that we've missed his talent on our screens for a few decades. Michelle Yeoh, of course, carries the weight of Evelyn's story with sincerity, ease and gravitas, while also being incredibly funny (\"very busy today!\" will never not be hilarious). And Stephanie Hsu as Joy really makes you want to cheer her on: balanced against the depths of her despair is a chaotic exuberance and a wild hope that really builds depth of character.I enjoyed the casual queer relationship and how it both mattered (eg. In terms of Joy coming out to her grandfather, in Joy and Evelyn's interactions) and didn't matter (Joy and Becky's relationship is one of the few solid and unchanging parts of the story). Yeoh and Hsu, as Evelyn and Joy, completely sell their complicated love for each other - alongside the powerful medium of classic Asian mother nagging, of course.This film, its actors, filmmakers/directors, and VFX artists deserve an Oscar nomination - both for the importance of the story they're telling, and the powerful and entertaining way in which they've pulled this off. Can't recommend this more.",

My personal rating would be lower.Which is unfortunate because there's a truly great 100 minute 10/10 film in here. But it's ruined by pacing issues and a mix of alternate reality shenanigans. Half of which I loved and half of which I hated. And when you're switching from great to terrible to boring and back again every minute you just end up with whiplash.-------------Part 1 has by far the worst pacing issues. At 85 minutes it could be an entire movie by itself and you really feel it. It takes far too long to get going, has a really good middle third, and then starts getting lost again.You could cut half an hour out and the film would be much better for it.Then as for the shenanigans. Some of them worked for me and some of them just did not. At all. And they kept taking me out of the great experience I was having.The sex toys in particular I would remove entirely. For a movie that gets surprisingly mature and profound, they were immediately jarring whenever they came up. It didn't come off as whacky and absurd, just juvenile. And incredibly overdone.The rest I could probably live with if the film weren't dragging on so much, but if I was going to vote I'd also get rid of the hot dog universe and the raccoon. Both were fun, for about a minute. And then just increasingly annoying whenever they came back.So maybe it's back to pacing issues as the #1 problem from which all else stems.----------------------Ultimately then, an interesting but frustrating experience. I'm glad I saw it, and I'd like to see more films try and do something different with the formula.But thanks to the editing and the pacing, it's a film that I appreciated more than I actually enjoy watching.",

That's how crazy and original this film is.I do get some of the negative reviews, as this film isn't for everyone. But, if you're into multiverse type films, it's easily one of the best. There are so many Multiverse ideas packed into this film, it will be hard to catch them all in the first viewing.I've been a film buff since a child so have pretty much seen everything there is. This is one of those films that will blow you away with its originality similar to Eternal Sunshine, Her, Being John Malkovich, Mr. Nobody or other films of that ilk. Easily a 9/10 and will watch again to catch everything missed on the first viewing.P. S. For other films about the Multiverse and alternate realities, there's a good list of films at kneelbeforezod.io/tag/sci-fi-alternate-history-films/",

            "review_title": "Postmodern but not Pretentious",
            "content": "It is sadly quite common for new movies nowadays to be politically correct in a forced manner. Token racial characters are inserted into movies without any real reason than to diversify the roster. This is not the case here. This movie has Asian culture and philosophy onboard not just token Asians. Furthermore, it is not politically correct, as it makes fun of stereotypes and in general it does not take itself too seriously. This makes for an entertaining watch, that is filled with funny action sequences and all kinds of dark humor.In a multidimensional universe where everything and anything that can happen, will happen, is there a reason for morality? Is there even any kind of meaning? The simple answer is no. This kind of nihilism manifests in the postmodern world through the philosophy of existentialism. In its foundational premises the philosophy revolves around the fact that existence comes before essence, and thus no true meaning is a given for one's life but must be created through culture or other means. Nietzsche took this premise to question the nature of morality itself and how it is built artificially and can't be espoused rationally and universally. First, one character who grasps this lack of meaning and purpose struggles in mental anguish and adopts Albert Camus' absurdity ideals, just trying to enjoy the ridiculous nature of the universe. As this gets old though, the character begins to adopt Kierkegaard's idea of the abyss and despair in the form of the abyssal bagel. A multidimensional entity that acts as a black hole that swallows everything, created by the character to help end the suffering of the meaningless world and the hopelessness. In terms of overall message, it does not try to be subtle, the message is kindness and love. The way to best nihilism and answer the existential question, is not to answer it, but to dodge it entirely and focus on each other; the fellow humans that we can help ease their suffering through acts of kindness and compassion. Although a pretty standard good message, it is delivered in a captivating way and in an entertaining envelope.The cinematography is quite intriguing and done in a very cool way. With striking visuals that capture the absurdity of multidimensional existence. The CGI here serves the movie, rather than take away from it. The cast is brilliant and really carries this movie in terms of humor delivery and emotional release. That is except for the daughter, Joy, who I personally found irritating and too clich\u00e9 in terms of her character design (the teenager trope is really overused). Other than that the movie is quite solid and I would definitely recommend for others.",

The characters seemed very natural and fitting, nothing felt forced in any way.My personal taste is that I usually don't like comedy movies from China because they tend to be over the top crazy and not make that much sense but this one really changed my opinion. It is crazy, yes, but in a good way, I would say really on the line of being too crazy but not yet. Most importantly the plot wasn't hurt by the craziness in any way so it is still briliant movie story-wise.As critical as I usually am to movies, I am honestly giving this movie 10/10 and ranking it among my Top 5 movies while being the Top 2022 movie (and I watch a lot of movies).",

This is maybe the most entertaining but excellently written movie that I'll ever see. The humor is great, combining both slapstick and observational comedy. The action scenes are just standalone masterpieces. The cinematography is just refreshingly good. But I wanted to basically talk about two things here, the acting and the message.First, the cast is just plain awesome. Everybody has already heaped praise on Michelle Yeoh's outstanding performance, but I was more engrossed in Stephanie Hsu's Joy. She has easily secured her place as the best antagonist I've ever watched. Not only is she brilliantly written and acted, I just found her way too relatable. She is maybe one of the best teenage/Gen Z antagonists I have seen, and I was honestly rooting for her the entire movie. Also, they make a very adorable couple(her and Becky).Finally, the message. The movie does something most movies don't even think about. It works hard to resolve it's conflict, which is basically existentialism. It somehow manages to put a optimistic spin on such a nihilistic concept, and makes it satisfying.Also, this movie made me laugh and cry with just two rocks. No dialogue, no music, just two rocks at the edge of a cliff. So if you haven't watched this yet, just go see it. Pirate it, buy it, idc, just see it.This is the true Multiverse of Madness. The 1 minute shot of Evelyn across thousands of multiverses is the best shot in entertainment history. THE BEST!",

Does any of this life actually matter or is it just what you choose to do with your time? Is there any innate reason for us being here or do we just make it up as we go along? I understand exactly how the daughter was feeling as if she was just so tired of going on and on in a box, all for it to end with so little having been accomplished. The visuals in this movie are eye-popping, and this was a fun adventure with parallels to The Matrix, but way cooler! Made me wish I could escape from my life and hop into another me in another universe. I guess we just need to understand and love the people in our lives for who they are. Take it or leave it, all or nothing. Use what little time you have together and make the best of it while you can. What else is life besides what we make it?

Demons, possession, extremely fast paced, literal good vs evil etc.The pacing in this film is incredibly quick, with most hollywood films being too slow, this film is too fast. So many different ideas, so many different thoughts, all whizzing past you at a tiring speed. Although its fast with many moving parts, theres zero depth, like a rambling schizophrenic going 1000 words a minute.Coming back to the crazyness, this film goes full on 12/10 in wackiness, bizarreness and other abstract outside the box ideas. Just like the pacing, its more schizophrenic randomness rather than having rhyme or reason.The martial arts are good, the technical side and minimal CGI is always nice to see, but its all rather simple with zero depth. This film displays more like a live theatre production, with you constantly wondering when the literal curtains will fall and youll have to start clapping, instead of being a well shot, well planned, well thought out film.If youre looking for a super random, almost psychedelic, asian stage show experience, this is it. But if you want anything resembling a coherent film, you will be disappointed. This experiment also runs way too long at 2h20m, we all enjoy some crazy, but not for that period of time.",

I don't think the alternative lifestyle theme took the movie anywhere either and was more of a distraction than anything else. The actors themselves were absolutely fantastic. I really enjoyed all of them. I'm giving the movie a 5 out of 10 because it was very well made but ultimately disturbing. Time for some mental bleach.",

This film is Madness, and it's bonkers! Depending on how Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness goes, this might be the most bonkers multiverse film of the year! It goes into many spots which are weird, and that's this movie in one word: Weird. And not only is it a great multiversal superhero story, it's a family movie, an adventure movie, a thriller movie, and a emotional movie. It packs a punch on what it does with the plot and villain and characters, and the surprises this movie has in line for the audience is so worth it!I know you probably didn't have Everything Everywhere All At Once on your movie radar to go watch, but your going to be doing yourself a MASSIVE favour if you buy a ticket and go see this masterpiece!8.5/10.",

Considering, some of these are my favorite movies, and the early high praise I saw for this movie, I thought I would love it, but it was awful and I kept waiting for it to get better.The main character is having a mental breakdown/existential crisis and hallucinating solutions to mending her personal relationships with her husband and daughter, while going through a tax audit. In this hallucination, she jumps to different multiverse versions of herself, through random achievements, which most often come in the form of self-harm or an emotional act. How does getting an object stuck up your butt get you your black belt multiverse version? Some writer came up with these completely arbitrary jumping achievements and I was consistently pulled out of my suspension of disbelief because of how ridiculously hard they were trying to make it funny through absurdity, but it fell completely flat for me.Similar to how \"Joker\" was praised by many as amazing by those not aware of \"The King of Comedy\" and \"Taxi Driver,\" this movie is getting the same praise by those that haven't attended day 1 of Philosophy 101.",

            "content": "I have heard so much hype coming from this film even before its release. As I have finally gotten to watch it on the big screen, there are so many words that I can use to describe my experience towards the movie. And that is mostly positive things that are hard to be put into words due to how Everything Everywhere All at Once is a confusing yet a thrilling and entertaining film that I will never forget. To A24 pictures, this is probably the best that I have seen from you yet and here is why I loved it.Michelle Yeoh, who is best known for her role in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, is an absolute blast to watch. She is by far the most standout but even the whole cast as well delivered when they are given screen time throughout the film. I love the fact that her bickering and being confusing makes a whole lot of sense to her because I too, as an audience member, was very confused at what's really going on. But by the time she eventually learns to acknowledge her problems and flaws towards herself and her family, she becomes a lot more relatable.And yes, as I have stated before in the previous paragraphs, the film is absolutely confusing. In addition to this, it was a non-stop rollercoaster of craziness and off-the-top humor, particularly sexual jokes, that added more fuel to the fire of confusion that I am getting. The action sequences though are also cool and not to mention how funny the jokes delivered by everyone in the cast, in particular is Jamie Lee Curtis who I was surprised was part of this movie.I am also happy that this is one of those films that does feature the element of the what-if routes. Seeing what Michelle Yeoh's protagonist could have been in other universes is a great and also relatable way to the audience because we also imagined what our lives would have been if we took the other choices in life. For instance, I am currently taking political science as my program but never in the back of my head would stop thinking if I took up film studies or even journalism. Or what would happen if I was married or just stayed single for the rest of my life.Remember the iconic quote of Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop \"whatever happens, happens\" - this basically sums up my love for the movie and interpretation to reality. Just like the movie, sometimes there we always be moments that you will face a difficult situation and as you start to think that it would have been better if I lived another life, always remember that sometimes, living your life to the fullest in all the mishaps you experienced with the people you are stuck with is better than regretting everything that made you come to this point of your life.So basically, even though I said Hustle was my favorite movie of 2022, it seems like Everything Everywhere All at Once has just topped my list. Please Oscar, nominate this film for Best Picture and give Michelle Yeoh her very first Best Actress nomination because she literally carried the film the entire way through. Yes, there is more to come in the second half of the year but I bet no film can be as standout as what the Kwans did. If you haven't seen this film, I would be very jealous of you because you are going to have an exhilarating yet memorable ride with the movie.",

It is like a production where the director keeps changing his mind halfway through a scene and the stage manager forgets to take notes, I can't imagine being offered this script as an actor, and then agreeing to do it. I also agree with a prior reviewer - there absolutely needs to be a flashing light warning with this film. I think part of the confusion may be to reflect what is going on in the lead character's mind - just a bit overkill.

Like a lot of other perfect films cinema bank doesn't do it justice, I hope that word of mouth, home video and streaming gets it the views and appreciation the love and act put into this fantastic film.I don't know how the film makers made this, and kept the viewer in touch and not lost in the mind bending tale.

The executions of how this took place was didn't. In Dr Strange it was witchcraft and in Everything Everywhere it was science that looked very low tech. Just headsets.In addition though, this movie explores family relationships and the importance of them and how we hurt each other as families. And how we give up a more successful life for families. Just how we learn to value love and relationships over world success and personal achievements. That having a family with pain of poverty and failures can make us not appreciate our families and relationships.How to repair the damage done to family relationships through mistakes in the past.It just seems so easy to repair? The world and failures don't matter as long as you succeed as a family and relationships.The movie was messy and all over the place but still easy to follow. It has interesting imagery but also looked low budget. But it looked high tech with a budget.It looked indie and campy and unique without being unique. It felt like it answered everything but answered nothing. It's a movie of contradictions. So oddly, I find myself really unable to complain about it.",

            "content": "First off, this is my first IMDB review. I've wondered many times when would I finally publish one but I always felt the movies spoke for themselves, and also that there are so many people around the world reviewing here that it would simply be 'a waste of time'. Not for this movie, it isn't.Second of all, I am a fan of old school cinema, even though I enjoy a modern flick from time to time. However, in recent years I don't think I watched anything that really moved me or made me care. That means when I actually watch something beyond the year 2000, I go in with extremely low expectations, basically that I will be watching trash. I would definitely describe myself as a pretentious viewer, meaning I really need substance in a movie to really like it.Third, this movie inspired me to a degree I literally feel I am just a bit better as a person after watching it. So this is more of a praise than an actual review. I won't go into detail about any facet of the movie; just go watch it. What I want to share is the overall impact it had on my as a viewer. So here it goes:My first impression was basically boredom. I didn't really understand what the writers were getting at; it this a comedy, a superhero flick, or what? All I knew going in was the movie is supposed to be 'great'. The movie starts out slow, which in hindsight is good - the pacing is on point as the viewer is slowly eased into the characters and story. I don't watch trailers, so if you're like me, you're lucky to watch this not knowing what a wild ride you are in for. The whole 'multiverse' concept is simple, yet overused these days and I was very, very disappointed with how it was handled in, say, Dr. Strange: Multiverse of Madness (yep, truly maddening plotholes and zero logic in that one). It's also not so easy to pull off the visuals, SFX and the whole narrative around that sort of thing. However, in EEAaO, it's handled brilliantly, in my opinion. Without taking themselves or the movie too seriously, the writers and the director manage to masterfully engage you in an almost real-life scenario where endless possibilities exist. Most, if not all of the visuals are breathtaking and mesmerising, taking full advantage of the multiverse concept inside the confines of the story, without exaggerating too much or keeping it too low-key for such an ambitious idea. The kung-fu elements I felt where spot on, not relying on 'magic' or 'superpowers' (even though we get a taste of that too, at one point).Smart and grown-up humour is all over the place too, adding a lighter tone yet not sacrificing the overall atmosphere which is still serious enough to get one thinking and feeling more deeply. The humour itself is definitely a breath of fresh air - it's weird and at times - even kinky, but it does not cross the line too much, it's just enough to be different and really funny at the same time. It's adult aspects are not hard to draw parallels to, say, Deadpool type humour, but of course Deadpool's is way over the top, which is a sort of trademark there, but not here, thankfully.Speaking of depth, I felt this movie is not brilliant or profound, but still manages to pull intellectual and emotional strings enough to intrigue all types of audiences. It has everything for everyone (pun not intended), from teenagers to grownups, from the casual viewer who seeks only spectacle to the more refined one that needs a bit of flare and meaning in every scene. The overall message is so sweet and simple it can appeal to anyone - perhaps only the people looking for completely empty films would not understand or care what the movie is really about - which I feel is Love, Compassion, Connection.Trying to dig a little deeper, in a world where metaphysics and now even science are bringing us ever closer to the idea of multiple, perhaps infinite universes and alternative dimensions, quantum fields and so forth, it's a really intriguing and interesting topic with a fresh spin to it. It also has very valid moral questions inserted into that, again, in a world where definitive moral and even existential values seem to be blurring more and more.Now, about some key elements of the movie - plot (script), direction, dialogue, acting, Action/SFX, sound/music:I found the plot quite well constructed and executed, it handles both the story and multiverse concept quite well. Maybe multiple views and a more detailed analysis will no doubt reveal inconsistencies - the movie is so coherent and satisfying overall I believe such will be completely inconsequential. Character development is good, if not great, basically only the two major characters transform during the movie but it's still well thought out and executed. Maybe developing more secondary characters would have muddled the overall progression of the movie, so no real criticism there. The length of the movie is ideal - not too long, not too short, and to be honest, it felt longer than it was, in a good way. The ending was not spectacular but wrapped up things nice and neat, focusing on the message and not so much on the metaphysics, which I felt was a good choice. * 9/10 *The direction I found masterful, really impressive shots, having to combine elaborate action sequences with steady, almost slow emotional moments. * 10/10 *The dialogue is by no means brilliant, and I found it possibly the only element a bit lacking, especially towards the end (mainly some unnecessary repetition); however, compared to some other modern movies it outshines them all in this aspect. * 8/10 *The acting is really solid here, most of the central characters are Asian-American, which is a breath of fresh air as far as I'm concerned, the main character is an Asian woman and I thought she did a great job, she is by no means a Mary Sue character, she has her flaws and builds on them how it should be. Even the smaller roles are really well acted and filled with substance. The stuntmen and body doubles deserve and extra mention. Basically, everyone is really into the project, which can be felt and is always a very good sign. * 10/10 *The action bits are well choreographed, awesome to watch and never dull (compare that to John Wick, for example - the action there to me *looks* good but is very monotonous and overall, boring). Here, the kung-fu elements combined with the madness of the multiverse come off real well, are blended well and are always fresh and interesting, often funny and wild. The SFX only add to this feeling as they never felt cheap or ripped off - there are even some obvious nods to the Matrix movies which I think was very nice and respectful, again adding an extra layer of fun while not ruining the originality or freshness of this film. * 10/10 *The quality of sound effects and music was really high, I felt engrossed by every hit and every note, the music does not lead or distract but amplifies what's happening on screen. There is some more originality here, but I'll leave you to explore that for yourself. * 10/10 *Overall judgement - this movie left me feeling inspired, refreshed, and most of all - entertained. I find all this to be rare in recent productions. The movie is certainly not perfect, but I think it's really close to perfection for it's genre and the message I felt it tries to convey. In a few words - go see it if you already didn't, it's worth every minute!!",

The movie initally appears quite disjointed and confusing but as it progresses the emotional connection takes over and the inticacies of each character in each timeline becomes part of the whole and one processes it as such. I really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it. Truly excellent! Michelle Yeoh as the main character is a \"shape shifter\" in the sense that she can change her demeanor and physical actions as she progresses on her journey. James Hong seems to have been around for ever as an actor and he adds a familiar face to the scene which incorporates drama and comedy in a seamless fashion always taking you to another level. Jamie Lee Curtis is magnificent in a role that you would never expect her to play yet she pulls it off with a memorable performance. Ke Huy Quan who plays the husband from different timelines also brings a believability to the movie and Stephanie Ann Hsu who plays the daughter is able to morph personality and bring shock and awe to the situation. I highly recommend this movie.",

Which was overall a missed opportunity and a disappointment. The film brought more and clear understanding about the concept of the multiverse instead of complicating things to connect with a broader and wider universe like the MCU. The film also stands out more from other versions and takes of the concept of the multiverse due to its standalone nature and its own take on how the structure of the multiverse works.To wrap this up, \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" is an achievement in filmmaking from its cast of characters , story and its many themes and connections to the real world, to the shear insanity of weirdness that it gives, only to keep it contained, only pushing the boundaries when it needs to.This is a MUST see for movie fans.One of my favorite films of last year.",

The soundtrack is an ear massage. The visuals are good. The story is chaotic and strange; it's everything. The setting spans multiple alternate realities; it takes you everywhere. I imagine that people who prefer an \"organized\" movie may find this one difficult to watch and understand. The first 1/3 of the movie raises so many questions, but don't worry.

I think the hot dog finger universe and Racacoonie universe are regarded as unpalatable and useless the most, but they do have a role in the film. For example, the hot dog fingers universe is required for Evelyn to accept her daughter's sexuality and realise the usefulness in everything. And for the Racacoonie, it is important in the sense of not feeling shameful to depend on others when one is in need and giving back when one is capable. People tend to disregard these scenes too soon because of their absurdity.Open your mind, and I am sure you can feel it. (I cry even by watching reactions, it is how powerful it is).",

I honestly was not expecting this movie to be built around a family delivered through a multiverse of astounding scenes and imagery but I was pleasantly surprised and intrigued by it. Particularly impressed by the brilliant Michelle Yeoh and the underhyped performance of Ke Huy Quan.However, considering the high standards the movie sets for itself - despite the brilliance of its characters, how the story is told, and how the movie's plot unfolds, and - if Everything, Everywhere, All at Once is perceived as the fast-paced drama it is albeit set across a multiverse: The movie underdelivers. To be clear, yes, the movie borrows a lot from multiple genres but at its core it is mostly a drama.In that light, it struggles to provide sufficient emotional fulfillment by the end of the movie and all the brilliance of the movie's methodology amounts to little. It also fails to deliver anything new or unique to match its multiversal ambitions, undermining its brilliance with a bagel. Point being: The movie shows that it can tell its story across a multiverse but ultimately does not prove that it has a reason to do so.Also, while Stephanie Hsu was good for the most part, I think she perhaps lacked a functional range to portray the varieties of her character. Thus contributing to the emotional gap at the end of the movie.Overall, it's a mostly superb movie, seriously original and put together with Oscar worthy editing. If there was one Oscar this movie would easily win, it would have to be for the editing work.",

I have questioned countless times the meaning of life, been close to suicide, suffered from constant depressions, and wondered how life would be if I had chosen the other path, or any path at all. But nothing hits deeper than the sense of nothingness that comes up when you get a glimpse of all the alternate universes you could've experienced, which is also a real math principle given the infinite size of the one we live in. Everything, Everywhere, All at Once will relate to each of your life memories and draw a picture to the frightening feelings the anxious, unstoppable and unforgivable world has put you through, but to say CHILL, LOVE and DONT WORRY TOO MUCH.

It turns out one of her counterparts is the one who have found out about the dimension jumping and because of that, things went pear-shaped really quickly after a traveler started becoming too powerful. Evelyn is suddenly approached by a husband from another dimension and give the unlikely task of fixing everything. Why?

            "content": "Something I thoroughly enjoyed about this film is that amongst all of these fight scenes and action there is a grounded storyline, a clear lesson, something to take away from that movie. Many action films released as of late lack substance, which gives the action no meaning or emotion, leading the audience to become disinterested. I had heard very positive reviews about this film, people saying that after they had watched it they believed it to be their new favourite film. I enjoyed this film, it was imaginative, created and portrayed the idea of the multiverse in a way that I had never seen before. This film uses editing, costume, and colour, effectively, in a number of ways to tell this story in the best way it could.The choreography in the fight scenes were fantastic and even highlighted this film's creativity, executed in such an elegant fashion to where the movements of a character is seamless, effortless yet still convincing enough to a degree that matches this film's tone, in terms of realism. Furthermore the cinematography, together with the composition and use of levels in this film, specifically the use of push ins, created and maintained that cinematic and exciting feeling needed in scenes of action or even emotion. The story of this film touches on many themes and subjects, such as: coming of age, finding yourself, and even having pride in who you are. This relatable storyline of a parent raising their child would gravitate to the majority of the audience, from either the parent or child's perspective. Because ultimately the story is the most important component of a film, the quality of a story absolutely cannot be hidden by an excess amount of CGI or acting, which doesn't apply to this film at all.The acting of this was great, comedic and gave me a sense of Back to The Future with the actors playing themselves across different time periods, or in this case universes within the multiverse. I want to mention a specific moment where lighting/ colouring further immersed me in the film which is where The mother and her husband are staring into each other's eyes in her moment of realisation, there are an array of lights shining on both of their faces which could be interpreted as a representation of their feelings to be the rekindled optimism and realised affection. It could also be a method to show all of the multiverse in chaos and prosperity, contradicting the nature of this scene to be soured by one feeling; love. I believed the ending to this film to be perfect, it shows that although life may continue as it always has, your entire life would have completely changed, being more reassured, and happy with your life. I thought the dialogue was written very well, and thinking about it the entirety of this film could be a metaphor for this relationship between the mother and daughter, as well as, this period of change they are both going through at different ages. This film teaches the audience to be grateful for the place you are in, rather than wishing you were this or that, or wondering 'what if?', learning to be happy and embracing change whenever it may hit you in life.",

On a technical level, this movie is a masterpiece; I felt levitating watching it and had an amazing euphoric experience.It has a phenomenal screenplay, embodies multiple genres and it balances everything. It was overwhelming from the beginning, moving, had a ridiculous twisting plot and it was terrific, beautiful, funny, emotional and deep with a perfect ending.As soon as it ended, I told my movies buddy I needed to take a break to have it sink in before we talk about it. Then, we started talking and found it very complicated at the beginning but simple at the end, detailed and scattered at the beginning but wisely connecting the dots at the end and as we kept thinking, we soon noticed the depth of the message this movie conveys. It kept us engaged at every scene, we were laughing, we were crying, and thinking and it had incredible levels of emotions with some heart-warming moments. Michele Yeoh has delivered an Oscar-deserving act and the supporting cast has done an amazing job.It is my top 2022 recommendation, go watch and you will thank me.",

The scene where the husband has to explain the premise is so poorly written that they had to spread it out over several scenes when it was completely unnecessary.

The over the top aspects littered all in the movie just didn't do it for me. I'm not opposed to weird things and odd stuff happening as long as it makes sense or at least enhances the movie. This movie just had weird and, to me, very corny and cartoony things happening that made the movie feel lame and not intelligent, which a complex storyline should have. Just putting weird stuff for the sake of it doesn't make it work well and doesn't make the movie good.I went into the movie not hearing about it from anyone who had seen it so I guess my expectations of the direction they were going to go was not in the right mindset. There were even a few parts that probably would have been funny if I wasn't so unimpressed with this film and that I spent over 2 hours on another movie that is hyped up and again was not good.I give it 4 stars just because it is creative and the directing must have been difficult with so many odd things changing and happening all at once. But that is really being generous because I just didn't like the movie. The basis had potential but I think the director just really fell short on his delivery of concept. And if that is what the writers were going for then I am surprised people wanted to make it.",

It starts out by introducing us to Evelyn, Waymond, their daughter Joy, and their laundromat. They have some issues with their taxes and have to report to an IRS examiner. From the moment they arrive at the examiners office and sit at the desk the movie changes genres completely. It goes from a movie about a small business owner and taxes to a fantastic sci-fi adventure. It's a lot to take in all at once, but that's what makes it even more interesting. We are thrown straight into the adventure just like Evelyn is. Boy, what an adventure. I won't go into detail, because honestly it's too much to explain. Behind all of the amazing special effects, action sequences, and hilarious jokes, this film is a wonderful story about family and appreciating the little things.

It also teaches us how we should think of our lives. You may believe that alternate universes do exist. You may think that our lives are pointless because we could have lived in any of these universes and lived through all the ups and downs. The movie tells you that you are wrong.We humans possess a natural instinct to render positive meaning to what we sense. That is why everything we have experienced seems to be real. Think about dreams. When you are having a dream, you never realize that you are dreaming regardless of what you see inside the dream. It is this very instinct that makes life possible. We take our life seriously and try to make the best of it because we believe it to be positive, real, and worth-living, otherwise there is no way we can survive.It does not really matter whether the world we live in is actually real. In a Matrix-sense way of thinking, we may all live in a virtual reality and everything we feel is nothing more than electrical signals in the brain. What matters is that even inside this virtual reality we can render meaning to our lives and treat it as if it is real. This is the persistence of the survival instinct - it drives us to secure the best ourcome in whatever circumstances we find ourselves. It is this spirit that makes us human beings.Next time when someone calls you naive because your are being optimistic, tell them you are not being naive.",

Or like when I actually was able to translate my dream songs they ended up sucking quite badly.In any case, this experience failed for me. But the core message was nice.

It has been carrying a lot of spectators and let them with a sense of joy and freedom in the end.

Some of the acting was good, but the pretentious premiss was totally lacking in coherence and credibility. It was, however, a nice assembly of costumes which in themselves might garner an Academy Award, but that would be about it. The amount of time and money put into the brief displays of costuming don't translate into the disjointed undeveloped plot, which boils down to nothing more than a display of bloody martial arts with lots of high-school-boy-humor. Even Michelle Yeoh couldn't transcend those low moments...which are pervasive if you sit back and analyze the proceedings.I felt no emotional connection with anyone in the film, despite the many tears milked in the hope that the audience would care enough about the characters to buy into them...which apparently a majority of reviewers did (!)

So much that was supposed to be \"funny\" was actually crude, cruel, violent, and sophomoric. The story line was simple yet still not well explained. The acting was not subtle or masterful. We watched the whole thing and in the end could not believe that this is a highly rated movie. This movie is an example of why I rarely watch award shows. Award shows are mostly the privileged patting each other on the backs. But I digress- this movie is not good. This movie is massively overrated, not because I didn't like it, but because it stinks.

Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert absolutely knock it out of the park with superb writing and fantastic direction and action that is just bonkers enough to make sense and yet imaginative enough to keep you thoroughly entertained.The movie is a fresh breath of air amongst the recently developing crowd of multiverse flicks. Never does it shy away from the weirdness or trying to offer complicated explanations which gives room to explore the core characters and the underlying story. This movie will leave you playing out your own What If scenarios in your head, and how the slightest decision can lead to drastic differences in life. Its not a new concept but never has it been explored from the perspective of a relatable story of an ordinary household with common problems which are very much at the heart of it all.The performances explore the widest range of emotions I have ever seen. Michelle Yeoh gives a career best performance in the role of Evelyn, who is trying to be a good Wife, Mother, Daughter and laundromat owner. Trying to be Everywhere, do Everything all on her own which later ties very well into the multiverse concepts. This is a character she plays to perfection and in my humble opinion is definitely worthy of an Oscar nomination at the very least if not a win. The support cast Stephanie Hsu (Joy) also gives a well layered performance. She flushes out the nuances of being different in a conservative family very well and beautifully channels the frustrations. Ke Huy Quan is also a great support.To sum it all up, the movie is Hilarious, Heartfelt and Relatable, ALL AT ONCE.",

You find the essence, you find the beauty, you find the secret of humanity. You even find the key to happiness, through simple acts. By simply listening to those around you. By simply trying to make others happy. And in my opinion, the 11 Oscar nominations are more than deserving! It is pure beauty, from start to finish.Or, of course, you can just see it as a martial arts film. The choice is yours.",

This movie is a reminder for us to be kind, to be understanding and caring, and to be open to new possibilities.

There are some parts that seem a little far fetched but the main idea behind the movie in my opinion more than makes up for the parts that seem to drift. It probably could have been delivered a little better in parts.A little more in-depth on my idea of the meaning of the movie.In my opinion the idea of the multiverse that exsists in this movie is something that differs from our current idea of the multiverse from Marvel as an example. I believe it's more of an idea of what you could have become had things been different in life and a way to connect with those lives, where things played out different. Just the idea behind that is intriguing to me.Overall a movie I would recommend you watch. But also go into it with an open mind and allow yourself to enjoy it.Thanks for taking the time to read my review....",

Of listening and understanding our place in the cosmos.The acting is flawless as is the casting. The visuals are absolutely mind blowing.As my review title states, the movie reminded me in part of the Matrix but better and yes, on an acid trip. I loved the action scenes and the humor throughout.

They are about to be audited by an IRS agent (a saucy Jamie Lee Curtis) when all of the characters seemingly enter a nonsensical \"multiverse\".The first 20 minutes are so solidly written and acted that I wonder what the final result would have been had if just abandoned the absurdist concept and presented a straightforward narrative instead. Of course, that's not what this filmmakers are trying to do, but at 140 minutes it wears it welcome quickly.While I do admire the film for it's originality, it becomes so entrenched in its own over the top silliness you almost wonder what the point of any of this is.",

Think of this as two camps; one born out of Atheism and the other from religion. Religion views it as one universe that is orderly while the other chaotic. But this movie falls flat on its face because it proposes that from viewing / participating from a alternate, chaotic universe you could solve your earthly problems. This is not impressive philosophy but rather bland and flawed and the creators tried to make up for it with some feeble comic elements. Another nuisance was the constant barrage of fast cross cutting and cutaway in and out of parallel universes. This is only done one or 2 times preferably in the 3rd act to tie loose ends to give audiences insight into the character's feelings and thoughts, but here it felt like we are engaged in a video game.",

I was immediately captured in the beginning, but I'll admit that this film got weirder and weirder to the point that I almost stopped watching it. Without spoiling anything, let me just say I'm glad I stuck with the film until the end. Despite the over the top ridiculousness of some of the scenes, this film successfully told a contemplative story that'll surprisingly tug at your heartstrings and keep you talking about this movie long after you've left the cinema. The cast was great. I'm glad I stuck with it, but I also don't see myself watching this again. The movie seemed longer than it actually is.",

            "content": "So, as someone who is deeply interested in philosophical questions, questions of depression and anxiety, this film should have been perfect for me. It actually is, in terms of asking and answering the big questions of humanity: Where are we ? Who are we ? Are we alone ? How can we go through this ? Alone ? As a family ? What are feelings ?I think the Daniels answer these question very easily, not cheeky at all, we are humans and we've got emotions, desires and wishes. It's what makes us human, our feelings, and we can live through these emotions and make connections to other people. It's how we can overcome anxiety, madness and desperation. It's a beautiful message and the film explores these themes with undeniable power and maturity.In addition, the film is a great production, it has some of the best fighting scenes I've seen in recent years, strong acting by its lead cast. It comes with clever dialogue, with beautiful pictures (as I'm referring to two stones talking to one another right next to a cliff), costumes, design, special effects - it's all there. A beautiful piece of art - and that what it really is in the end - a piece of art.But this piece of art comes with some cost. Really, I love the messages behind the movie. But I think that in the end it, of course, it can be an artwork, but it's also still a movie. And in-between all these multiverses, we sometimes don't know where we are. Humans, or as I should say -especially myself - still have the desire to know where we are and to hold on to that world we are living in right now. The film floods you with pictures, images, changes, fights, explosions, madness. Of course, this whole thing here is madness, our life is absurd. But in the end I watched a movie of which I expected to be entertained. And I was entertained, but it felt stressful. Almost exhausting. It was just too much. The pacing was too fast in my opinion. I would've needed more time to take a deep breath and ask myself what the hell I just saw. I also feel that the 140 minutes are too much. Don't get me wrong. I liked this, but I didn't enjoy the watch as much as I did it with other masterpieces or artworks, because there is still an opportunity to create these kinds of movies AND deliver an easier watch.I also want to mention, that I cried multiple times, especially in the end, where I think the film rewards the viewer brilliantly. But that reward was not enough in comparison to the demanding but also tiring parts in it.",

But listen, this is the perfect example of how strangely movies have come to be made today and why it might be worth questioning.Back in the day we have The Godfather and Memento for example - very focused on story and character arcs. No one single scene doesn't serve the higher purpose of the story. Each action scene carefully designed, again, to serve the story and perhaps even the catharsis of the film. And today we have the Super hero flicks. And Everything Everywhere All At Once fits into this superhero structure.It offers a concept, a world, a story, only to throw it in the bin in the 2nd act and do a bunch of actions scenes for no greater purpose than generating a dopamine rushed audience. The tempo and flickering lights and action is so very millennial. It's clearly made for a generation that is used to having their brains reward system massaged every millisecond by rolling screens.Everything Everywhere All At Once is like a half baked The Matrix on drugs with unicorn sprinkles all over it. Maybe you like that, and then that's great for you!But I was disappointed. The pace is too fast, the characters are underdeveloped, and the original concept stops developing early on only to be replaced by trippy action scenes. It's a video game kind of movie.

I cared about the characters (in some timelines) and wanted things to work out well for them.One complaint I have is that the science fiction part is never resolved. People from the future(?) or at least a different timeline are trying to get Evelyn to help them, and they are important in the first part of the film but not later.

It truly exemplifies the mental gymnastics your mind sometimes has to go through to come to a simple realization.I loved the concept of this film and the overarching themes are deep, emotional, and powerful. It explores topics like love, mental health, regret, and how simple, seemingly meaningless decisions have a butterfly effect on outcomes. For this alone, it is absolutely worth a watch.What didn't land for me, personally, was the attempt of comedy- mostly in the first act. It just felt too slapstick and ridiculous. Juxtaposed to the deeper themes I mentioned above, it just felt like it didn't mesh and cheapened the experience a bit.The second act got me back into the movie and I think it didn't a pretty good job and tying all the chaos together to show the viewer what this movie was truly about.Kudos to everyone that worked on this movie. It was chaotic for the viewer so I cannot even imagine the monumental effort that was put into directing, costume design, and editing this film.In conclusion- This film was a wild viewing experience, truly everything you've heard it to be.

This is usually only a feeling I get if it's not a very good screenplay or the director has no idea how to end it, or Hollywood decides to take over an ending.Michelle Yeung is an excellent and brilliant actress and now has shown she can be quite hilarious too.The daughter in the film I was very impressed with as a young actor with her many different takes on her character, and halfway through, I realized the dad was the kid in the 2nd Indiana Jones film!The costumes and sets were amazing, and some only appeared for 3 seconds! The directors get high props from basically everything all at once in the editing and filming, except the kitchen sink, as the saying goes.The screenwriters get props as well with some great comedy hot dog hand universe, and one of my favs was the bagel of existential despair.There are great moments of Zen-like silences of contemplation in the chaos, like the \"2 rocks\" overlooking the immense canyons of the creation scene.However, at its heart, it's really about family, unconditional love, the fears of losing out on something that passed us by when married, but foremost was the bonds of love and hate that all mothers and daughters struggle with we find comes universally, no matter what culture you come from.A must-see but not perfect or a masterpiece, but I do not believe that was the intent in the end. It's meant to be chaotic, silly, and philosophical.Sadly with way too many tv and films blasting multi-universe themes these days, I hope all can catch this film before it's too late, like when our pop culture ruins such brilliant ideas and themes if it hasn't already.

The core of the movie is a pretty cliched story, treading on very, very well-worn ground.It tackles a lot of big, weighty questions: the significance of our lives in an uncaring universe, midlife crisis, generational differences/overbearing parents, etc. But doesn't seem to have anything new or interesting to say about any of them. It just tells the same basic story with a new and flashy sheen.The humor is also hit or miss. It takes a lot of shots and some certainly land very well, but much of it also is in the \"OMG RANDOM!!1!one!\" school of humor, which I find grating but may work for others.The action choreography was very well done, and all of the fight sequences were a blast.I'm also not a big fan of it pushing certain stereotypes, such as small business owners talking trash about their customers whenever they're speaking in their native language.",

It is such a beautiful take on mental health and depression that doesn't come off as preachy. With such an intense topic they added humor, beauty, and just pure insanity that really makes this movie exceptional. It takes you through loopholes and just keeps getting more and more unbelievable and bonkers. The cuts through different realities and so many different possibilities of what the world could be like is really remarkable. Somehow it was not confusing, I mean granted when the introduction to the alternate realities happened I was a little bit taken aback because the start of the movie has such a different feel from where it ends up going. But nonetheless it was easy to follow for the most part and when it dawns on you what the truth behind all the alternate realities mean is just so extraordinary.Not only was the writing behind this movie so clever and intriguing, the acting was impeccable. Not one moment where I was taken out of the film from poor acting, I honestly felt like I was in a whole different world myself. One thing I absolutely have to address is the silent scene, everyone was holding their breaths in awe during the rock scene, so beautiful. The silence creates such an impact for the audience especially since everything surrounding it is pure chaos. But chaos in the best way possible.Watch this movie. It is incredibly written, acted, and edited. Even with the silliest of concepts it still came across as beautiful, this is a game changing movie.",

            "review_title": "Messy, Reactionary, but Good in Parts",
            "content": "This really is a film of two halves. The first half is great fun - the cast are excellent, there is plenty of visual flair in the direction and some excellent gags are delivered along the way, but beyond its mid-point the narrative discipline disintegrates and the film spirals into a disappointing mess. There's also a real problem with how reactionary this film appears to be in terms of how it represents women.Part of the problem is simply with the writing. The central conceit of the narrative proves too complex in its implications for the screenwriter to really make any sense of it. Essentially the central character finds herself skipping between alternate realities in a multiverse of infinite possibilities, where she is able to connect to alternate versions of herself in order to tap into skills (martial arts, gymnastics...) developed by her alter egos, and thus fight off a supervillain bent on the destruction of the whole multiverse (or something like that). The mechanics of this process are utterly confused, however. Initially she connects to alternate realities with the aid of a computer operated by allies in parallel world, but when they are wiped out she continues with this power even though the mechanism that makes it possible has apparently been destroyed, leaving us in a world where anything can happen as long as it serves the narrative, Whether it actually follows the narrative rules or not seems to no longer matter. All this is very frustrating - you can't establish rules in a fantasy narrative like this and then show so little concern for them as the narrative develops; its just lazy writing!Another issue that emerges is the mawkish direction the plotline takes. The second half of the film becomes largely focussed on fixing the dysfunctional relationship between the central character and her husband and estranged daughter. The reconstruction of the divided family is such a tired old trope in cinema and the way they handle it here feels incredibly sentimental, predictable and hugely at odds with the cine-literate wit and invention of the film's first half.All that is irksome enough, but what bothered me most about the film was its attitudes to gender. Superficially it might seem pretty empowering to have a female protagonist and antagonist as the focus, but this soon unravels to reveal a worryingly traditional/sexist world view. Michelle Yeoh's character is a dissatisfied mother and wife running a traditionally \"feminine\" business - a laundromat. These traditional limitations on a woman's potential and aspiration are clearly felt as exactly this by the central character, but unlike a film like 'Desperately Seeking Susan' (where resolution is delivered when the heroine rejects and escapes her patriarchal constraints), 'Everything, Everywhere, All at Once' delivers the opposite conclusion/message. Here we celebrate a woman coming to see her desire to break free of the domestic sphere as an unhealthy and unhelpful fantasy. Instead we see her giving up on all her dreams, rejecting her instinct that she could be more, and learning to settle for the very things she is so unhappy with at the start of the film. Is it just me, or is it like the feminist movement never happened?Certainly worth a watch for the hilarious Jamie Leigh-Curtis and all the fun and invention of the opening forty or fifty minutes, but beyond that don't expect too much and prepare to be at least a little offended.",

It makes you both confused yet engaged with the movie every step of the way in a beautifully emotional yet ego-confronting , and at times, humourous way.Some of the fight scenes are fairly funny and odd. It reminds me of a classic (life reflecting) supernatural film where it takes somewhat supernatural powers and experiences, for one to learn ab ultimate fact about life. I find this movie both well made, with obviously high quality production for the elaborate special effects and the plot is so original, that it's out of this world.

It contains a little of every story, every conflict, every problem you yourself are facing, and addresses all of them from a place of empathy and love.Don't expect anything specific. It won't matter, though. You won't expect any of it. I've seen this film 4 times, once in Finnish, and each time it made me cry in a different way for different reasons. It will require multiple viewings, and it will feel like about 20 movies at once. And it is. It's a beautiful amalgam of so, so, much. It's a story about a laundromat owner doing her taxes. And much, much more.This is a beautiful film. It's the best film i've ever seen. In addition to the important emotional stuff, it's also a pretty movie, with wonderful cinematography, lighting choices, vfx, all that stuff. That's not why you'll watch it so many times, though.

The action and the 'ear piece' were so dated.Some humorous moments but that was about it. The 'family is all you need' point was laboured beyond feeling and the 'bagel' thing just made no sense.I really hoped for more like Crouching Tiger or Hero style films in terms of action and feeling but it was flat and quite B-Move in terms of dialogue.I've not seen a more overrated Oscar nomination since Gravity, avoid unless you have all the time in the world to spare!",

Maybe because it was the first girl whom I may have liked at that moment, as she smiled elegantly at me, the first time our eyes made contact.She has been my source of hope, for years.For a fact, we were never together.Long story short, I hesitated long enough that my mind distanced itself to follow its own course in the world. But I still feel my heart burning with the exact same passion, only by the thought of her.It's a strong feeling.A feeling that gave me too many times the vital energy to move on to what I've had to do, in hopes that one day I may meet her again and talk with her, smile back and have a great day.This dialogue made me think.In a world where I don't get to choose whether my hapiness is, or isn't, that's how I would see myself.The scene immediately left me thinking of what I would say to the one I have dreamed of, for too long, in a future where love did not represented a life criteria and circumstances made us meet, \"on purpose\".Reviewing the scene: 100/10\nMovie review: 10/10 - because, even if I'm not agreeing with many aspects from the movie, getting a promotion on the big screen, movie it's its own genre.Don't forget, you could have been, too, a singer!",

I had no idea he could move like that. I decided to give it a watch because Michelle Yeoh is awesome, but I didn't know I'd be getting a long overdue dose of Short Round. . . Lo Pan too.

            "content": "This movie is best gone into blind. This is a glowing review that promises 3 things: 1. Laugh-out-loud funny absurdist humour; 2. Thought provoking questions on life, existence, and purpose; 3. Fantastic performances plus a script that's sure to get some Oscar nods. You should stop reading and go watch it now, ideally avoiding a trailer as well.For those that want to know more, such as why the script is Oscar worthy, to me this movie is a blend of all movie genres done very well. Similar to how Parasite was a nod to Hollywood stories with meaning and meaning told through film, this is a nod to Hollywood genres and all the ways you can tell a story.The themes covered in this film match the title. It has all the themes. There is something for everyone, whether that is someone looking for slice of life family drama, musings on nihilism and the meaning of life, or how many absurd dick dildo props you can squeeze into a movie that shares scenes set as romantic film noir about missed connection lovers sporting $10,000 gowns and suits.The acting is superb, from both Yeoh and her supporting actor Ke Huy Quan. The range of their performances is surely Oscar bait, but serves a purpose in the story. The protagonist's daughter (Stephanie Hsu) plays a very relatable struggling teen for younger viewers as well. I'm glad Awkwafina had to bow out of this role, it would have been hard to imagine her struggling and seeing her as anything but awkward.Finally, and most importantly, this movie is fun and enjoyable. I avoided this for so long despite glowing peer reviews thinking it would land on either the two extreme ends of a dumb action movie (it's not, it's quite deep) or a way too heavy-handed dry philosophical painful slog (it's not, there is a lot of light hearted fun). Older British thoughtful comedy classics landed in this sweet spot for me; if you are a fan of Edgar Wright's mashing of genres you'll find something here for you.",

It breaks all aspects of how a movie should go from this unassuming relatable family in its own problems and culture, to this unbelievable story that's ripped across all realities past present and future all at the same time.This has the Matrix (the original) feel to it but at the same time Total Rdecall (the arnold version) vibes, with a little new once to make it its own. The character development is standing ovation worthy and keeps you on the back of your seat in fear of what comes next. But leans you forward to hold on for more. I can't believe this is what this movie was. I was expecting a mediocre seen it before tale that had some new twist, but I was pleasantly surprised that I was taken on an original journey through mind altering thought to the point where I was questioning whether I was in the movie or some spin off of reality waiting for my own body to be tagged in and fight.All I can say is it is a must see for everyone who wants a new original thinking journey to ride along with and not think about awards or criticism. Just to take a ride on another state of mind all together. I commend you for reading this but can't wait for you to realize what you are in for within the hours to come in this unbelievable joy ride you are about to partake.Enjoy the ride and please open your mind to what is coming!!!",

It's a lot of fun if you stick with it.A few things could be improved/changed, such as the butt plug scene, which made no sense; and some editing was needed for the bagel scenario, which went on too long. The \"message\" was a bit heavy-handed, and should have been handled in a manner more befitting the zaniness of the film.I'm going to watch it again, to see what I missed, this time with closed captions.Not perfect, but definitely one of the better films of the year.

Every single aspect of this film is as close to perfect as I've seen. The images on screen are lush and saturated with color and texture, the camera work is kinetic and puts you right in the middle of all the action, the ensemble cast is fantastic (more below), the stunts are mind-blowing (and hilarious), the story is totally weird and original (and a bit mind-bending, but don't worry it all makes sense in the end), the special effects make you scratch your head and wonder: \"how did they do that???\"A quick moment of focus on the acting in \"Everything Everywhere...\". The role of Evelyn is very difficult as it carries the weight of the entire film, which is told almost entirely from her perspective. She has to go from a tired, end-of-her rope, slightly downtrodden immigrant woman whose hopes have been dashed by harsh reality, to the saviour of not only our universe, but countless others as well, realizing along the way that the little daily events and love of her family, is what will save her. Michelle Yeoh pulls this off masterfully, letting us see in her face (and whole being) the transitions she's undergoing, at great peril to her own sanity. But she in no way does this feat on her own. The talent arrayed around her is so powerful: an almost unrecognizable Jamie Lee Curtis portrays her nemesis IRS agent; Ke Hui Kwan (known from Indiana Jones and The Goonies) in his first major film role in over 20 years portrays Evelyn's husband Waymond, at once both the ass-kicking protagonist and tender beating heart of the family; the radiant Stephanie Hsu plays Joy, Evelyn's daughter and unexpected antagonist. Even the minor parts (James Hong, Tallie Medel,and. Jenny Slate) are fleshed-out and contribute greatly to the film.The result, is a film that feels holistic, that presses all the buttons. It's by turns hilarious, balls-to-the-wall exciting, devastatingly sad, and ultimately life-affirming and uplifting. One of the best films I've seen in the last 10 years.",

Some images would have been enough to explain - or make you feel - the multiverse and all its facets.Truth is : \"Everything, everywhere, all at once\" is fantastic because of Michelle Yeoh. She shows an ability to habit emotions that you cannot rehearse, to frame silent emotions as if in her right true life, portraying a character who would not grasp the wild stakes of these events. She made me feel like truth was achievable by an actor with a very deep control of emotions. Her kung-fu education in martial arts surely is no stranger to that ability.I don't think we will remember the movie as much in the future, but we will remember Michelle Yeoh. There is no Oscar night without her kicking Chris Rock on stage in 2023. And if she doesn't win then they haven't understood anything about acting.",

Therefore, people who do not understand the notion of a multiverse will find \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" confusing. Like I said, it's not for everyone. Physics is not for everyone. However, it's also a movie about love, resentment, regrets, relationships between people: mother, daughter, father, lovers, enemies. It's also an action movie! I laughed and cried watching the movie.

During the middle of an IRS audit she encounters an alternate version of her husband from the Alpha universe who tells her that she is the hero who will free all reality and all other universes from the evil Jobu Tupaki. Unfortunately, Evelyn is the version\nof herself who had made all the wrong choices in life, unlike other versions in other universes. She must learn from her other versions, in order to defeat Jobu Tupaki. The acting and conflict between Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis is outstanding. Although, in a distant universe that are friends, and maybe lovers. In this universe, Evelyn Wang seems to bring out the worst from\nthose around her. Actor Ke Huy Quan hasn't made many movies since he delighted us in the Goonies (1985) and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), so it is pure delight to see him again. Evelyn Wang learns love and compassion from a version of Waymond Qang (Ke Huy Quan) in another universe, which becomes the secret to resolve the conflict with Jobu Tupaki. The acting is superb, the photography average and the special effects confusing. But the actors and plot lift the movie above the ordinary.",

Just okay.It takes a while to get started, but by the end of Act 1, it *really* gets started. The climax of Act 1 is over-the-top in all the right ways, and had me in tears laughing at certain points. I figured that, although the start is very slow, now that we were in THE action, the rest of the movie would be just as good as everyone was telling me it was.And... it wasn't. This is a movie that really peaks at the climax of Act 1. Everything is absurdist, over-the-top, yet comprehensible, hilarious, and tense. All the pieces were there for a great film. But Act 2... drops the ball. Not hard, but like a gentle fluttering towards the ground, where you watch the ball descending and try to convince yourself that the ball is not, in fact, descending, but at some point you have to admit to yourself that it's far lower than it was before. It goes on an excruciating amount of time, it throws up the husband's idea of fighting as \"being nice to others\" despite the fact that every alternate husband we've seen so far is essentially a combat master. And apparently that's the key to unlocking the villain's heart, the villain having turned from an over-the-top, enjoyable, yet still sympathetic and mysterious force of nature, to a whiny, depressed teenage girl whose only echoes of the character she used to be are her outlandish outfits in each scene. It wasn't fighting for survival it was just... being nice? I guess?The movie gets unusually predictable from here to the end. The only unpredictable things are the different universes, which remain the most enjoyable part of the movie. But by the time Act 2 gets going, you will absolutely know how it ends: just like any other movie out there. And so it does. They also force a happy ending for one plot thread that seemingly comes out of nowhere. Given a huge message of the film is \"nothing matters, but you might as well enjoy it\", I feel like it would have been much more powerful to go the direction that plot thread was clearly heading, only for the character affected to be assured that the lack of acceptance she received means nothing as long as she, herself, could be proud of who she is. In a world where being LGBT is still seen by many, especially in traditional culture, as wrong, it is unrealistic -- and unhealthy -- to hope that everyone accepts you as you are. You need to find your own happiness and acceptance, because not everyone will be willing to give it to you.I won't mention Act 3, because it's not even really an act.So yeah, okay film. By the time the second credits started rolling, I didn't even stay to see if it was another fake-out. I was honestly just done with the film. I can't really recommend it. Maybe just look up the action scenes as they are easily the best part of the film.",

The daughter manifests as an inter-dimensional being of unimaginable terror, bent on the destruction of the multiverse - and the mother is required to tap into the powers of her various alter egos from across the same multiverse in order to defeat her. Along the way we plumb the depths of the daughter's chaotic psyche and the writers' imaginations, as Yeoh taps into different universes featuring sausage-fingered humans, talking racoon chefs, robot grandfathers and a version of her movie star self. There are numerous homages to different movie genres, from fight scenes straight out of the Jackie Chan school of choreography to extensive comic-book superhero pastiches.The concept is brilliant lunacy and the execution is almost flawless. Yeoh and Hsu are perfectly cast, Ke Huy Quan is a revelation as he switches apparently without effort between his completely bi-polar alter egos, and Jamie Lee Curtis is in equal parts terrifying and hilarious. Surprisingly, for a fantasy film, the cast is able to dictate proceedings without being dominated by CGI and special effects.As is the way of cinema these days, the film is over-long and does drag slightly in the last quarter.

            "content": "I didn't know what to expect before watching it, neither in terms of visuals or story. A friend told me it was a really worth watching and that was it.I enjoyed it quite a lot until I clearly could understand how characters would activate skills through parallel lives. And loved that surprise moment in the elevator with the umbrella. I thought \"damn that's going to be some dope unusual science fiction movie\".But overall it felt too much. I guess that's the whole point of the film, and I must highlight the insane technical work behind all the visual effects, as well as consistency in terms of quality. It is interesting that such a small team worked on them because it showed a very precise, consistent and quite unique style which I can only applaud.I think the acting was pretty strong too, there was something quite true and honest despite the characters being assigned to (sometimes) exaggerated tropes.In my opinion, the plot is too simplistic and the over-abundance of visual effects made the storyline actually move very slow. I felt like swimming against some super strong artificially induced current in a 50 cm deep pool for over two hours. The third part of the move felt also totally unnecessary. Would have nice to end it when the mother and daughter hug outside the laundromat, end of part 2.There were some genuinely funny and interesting comical gimmicks throughout the entire film but I was enjoying them less and less as the story progressed so slowly and being bombarded with the visuals. I believe that stronger writing with a more strategic use of the effects would have made the film overall easier too watch and even made the simple storyline stronger. I got lost in all the layers, despite some really good stuffs. The premise of the double culture, chinese-american, struggle of the first generation/second generation, generational clash, daily life struggle etc... were for me already very exciting. And during the emotional moments, explored through the many dimensions , I was hoping to get emotional too but I just barely felt anything because I was just feeling knocked out from the visuals.I like the idea of movie making when it is testing limits and breaking them in this time of human history in which technology moves so fast. Especially when we are already bombarded with visuals on our phones on a daily basis. I do believe that this film breaks all the records considering that it gets harder and harder the break them. But there will always be one thing that never changes. What happens when you have too much of a good thing ? I love baklava because it is intense, it has many textures, many layers, many flavours in one bite. But if I eat the whole tray of baklava I won't remember any of it. I feel the same about this film as if I do with baklava.",

There's beauty in a film that caters for multiple audiences and their watch styles; for example, those who need a little more hand holding for the plot and those who don't. There are obvious themes like, love and navigating relationships with others and yourself, and concepts a little more subliminal / complex like the multiverse itself, chain reactions, life purpose. There's an insane amount of symbolism in this film worth thinking about. From the IRS (and the trophies...I won't spoilt it but) etc... I promise the trailers really don't clue you in to the film genuinely, I was totally taken for a ride in the best way possible. I was just a huge fan of Michelle and that was my main reason for going, so this was the most rewarding and unexpected experience. A film that had me crying, then laugh crying, to feeling changed! Surely you can find some some story line to relate to in this film. Refreshing to see a story like this when cinema seems slower at turning our original content anymore.",

I've gone to middle school so I've heard those jokes before.It is also incredibly long and boring, and when it is finally over, no it's not, there's still two more gd parts. The majority of this movie was either terrible, sophomoric 'comedy' or fight scenes that were done horribly and are incredibly unrealistic.I am so angry I wasted two hours on this I will never get back, and shocked that people enjoyed this.

            "review_title": "A Masterpiece of a Hidden Gem",
            "content": "Where do I begin? There's just so much to talk about this absolute masterpiece of a movie. The action, the drama, the humour, the subtext, the cinematography, the emotions-and most of all, the weirdness.I will try my best to put into words how beautifully this movie was brought together with a neatly wrapped ribbon on top. I don't do movie reviews but this is something I just cannot resist writing at 4 AM because the pure adrenaline will not let me.IntroI will admit that I need to watch it 2-3 more times to fully grasp every drop of what the directors poured into the 2+ hour runtime of the movie.When I started watching it, I was so confused as to why this movie came highly recommended as it seemed very crude and bare at face value.But the more I watched it, the more I delved into the multiple realities the movie takes you through. It just draws you in and you cannot stop watching with every obscenity, every chaotic scene and every inexplicable moment that passes. It's a steadily meandering curve of insanity and chaos from start to end.Action and ChoreographyViolence is usually depicted as a raw amalgamation of gore and barbaric roughness. This movie polishes a scintillating diamond through the beautifully choreographed fight scenes. Creativity knows no bounds and nothing is repetitive in any of the confrontation scenes as people are killed off in the most elegant ways imaginable with the help of colourful visual effects.The movie somehow manages to antithetically depict the other side of the coin, addressing violence with kindness and compassion in a truly unique way.Writing & CharactersThere is a perfect balance of comedy, action and heartwarming poignance.At the start, you are introduced to characters and plot points seemingly unrelated to each other. Right until the end, all of these characters are thrust into each other's lives in the most unfathomable ways and each character plays a vital role, no matter how small.The overarching plot seems somewhat fundamental at the surface level. It's the plethora of underlying plotlines and abstract messages that really form the core of the movie. The science fiction aspect takes a backseat to the more pertinent themes that are constantly overlapping sporadically.To put that on a scale, Doctor Strange is a 6-year-old's art homework.EmotionsThe story explores the lives of 3 separate generations of a family who hate as much as they love each other. The generational gap is evident right from the start, with each one having nuances in stark contrast to the others. These various relations burgeon into something indescribaby wholesome across their shared experiences.Coming to the quirkiness aspect of it, I have no words. I am inexplicably drawn towards zany and quirky plots and sequences that make superficial sense to the common viewer. I found myself uncontrollably laughing every 2 minutes while simultaneously being absolutely bewildered at the nonsensical shenanigans transpiring in front of me.Cinematography & DirectionThe director duo of the Daniels, responsible for another one of my all-time favourites-Swiss Army Man, absolutely smashed it out of the park yet again. The way one scene shifted to another while my brain was stuck processing the earlier one really captivated my full attention. They've also thrown in a little treat for fans of fourth-wall breaking, completely novel and never seen before.There are also a few segments within the movie that give you a breather to take in everything and contemplate the meaning of life along with the characters themselves.I would be gravely remiss if I did not mention that the VFX team was comprised of only SEVEN people entirely, an outstanding feat for what they've achieved.For simple-minded Marvel fans, this is produced by the Russo Brothers. Do with that information what you will.Shoutout to the ActorsThe acting, on the other hand, felt a little less than organic, if I had to criticise just one thing about an otherwise flawless production.For Asians to have such brilliant interaction on an English medium is remarkable on its own, as seen with Crazy Rich Asians. It is with that same energy that Michelle Yeoh brought her A-game and really flourished. The other cast members also carried their role to their fullest in their own idiosyncratic ways.The VerdictThis movie had me at the edge of my seat, processing several emotions at the same time. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a completely new experience that pretty much condenses an entire cinematic universe in just 2 hours. It's a refreshing change of pace from today's hackneyed Hollywood industry that seems to care more about profits than quality, and offers a hidden gem unlike anything you've ever seen before.It was wholesome. It was thought-provoking. It was alluring. It was insanely mind-bending. It was everything, everywhere, all at once.If you actually read all of that, I appreciate it. If you just skipped to this part, shame on you. Either way, go see it asap. It's a must-watch masterpiece that I'm definitely gonna find myself re-watching over and over again.",

The writing and the execution were near perfect. Michelle Yeoh's performance was superb and Ke Huy Quan was just fun. The visuals, the cinematography, the editing, and the music were outstanding.

It is me, a Chinese girl who has given up on everything trying to immigrate. I ditched my beloved major, my family, my friends, my promising career future, and my social status to embrace freedom. Sometimes I could not let myself fall asleep and asked whether it was worth pushing myself so hard. Maybe I could have become a history professor at the best university in my motherland, or at least I could serve my parents to the end of their days. While taking every strength of me to beat the current, it is tempting to hate the fate assigned to you.I noticed that most of the audience is so touched by the successful version of Raymond, who confess that he would like to do the laundry and tax with Evelyn in another life. However, for me, the rock scene and the vibe Raymond shows when he sings Hope You Get Rich and cleans up the mess caused by Evelyn are unbeatable. Evelyn lets joy go, even though it is against her will. The truth of freedom lies in the right to fall.

            "content": "Everything everywhere all at once is completely and utterly absurd. Submitting yourself to the absurdity of it all is one of the many lessons that this movie gives the viewers.In between the crazy montages of parallel universes, we find an unassuming family made up of Gong Gong, Evelyn, Waymond and Joy; who are grandfather, mother, father and daughter.Each character is struggling with some form of anguish in life, such as marriage problems, enduring generational trauma or plain old dissatisfaction with the daily grind, yet at the core of these troubles is a group of people who love each other fiercely, even though they seem to love each other in a way that none of the other characters understands. As reality unravels around this family their love for each other manages to bind them together.This movie is about healing, being proud of who you are and finding the joy in the life you have rather than daydreaming about the multitudes of lives you could've lived.The movie itself is artistically complex and obviously well produced. I don't think the acting in this movie was necessarily the best I've ever seen, but I still wouldn't replace any of the actors. They were the perfect choices for each character and story.I really, truly don't understand how people who admit that they didn't watch the whole movie are being taken seriously as reviewers. If you don't want to watch this movie, I'd completely understand, but if you are going to watch it, at least watch the whole thing because it all ties together neatly in the end.I feel like there's so many other things I'm leaving out, but I'll spare you the rambling and just finish off by saying that everything everywhere all at once is a perfect balance between comedy and drama.If nothing matters, then you're free to live your life in any way you want, and everything CAN matter, if you want it to. But remember to be kind.Side note: there should really be an epilepsy warning for like 5 seconds of the movie.",

            "content": "Everything Everywhere All at Once is beautifully written and directed by Daniel Scheinert and Dan Kwan. This movie is about a Chinese woman named Evelyn wang played by Michelle Yeoh, who is running a laundromat and has a failing marriage with here husband Waymond wang played by Ke Huy Quan. Evelyn is soon tasked with saving the multiverse from her daughter Jobu Tupaki played by Stephaine Hsu. Michelle Yeoh and Stephaine Hsu both play their characters wonderfully, the emotion they give off in every fight, every conversation seems so real, Ke Huy Quan also gives an amazing performance, he can play a shy and goofy husband that seems like he has no real intelligence and he can also play a man who is just an absolute savior. I think the most outstanding performance in this whole movie is Stephaine Hsu as Jobu Tupaki/ Joy Wang I love their take on the theory of the Multiverse and the way they tackle this idea is quite unique and something that I've never seen. Throughout the movie we see the camera pan to things like a vent in the ceiling or the characters would make say something that sounds like it is not relevant to the movie but in actuality later in the movie it would play a major part or that thing they said would pay off and show up in the movie later. I love the comedy in this film like when Evelyn mixes up Ratatouille with a racoon and calls it Racacoonie, and when Eveyln is fighting Jumpers they try to get abilities by shoving a weirdly shaped employee of the month award up their butts, this film does not try to hard to be funny like most other comedy films. I also love the action in this film, the choreography is amazing like when Alpha Waymond is fighting the IRS security guards with a fanny pack, or when Eveyln is fighting the Jumpers all of these are fantastic especially with the blend of their special effects, with a budget of 25 million dollars it feels like the budget is higher with all the special effects because it is so damn good. I have so much to say about this movie that I cannot express into words but this Movie is so good. The themes of the movie like nothing matters,or something kindness is the key and many other themes are just perfect and can blend in well with this film, The emotion you can hear in the characters like when Evelyn, Waymond and Joy are fighting in the parking lot, there is so much raw emotion that can make you cry. But the only problem with this movie is that it has to much going on for it, there is multiple universe they talk about once and it can be confusing the first time you watch the movie but after a bit you will get used to it. I have no more to say about this movie except that this is a must watch movie and if you want to watch a movie that can make you upset, Happy, grossed or just anything you have to watch this movie. Everything Everywhere all at once is a 9.5/10 film and should get the recognition it truly deserves.",

But it missed the mark for me a little bit, I didn't really care about the characters as we spend minimal time building them so it was hard to feel that deeper connection with them.The visual effects and cinematography with some aspects of the screenplay were the best I've seen in a movie in the last couple years. It was really great to see such strong Asian actors kill it on screen with the long awaited Ke Huy Quan who was one of my favorite child actors playing Data on the Goonies and James Hong who I don't think I've seen I film from him since Big Trouble In Little China and last but 100% not least Michelle Yeoh who gives an absolutely stellar performance through-out the entire film, even going back to her kung-fu roots which I'm sure was a great sight to see for any kung-fu film fan me included.What I didn't like about the film is all the answers are just given to the viewer, no room for the viewer to figure things out on their own. Some scenes didn't feel genuine and the script is quite stilted in some scenes, the pacing could have been better but its an a24 film so i guess that's expected .BUT all in all its a good film with potential to be great.",

The main character, Lila, is stuck in a job she hates and is constantly searching for something more. Her friend Ben tells her about a philosophy called \"The Perennial Philosophy,\" which believes that everything in the universe is connected and that there is an underlying unity to all things. This idea resonates with Lila, and she begins to explore it further. She meets different people along the way who help her learn more about this way of thinking, including a man named Simon who has devoted his life to spreading the teachings of The Perennial Philosophy. Through her conversations with these people and her own exploration, Lila comes to realize that maybe there isn't one specific thing she's supposed to be doing with her life; instead, she can find meaning in simply living each moment as best she can.I really enjoyed this movie because it made me think about my own life and what I want out of it. I also loved the characters-they were all so relatable and likable (even though some of them were frustrating at times!). And finally, I appreciated the philosophical side of things-it was interesting to learn about The Perennial Philosophy and how its ideas could be applied to everyday life. Overall, this was a thought-provoking film that left me feeling hopeful about finding my own path in life.",

I am always worried about any type of content that tries to tackle multi-verse or time travel because I feel like it often leads to paradoxes that disconnect you from the story. In Everything Everywhere All at Once I did not feel any of that, even though there are plenty of plot holes and inconsistencies to point out.Part of it is, of course, the comedy aspect of the movie. But beneath this layer there's a very well told, and surprisingly consistent message of \"no self\". For me, it reminds me of 2 books combined, namely \"Man's Search for Meaning\" and \"No Self, No Problem\".It is an incredibly powerful message, told in a very dorky yet incredibly effective way. I was hooked from start to finish and I feel like the movie's message will linger in my mind forever. I feel humbled and empowered at the same time.",

At many points it feels like it contains all the ideas from pitch meetings that get thrown out when the boss says 'there are no bad ideas'. Though when most would immediately shoot these down and judge the life of whoever blurted them out, this film uses them in a chaotic, almost beautiful way.While the concept of a multiverse has been beaten to death a bit recently (particularly with Marvel), this film commits like it had nothing to loose. It explores so many different aspects of multiple realities and existence to the max that it's painful to try to take it all in. It builds and builds and builds into more and more unthinkable scenarios but keeps a personal, meaningful core throughout. Where certain (marvel) movies would keep building the stakes to a destructive cgi monster fight this never looses touch with what story it's actually trying to tell.This is a remarkable film with a unique take on an idea, incredible visuals, elaborate stunts, perfect performances, and a touching story to follow through.(You need to be in a very particular mood to really enjoy this film. I wasn't lying about the weirdness but it does have purpose and charm if your up for it. If not maybe try it again another time or look into the work behind it or maybe it's not for you.

Not here. Just because you can think it, you don't have to say it, let alone film it. And humanizing the irs, who take from middle class folks hard earned money to give to bloated military contracts so that some devious people can get rich... Alright, that's going too far now. Jamie Lee Curtis is excellent, so is everyone else in the cast. And the \"message\" is at least positive - open your third (googly) eye and realize that compassion and love is what you need, and it doesn't matter if you're rich or poor and what your life is or could've been materially.

Theres so many details to the movie that they didnt breeze past and i think thats what makes it one of a kind. The raccoon ratatouille, the outfit changes the outrageous fights, etc. They took a general plot concept and gave it authenticity and Alice in wonderland details. They did what so many low budgets films try to do and thats pull off weird in a way that isnt cringey and unrealistic. This movie was alot funnier then I thought it would be , I absolutely loved the rock scenes. There's something so refreshing about seeing something completely new AND good, and this was it.

The bad thing about me is when I start something, I rather finish it to the end and to top that up, I was so devastated at the end of this movie that I told to myself quiet loudly, what have I done to myself and my time? And why people should give it this rate? Absolutely overrated movie in my opinion, no aim, no sense with mediocre acts. I am being generous to rate it 3 and it's only because of the action scenes. I hope no one else with the same working schedule that I have gone through this misery.",

Its so trippy that sometimes it gives me nausea effect, and the bizzareness and absurdity FAR outweigh the film's overall feel, even though I get what the film is trying to say.So.. what's my final take on this film? All the actors played here gave great, ..no, superb performances. Film's message was great. Visuals and art direction were great. But it's still very hard to rate this movie. A part of me wants to rate it 9, but also wants to rate it 3 at the same time. I like it, but at the same time, not really.

The performances. The stellar fight choreography. The bonkers physical gags. ALL INCREDIBLE. The Daniels definitely have a beautiful, unique style of directing. Every frame is filled with visual intention and style.But I will say, I really wanted to get hit with an emotional punch, and that department fell slightly flatter than I would have wanted. As a general rule I liked where they took the story, and they had lot of beautiful things to say. But for me...I did feel like they half committed to about 5 different themes.So to be fair, this movie is SUPPOSED to be about \"everything\". But as far as packing a punch from a narrative perspective it felt a little too split.From what I recall these are the themes/overarching topics I picked out:The first: Evelyn rekindling the relationship with her husband. She learns she has not been present for him as a wife, and has not appreciated him for the sweet, patient man he is.Then the next theme, and most prevalent: Evelyn's relationship with her daughter. She learns she has failed to accept her for who she is and hasn't been communicating how much she loves her.Now the third theme: Standing up for what you believe in. Don't let your life pass by, get out there and be the best you you can be.Ok now the FOURTH theme (which I think they just included to cover their bases), was \"kindness\". Live life with kindness in your heart and treat others the way you want to be treated.The FIFTH theme, learn to let go of the ones you love. Except also don't let go, if you really love them, hold them tight and never let go? I think?And then theme 5.5, the importance of standing against older, more traditional generations (specifically in regards to homosexuality).So I love ALL of those themes, they're beautiful, and in most moments fairly competent. But they all felt very half-developed in an unintentional way. To me it felt like our protagonist experienced 5-6 different half arcs. All of them were good, I just felt like the movie could have had me in tears if they had fully committed to just one (maybe two) of them.Lastly, from a pacing perspective, the last Act felt like it should have been a bit tighter. The \"final climax\" of the film (which is generally 5-8 minutes) lasted for a whopping 30 minutes. Emotional montages are great and impactful, but the longer it plays out the more it loses its potency.In conclusion, this movie is still pretty great. I don't want to sound like I'm being TOO harsh on it, I was just so ready to absolutely LOVE this movie. Instead I just really really liked it. 7.8/10.",

I was left incredibly disappointed by the philosophy that the movie was promoting at the end. It wants us to accept nihilism, because we're all just a tiny speck of dust on one of several planets in a universe among many.According to the movie, nothing matters and we should do whatever we want to do, but we just have to make sure that we include one important action: \"Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on.\" What???? So nothing matters and we can do whatever we want to do, except that we have to be nice to other people? If nothing matters then what exactly is the point of being nice? There's no reason to do anything in any particular way if we are all just insignificant.It's as though the movie production was only as immaculate and spectacular as it was just to slyly distract us from the fact that it's promoting nihilism.

Possibly my favourite film of the year so far.However, the second half is where I started to lose a bit of interest. I don't mind a film being a bit odd as that is what makes films original - especially in this world where Hollywood churns out lifeless crap like Uncharted and The Contractor (just happen to be the last two turkey's I've watched) but I felt like the story started to drag towards the end. I started to lose track. Again, I don't mind being confused by films because this just means it's worthy of repeat viewings to pick little bits up you missed the first time - but when it is SO confusing you barely have a clue what's going on, it becomes disengaging and hampers your enjoyment. It could have done with being about 20-30 mins shorter to be honest. After such a brilliant assault on the senses over the first hour, making this over 2 hours just felt a tad too long.Overall this was original, well acted and entertaining so it's worthy of the high praise it's getting, but I can see why it has such diverse scores.

Very deep, touching, tender, funny deliveries.Reading that the FXs were made by a small group of friends (9) including the Daniels (Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, writers and directors) is astonishing and they learned through tutorials, impressive.I imagine the script as a mixture of the Wachowskis, Terry Gilliam (edit: there's a photo of him and Yeoh together in his IMDB page, maybe in another universe, hahaha) and Charlie Kaufman; a total chaos that leads to something deep and beautiful.It deserves to be re watched several times to get all the small details. Being a Wong Kar-wai fan I recognised the homage straight away, it made me cry.This is the way, at least I, expect one of today movies industry's favorite topic to be treated, won't tell wich not to spoil anything, you'll find it.

It's basically a family drama, and the symbolism are way too clear for anyone to miss. A lesser movie would've made the mistake of underestimating its audience by spoon feeding them rubbish information that's clearly way too easy to understand, in an attempt to make themselves look smarter, and the end result would've been a convoluted, conceited mess of a movie. On the other hand, if an obnoxious douchebag (a pretentious prick) had taken the movie, it would've ended up being too ambiguous and self serious. Thank God that was not the case. This movie is fun, light hearted and extremely well paced. The action scenes are so energetic that they keep you on the edge of your seat and the comedy is too idiotic that you can't help but laugh. It's an emotional drama that is disguised as an action, scifi and comedy. Hats off to the writers/directors. This is only their second film if you can believe it. And their first one is a masterpiece of it's own, a little movie called swiss army man.Goddamn, the level of genius is mind blowing.

But if you're willing to open your mind and accept the premise for what it is without scoffing, you can be in for a fantastic experience unlike many other movies ever. If I were to describe what this was like, I'd say it's like watching The Matrix on an LSD trip.Like The Matrix, the movie follows the titular character living a somewhat normal life, but is unsatisfied with it before being presented the truth about the world that completely recks their whole basis of reality. What follows is a \"chosen one\" / \"hero's journey\" plot where they must use what makes them special to defeat a great evil.Unlike the Matrix though, Everything Everywhere All at Once ends up with a very different theme and message. The Matrix had a theme of fighting the powerful to achieve a better world, but EEAAO has a theme of learning to get past the regreat of the bad choices made throughout your life. But also a theme of being kind to people and accepting them for who they are.As weird and crazy as the plot is, it helps with its themes. The multiverse plot dives into the first and the absurd presentation dives into the second. It isn't just \"lol, so random\" without purpose. Afterall, eventually having a serious sub-plot involving people who have literal hotdog fingers will either make you shut off the movie or if you let yourself immerse into even that it'll allow you to perhaps have an open mind for the absurd people in your own life so you can better understand them.But there are some truely ridiculous scenes that feel like something from an Adult Swim show so I also can't blame anyone for not being able to get into it.

The length at least gives the actors to display their immense talents in making the crazy situations credible, and adding the right amount of humour and pathos. However, I prefer a story that needs the length rather than padding to display the actors and editor's skills\nI see how some find the film engrossing in how it's message develops and the characters' realisations of it, but I found myself distracted. Maybe I've heard the message before and admire the presentation but feel little impact. For others I can see it is revelationary.

These parts kinda grossed me and ruined what was otherwise a pretty good film. Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh in my rating, but it really killed the movie for me.

            "content": "In Swiss Army Man, the debut film from Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan (collectively and fitting known as Daniels), Hank (Paul Dano) and his corpse friend Manny (Daniel Radcliffe) shoot out of a river propelled on the power of Manny's farts. As they fly through the air, they sing a song to each other that goes: \"You just have to remember that we're all here for a purpose, and the Universe picks its time. Everything, everywhere matters to everything.\" While Swiss Army Man only lightly touched on this idea, six years later, Daniels' second film Everything Everywhere All At Once almost makes this verse a mantra amongst a cavalcade of insane multiverses, unlimited possibilities, and endless creativity. Daniels has given audiences a wholly unique vision that literally feels like everything everywhere all at once.Leading this trip is Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh at maybe her all-time best), who runs a struggling laundromat with her overly-optimistic husband Waymond (an equally fantastic Ke Huy Quan). When we first meet Evelyn, she's surrounded by receipts, thanks to the laundromat getting audited, her husband is putting googly-eyes on bags of laundry, and it doesn't take long for Evelyn to embarrass her daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu) when introducing her girlfriend to Evelyn's father, Gong Gong (James Hong). To make matters worse, Evelyn doesn't know Waymond has divorce papers, and IRS inspector Diedre (a hilariously wild Jamie Lee Curtis) accuses the laundromat of fraud. As someone tells Evelyn later in the film, Evelyn is living her worst you.But that's not to say Evelyn hasn't tried to escape her monotonous life. We learn she's wanted to be a singing coach and an author, amongst other interests that became hobbies instead of life-altering careers. But Evelyn's life irrevocably changes when a version of Waymond tells Evelyn that she is just one of many Evelyns, yet she's the only one that can defeat a powerful villain named Jobu Tupaki, who could destroy all the universes (and there are a lot of universes).",

            "review_title": "Multiversal yet Universal",
            "content": "It's hard to explain everything I like in Everything, Everywhere all at Once. Surely there are several little (and big) things I didn't catch. The movie is abundant in symbolism. But I'll try to point out some of them:It's a film with a multiverse clothing over a core of family relationships. In its essence, it's a mother/daughter, wife/husband story. The contrast between a complex sci-fi theme and something so human, with which we deal since the beginning of times, makes it layered and easy to relate to. It's multiversal, but it's universal.The philosophical confrontation of Jobu Tupaki's nihilism and Waymond's optimism. This is another underlying theme that makes the movie speak deeper. Bagel vs. Googly Eyes. As a visual metaphor, one is the inversion of the other (a black symmetrical bagel with hollow center, a white asymmetrical eye with black center). Both circles having similar geometric properties but indicating opposite approaches to life.Throughout the movie, the directors (the Daniels) use several round shapes to address and reinforce this duality. At first, in images as the washing machine's doors or the way Deirdre draws a messy circle on Evelyn's papers, they refer to the donut. Inevitability, lack of finality, monotony. Evelyn is trapped in her routine, in a tedious laundry business, dealing with the IRS. What could be more tedious than laundry and taxes? What is the point? This is Evelyn leaning towards nihilism. By the end, the circular shapes become more asymmetrical and colourful. The chinese decorative lights are framed more instead of the machine's doors in the laundry scenes, Deirdre's pencil has a colourful ball attached on its top. It's optimism taking front.Evelyn makes a journey of getting out of her inertia and self-absorption, experiencing instead her daughter's and her husband's views about life. Thus, comprehending them truly and loving them honestly. The circle now represents connection.Camus said: \"What gives value to travel is fear.\" Perhaps we can conclude that Evelyn's journey was full of fear, full of wanting to get back to what was, but ultimately fear shook her up and she was ready to see value on Waymond's way. The kind way of fighting. Realized that keeping their customers coming and having Deirdre give them more time were Waymond's merit, that past victories were not because of her, but in spite of her. The moment she wears the googly eye as a third eye, she is enlightened. And then, having traveled from nihilism to existentialism, she is able to guide her daughter through the same path. Empathy.I also love the recurrent use of irony. This is an exhilarating movie about laundry and taxes! The name of the daughter is Joy! Also, the very fact that the worst version of Evelyn is the best fitted to save the multiverse is hilarious. Being always just one decision from a better version of herself, Evelyn is able to connect more easily to all her better universes. As she chose always the worst path, several better paths and it's acquired skills are now uniquely close to her. There is a lesson the movie wants to teach us here.Even the most ridiculous universes are capable of carrying deeper and valuable meaning. In fact, the Daniels seem to dedicate themselves to come up with the most extravagant, nonsensical, absurd ideas, and commit to them, just to reinforce the argument that it is possible to find the best in the worst. The hotdog fingers could be just a brief visual gag, but became a full arc, as did Raccacoonie, and contributed decisively to the final resolution.It adds to this approach that the most violent scenes are filled with comedy and feel frivolous. And that the most laughable settings or visually empty parts carry an emotional punch. The rocks, how do not cry with them!The movie is named Everything, Everywhere All at Once and hardly I've seen any movie edited and composed so fittingly to its name. It's remarkable that it can be so cohesive with such a wide range of subjects, genres, techniques.Is it sci-fi, comedy, coming of age story, martial arts, romance, thriller? Everything at once. The mix of genres make it impossible to classify.Is it spoken in english, mandarin, cantonese? Everything at once. Grandpa speaks cantonese, daughter english, husband mandarin, and Evelyn has to mix it up. At first, the cultural and language barriers within the family act as barriers to deeper relationships. At the end, the mutual acceptance, empathy and the realisation of their connecting lines bring the family together, and they are richer because of their diversity.Is it 1.33:1, 1.85:1, 2:1, 2.33:1? All aspect ratios at once. 1.33 (4:3), reminiscent of old TV screen proportions, used in flashbacks. 1.85, an aspect that can fill the entire movie screen without pillar boxes, used on dialogues, romantic moments and other situations were realism is needed. 2.33, the widest of them all, in cinematic fight scenes or large scope shots. 2.0, an odd and uncommon aspect ratio, in the sausage fingers' universe.What lenses and cameras were used? All at once. In fact, each universe is also shot and colour-graded in different ways. Anamorphic vs Spherical lenses, several cameras, flatter/colourful/greener gradings... these all are used and yet the final result is cohesive. To achieve that the editing here is nothing short of spectacular. Wow, those transitions!There are also a plethora of references, homages. The most obvious ones: Kubrick's 2001, Tarantino's Kill Bill, Pixar's Ratatouille, Wong Kar-Wai's In The Mood for Love. Also, Matrix, Hong Kong kung fu movies, and several others influences can be spotted. A multiverse of movies within this one.The soundtrack is a masterpiece. We also have everything at once here. Clair de Lune, pop songs, mayan flutes, circus and western themes... dozens of small motives, arranged differently according to the context. Each one helping us identify a universe, a character relationship. For instance, Clair de Lune appears for the first time in a fight scene between Evelyn and Deirdre. When Evelyn can finally say \"I Love You\" in a truthful manner, it plays. Afterwards, we find out that there is a universe where both are lovers, and Clair the Lune is the soundtrack of this relationship.Another example: Waymond says: \"Your clothes never wear as well the next day, your hair never falls quite the same way\", describing the multiverse. This is from the 2000's song \"Story of a Girl\" by the one-hit wonder band Nine Days. When he says it, many of us possibly sensed something familiar about those words, but not quite sure what. A very parallel universe/deja vu kind of feeling. Afterwards, the song plays in the movie, including different versions of the lyrics and arrangements, made by the original band, according to each universe.Add to all that the superb acting from all 4 main actors. They are mesmerizing. Michelle Yeoh delivers a wide range of several versions of herself. And among all that, she conveys the stages of fatalism, self denial, enlightenment and acceptance Evelyn has to pass through. Ke Huy Quan transforms from kind and naive to confident and experienced with just a flick of his expressions and body language. We are never confused about what version of Waymond is on screen. Stephanie Hsu is as big as Jobu Tupaki is, and not every actor can pull it off. The hopelessness , the solitude, the sense of inadequacy, all there in her eyes. Jamie Le Curtis was never freer, exposing a vulnerability I've never seen in her past roles. A bravura acting. All 4 of them fully deserving of their Oscar nominations.At the end of the 3 acts, all this ridiculous amount of everything imaginable surprisingly showcase a cohesive work. How could the Daniels put everything in this bagel and come up with something as tight as this marvels me. It is another testament to the recurring theme: connection. Emotional, visual, thematic.All connects as in a circle.",

So if you are not familiar with it, or the idea of philosophy or even rejecting the reality we live in, you will have issues following the plot. There's no such thing as \"too silly\" to be possible kind of reality, our universe itself is as ridiculous as it can be, we would look just as silly from the perspective of minds from a universe where ppl walk upside down or just the fact the walk at all.More importantly this movie send me to a journey through most emotions. It felt like action at times, suspense n horrors, but really a lot of really funny times filled the will of humans to feel complete and the power of loving and being resilient to the adversities of life.",

            "review_title": "\"Everthing Everywhere All At Once\" 50/50 right down the middle review",
            "content": "\"Everthing Everywhere All At Once\" 50/50 right down the middle review\n.First of all, this should have been 2 movies, the first of which ended at the end of part one. That's what I'm saying, and i want you to really ingest the suggestion and its implecations,\ninstead of thinking \"crazy person\" and clicking back to find another review,\nwhether you want to read\na more positive review or one listing all the faults so you don't have to burn the brain calories (can actual faults be found??)\nI humbly submit that this review features BOTH. With actual ASSERTIONS which are then TESTED rhetorically and result in\na JUDGEMENT (or a couple)\nand even distilled to a single NUMBER.My assertion, at least in part to justify a pun injected into the review title,\nthat this movie, which,\nin its current form, stands at number 108 on IMDB's list of most favorably reviewed movies of all time; not only that, consider the fact that it's only been released a month ago: nowhere to go\nbut up.That's pretty damn impressive,\nso take anything I say with a grain of salt, because if the whole world loves it and I say it's flawed, the chances that I'm a crank are high.Nonetheless I insist it could have been better,\nwere it chopped in half.My reasons for this are as follows:It would have been a decent ending! Dark and bleak and a little unsettling. I liked the pacing when I thought that's what happened for a couple of seconds. Wham, she's dead. My stomach got cold for a second when I thought that was what happened. I should mention that I get that feeling when a movie I like ends well, which is to say confounding my expectations. That way, people who like their endings like they like their recursive everything bagels: dark, could have at least one movie. Which is also to say, NOT the way most audiences seem to like movies to end.I suggest that the standalone first movie timeline would end where it started (alt-meta-husband goes to look for her) wraps around to the beginning like a M\u00f6bius strip.Had I been properly consulted on the matter I would have suggested filming a couple of different endings for secrecy/confusion and call it a one off. Now you have time to make your uplifting sequel / answer to contemporary post-trump societal chaos and anxiety, or whatever.Observation B. The ending was obvious. So so obvious.Color me cynical, but we kinda knew from 10 min into the film after the premise was revealed that we were going to end in an uplifting realization that she liked her life after all, didn't we? Come on. The whole second half of the movie was her maneuvering into that spot. Especially after part 2 started , we knew, but we kind of have that assumption going in because this is a very very buzzy popular movie with glowing praise so its GONNA get all of its little conflict ducks (made of flourescent lime green ASMR jelly) in a perfect line, light them all on fire, and pop them one by one. How could it not? It couldnt. But what if it did?Observation C.If you look at the reviews overall it would seem that roughly 80 percent are apparently rapturous to the point of blacking out, and the remaining 10 percent loathe it.. ever so very much.Of those, I'm guessing at least half are just not bright enough or weren't paying attention to the plot points. These are the reviews that say things \"didn't make sense.\"\nI'm happy to help clear this up. Really, the following are factual statements, not opinions, so once and for all:\nI present to you the folowing as the indisputable, incontestable truth for every viewer, including you, NOTHING in this movie \"doesn't make sense\".I promise, I paid attention, made a list of potential plot points which might have seemed to be infected with possible Non-sense, but upon review, every one of these had a reason and purpose which was revealed.EVERY single frame, its safe to say, of this movie was thought about at some point, perhaps obsessively, by someone or multiple someones. Everything makes sense. If you don't know why something happened, you might say \"that's weird\" but chances are it had to be that way and you're just not considering all the implications. Sorry.. This definitely isn't a movie to \"multitask\" with (shuddering with impotent fury at people who barely watch little snippets of something or get drunk and fall asleep or whatever and claim to have watched X movie).Observation D. This was and is a highly entertaining movie.But it's not perfect.I dont know how any reviewer can say it is, because thats impossible. That doesnt stop even professionals from saying this. Didn't you watch the film? Its in there, sort of.But what's the number 1-100?76 percent perfect, based on available scientific data models which are, themselves, statistically 96 percent accurate..\nSo, .7296 or 73 percent.Which is still quite high. Fully sitting, in my mind, along side of timeless great/weird spacetime bending classics such as Adaptation, Being John M'vitch, pretty much C. Kaufman's entire filmography, Brazil, Interstellar, and .. others.Its great to know I have another film creator(s) who I can check for upcoming must-see releases, and make no mistake, this is a must-see release.Precious observation E.OK next , problematic, uh,\nproblem: the attitudes overall about sex in general and LGBTQ sex in particular, were strangely immature and at odds with the seeming baseline ethos.For instance, at the very end of part 1, we reveal that the action was being projected onto a movie screen and was a movie premiere in the moviestar/billionaire timeline. Which explains the blurring of male agent's genitals in the previous scene, and we are to offload any judgement we might have about the moderately homophobic 5 minute choreographed fight scene involving the protagonist and two time agents with large candlesticks inserted and hanging out of their rectums for comic effect. So the blurring AND the candlesticks were reflecting the societal norms of THAT reality, but we still watched it for 5 minutes, as though the filmmakers had one segment of the audience that would think that was hilarious and another that would judge it in ramping unease, but then the reveal would focus the judgement on a fictional alternate movie audience. Can't be mad at Them, can you? Moving right along!Why is every multiverse instance we observe involving Yeoh and Curtis in a lesbian relationship is ALWAYS the same exact one where they have flappy hotdog hands and giant oil-painting style transfer portraits of stock photos of housecats? Also its the same one where they have 2 eyes each and Planck's constant is 6.626176 x 10-34 joule-seconds, not 3 more, plus a LOT of other similarities to our timeline, so many similarities that the odds of this being the case are 1 in a LARGE indeterminate number.The hands *are* funny and the foot piano duet was somebody's idea of funny, but all accounted for the only instance I can recal throughout the whole movie where we witness an earnest affection between same-sex couples is when Joy's gf kisses her briefly as Joy exits the car. One time.. Maybe I missed one, but even if there are two tiny earnest moments in a sea of broad humor, its not a great look: the movie uses LGBTQ themes and plot devices, some of them fundamental, throughout .. but there's almost always an escape hatch if you happen to view queer people as definitionally hilarious.Some other, earnest realitites and non-humor-mediated honest normal casual no big deal everyday ho hum seen it a billion times gay behavior embedded in there would have gone a long way to allowing the audience believe what it would greatly prefer, that the film is a friend and ally of queer folk, despite the comedic tropes, like when all the scrambled possibilities are instantiating like NFT attributes, we are to believe that out of the set of (EVERYTHING/ALL POSSIBLE) all the lesbian ones worth seeing evidence of are of the flappy hotdog hands variety. Hm. That's... odd.BTW, cutting it in half, into a movie and a sequel, would create opportunities for all KINDS of extra backstory including earnest gay b-roll, I'm just saying. Or, NOT backstory or b-roll, and instead a meaningful character, which Joy's girlfriend is NOT any kind of realized character; I'm not the genius screenwriter, do something!I could go on and on beating this horse but I think you get it.Observation F.I can't finish this without mentioning, of the Tupaki character, that her outfits and makeup are increasingly spectacular up until the last 10 minutes. I'd say last 9 outfits with the exception of High Priestess of the Communal Order of the Supreme Bagel, which I just can't with the bagel-shaped hairdo, are genius and more genius. A lot of various Oscars are potentially inbound, depending on how the gay thing breaks for them politically but regardless I think that Shirley Kurata as costume designer is more or less a lock.That's about it.. To recap (as promised, but renumbered and restructured from the overall text of this review)1. Good, great even, in places, not perfect by any stretch.2. Not great with regards to LGBTQ treatment despite appearing to exploit gay themes for both plots and character formation.3. IMHO, would have made 2 better imperfect movies than one 2 hour and 19 minute all-in-one movie which was almost twice as long as it needed to be.4.

I had a number of different reactions and interpretations of the film while I was watching it, but the conclusion offered deep messages about human connection. The acting was also superb and the film seemed incredibly ambitious visually. It is amazing to me that they pulled it off because it was a very complex film! In all, this film was easily one of the best of the past few years and is well worth your time.",

The fight scenes were excellent, but some felt forced. The need to include the IRS lady throughout most of the movie felt really out of place when it was irrelevant to the laundromat's taxes. As much as I like Jamie Lee Curtis, her character felt like it was thrown into every universe because she is a great actress, not because her character fit in the scene or story.

            "content": "I found this film to be very anti or strange in its message. It evolves around nihilism or at least existentialism on how nothing matters but we still choose kindness in the midst of 'not having all the answers.' This type of thought leads me to believe that the film makers believe in a worldview of 'nothing matters' which irked me as I don't believe in the same way.I think that we should choose love and kindness because we do matter and life does matter and the choices we make have lasting effects on higher powers or a God in place. It's a disappointing final message and I wish no one would come to appreciate or believe in its nihilistic approach, it's devastating.The film is original, masterful, perfectly edited and incredibly engaging. It's an acid trip and it feels as if you're exploring through many different portals of life. It's grand and I believe its a mind dazzling, complicated and pretty fun experience. I can't give it a higher score because I'm saddened by its poor depiction on life and how we should value it. I just wish this film wasn't a message to allow more LGBTQ privilege to flood through our heads thinking that's okay.In summary, it's a film about human liberalism and the allowance of mutual sin and spreading sin, it's about universal love but it's human centred and it idolizes our place infront of God. The reason I'm being religious is because the film explores so many ideas of life and the meaning of it. As a Christian I don't believe life is meaningless and I don't believe that lesbian gay rights should be pushed ever so bluntly they did here. I believe that life is full of grace, and lesbians should have equal rights but not in the way of outright blasphemy of Christian tradition. It's this kind of liberalism which angers me because if you don't have a fear of God, you'll unleash human anger and rage everywhere.Instead of being kind because life is meaningless which is a stupid message, think about how God loves us so much and made you so valuable and you are loved no matter what race, status or sexuality, so then be loving and kind because we are all eternal people and we shouldn't misplace the love and message of Christianity for something trippy, ethereal and demonic.",

The performances were all great, but to me the standouts were Jamie Lee Curtis and the amazing Stephanie Hsu.Unfortunately it felt about an hour too long. The Daniels kept on making the same points over and over again, and when you combine with that some of the protracted jokes (rocks talking with the help of subtitles, hot dog fingers, 2001 apemen with hot dog fingers) I felt The Daniels were going over the top, if that's even possible in movie this over the top.The Daniels have made a fun science fiction comedy.

Then at the end the mother's hint to Becky as to grow her hair, leaves a doubt so there won't be total acceptance and the new truth has to comply to centeric family's way after all.All the fuss is about centerism the entire length of the film. It seems China has tried to strip Hollywood of its cultural influence as a broadcaster for American way, and using it to his own advantage. So with all the nominations from Oscars, it seems there will be more of this to come in coming years.The movie is promoting the Chinese way so obviousely and especially present it as an alternative to American dream. Freedom and letting go is bad, and sticking to the centric family as Chinese culture suggest is a better option (at least what is they want us to believe of Chinese culture at this point).Altough it has been entertaining with an action packed and distracting storyline and showing some acceptable storytelling proficiency, but it leaves no doubt this is defenitely a propoganda towards China and how the world shall accept it and BE KIND!.",

But, stick with it, it will begin to make sense toward the end in the last quarter.Great casting and I was super surprised and pleased to see Ke Huy Quan in one of the primary roles; always considered him an interesting child actor but then he seemed to disappear from the screen. As he has been reported to have said that after his childhood roles, there just didn't seem to be any opportunities for him again in acting, so he turned to behind the scenes. Would be really interesting to see him reprise his role as 'Short Round' in the next Indiana Jones film, but now as an adult.Michelle Yeoh is of course impeccable in anything she's in, and Jamie Lee Curtis is a hoot as a government IRS agent. Story line with so many costumes and scenery changes must have been as confusing to keep up with as it was to watch it all. Expect I'll be seeing different scenes of the film in my memory again and again for a few days.It's an odd film, might even consider Art House worthy, but I'm hoping you will also think it was worth sticking through all the crazy scenes and costumes till you get to the end and the purpose of the film.

Well, they talk to each other, they live together, spend time together, work together. They have some issues with the gay girlfriend, but she is not abandoned and welcome to visit the family. Oh the daughter has a tattoo and get \"fat\". Really?! Other families have much more problems...The storyline about metaverses is not understandable.

It operates under the modus of \"more is more\" and that might be the only reason that I wouldn't give this movie a 10 out of 10.At the same time, if it wasn't for the willingness of the writers to explore every possible idea they (and their team I presume...) could come up with, the movie wouldn't be what it is - and in some weird way I wouldn't want it to be perfect anyway - the overwhelmed feeling that I'm left with now, is part of what makes the movie such a masterpiece.

Also another thing i love about this movie is how it depicts a chinese immigrant household, as it doesn't include nothing but stereotypes, but uses so many creative aspects to create the movie. As an immigrant from china this movie is such a masterpiece. Another thing i love is the lgbtq representation and inclusion. Love this movie 10/10.",

When titling an entertainment \"Everything Everywhere...\" you really need to take effort to leave some stuff out.The film announces its three sections with title cards pulled from the movie title. EVERYTHING was interesting (though a tad overlong). We meet the characters. We learn the conflict. (It's family dynamics.) It's easy to identify with the quite familiar characters, and you're pulling for them. SPOILER: The interest is sustained as we clue in that the family conflict will be played out across a multiverse.When the story resumes as EVERYWHERE you're ready for the running time to be half spent. But, no. The three segments are granted equal time. The movie starts to wear out its welcome in segment 2. (Although I appreciated that in the multiverse thread wherein the characters appear to be living their best lives, they're still dissatisfied. That impressed me as \"real.\") Finally ALL AT ONCE unspools. If they could have dealt with the universes colliding in a tight fifteen minutes or so, and then devoted about the same time allotted the primary reality, I might have stayed onboard.In the Army, my platoon was mustered for a 4-mile run. The course was laid out with mile markers. For some inexplicable reason, the starting line was moved up half a mile. When I got to the first mile marker I thought, 'Man! I'm in great shape! I should pick up the pace, and maybe set a landspeed record!' The second mile marker took forever to reach. I still hadn't clued in to the situation. I figured I'd dial back a little, and maybe just set the service branch record. At the 3-mile mark it dawned on me. I staggered through that fourth mile and, guess what? I had another half-mile to the finish!This show was like that. Give some thought to desertion.",

Jamie Lee Curtis is also brilliantly surreal in her role.Yet despite all the theatrics, and special effects, the film has the simplest of messages: Be kind. This message isn't forced, comes across beautifully and leaves you feeling uplifted and content by the film's close.Simply put, this is one of the best films I have ever seen and has broken into my top 10 films of all time.

She is presented with another version of her husband that takes her on a journey of her other selves whilst he teaches her how to switch realities and draw in the gifts and talents from other versions of herself to change the reality she is living. It really is very enlightening! A mix of sci fi, comedy, romance and some great psychological insights as it explores the relationship with her family and how she came to be at the crossroads in her life that wakes her up and explores what's 'out there'.

            "content": "The BadThe modern view of the multiverse started with the TV show Rick and Morty where we can now explore just how weird things can get when everything is possible. This works out great for comedy but proves to be tricky for a film like this that also wants to have its dramatic moments.At certain times I found myself completely over the ridiculousness and was hoping for the story to just slow down. Luckily it did but only to be interrupted by moments such as hot dog fingers being shoved into each others mouths.Many times this film drags on story beats, whether it is a dramatic beat or a ridiculous one, and would benefit from a ~15 min reduction in run time.Back to the Rick and Morty comparison, the divorced couple who sees how their life would be without the other was played out in an episode already. I believe that the TV show did a much better job of that and it truly made sense why they decided to stay together in the end. In this film it seems like they got back together because he is a nice guy? Hard to decipher due to the ending of this movie tieing so many loose ends up in such a quick and ridiculous fashion.The GoodIncredibly deep in its exploration on nihilism and how it is effecting the youth of today. I love the tie back to family love and acceptance because it truly gives their lives purpose.The Jumping between universes, although a bit ridiculous at times, was visually stunning. The different ways they filmed the switches between worlds and how it effected across them was stunning.Ke Huy Quan absolutely stole the show with his performance. Without that lovable feeling he brings so well, I'm not sure the ending would have worked at all. He does this while also bringing such depth to the character at times showing great promise for future rolls.Overall\nVery difficult concept to nail perfectly but was done extremely well. Defiantly worth a watch for all film lovers but be ready for it to stumble along the way.",

It's for the most part a tale of finding family across the multiverse which I think could've worked fine on its own. Instead, it's got this scifi \"jumping\" element where in order to switch multiverses you have to do a \"statistically improbable action\". So you go from artsy shots and the protagonist discussing divorce with her husband to some guy sitting on a buttplug in an office or a universe where people have fingers made of hotdogs. I only laughed once or twice during the movie; the overall tone wasn't comedic and the \"wacky\" bits were quite tame compared to what's been done in Rick and Morty to much greater effect. You're also constantly jumping around, martial arts gets thrown in...it's all a bit incoherent.I would rate Eternal Sunshine higher for emotional time travel, About Time higher for romantic time travel, Rick and Morty higher for comedic time travel, The Butterfly Effect higher for thought-provoking time travel...in summary; this movie is not more than the sum of its parts; it's more like the average of its parts and each part isn't as strong as it could be on its own.If you like \"trippy\" movies then this might be for you but if you're looking to stay awake for two hours then I'd find something else to watch.",

Her acting is great and she's very funny but brings a much needed subtlety and sort of more calm, less dramatic vibe to this very dramatic chaotic movie.My least favorite part, the visuals. Just personally doesn't do it for me, feels draining and like it's trying to sell more or be different and original but just doesn't get there. Just a matter of the style i guess, feels very like \"oh cool look at all these ideas and elements, let's use literally all of it\". If this movie were a food it'd be one of those hamburgers but the buns are glazed donuts, with onion rings, two types of sauce and rainbow sprinkles. Not everyone would eat and enjoy but it will catch everyone's attention.I felt like the other things i loved kind of became what i didn't like after sometime. Like how it's unexpected and you can't tell what's coming, but then this element gets tired and overused. Or how it's psychological and reaches for the character's depth and complexity of their relationship to each other, but then again kind of goes too far and gets repetitive. I loved how it tackled heavier issues like suicide ideation, mental health but again, as it went on and on and just got too stretched to the point it drained my energy and it didn't feel worth it.To finish off i loved the idea, it had a lot of potential, it has its great moments, but just doesn't get there. My biggest personal bias is that i hate romance, not as in a couple in love but as in how a message is delivered in a very positive light way but with a lot of struggle before it. \"nothing matters\" but \"i will always be here for you\" and that kinda stuff. It's just too romantic for me when things go from relatable and simple to something aiming to be beautiful and extraordinary. I think we should be kind of past that at this point as humans, as time progresses and we see how effed up things really are as a whole and instead of being proactive we try to escape to a better, more digestible place where we can be comfortable again.",

I didn't feel curious as to what I had dozed through because there was no progressive story line to follow. Just a compendium of individually non-essential scenes stitched together - any one of which could have been cut from the movie and we'd be none the wiser. It wasn't so much a plot as it was a premise, and so there was no plot to lose track of.I feel like a basic dynamic was borrowed from Sense8 - the power to tap into multiple abilities from another dimension to get out of a fix. Even so, there was never any sense that the protagonist was in any real mortal danger.There were moments of silliness and moments of sobriety that I appreciated... but on the whole, it felt mismatched.At the end of the movie, I felt cheated: what appeared to be a literal, objective experience could very well have simply been an inner struggle of the protagonist worked out in her imagination.The villain never once felt like a villain... and one knew from the moment the villain was revealed that they would inevitably have to patch things up by the end of the movie... and so there was no real sense of the villain being truly dangerous or ruthless to the core.The movie felt predictable and laborsome to watch. I'm not at all fussy and end up loving movies that most tear apart... but this film was forgettable -- they spelled it all out for us and left no mystery to ponder once all was said and done. And even the visual messiness/ madness of the movie was not disturbing or intriguing enough to give me fitful dreams - having gone straight home thereafter and jumped into bed - which I found quite odd.

But after rewatching it after some time, I am convinced that it is the best form of any storytelling I have ever come across. Granted, I haven't watched, read or played every movie/show/play, book or game ever created in the many languages that exist. But of the significant portion of my life I have spent experiencing stories and my subjective & biased parameters for what an exceptional form of storytelling should ideally be based on, I am certain that this movie is the best I've come across yet.Why do I think that?Because it combines the most investigated philosophical question of the purpose of life, the most complex metaphysical theory of multiverses and the most consistently prevalent emotions of hope & despair, all together, in 150 minutes that span almost every storytelling genre there is.And it does this with a series of truly extraordinary & powerful acting performances, elegantly simple yet extremely compelling dialogues, absurdist yet coherent editing & transitions and one of the most narratively complementary cinematography ever.Furthermore, the exceptionally intelligent use of various styles of humour, balanced with a metaphorical yet deeply compassionate use of relationships, to construct a narrative that - though may appear comically-absurd & entertaining on a casual first-watch - is actually so much more; being consistently deliberate, methodical & profound on a second viewing.All this coalesces into a unique emotional journey - with an abundance of excellent humour - that inevitably transitions to a rollercoaster ride of hope crescendos & despair diminuendos, while offering convincing justifications for these ebbs and flows, concluding in an extremely cathartic & appropriate ending.Everything Everywhere All at Once - as the title suggests - is truly a story about everything, everywhere, told all at once. It's the most conclusive story of existence. And as cliched and inaccurate its ultimate moral may seem, it ingeniously conveys it in the single most hopeful & captivating manner possible.And that's why it is the best form of any storytelling I have ever come across.",

All other concepts of the multiverse like the one in the Marvel's Universe are somehow limited - they present other worlds but with the same structure - there are humanoid creatures living their lives as we are - but with differencies being the outcome of different life decisions etc. The movie here is showing all the abstract versions of ourselves which will push some of it's audience away - which is understandable as not everyone is imaginative enough to grasp it.It was a mind boggling experience full of moral principles which we tend to ignore in our daily life.

I will be the n-th person to say this, but this movie really is Everything, Everywhere All at Once. I really do not know how this movie does it, but it has so many things that I think I normally find extremely frustrating, unrealistic or not funny at all, but with this movie I appreciate it, love it and absolutely crack up at it. Of course I have seen movies that made me go through a lot of emotions but this movie is so different. I had so many emotions, and they all felt so complete and separate, it was like I watched 5 movies that all gave me a different emotion.I think I love how this movie gives you so many options to feel about it. You can think it is a great comedy or action movie, but you can also spend a lot of time analysing all the subliminal messages of the movie and find it an incredibly deep movie. It somehow succeeds at all of it.I saw someone make the comparison with The French Dispatch (in a negative way). I absolutely hated The French Dispatch (sorry), I found it so boring, it made me go and study. But in a way, I do understand the comparison. I (an absolute layman) think The French Dispatch also tries a lot and tries to make people connect with and get into an absurd movie. To me, The French Dispatch just totally failed at connecting and well, everything.This review is probably chaotic and all over the place, I apologise, but that kind of is how this movie was for me. And I absolutely loved it! Wow!",

It goes deep into human nature and figures out that ultimately, there is no \"trick\" to enlightenment, but it's all the things in your life being in tune with each other.The whole idea of this movie essentially is to create a vibe that comes as close as possible to sense perception and the potentially extreme chaos implied by that. Life is absolutely chaotic, it is extremely hard to solve if we get engaged with the logic of our environment. The environment can potentially be hell and the mind will run away from it. Evelyn is the personification of exactly that, she runs away from the immanent facts that actually rule her life and she gets very upset whenever anyone tries to show her the vastness of reality. Having done LSD, this reminded me of certain stages during the life altering experience during the trip. It's a memory that returns periodically.Obviously the movie can have any effect on anyone, it's like drugs. Whatever you want from the drug you can achieve, if it's just fun or wisdom.

It is a very profound wisdom. Learn to understand ourselves and others, instead of criticise or judging others and ourselves. We need to relax, live simple as we can and enjoy life.",

We didn't get to experience the other people's lives, we didn't get to experience their world and so it was tough feeling the way that the main actress was suppose to be feeling.

            "content": "A multitude of timely themes, balanced storytelling, and filmmaking genius combine to create the best movie of 2022. Forever to be my favorite film of all time!A lot's been said about how EEAAO transcends the sea of today's trend-hopping, attention-grabbing blockbusters, and for good reason. It's not only heightened the bar for science fiction, it's swung open the doors to a new universe entirely. From drama to comedy and action to romance, this universe has it all! As the title suggests.Michelle Yeoh carries the film with graceful humanity, but little's been said about Ke Huy Quan. His character may not be the most blatant, but therein lies his inherent value. Maybe I relate to him a bit too much, but I very much fell for his quiet strength and enduring kindness in the midst of all the chaos. Certainly, he was a soft, but sturdy anchor for the film.Based on the reviews, I don't need to touch on Jamie Lee Curtis, but I'd be damned if I didn't give her flowers for her unprecedented performance. Her scenes alone sent me to a universe of cackling fits. And, of course, not to mention the stunning Stephanie Hsu. Typically, I'd be irritated by her kind of bratty teenager character, but I also couldn't imagine the film without her. Her fashion and styling alone *chef's kiss* - although, not to take away from her brilliant acting, which made her a convincing menace.I won't get into too much detail because 1. Really, you just need to see it for yourself; and 2. Honestly, there's not one way to perfectly capture a movie with the title EEAAO. Just know that this film is soup for the soul. I laughed, cried, and felt the full spectrum of emotions. It did everything a great movie could do, and then some.I can see how, to some people, it was literally too much. But, I also think that those who were confused perhaps were just trying too hard to make sense of an otherwise senseless - and may I remind you - fictional movie. Some films you've really got to just go with the flow and experience the scenes as the characters do. It's not always up to us to fully understand what even the characters don't realize yet. I know, what's a good movie if there's no takeaways due to missing the points? Well, maybe you're just thinking too much into it.SPOILER: if you really think you missed the mark, my take is that it had multiple glorious, life-affirming lessons. That as much as we may dream about living other lives and rethinking our life's path, there is beauty and richness in every life, even our current one. Even if it's doing laundry and taxes when another life of ours may be one of fame and fortune.To me, that is the major, overhanging theme. But the line that sticks with me most is toward the end when Michelle's character is staring down the last line of her daughter's demented warriors. Ke Huy Quan is in hysterics after a whirlwind of events and watches as she places a silly googly eye on her forehead and says, \"I'm learning to fight like you.\"Gosh, that moment is just emblazoned in my memory. Maybe I'm biased, because learning to fight like others has been a personal theme for me this year, but regardless there's so much wisdom and heart in that. It's not a theme we often see, but changing our perspective in the heat of it all, learning to embrace the simplest concept of kindness and using that awareness to change the course of conflict - say more.With the state of the world these past years, we couldn't be more in need of a film that reminds us of the importance of thinking about others beyond the surface emotions and the brazen actions. How can we improve our mindsets to switch from automatic reactions to actual problem solving? How can we dig deeper to meet unkind people with the kindness their soul more desperately needs? How can we magnify the sources of kindness in our own lives in order to save the world?This movie spells out the answers.",

I recommend that you continue to recommend this film not only because it would be a good film to watch alone or in a group, with family, friends or a loved one, but because it is a whole experience that you can have just by watching it.

This movie genuinely surprised me; I don't typically think of comedies as great media, especially not comedic movies, but this movie is so emotionally resonant while also being funny that I cannot but give it a 10. To be clear, this movie is not perfect. It's not particularly deep, intellectual or cerebral. Though its first part, Everything, is funny, the movie takes its time getting to its absolute highest. The comedy doesn't always hit, particularly some of the sexual humor or scenes where the protagonist pees herself or inhales a fly. It's not particularly hard to find a few holes in the movie's logic. To my mind, however, none of that detracts from how great this movie is. This movie is raw emotion, and if you've experienced the emotions it puts on display, I think you can get something out of it. Its representation of an American immigrant family might get nods or smiles from those who come from such a background, and its almost psychedelic representation of what it's like to feel overwhelmed by life can speak powerfully to those who've felt that way. Combine that with comedy that, to me at least, hits far harder than it misses and even plays into the more poignant aspects of the story, genuinely good action, and beautiful, surreal visuals, and you get, without exaggeration, the best movie I've ever seen. This movie looks at life in all its insanity, suffering, tedium, and regrets and says yes. And that, I think, is something a lot of people can get value out of.",

When the movie ended I was like wtf is the movie over when in reality the movie within the movie about the movie ended. Everywhere Part Two: This part is even better because I was clueless to the fact that Jobu didn't want to kill Evelyn. This part made me cry multiple times not only about Joy but about Waymond \ud83d\ude2d. All at Once Part Three: I was very confused when this started because I was confused because I was so engrossed in Part Two I forget it was a part altogether. Nonetheless it's a very sweet segment especially when Evelyn Kisses Waymond. The acting is amazing from the entire casting. Michelle Yeoh is godly in this film. Ke Huy Quan having his return with this movie was perfect.

            "content": "I have watched this amazing film in the theatre three times so far, and I finally decided to leave some of my thoughts.For those of you who have not seen it yet, it is a bonkers cinema experience that you deserve to at least give a try without knowing much about it. I believe most of you will not regret it!My Thoughts (LIGHT SPOILERS CONTAINED)1. It is an edgy and bonkers cinema experience deliberated crafted as it is - the theme of the movie is literally about everything of life, and you supposed to love and hate some parts of it. So I totally understand those 1-star reviewers who hate this movie, and I guess I am just lucky to be the ones who loves the movie very much.2. The representation of Asian immigrant family is on point - I doubt there will be other groups of people who ask themselves \"what ifs\" more often from time to time. It is never easy to make life-changing decisions to leave at least part of your family to embark a journey of unknown in a foreign land. The distance from their own culture, the conflicts with the new ones, and the learnings and evolvements over time are shaping them to be unique group of people that are their own kind. Being children of Asian American family is like trapped in between, where you are raised with family of tradition value while attempted by the free thoughts from the outside world - it is essential a struggle between collectivism and individualism. In some cases, I guess the intergenerational trauma is inevitable.3. Oh I love the PHILOSOPHY discussed in the film - I was once fallen to the idea of nihilism as I discovered that science could not essentially prove \"objective truth\", instead, it could only present you with the theories that are not disapproved yet. So by definition, everything we know could be false, even though we human beings may never have the ability to tell anyways. It left me with such a feeling of emptiness and meaninglessness - what is the point to believe in anything if nothing matters? I found some relief later in the existentialism, as I am glad to have this may-be-fake right to choose what I believe, that gives you a break while providing you with a tiny sense of being human. I chose kindness and hope because I like them, and I wish them to be true.4. Is this film perfect? Surely nothing in life is perfect, and I guess it is one of the lessons you take from this movie as well. Do I believe the movie could be shorter and concise in some parts, and tighten up things faster in the ending parts? Maybe. But it simply DOES NOT MATTER as I appreciate the movie as a whole and the full package it presented. Also, why does it matter anyways since I am only one of the infinite opinions. Just be a rock and appreciate what you have in your life!",

Everything is metaphorical and everytime you rewatch it, you will catch something co-relates to the bagel.

            "content": "This movie was extraordinarily creative, with caveats.The trailers are absolute eye candy. They include Matrix-like action scenes with high contrast and slow motion martial arts. There are mentions of the multiverse, and one headline online suggested the film was an intro into quantum mechanics and alternate dimensions. The hype is so intense for this production that I tossed my conventional thriftiness out the window to wait until the next discount day at the local theater. Instead I pre-ordered an expensive ticket for the best seat at a luxury cinema that has huge reclining leather seats with lots of leg room. I was ready to shortcut years of college physics classes for the two and a half hour long visual treat.As the movie began I skipped attention at the early scenes while organizing boxes of candy and drinks. When the tax office scene started I knew from the trailers it's time to focus. As the movie progressed it was delightful, a comedic parody merging The Matrix with The Lego Movie. So far so good. Unlike the Matrix, it's actually hilariously funny and the production team here invested in lighting so you actually can see what's going on during the movie.(Opinion ahead!)Yet, midway through the film, all of sudden realized I had been shamboozled, as scenes with the hidden meaning started illuminating through the smoke and mirrors of the parody.There's two main perspectives on where you're coming from when you watch this movie. If you're a parent of a teenager or young adult, then long story short, this film is a colorful fun metaphor for why you should always make kindness and unconditional love the number one important theme for your communication with your kid, even through the rough times. Honestly from this view it is a brilliantly wonderful modern parenting guide presented on the big screen.If you're a parent, once you get to this realization in the movie, turn on your phone, and send a text to your kid, \"Hi, how are you doing, wish you were here, it's a great movie, just reminding you that I love you.\" Then continue watching the movie, occasionally laughing aloud, which you will many times, and saying to yourself, \"Hahaha oh yeah I can relate to that conversation... and that one... and that one too\". The dramatic interaction scenes are spot on indeed.(Alternate perspective for the rest of you)However, if you don't have kids then just pretend this movie is an updated Matrix, but with lots of humor and comedy and with better lighting. Just like in The Lego Movie, we are presented a story line in which a 'nobody' can be special and save the world, or in this case all the infinite possible universes too.The Everywhere movie has a tasty recipe. Combine the somber serious overtone of The Matrix with the happier smiling vibe of The Lego Movie. Now give the chef some magic mushrooms to snack on while heating up the sauce and sprinkle some of those peyote stems in the pot and go really wild with the absurdity. For atmosphere stir in the maximum amount of layers possible. Toss in every seasoning and spice in the kitchen and let them sort out their taste buds in between chomping on popcorn.Forget using antique pay phone booths to travel! Although sniffing the Kragle might do something. Snort a bug up your nose, sit on a trophy, or chew some of that sticky gum on the bottom of your shoe. The more insane the action, the better the slingshot connecting to a wackier dimension. The visuals are so mind opening that you don't have to drive to New Jersey and get high before watching this film.(Skipping lots of specific scenes because you'll have to see for yourself, including the rubber...)Just know that when the movie ends you'll have the thought that there could be billions or trillions of versions of you, and that you could very well be living in the worst possible scenario of all of them. It's likely that every choice and decision you have ever made were the wrong ones. But take comfort in that although your life might suck, there's potentially trillions of happier versions of you and many are rich superstars. Yes you might be a failure and a nobody, but in the event of an actual multiverse emergency you might be the first one they call.Don't forget the movie's sub-sub note here. If you're with a partner, guess what, just like you they are probably the worst version of themselves too. However, since you may have just watched the movie with them, right now they might be thinking the same about you. So now's a great time to give each other a hug and kiss.(What's the real reveal?)Saving the best topic for last, who's the villain in this movie? Pay attention, because it's the only way to save the multiverse. No it's not a computer machine monster army, nor even the holder of the Kragle. It's you. Yes really it's you. Well, it's simultaneously you and most everyone else in the multiverse. So you're not alone. For the villain role Everywhere, Everything All at Once deals the most realistic aspect of the movie and of life, the typical overall lack of human kindness. In addition to making bad choices you likely have a lack of appreciation, a lack of empathy, a lack of acceptance, a lack of openness, a lack of love, a lack of communication, etc.However the solution to fixing everything that is wrong in the multiverse is actually super easy, barely an inconvenience. No it's not EMP's, nor virus codes, nor armies. The answer is kindness and love. It's here where I give the movie the highest review possible, for the truth of this simplicity should be in every movie, every play, every book, every story, every spoken dialogue, every action, every thought. Just like it is in real life, the answer to fixing everything, everywhere all at once is kindness and love.See, you gotta love a movie with a happy ending.After you leave the cinema, you might be tempted to go get a bagel with everything on it. Skip it. Go get a cookie instead. When you're there at the counter buy a few cookies for those around you and tell the person behind the counter thank you and smile, and leave a tip. While you're nibbling away, send texts to everyone you know saying \"Thanks for being you, you're amazing.\"By the time you finish and walk outside, you'll feel right as rain again.",

This is what I did, and I was glad. I returned later to watch part 2, and I can say that I was glad I did. But I don't know if I could have enjoyed part 2 if had not waited for another day.

            "content": "As a film entirely devoted to Albert Camus, it impressed me a lot. It seems to have been the philosophical reflection of the books 'The Stranger' and 'The Myth of Sisyphus'. If you are interested in the philosophy of existentialism, it will make you think a lot. The main theme is based on the problematic of whether life is worth living or not. Of course, since this is a very heavy and depressing subject, they decorated the movie with absurdly funny scenes and good enough fight scenes. If they had not done this, they would have dragged the audience into that 'Black Hole'. In short, the score in your head is constantly changing from 1 to 10 in every minute of this two-hour movie, until you end up feeling bored and sometimes stunned. The acting, visual effects, music are very good, I can say that it is the unexpected movie of the year.Albert Camus' book 'The Myth of Sisyphus' begins with this sentence; \"There is only one philosophical problem that really matters, suicide. To judge whether life is worth living is to answer the fundamental question of philosophy.\" Here is the 'Jobu Tupaki' character, after all the endless lives she has experienced in the parallel universe; She decides that the truth, the meaning of life, is nothing. She also wants to share this nothingness with her mother 'Evelyn Wang'. Her mother's experience of all these other lifetimes by following her daughter and eventually turning into stone and then rolling off the mountainside turns into a life's unchanging cycle of hope and frustration. The punishment given to Sisyphus by the gods, the burden he will carry forever, is just that. In the end, Evelyn decides that instead of getting rid of this burden placed on everyone, she should accept it and just be 'kind' in life. This is how she fights her daughter's thoughts. Your goals, your desires, everything we do may be empty and meaningless, nowhere to be found. What matters is the path itself and with whom you share it. Therefore, Sisyphus and Evelyn can find happiness in every collapse and disappointment, and such happy people spread happiness around them.",

Thee conclusion of the movie is actually harmful. It's maladaptive perfectionism which is common in narcissistic abuse. Most of the movie is what would be the reaction of an abused person. Basically a healthy person would reject the premise and not try to save everyone. You're the unibomber and I'm going to have healthy boundaries even if you're my family.If you don't believe me the multiverse is what happens when you're abused and your psyche implodes because you're regressing in an attempt to cope with the circumstance. You're living in a narcissists false reality and it's very unhealthy. Self improvement is an individual task and you should remove yourself from narcissists. That's healthy behavior.

But among the best movies, there are ones that inspire a whole genre and a generation.For me, the matrix is that kind of movie. Within which there is a fascinating, realistic world with its unique physics laws, culture, hierarchy, and characters. And the creators are at their premiere era of creation, and ideas are so overflowing that they try hard to push them into their works like cramping a feast into a tightening tin can. And when you open it, it just blows everything right in your face. Compared to Avatar, another one of my favorites, Avatar is the feast, much more mature, presented to you in a Michelin dining room, and you're well-acquainted that it must be dame good before tasting, without some specific feeling of surprise.I don't need to comment on the details or philosophy of the movie. There are tons of them. Instead, I want to express that you have to watch it and break your mind. It should be a movie you need to watch in your lifetime. PS, any rating less than 8/10 is not fair.",

The importance of relationships in life really hit deep. This is the first I've seen Stephanie Hsu in anything and I am a fan. She plays all sides of her role to perfection. As always Jamie Lee Curtis delivers. The amount of characters each character had to play really intrigued me. Ke Huay Quan makes such a great comeback into the acting world.

There are a million different ways to rank media, so every piece of art is interesting or flawed in their own way. Also, art is subjective. I can safely say however, \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" is OBJECTIVELY the GREATEST movie of all time... by FAR. This movie is incredibly ambitious, juggling 7 different themes that somehow weave together and coalesce perfectly by the end of the movie. I actually cannot believe they managed to pull off this dangerous feat of beauty. It's a visually stunning psychedelic trip incorporating weighty philosophical ideas like existentialism and nihilism in a playful and humorous way. You will feel a combination of 4 different emotions \"All at Once\". The line between the metaphorical and literal is blurred. It is simultaneously very basic and accessible, but also esoteric and dense. Its both lowbrow and highbrow.\"Everything Everywhere all at Once\" includes 6 different genres that are somehow done perfectly. Its a drama, comedy, matrix film, Jackie Chan film, and multiverse film all in one movie. I cant criticize this movie in any way. I'm actually disgusted by how good this movie is. The acting was perfect and the pacing was spot on. Its intense (like uncut gems) that is overwhelmingly stimulating (emotionally, visually, and mentally) in the best way possible.The political/cultural parts of the movie are conveyed in an authentic and non-soy way. It includes an older immigrant woman, her gay daughter, and a message about acceptance and love yet there was no fake, overdone \"GIRLPOWER!! LOOK STRONG WOMAN\" cringe. \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" is a 10/10 film that excels above every film I have seen on all dimensions. Please watch this film. I sound like a crazy person right now, but I promise after watching the movie, you will understand my fanaticism and thank me for the recommendation.",

            "content": "Everything everywhere all at once is an amazing experience, that of course isn't perfect, similar to most worlds depicted in it.It is unique and in complete disregard of fast food movie tropes, although, there is one, and no, it is not the multiverse-subgenre in itself...So it was a mother/daughter movie at its core, but to some parts the film makers had no idea what that actually entails and means, so they forced in a lesbian subplot for the daughter that was utterly redundant and because it was such a klischee of our time, a bit offensive. It was a cheap excuse to not have to put in the work to find something original and fitting, whilst the rest of the movie is exactly that, detrimental, I know.You can exchange this subplot for everything actually, and everywhere it would feel similarly artificial, underused as it was, which bags the question why this was chosen of all the all-at-once elements that would have had a way bigger impact, and would have had a lot more comedic potential, as the only thing that didn't get ridiculed and multiversed in the movie was the daughters girlfriend, because duh.This got even more obvious as there was an amazing parallel universe already with two female characters that felt organic, truthful and utterly fitting into the concept.It was respectful, cute and wholesome, the exact opposite of the daughters subplot, which feels even more misplaced and unnecessary, when comparing the two.That was my main critic, on to the good stuff, ergo, the rest of the movie.It deserves all the praise, with amazing female actors, who absolutely smash it - Jackie-Chan-style, which makes it so much more enjoyable as this style of fighting is such an underused story-telling-vehicle in nowadays cinema.Indiana Jones' Shorty (Ke Huy Quan) is finally back on the big screen as well, which is a bittersweet thing in itself, brilliantly portraying the father in absolute harmony with Michelle Yeoh, who runs the show with incredible comedic precision, that only gets equaled by her martial arts skills and the overall choreography. She remembers us time and time again, that Asian cinema had its leading lady all along.In comes Stephanie Hsu, as the daughter, who mirrors Yeoh in the most compelling way, yet she is bringing her own uniqueness into the ring. She showcases Joy's burden in the most bizarre and joyful (Pun intended) ambivalence, so full of insanity, that you catch yourself screaming in support of letting her go into the goddamn bagel!The cast gets completed by greats Jamie Lee Curtis and James Hong, both deserving of all the nominations that will come in. Especially Curtis' IRS clerk, who you just love to hate and once everything is over, love to love. Let that sink in, they managed to humanize a worker drone from the IRS, if that isn't a cinematic milestone in each parallel universe there is, then there is no hope left.Hongs Gong Gong on the other hand goes the other way and back again, ridden with guilt and only driven by closure. What he delivered here, at his age is nothing short of a marvel, that marvel can only dream of.Honorable mentions are going to Harry Shum Jr. And Bradley Cooper for showing us that even trash pandas can be great cooks.What is left to say? If you are longing for an original cinematic experience it is your obligation to support this film by all means, and to make sure that Hollywood understands, that even in our multiverses of madness, it is uniqueness, that prevails.",

Ke Huy Quan back on the screen again, and I may be slightly in love with Stephanie Hsu. Jamie Lee Curtis is almost unrecognisable as an auditor and well, once the film takes off it is an amazing, wild and increasingly mad journey (seriously, at times there are people with hotdogs for fingers and a chap that appears to be wearing toasters on his jacket) Watch it now.",

However, it is worth watching it until the end because it improves at times although from the first minute it surprises you in a very spectacular way audiovisually speaking. There is no scene that is the same as the previous one.I wanted to highlight the performance of Jonathan Ke Quan, who plays the husband of the protagonist. He's a super charismatic character and it's partly why the film works so well because of the duo that the leading lady (Michelle Yeoh) plays.The film is divided into two acts, which is something different from what is commonly.

This film felt like it was made for me, to reflect my experiences as an Asian woman growing up and not a white woman. I've never seen that before. This film is brilliant and a must watch, but it also made me tear up because for the first time of elf seen.

The film is well rhythmic, you never get bored. The writing is as touching as it is funny. This film is really impressive, it surprises us every second. You never really know what you're watching, you alternate between sf and family drama.

It's clever, emotional, hysterical, thoughtful and you walk out elated and happy you saw the movie. It's deep, if you want it to be, and fun regardless. Ambitious as heck, it successful pulls off its ambitions and joins my top ten list movies that i have enjoyed of all time, and i have conservatively seen 5000 movies. And if you don't like it? Too much for you? Well, at least you saw it and now have an opinion.",

It's an every household story, but with the help of the concept of multiverse.Themes of family, kindness, selfishness & selflessness, unending commitment to love, etc echoes loud throught the whole journey.This movie is a case study and will be studied by film schools for generations.",

It's both an emotional roller coaster and a deeply thought-provoking meditation on the meaning of life. At its heart, though, is a simple tale of love mislaid and found again. The acting is perfect, the writing is perfect, the direction is perfect; even the music is wonderful. Thankfully it is not actually all at once, but its 140 minutes of undiluted delight fly by way too fast. It's worth a second viewing. Or a third.",

This movie is funny, bold, creative, maybe cheesy at times, but overall it's a profound movie.The central theme of the movie is the battle between nihilism and absurdism (or existentialism). Nihilists say that the universe is meaningless and our lives are pointless. The antagonist of this story is a nihilist and wants to wallow in sadness and gloom. Existentialists and absurdists both attempt to solve the problems created by nihilism. Existentialists believe that since the universe is meaningless we are free create meaning of our own, and that is a beautiful thing. Absurdists argue that the universe is absurd and meaningless and one must find happiness in the absurd.This movie presents all of these philosophical ideologies and does justice to them in my opinion.",

People look for different things in a film: perhaps to see something visually appealing, perhaps to escape from reality for a while, perhaps to learn some important life lessons, or perhaps just to experience something new. This film has all of that. Give it a watch: whether you end up liking it or not, you will definitely experience something you've definitely never experienced before, intensely. 10/10.",

We could be rocks-it would be peaceful but at the expense of missing out on the beautiful chaos and connection life can bring. Whatever strange, terrible, absurd makeup of molecules we came to this world in or another world or parallel world for that matter-make your molecules send waves of positivity, connection, love. It hits different out there. \n\nNothing matters, existence is absurd, yet in our own personal universes everything matters. We can't change the crazy swirling universe/s around us but we can make an impact on the the swirling universes of each person by listening to them, seeing them, treating them with kindness. That is our only hope- no one gets out of here alive.\n\nThe movie seems to take absurd to an extreme at some points but then again, does it really? Think of the absurdity of human construct. We have created a world where we dress up our natural bodies in uncomfortable clothes and spend most of our time alive inside a cubicle until almost the time of our demise for pieces of paper to buy large homes we spent in less time than we do going to the cubicle to buy them. Our existence is scientifically proven to be nothing short of miraculous and this is what we have designed to pass the time of our miraculous existence. We are absurd. Everything is. But we can be kind.",

The attempted storyline surprises and low budget visual effects caught my heart not because it's the best, but because it's their best from what they can offer. In fact, more than what they could offer. The story is so deep and heartfelt, for me it's not telling just about the mother-daughter relationship but a deeper understanding of a pain felt by people who lost hope in the low point of their life, it's bizarrely speaking to those who had lost their passion in living in any universe (being portrayed so painfully through the antagonist), and the \"O\" bagel (such a humorous element, a bagel as empty as it seem literally made me laugh in the mid of teary scenes) assuming it symbolising the emptiness in all universes is what many people face in this colourful society nowadays. And in the end the story hints about holding the very moment and seeing the beauty in all emptiness, if to be digested well, this story brings so much hope, love, in-depth view of life and some entertaining action scenes and plebeian moments that humble people can relate to. This movie is a masterpiece of bringing the theme of love without even mentioning the word \"love\".",

            "content": "Not nearly as good as other people might lead you to believe.  It starts out incredibly slow with the story of an Asian washeteria owner, her husband, her Americanized daughter, and her wheelchair-bound, disapproving father.  At an IRS audit, her husband switches bodies with his counterpart from another universe where things are a lot more exciting and some unknown force is trying to end all other parallel universes. (SPOILER AHEAD).  He's come to convince the washeteria lady to join the fight and at first, she has no interest or belief in his antics.  Turns out, as part of switching between universes, you have to do something totally random and silly like sticking a foreign object up your backside while whistling The Star Spangled Banner.  That's not in the movie, but it's an example of how silly things can get.  Much of the movie falls back on stereotypical wire-fighting like we've seen in so many previous movies like another Michelle Yeoh vehicle, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  If you like that sort of thing, you'll probably like this movie because it has a lot of it.  (SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER).  Turns out the force trying to end all of reality in all universes is the daughter of the washeteria owner and the rest of the movie is Michelle Yeoh's character trying to make up with her daughter and form a bond even though everyone else is telling her that, in order to save reality, she has to kill her daughter in every universe.  And so, that's it.  That's what won the Oscar.  Big disappointment for me and I'm a huge Michelle Yeoh fan.  I was even excited to see Ke Huy Quan again and he did a formidable acting job in this movie.  My biggest disappointment was the story.  Acting was fine from all involved.  While the story was somewhat original, it seems like it's just one of the pack of movies coming out lately (mainly from Marvel) where a multiverse is involved.  If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, someone is getting mighty flattered today.",

            "content": "Underwhelming. Could've won 4 Oscars (editing, costume, set design, supporting) + 2 nominations (screenplay, direction), but it's only above-average as an overall movie or experience. Not even close to the best movie of 2022 so the record-breaking number of awards is head-scratching. It's extremely derivative (the plot is The Matrix) & there are too many references to other better films throughout as it jumps from 2001 Space Odyssey reference to Matrix reference to 'some other movie' reference.\n\nOverall it's a very silly movie, that gets stuck between two conflicting tones (melodrama & slapstick comedy). Imagine the plot of The Matrix mixed with the tone of Scott Pilgrim. It's jocular tone doesn't match it's disconsolate themes (regret & nihilism). It contains strong components, but might've been better if treated more seriously, dramatically. Allow characters, themes, & actors to create tone so your fun can be earned through story. Instead it's forcefully directed like, \"let's try to make it fun.\" Reminds me of the quote, \"there's a difference between being smart & trying to be smart.\" So on one hand it's a somewhat fun movie, but on the other hand its fun is a contrivance.\n\nWhat worked least for me was: two rocks talking with subtitles, the personification of eternity as an everything bagel & the main character. One of the worst lead characters you'll see: completely cowardly at every turn & a nearly unbearable attempt to create an anti-hero. Thematically it's so heavy handed, it's nearly preachy. What worked best was the first few minutes of act 1 (how it was written, acted, executed). The opening character introductions, pacing & writing are excellent in a complex 'show don't tell' type manner. It quickly devolves into a slapstick time travel romp & lost it's steam once it started 'verse jumping.'\n\nIt's not a bad movie, but it wasn't a great movie like I was expecting from all of the awards and the price to rent. Nicest way I could say it is it wasn't for me. To be fair, that could be due to demographics. If you're under 30, especially female audiences, you may connect with it better. For viewers over 30, especially male audiences who's tastes might typically align with the critic scores more than audience scores, it likely will not reach your expectations & you might even find it growingly frustrating as it continually falls short of those expectations. It's best suited as a mother/daughter bonding movie with some popcorn, but it's not as universal, original, or good as it's score might have you believe.",

            "content": "First review I'm doing on Rotten Tomatoes!\nI want to start of with saying that this movie is one of those movies you have to watch in one sitting and preferably on a big screen. To not have you wait for my honest feedback I'll give it now and then explain why. In all of the movies I have watched, enjoying everything from comedies to action films, sci-fi and dramas, this is absolutely the greatest masterpiece I have ever had the pleasure to watch. If I could, I would love to watch it for the first time again - such an emotional journey it takes one on.\nI have to mention one thing to set your expectations straight: - do not go into this movie aching for a logical, realistic, planned through story to be told- if you do you'll be very disappointed. This is not like any other movie, this is a piece of film - the conglomerations of visuals and sound that produce tension and get the audiences attention. \nBefor watching this movie, I did not know why this movie won so many Oscar's, I was more pessimistic on the overall quality of the movie. The reason why i believe it's one of the greatest film artworks ever is because the absence of rationality and logic, of structured content and foreseeable behaviour allows the creation of feelings and a connection with the overall human emotions portrayed like no other movie has done. Because it does not make sense it feels so close to us. Most of what we experience, what we truly feel does not make sense - we can be angry but still love a person, we can have an abundance of things but still feel empty- unfulfilled. The movie creates so many different scenarios into which we can portray ourselves into, that it connects everybody to the plot ( hell I could not take my eyes off of the screen in the last 30 minutes). This gives everyone this (joy)ride of fast emotions that everyone has - the movie makes you feel happy, sad, disappointed, content, confused, orderly, scared all at the same time. The first half takes getting used to, but if you embrace the confusion, the chaos and watch the second half you'll have the absolute mesmerising experience of a wave of emotions coming over you, being captivated by the pleasure of what it feels like to be alive. Go and watch it!",

I don't see what's so great about the film. Yes, it is somewhat funny with a heartwarming story that unfolds; however, about 45-60 minutes into it, I was already done. You're not supposed to say the quiet part loud but I'm going to: this won at the Oscars for one reason and one reason only, DEI. It's an average film at best that won due to weak competition or films that were overlooked that should have easily won but were snubbed for Best Picture and Best Director (and yes, I'm talking about THE WHALE and Darren Aronofsky). Within a year this film will be forgotten. Don't get me wrong, I'm extremely happy Laurie Strode won an Oscar (surprised in fact as the buzz heading in was Angela Bassett would win), as well as Ke Huy Quen who will always have a special place in my heart like so many others for Data and Short Round. Finally, isn't it cultural appropriation for Daniel Scheinert to direct basically an all Asian cast? Just asking.",

First you think that this is intentional, so as to convey the chaotic situation, and once it is established, the pace and tone will settle down. Nope. This is the entire film. \n\nThe film is a nonsensical mish-mash cacophony of frantic, hectic, hyper, non-stop dialog, noise, lights, people, and things. I understand that this is the point, and it's supposed to be Funny & Satirical & Smart & Weird & Sweet & Edgy & Silly & Serious & Meta.\n\nHowever in my opinion it tries way, way too hard, and ultimately falls flat on its face in all its aspirations. At least the title is apt.\n\nSurprise-Surprise, trying to be Everything Everywhere, all at once... doesn't work! At least not for me, as I see that it does for many others. (I will leave the audience cultural psychoanalysis to others \ud83e\udd2a)\n\nThe film is simultaneously sensory overwhelming, and very boring. Dumb, but pretentious at the same time. Both branching & multi-verse hoping, but also repetitive and so very predictable. Quite the accomplishment.\n\nMy quick summary of what I watched:\n\nA high budget student film- bad imitation Woody Allen meets a bad imitation Rick & Morty meets a bad imitation Jackie Chan\n...on coke\n...and LSD\n... and partially in Cantonese\n\nWritten in a parallel universe by Alex Kurtzman and directed by Michael Bay, after they had both been lobotomized with a wooden spoon.\n\nThis actually sounds cooler than it is. Ha! So if this sounds like your cuppa tea, and you are not epileptic (seriously), then... hey go for it. It is certainly an experience! \n\n* Still, I am happy that Short-Round won an Oscar \ud83d\ude09",

The multiverse theory is just a mathematical way to explain the way a universe that favors life could come about randomly and is actually a way to show a way to satisfy the Cosmological Constant and the infinitesimal chance that life could have come about:  Parallel universes containing other versions of ourselves is not a part of the theory.

I would rank this one right up there with any films the great masters ever made. It's not for the people who love \"Cocaine Bear\" or franchise sequels Like marvel movies. It's made for people who love cinema.  It's a Comedy /sci-fi / action film based around a story of a struggling immigrant family on the verge of divorce and their daughter's nihilist attitudes. If you can watch this movie and not laugh and cry at least once, you need to check your pulse, cause you might be dead. \nIt's easily going somewhere in my top 10 list of favorite films of all time...

Furthermore, it is absolutely blasphemous that Jamie Lee Curtis could win best supporting actress over Angela Bassett. Yes, Jamie Lee Curtis's role was very diverse in Everything Everywhere All At Once, but it certainly did not deserve recognition over Angela bassett's performance and Wakanda Forever. More credit should have been done to the costume and makeup team for Jamie Lee Curtis's character. It was not emotional, it was not groundbreaking, it was not moving, and you would barely know she was in it because it was such an insignificant role as far as impact is concerned. On the other hand, Angela bassett's performance was emotional, it was heartfelt, it was strong, it was passionate, it was memorable, and she was absolutely snubbed. The academy should be ashamed of themselves because this choice seemed more of a racially biased move or political move, I can't put my finger on it but they definitely got that one wrong and missed an opportunity to give a premiere actress her flowers while she's still with us. I noticed that there's been criticism of the movie Wakanda Forever as there are many people in the United States, and across the world, that have a hard time grasping the idea of an elite African nation, on top of the food chain that, couple with the fact that the movie highlights some injustices on behalf of the white man. I get it, but let's take off our blinders and be real. Conversely, EEAAO is receiving positivity biased kudos due to the industry's recent infatuation with Asian inclusivity. And don't get me wrong, the actors in this movie are absolutely phenomenal and this is nothing against them, this is against the academy, this is against the biased critics. Yes, the movie is different and refreshing but that does not make it a better movie than some of its competing films.",

I believe they chose a heroine and a storyline in general which provided a lot of social commentary about modern American life, and the overwhelming nature of our capitalist culture and how it punishes minorities the most.  \n\nUnfortunately, the film seems to lack an articulated or properly-maintained plot at points, and tries to juggle way too many different themes and directions at the same time to be comprehensible.  I was very frustrated by how often the plot took off ramps onto another theme or action scene, without fully developing and explaining what was going on (descriptively or symbolically) in the previous scenes.  I'm guessing this may have something to do with the average American's ever decreasing attention span and critical thinking skills, which seems to have negatively influenced Hollywood film directing over the years.  Regardless of the real reason behind these directing decisions, it made it very difficult to absorb the material at times.\n\nI was also disappointed with the character development of Jobu Tupaki/Joy.  I never felt the audience got sufficient explanation or context behind /why/ she was so suicidal and hostile toward her mother, beyond some superficial information detailing typical parent/ teen child antagonism, or the story of split personalities due to too much multiverse switching.  Someone who is going through complex suffering and struggles to develop into that character deserves a comprehensive backstory and contextual interpretation.  Perhaps some of the explanations for her pain lie in inter-generational conflicts within Chinese American families, in which case that explanation may have been lost in cultural translation.  But I also think aspects of her backstory and character may have also just been poorly written.\n\nAlso, there are far too many kink and BDSM material to make me feel comfortable. Unless these BDSM scenes were poorly-developed attempts at satire, the film seemed to otherwise be promoting a culture that for many people is often one of out-of-control consumerism, exploitation, and abuse.  I get it, adding this material gives the illusion of adding prestige, exoticism, or 'intricacy' to a film.  That's often the effect BDSM references have on general audiences, since that culture is taken at face value as a 'rebellion against normalcy'.  Introducing BDSM themes out of context also has some kind of shock and awe effect, and can be injected in content that may not otherwise be sufficiently thought provoking.  But that's just it, the real value of this material is illusive, and putting motifs of kinky practices in film to substitute more powerful messages or ideas can't fool everyone.  That's not including how gross and disturbing a lot of the kink content was to begin with.",

At it's core, yes it had a touching family story of a underrepresented part of American society, but the movie spent so little time actually developing that and instead decided to have the actors engage in 3 stooges slap stick routines and throw up site gags like dildo nun chucks and hot dog fingers, of which I just did not understand the purpose. Did the directors feel the story was too boring and decided they needed to entertain the audience with parlor tricks and a ridiculous marvel like scifi plot? I became so annoyed and frustrated like I was purposely being distracted and denied the actual story. These are the kind of movies I just hate, that make me feel I'm wasting my time in order for the director and actors to seemingly just show off and enjoy themselves. Another film that honestly pissed me off as much as this, well more, was tenet...I get nauseous thinking about that hot mess. But hey at least the title hits the nail on the head and kinda warns you for what your in for. Its exactly why I avoided seeing the movie until all the Oscar buzz.

It's like people are running out of ideas! But not with this movie - it was the most unique movie I can remember watching. It had everything: humour, sci-fi, action, martial arts and so much raw emotion. The emotion was so strong that I cried one minute and was belly laughing the next. At one point I didn't know if my tears were from laughing or feeling emotional. All thanks to the incredible acting and brilliant script! It must be so difficult for the actors to do comedy acting one minute and then pour so much emotion into the role the next, not to mention all of the action scenes. I appreciate some won't get it, for me and my easily bored ADHD brain it was absolutely perfect! I wonder if the ones that walked out did so when the movie pretended to end! I've watched it three times and could watch it many more. You always see something different the next time you see it. I'm so glad something so unique has won so many awards, and I was rooting for them all during the whole awards season and so happy with the Oscars wins.

Also the rock metaphor didn't track cause she lets her fall off the cliff and then  when she's convincing her to stay she falls off the cliff after her? Didn't really make sense.

Partly it is about nihilism vs love/kindness/connection which for me was another relatable piece.  And partly I was impressed at the overall creativity, acting and humor.  It was not like most films nowadays that are all focused on action or gratuitous violence or predictable tropes.  Yes, the pace was a bit manic at first and took me a bit to fully get where they were heading but I left the theater deeply moved.  I saw it a second time recently, now knowing the plot (and the hype) and it didn't land quite as strongly, but I noticed a lot more fun bits that I missed the first time and I remain impressed at the creativity and basic heart/feeling the film has.",

            "content": "This masterpiece is all about everything happening everywhere, just like the title. And I assure you that you will feel the same way as I do when you watch it. So there will be a question about what is even \"everything\" to start with. Everything is about your life and those people who you are surrounded with. This movie may be fictional by the inclusion of a multiverse but the depiction of underlying philosophical meaning about the realistic view of family issues, life choices, and all the possibilities we could create from small insignificant decisions in our daily lives reflect and wonder about our lives a lot. The whole plot itself takes place in the multiverse which might be something confusing when people who are unfamiliar with the concept hear that but surprisingly it is very simple to comprehend the whole plot. \n\nIt will give you a tremendous amount of different emotions, some of them which you might not have even experienced before. At least, it was that way for me. Many types of comedy also take place in the plot frequently and all of them are fantastic and in perfect timing. Despite having so many funny and ridiculous scenes, the plot itself is very serious to the point everyone can relate to either characters or situations in their lives such as the scenes when the movie depicted the young couple making \"wrong\" choices in this universe, the parenthood focusing on both the perspective of the wife (Evelyn)  and the husband (Waymond), their teenage daughter (Joy)'s problems concerning her life choices being unaccepted by her mother, ruined and shattered hopes from a young couple,  their business situations, the typical dead romance between the long-married couple (especially Asian couples), and many other characters' plots and viewpoints.\n\n\nThere are no villains in this movie. At the first glance, you might probably think (as it is stereotyped) of the mysterious character who seems to have bad intentions toward the universe, Jobu Tupaki (Joy) as the villainess. But if you can truly apprehend the way she becomes who she is, her actions are not justifiable but are understandable. Then, her mother would be the one you would want to blame for making Joy the way she is. But turns out, that is also not the case as everyone always wants the best for themselves or their loved ones. Her mother's action is also understandable but not justifiable. So in short, either her father, her grandfather and his organization, her mother, herself and everyone and every version of them in different universes cannot be blamed as it is going in a circle, and not one person can be blamed for one exact cause. \n\nLast of all, \"Nothing matters\", the main concept of this movie. This line mentioned by Jobu Tupaki(Joy) is a very simple yet powerful line for everyone everywhere it also shows her belief in one of the most famous philosophical branches called Nihilism. She tried to end the whole multiverse and universes by sucking everything into the giant bagel with her superpowers because nothing really matters to her anymore. But the fact that she wanted to end it together with her mother from the far multiverse shows that someone still matters to her and if we think carefully about Joy, she is doing all these things because of the concept of \"nothing matters\" matters to her. And yes it actually feels nice to think that way because if nothing matters, all the pain and guilt we feel from nothing of our lives go away as it is stated by Jobu Tupaki. But on the contrary and concluding from the ending and Evelyn's fighting scene against her daughter to stop her from going into the bagel, we can say that because nothing really matters, it is our choice to decide what and who matters in our daily lives and give and try our best for them no matter whatever the hardship we may face. I think that everyone should watch this movie at least once in their lifetime. You will get an unbelievably amazing experience and feeling in the duration of these 2 hours.",

The tired and hollow storyline really really dragged on me\u2026\n\nI'm going to be blunt: This movie is like a bright speckled donut injected with some super stale bland bread and with a hollow core.\n\nWe get it. It's a story about a mother of a depressed, anxious suicidal young adult, but the treatment is so shallow that if you try to dive in you'll break something. \n\nDaughter: The writers never really get into the daughter and present her as a flapping conundrum for the mother. The writers see fit to laminate a layer of gay in the daughter as if somehow that helps support the daughter's feelings (offensive meter is ticking), but never really delve into the experience of being gay and they never show a moment of gayness in the film, they just slap a label on her, make her hold a girl's hand and the job is done. Instead they focus on presenting the daughter as a writhing ball of whimsical existential angst - and that's it.\n\nOn to the mother: Just a trope of a character. Maternal angst meets bored middle aged woman stuck in a rut. Yay.\n\nTheir relationship: They don't have one. It's just two shallow characters, one pulling away and the other trying to cling on, \"SAVE\" the other from themselves and neither really understanding the other. Hot tip for the writers: without you guys writing these characters as more than a window shop painting, you can't write true connection between them. How do you display human understanding between two characters if there's nothing for the audience to understand either?\n\nThe rest of the movie was shiny and silly. \n\nThe shine: The shine was pretty. Lots of pretty things. They were shiny. They were well done. I liked them! But you can't watch 2:20 of shiny things alone\u2026 well I cant. Gummies aren't legal where I live.\n\nThe silly: The kind of silly people who wear Depends appreciate, but for everyone else it's like trying to share a meal with the same person after they've taken their evening Xanax.\n\nI have no idea how this movie won so many awards outside of the visuals.\n\n2/5",

I have been starting to feel like originality in film is hard to come by. Uhhh.... until this mind f*ck of a film comes out of nowhere and blows my mind. Even if its not your cup of tea you have to respect the sheer amount of creativity, originality, and the overall risk these filmmakers took. It's funny, weird, emotional, raunchy, sad all at once. IT IS EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE.Obviously we haven't seen multiverse of madness yet but did a movie with 95 percent less of its budget and zero previous hype just show marvel how to do multiverse correctly? This movie is a benchmark for originality. Can't recommend it enough! Tell your friends, family, ex girlfriend and everyone you know and lets get some butts in seats and make this movie a hit!",

But after rewatching it after some time, I am convinced that it is the best form of any storytelling I have ever come across. Granted, I haven't watched, read or played every movie/show/play, book or game ever created in the many languages that exist. But of the significant portion of my life I have spent experiencing stories and my subjective & biased parameters for what an exceptional form of storytelling should ideally be based on, I am certain that this movie is the best I've come across yet.Why do I think that?Because it combines the most investigated philosophical question of the purpose of life, the most complex metaphysical theory of multiverses and the most consistently prevalent emotions of hope & despair, all together, in 150 minutes that span almost every storytelling genre there is.And it does this with a series of truly extraordinary & powerful acting performances, elegantly simple yet extremely compelling dialogues, absurdist yet coherent editing & transitions and one of the most narratively complementary cinematography ever.Furthermore, the exceptionally intelligent use of various styles of humour, balanced with a metaphorical yet deeply compassionate use of relationships, to construct a narrative that - though may appear comically-absurd & entertaining on a casual first-watch - is actually so much more; being consistently deliberate, methodical & profound on a second viewing.All this coalesces into a unique emotional journey - with an abundance of excellent humour - that inevitably transitions to a rollercoaster ride of hope crescendos & despair diminuendos, while offering convincing justifications for these ebbs and flows, concluding in an extremely cathartic & appropriate ending.Everything Everywhere All at Once - as the title suggests - is truly a story about everything, everywhere, told all at once. It's the most conclusive story of existence. And as cliched and inaccurate its ultimate moral may seem, it ingeniously conveys it in the single most hopeful & captivating manner possible.And that's why it is the best form of any storytelling I have ever come across.",

As a comedy it fails, its humor is very childish and ridiculous, there are comedy movies from the time of our grandparents whose humor still seems funny to us today, the humor of this movie is almost purely visual by showing ridiculous fights or characters dressed in ridiculous to say an example. As a science fiction genre, it also fails, despite the fact that the genre is fantasy, in general, the universe that we are presented with has consistency, it is credible, it has logic and if there are elements that are not very credible, they end up being few or scarce. The science fiction of this movie is so silly, so unbelievable that I can't really immerse myself in it. The story and relationship between the mother and her daughter, and how it develops, doesn't seem bad to me, but the other elements that I mentioned before are like ruining the experience of the movie itself. The film is new, I don't know if you could even talk about a new genre because of how incredibly chaotic it is, but even so, the stupidity of the plot, the stupidity of its universe, the bad humor, the nonsense of how several of the events take place that make me unable to recommend it and rate it negatively.",

That they don't challenge them, and they're not inventive enough. But when they break out of the mould, they dismiss them as too ambitious and complicated for those same audiences.So what the hell are we doing? Or are they telling the crowd they're too dumb?And I comment on this because one of the many things I've heard about this film is that it would be too much for the average audience, but that's not the case at all.Everything Everywhere All at Once is perhaps a film that pushes its concept a bit too far, but that doesn't make it any less appealing. Because as far as I could tell, once its plot explodes, the chaos of everything it presents is the cornerstone of the story, and therefore you must embrace that chaos.The irony of it all is that in the end it's actually a pretty ordinary story.Yes, of course, it is still an emotional, philosophical and profound journey through a complex narrative device such as the multiverse, but the underlying idea is still a story in which its protagonist must confront and question everything about her life. From her family to the decisions and failures that have brought her to the point where she finds herself when it all begins.Perhaps the teaching addressed in its conclusion is nothing earth-shattering, but the journey to reach it was thoroughly entertaining, chaotic and exhilarating, and that was something really, really good.And above all, what a great performance by Michelle Yeoh. She is the absolute captain of this film. Her co-stars do a great job too, but this is her show.",

The acting and cinematography are top notch, the multiverse story is insanely innovative and wacky, and the writing is so perfectly done and impactful. Furthermore, while the comedy comes rapid-fire at points and lands almost every time, the film takes its time for slower, more introspective scenes that leave one wondering about how their multiversal selves are and how we can make the most of this life we have here, even if it may not be as impressive as we hoped.

It is filled to the brim with ideas some being absolute crazy in the positive way, has great humor, a near perfect cast and fights that made the older Jackie Chan movies jealous. A wild and crazy ride that was more enjoyable than almost any other movie I have seen in years. The story starts with the worst day Chinese immigrant Evelyn Wang could imagine. Her laundromat business she had with her husband is investigated by the internal revenue service (IRS), her husband wants a divorce, her lesbian daughter wants her family to accept her white girlfriend while her estranged and traditional father just arrived while they prepare for the new year celebration. Things take a sudden change when in the elevator of the IRS building her husband completely changes personality. He says a multiverse exists and he is from a different universe / reality. The whole multiverse is in danger and Evelyn is their hope to stop the catastrophe. I stop here to avoid spoilers. The story is amazingly well written. It has so many ideas, craziness, humor and highlights. No movie I remember in recent years could compete. We think drugs were involved for a lot of ideas but everything works excellent which is the prove for the quality of writing. Think about it. If done poorly this would be a laughing stock of a story and movie. So I have to praise all writers, directors, producers and the whole team behind the camera. The actors were equally amazing and I think it is a close to a perfect cast as it could be. Michelle Yeoh is Oscar worthy and I am deeply impressed by her performance. Stephanie Hsu, Kee Huy Quan, Jamie Lee Curtis,  James Hong and Tallie Medel are all excellent and improve the movie. Then there is the humor. I laughed a lot and cant remember the last movie that was as great for the humor. The fight scenes are amazing and some put Jackie Chan to shame. Lastly I must praise the sets, costumes and CGI. They nailed the movies atmosphere and style with those. Overall this is a masterpieces and truly unique. It was so good that future movies will be rated against this for me.

I liked that its set in such a domestic, dare I say particularly boring setting as an IRS office. The visual effects are great - I liked the cartoon strip feel to some effects in particular (I won't elaborate so as not to provide potential spoilers). I found it difficult to follow all the plot details but I certainly wouldn't say that affected my enjoyment of the film overall. Watching the fast paced fight scenes reminded me a little of kung fu or samurai films of the 1970s. At times Chinese songs are played in the background and it was nice to see the various family members speaking in their (I assume) mother tongue. As over the top as it undoubtedly is for the most part, there is a point in which things slow down significantly - that is somewhat poignant. I should perhaps note that a fair amount of the dialogue is in either Mandarin or Cantonese, hence subtitles are often present, which may or may not put you off it. Its a very engrossing and yet also somewhat baffling film, with a quirky, arty feel to it to an extent but enough mainstream CGI to entertain the audience well, I reckon. It's definitely a film to re-watch, as I was left thinking 'what did I just see?' by the end.Needless to say, I would definitely recommend this film, yes.",

Your brain will undoubtedly be stimulated. Overall verdict: a cinematic experience once must experience in the cinemas. This will undoubtedly one of the front runners for Best Picture.",

The action scenes are very beautiful and we feel all the love of the directors for the films of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. The editing is very fluid and pleasant. The film is well rhythmic, you never get bored. The writing is as touching as it is funny. This film is really impressive, it surprises us every second. You never really know what you\u2019re watching, you alternate between sf and family drama. This film is really a new breath in the current film industry, an author\u2019s blockbuster that never suffers from its low budget and that could become for the next generation of filmmakers a revolutionary film as was the first Matrix (whose film is inspired ) by its positivity, its universal message, and its cinematic qualities.",

I cannot understand how this was widely proclaimed one of the best movies of 2022. This movie is a pretentious mess that only professional movie critics would like. The editing can induce an epileptic fit, the story paper thin. The humor is crass and childish - there's a parallel universe where people have hot dogs for fingers. There's a scene where two men kung fu fight with butt plugs. Not hitting each other with butt plugs, no they fight with butt plugs inside them. In their butts. That is how you make the \"movie of 2022\", folks.According to the Wikipedia synopsis this movies handles themes like existentialism, generational trauma, nihilism, absurdism, and Asian-American identity, and I say with great confidence that I didn't see anything of the sort. Sure, it pretends to, with pretentious hand waving and preachy yelling, but there is nothing you can take away and apply to your own life.

Director is great at using slow mo, cinematography, and music to manipulate audience emotions- basically an intense emotional roller coaster. The simplest way to understand this movie is that lady has a lot of stress- from IRS audit, from divorce request, from daughter being gay and abandoned family, from father\u2019s disapproval, etc. Everything is fake and in her head and she\u2019s trying to find resolution.

However I have to say I felt exhausted after watching this confusing, overlong, mess of a movie. The multiverse concept is already a well-worn trope, and ultimately the basic message of the film is quite simplistic. Too many effects, too much cgi and too many comedy kung-fu fights made me feel as though the director was making it up as he went along and throwing everything possible at the screen in case some of it stuck. I hear they originally wrote the main part for Jackie Chan, and it's a shame as he would have been ideal for this - though Michelle Yeoh was a good stand in.
