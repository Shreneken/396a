            "content": "Same old nonsense continues to be done in this industry. Tiger Shroff has been doing one thing from the start of his career and is not capable of giving any other expressions. With him it's always like 'action at the cost of expression'. He's been in this industry for almost a decade now but has not improved even one percent at the things that he's bad at, which is obviously acting, emoting and dialogue delivery. How long are we gonna see the same old jumping and dancing with the same bland face? Is he ever gonna change?There's no story in this film. This film relies solely on its action which is still way over the top and completely nonsensical. Tara Sutaria is overrated. Haven't liked her acting since her debut film SOTY 2 but I don't know how people still have faith in her.The songs in this film are terrible. 1st rate torture if I may. They only make the film more unbearable. Can't believe AR Rahman worked on the music of this film. Even the original whistle baja is so good compared to this. This one is so bad I can't even describe it in words. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is doing his same acting from Kick. So in short this film offers nothing new. Pathetic acting, dialogues and their delivery, worst songs, action that you've already seen a million times and no good story at all (horrible in fact), I wouldn't recommend this film even to my debtors. Don't pay me back but also don't waste my money on such horrible films.",

            "content": "Heropanti 2 (2022) :\nMovie ReviewOne of the main reasons behind massy South films' huge success in the Hindi market is Bollywood's masala films being too bad. It's been 5 years now since we haven't had a huge hit in the action-masala genre - the last being \"Tiger Zinda Hai\". The reason is quite clear and simple: we aren't making good films. Rajamouli's larger-than-life vision has left such a big impact on the audience that they are not ready to watch any mediocre masala film with cheap materialism. Tiger Shroff debuted in heroic style with Heropanti (2014), which was a remake, but anyway, the film established him as a young action star in Bollywood. With Baaghi (2016), Baaghi 2 (2018), and War (2019), he cemented the position, but then came Baaghi 3 to spoil the party. And now comes Heropanti 2 to add more fuel to those burning expectations. A late sequel is always in doubt, especially when it has nothing to do with the storyline of the predecessor, unless you are making a \"Golmaal\" franchise like Rohit Shetty. Heropanti 2 was too late, but more than that, it was unwanted. Instead of doubling the fun in the second part, it halves everything.Heropanti 2 has a complex storyline, so there's nothing simple about it like its first part. The film introduces you to Babloo (Tiger Shroff), a smart hacker and a fighter (that's obvious with Tiger), who is living a remote life somewhere away from enemies. As expected, the villains unite to beat him and find his location, and from the rest, you can predict how he smashes everyone. Babloo's love interest, Inaaya (Tara Sutaria), is the sister of his biggest enemy, a magician-cum-gangster, Laila (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). Laila wants to do mass hacking to earn money, and Babloo tries to stop him in his style. The writing has nothing new to offer, but that's still okay with a mass film. We don't expect a strong script from a typical action entertainer, but what's not okay is the cheapest form of screenwriting. Heropanti 2 is full of cringe moments, and believe me, they are unbearable.This is not a film for acting; most of the mass films aren't, including Hollywood. Tiger Shroff is on a heroic high, the same way he was in Baaghi 3. Yes, he can beat a bunch of villains, but this time he's a hacker too. That adds some tech stuff to his filmography. Tara Sutaria looks gorgeous in every scene, whether it is a casual, fashionable look or an extremely glamourous one with high sex appeal. But let's not talk about acting. Let's skip that part. The bigger shock is that a talented actor like Nawazuddin Siddiqui is playing this bad role. The calibre of Nawaz is so high that it's just unacceptable to see him doing a role like this. It's not that I expected an artistic performance from him, but even in mass films, there's always some kind of scope for the villain. Nawaz just doesn't fit, or shall I say, the character doesn't fit. Amrita Singh goes flat too.Heropanti 2 is a high-action film alright, and some of its effects even work on a few occasions, but the rest of the time, it's unbearable. The dialogues are too cheap sometimes, and are a little funny on a few occasions. What hampers it the most is the screenwriting, which literally tests your patience. Those Facebook and WhatsApp jokes from the 2014-2015 era are not supposed to work in the film made in 2022. Heropanti does not have anything new, but what's more worrying is that it makes the old formulas look worse. There are a few scenes that are entitled to please the single-screen masses, especially those different forms of action sequences. Also, AR Rahman's music has some sort of goodness. Even though not all songs work, some do.Director Ahmed Khan seemed clueless here. There was no chance that Heropanti 2 could have gone anywhere with such weak writing, but Khan's direction does nothing but present it in outdated manners. Many scenes remind you of the 80s masala films that we have left way behind. Heropanti 2 is not even watchable for hard-core Tiger Shroff fans because they have seen him in better films like War, Baaghi 2 and Baaghi. There's a lot missing; it's just a matter of how much you notice. The list can go on and on as the modern cinema and its audience have become more cautious nowadays. Overall, a terrible sequel that people never demanded, and the Heropanti level is definitely down this time.RATING - 3/10*",

            "content": "Tiger shroff has immense potential to be a terrific action hero but his choices to work constantly with Ahmed Khan, who basically is another version of Prabhudeva , is ruining his career. Just because Ahmed Khan gave him one success in the name of Baaghi 2, does not mean he constantly continue giving him chances even after knowing audience don't find Ahmed Khan films as even barely watchable. This is exactly what Salman Khan did working with Prabhudeva constantly for 2 bad films.Heropanti was never good. It was average but was successful cuz of a new hero interest, some really good songs and dance/ action moves. Due to this commercial success , they went on to make Heropanti 2 which imo is even worse.The thing is, they had an interesting story in hand. A hacker named Laila planning to get hold of the money of every Indian and Tiger trying to get him by entering into his personal space and then getting caught eventually leading him to staying undercover and try catch him formed the base of an intriguing plot. It is the terrible execution of this story that leads to thr downfall. Never does it feel thrilling or something. Even the climax doesn't feel thrilling.Adding cherry to this cake is the terribly written characters especially of Nawaz and Tara. Nawaz tries to be a \"Kick\" kind of villian and fails miserably. It is Tara however who is an absolute pain to watch. Her constant squealing in high pitch voice feels so irritating at one point that i felt skipping those parts .Double meaning jokes, weird sequences further malign this project.Action is definitely a little over the top but after watching the action and logic in south films like KGF, I decided well, i won't complain here too as it belongs to the same masala genre.Songs? Well it's very hard to digest that AR rahman first chose to give his music for a film like this and then proceeds to give not a single good song. Whoever was the music composer for Heropanti 1 did a way better job than AR rahman.Overall, I think others have elaborated well about whether to watch it or not . Seeing the poor collection at the BO, it should be a lesson for Tiger to stop working with Ahmed khan.",

Heropanti 2, the unrelated sequel to his 2014 debut film, packs in all the standard Bollywood elements of over the top action, forced emotions (maa factor), unnecessary songs and oodles of swag while missing most important aspect of filmmaking - SCRIPT!!!Frankly, there is absolutely no semblance of a story or script here and all we see is either Tiger in action mode or gyrating to strictly okey dokey music score by A. R. Rahman. Admittedly, one of the songs called 'Da Faa Kar' is catchy and zingily choreographed but hey, why is it pronounced to appear like an English swear word??!!!On the positive, the action sequences in the second half are well executed and the production values are expectedly first rate. Editing could've been much better specially that non-linear timeline gets tad confusing after a point. The humour element is generously sprinkled across the narrative but falls flat on most occasions. Like Tiger being asked to strip in public to show a coveted 'teel' on his bum. Yucks!!!Of the cast, Tiger Shroff is outstanding in the action scenes but falls short in the emotional ones. There is no doubt that he is no 1. Action star today but urgently needs to choose a good story to showcase his overall talent. Tara Sutaria, looking a million bucks, has precious nothing to do except appear in various state of undress!! Amrita Singh is earnest as the maa...I actually recollected her young avatar in Mard (1985) which I loved as a kiddo. How time flies!!As for Nawazuddin Siddiqui's Laila, the same queer character was played more effectively by apna Shakti Kapoor in Dharmendra's 1990 hit Veeru Dada. \"Mere kanne chakku hai\" was Shakti's still popular catchphrase from that movie. Sadly, Nawaaz hasn't been able to match up to that level..Heropanti 2 is intermittently entertaining but most of it appears irrelevant and dated for 2022. An average fare, at best!! Sorry Tiger, I love you loads but kya kare. Heropanti se jyaada you need to do Acting-panti now. Please!!Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

Excessively objectified women, campy sleek action scenes drag the already horrible screenplay to an even poorer level.Bollywood just manages to stay afloat with cinematic masterpieces such as Tumbbad, Sardar Udham, The Kashmir Files preventing it from sinking.

            "content": "If Tiger Shroff had become a Gymnast, he might have won some medals for India at International events, but instead he decided to become an actor, so now he plays a gymnast in all his films, because that's all what he's good at. Ahmed Khan was doing a splendid job as a choreographer, but for some mysterious reason he decided to become a director despite having no understanding of the art, and delivered gems like 'Lakeer', 'Fool N Final', 'Baaghi 2' and 'Baaghi 3'. Tara Sutaria was quite likeable in the Disney shows she did at the beginning of her career, but now she has not only forgotten how to act but also lost her sense of judgement that would have helped her stay away from bad movies. Perhaps she was never meant to be an actress. If only, all three of them had met a career counsellor before deciding upon a career in movies, we might just have been saved from the atrocity that is 'Heropanti 2'.Nawazuddin Siddiqui is just enjoying himself throughout the film, while playing a character that is clearly inspired from 'Joker' and the character he played in 'Kick'. These roles pay him well and allow him the freedom to do movies like 'Manto', so people should not question his decision of accepting such roles. Asad Khan portrayed by Zakhir Hussain is easily the most grounded character of the film. Every time Tiger Shroff and Tara Sutaria say something in the film, as a viewer you wish they had been given silent roles. It would be quite an understatement to call the dialogues of this film bad, but what makes them worse is the way Tiger and Tara deliver them. Every time Tiger and Tara deliver a dialogue, you wish 'Obliviate' was an actual spell to erase from your memory everything that you just saw and heard. These two just cannot act!The writing of this film is extremely uninspired. It's neither an exciting adventure nor does it qualify to be called an entertainer. In one of the scenes, Bablu gets shot and requires an operation to remove the bullet from his hip. Normally, a bullet wound will ground you for weeks, you won't be able to walk, but our hero just walks out right after the surgery to dance around at a party! Did he undergo a surgery or a haircut? There is absolutely nothing wrong in making movies purely for the purpose of entertainment, but even the creation of an out and out entertainer requires you to have some level of skill and a lot of dedication, which was clearly missing in this project.The music of the film has been composed by A. R. Rahman, but it lacks the quality that one would expect from someone of his stature. 'Rehnuma' definitely stands out, 'Jalwanuma' and 'Miss Hairan' are also worth listening, but it's safe to say that not a lot of effort went into composing the songs of this film. It won't be wrong to say that this movie did not deserve to have a good soundtrack, but that also raises a key question, as to why did Rahman sign this project ?Although it's true that no amount of stunt work, production value and skin show can compensate for the absence of a good script, but what's also true is that a number of films have actually succeeded at the box office despite a poorly written script, and that is what encourages filmmakers to make movies like Heropanti 2. If you want good movies to be made, then you need to set higher standards for yourself, because substandard films only get made because there is a demand for it. The day movies like Swades and Sonchiriya start becoming blockbusters, filmmakers would stop making movies like Heropanti 2.",

Watching his stunts and fights gives you a sense of satisfaction. Though the story is little weak but Tiger Shroff's acting ,looks and stunts compensates everything. Nawazuddin's role is equally important throughout the movie. You can see Tara Sutaria's skin more than her acting. But I must say she is looking damn hot in the movie. This movie also gives you taste of Rohit Shetty's movies.... stunts of expensive cars.

            "content": "I was blown away, everything about it is well staged, and the background colors, lights, costumes were all very detailed, the actors dance with passion, overall it is well directed and choreographed. I'm referring to the music videos of course as for the movie. It is simply one of the most unwatchable, terribly written, poorly edited, awkwardly acted, aimlessly directed movie I've watched this year. This film is more of a music video than it is a movie. It is evident that the large chunk of the budget and energy went to the music as every now and again a random song pops up that has no tie to story at that particular point. The director chose to tell his story in a non-linear fashion and that's fine, with a crisp editing it is always a good concept but the editing here is beyond horrible. Past and present are being put together with no distinction whatsoever. For that, things get confusing really fast and it shouldn't have to be as it is relatively simple-to-follow plot. The other reason where this movie fails other than its poor directing and editing, is the characters. All the characters are simply irritating with Inaaya; the love interest and the villain being the absolute worse. The bad guy's 'grand plan' didn't make sense and so was demeanor. Our hero is not far behind, the film wanted us to believe that he's some kind of slick computer genius with mad hacking skills but he comes off the exact opposite. Tiger Shroff is being typecasted in these roles and although he has the physicality, his acting chops though are below average. He's got like two or three facial expressions. I think he needs to start choosing his projects more carefully or better yet he should star in gritty drama roles where he can improve his acting skills.On the whole, other than the grand scale production design and eye-pleasing visuals, there's nothing redeeming about this tripe of a movie.",

            "content": "Babloo Ranawat (Tiger Shroff), a genius hacker, is tasked with tracking down Laila (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), the mastermind behind the world's largest cybercrime yet to occur.With ripping muscles, crisp six-pack abs, high-octane action, and double dhamaka, Babloo is back with his Heropanti. To be honest, the premise is predictable: Babloo is an unstoppable one-man army on a mission to track down the baddies and kick their a**es off in order to protect the world from cyber-crime. But apart from this basic plotline, Sajid Nadiadwala's franchise Heropanti 2, serves up a lot more for the action-movie buffs.After directing the Baaghi franchise, Ahmed Khan reunites with Tiger Shroff. And, as with his previous films, the story takes a back seat to the prospect of watching a hot hunk engage in a high-octane stunt duel. The first half is a little off-kilter and takes a while to settle in, post-interval one can expect a lot of stunts, thrills, twists and just enough masala and explosions to keep you entertained. The film excels in action set pieces by Ram Chella- Lakshman Chella, Parvez Shaikh & Kecha Khamphakdee, but it also delivers some unbelievable action choreography in which the hero and even his phone survive a major explosion. Eventually, Rajat Arora's writing falls flat and takes the audience's sensibility for granted. The story tries to be overwhelmingly larger than life, but in the process, it loses logic and becomes preposterous.Laila, a hobbyist magician and cybercrime kingpin, is on the verge of robbing the Indian government. CBI has hired Babloo to prevent this calamitous event from happening. Will Babloo be able to catch Laila, who always seems to be ten steps ahead of everyone? Will his love, Inaaya Saran (Tara Sutaria), a self-made billionaire and Laila's sister, get him into more trouble and become a roadblock for him? Or is it simply a honey trap for Babloo or vice versa? Things reveal themselves in layers as the story progresses, keeping the audience engaged.To make it a Hollywood-style movie, Ahmed Khan and his action team have designed the stunts of the film to recreate thrills that you'd usually watch in movies like Mission Impossible and Fast And Furious. And while the action is relentless and the dialoguebaazi is entertaining, the predictable storytelling in this film leaves a lot to be desired.Tiger's smouldering on-screen intensity, as well as the high-flying action, are both fascinating. His seeti-maar dialogue, 'sabko aati nahi, meri jaati nahi,' is a perfect fit for his personality and the stunts. Tara's role is limited to mostly managing to up the glamour quotient of the movie. She is seen running around in high heels with Babloo, which is too tough to pull off in real life. Together, Tiger and Tara look good on-screen, but they don't have that sizzling chemistry to talk about. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is in top form in playing a negative role as Laila. He literally hypnotises the characters in the film and leaves the audience stunned with his superb act. Amrita Singh adds a sense of humour to the narrative.AR Rahman's score heightens the drama's feel, but every song drops randomly. Among the rest of the songs 'Whistle Baja 2.0' is the most upbeat number, but you'll have to wait until the end of the movie to hear it. Tiger makes his singing debut with the song 'Miss Hairan,' which is quite surprising.Like the typical entertainer, Heropanti 2 offers a little bit of everything-action, drama, music, romance and exotic locations. The screenplay makes room for a mix of commercial movie elements, but where the film scores is its action department, which gives Tiger's fans ample to dig into. Looking for anything more than that, like a story, this one is not for you.",

            "content": "Tiger Shroff is a great professional. Acting in this film confirms a certain self-sacrifice. The script is at best confused and mixes a background of espionage based on bank account hacking, stories with his mom (all the scenes with his mom are clumsy and boring), with his new sweetheart (the delicious Tara Sutaria, whose plastic is interesting - she should sculpt her legs a little, which should not be shown, but that the costume designer tries to show all the time with shorts or very short skirts -, and who needs to take acting lessons) and with the villain, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who is the only sympathetic, funny character (mix of gay Joker, flower wizard and psychopath with joy), very bad of course, and brother of Tara Sutaria.In the midst of all this, Tiger Shroff cries, is sad or serious, dances and fights (he likes footwork and splits, as a tribute to Jean-Claude Van Damme we imagine). His tendency to be quickly shirtless is confirmed. Probably to hide his legs (he is short on legs, bordering on dwarfism). But he impresses for all the dedication he puts in. No homoerotic subtext here (although if you consider some of Nawazuddin Siddiqui's remarks...)\nThe film is a stodgy mix of sentimental comedy, espionage and action.The dance numbers are rather vulgar and fortunately amusing (and there must be four of them): Tara Sutaria obviously can't dance and the editing of these sequences does everything it can to avoid showing her footwork, which is clumsy and sorely lacking in tone in her movements. The music is barely passable.Respect to Tiger Shroff for shooting such a crap with so much conviction.",

Somehow I feel that Tiger Shroff was far more impressive in his debut movie probably because he had only one aim, that was to impress and arrive. Here he has to perform one ridiculous scene after another, though he has a large quota of kick boxing scenes and stunts to perform but falls short in the acting department, perhaps not entirely his fault. Director Ahmed Khan has made the movie with the masses in mind and they will not be disappointed. A saving grace is Nawazuddin who plays an effiminate don Laila with a quirky and comic demeanour playing to the gallery all the time. He is the one who makes the movie watchable. The scenes are farcical and ludicrous to say the least. The songs are shot with glitzy special effects which don't make them better anyway. I do miss the conventionally choreographed shot songs of Ahmed Khan a few years earlier which had rythm and style. The cars are classy and they screech at regular intervals till they crash in the underground parking lot. The hoodlums are international types and they come in all shapes. In respect of acting, Tiger drifts along in an easy laid back manner showing off his attitude and nothing else. I was disappointed with the leading lady Tara Sutaria who overacted and hammed throughout. It is not the first time the heroine is shown as a haughty and arrogant girl but somehow her interpretation fell short.",

It's like some B grade writer wrote and directed the movie with a huge budget. Tara Sutaria is only an eye candy, but the moment she opens her mouth, we're done. I can't believe somebody actually thought her role would be funny. Dear Tara, please stick to modelling. Tiger's punch lines are cringe at its peak.The biggest shock is AR Rahman's downfall.

The man after his life is none other than Laila; a world renowned cyber-criminal (has zero knowledge about computers), who moonlights as a magician (a bad one).The most unbearable thing about Zero-panti is @arrahman 's involvement. A month ago, I thought Aaraattu was the worst thing Rahman did. But I stand corrected. The songs are disastrous; even the rehash of the original Whistle Song is reduced to some techno-crap. Rahman even managed to sneak in a Sufi number (for a pseudo mourning Babloo).Tiger Shroff as a world renowned hacker and Nawazuddin Siddiqui as a cyber-criminal aka fake joker are the worst casting choices ever made. At least make it believable if not anything else. Just because it is the 21st century, we don't need all crimes to be cyber related. Tara Sutaria and Amrita Singh's characters are irritating to the core.Horrific-panti is Tiger Shroff's other action franchise (Bhaagi being the other) that has countless spiritual sequels for no reason. And if you haven't had enough of Tiger's stunts, then he has a new film coming out this Christmas, titled Ganapath. Signing off until another atrocity releases.",

I really like Nawazuddin Siddiqui but his role here didn't impress me. Tara Sutaria wasn't good at all.The first half is just crap. It shows Babloo on the run with Tara Sutaria while everyone wants to kill him. It doesn't show us why it's happening but it shows us fragments of what happened. Every actor gives us a headache here. Also showing Tiger Shroffs' but isn't funny. It's also bizarre how he survives an explosion literally right next to him.The second half you could say improves as the flashback portion stands out.

I was surprised by how much I liked Tiger Shroff in this film. He reminds me of an early action-comedy Salman Khan. He is certainly no great actor but is pleasing to watch on screen. The film is lot of fun if you want to watch something mindless and entertaining. I personally don't like much of the 'great' or 'superhit' films that come out these days but liked Heropanti 2 enough to watch it twice.People have become too demanding and critical these days. They will watch and praise anything that comes on Netflix or OTT just because others say it is great and must be watched. This film is not smarter or dumber than other films or content that we see in south or north. But for some reason everyone decided to spread vitriol over this particular film.

An amazing villain who stole the show with their level of insanity that could only exist in such a movie. Dance moves that are basically emotes from any battle royal .
