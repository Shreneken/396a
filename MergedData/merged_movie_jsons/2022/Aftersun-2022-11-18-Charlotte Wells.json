            "content": "Oof, this movie hurt.\"Aftersun\" is a slow build to a climax that left me openly weeping, to the point that I had to sit in the theater for a bit after the end credits were over just to compose myself.It doesn't even seem to be about very much for a while, just a melancholy story about a dad and his pre-teen daughter trying to enjoy a vacation at a run-down resort. But man, that ending comes along and wallops you, and you realize all at once that the movie is about so much, and that's it's been gradually revealing its layers to you all along.I seriously can't even think about this movie without tearing up. I think about that ending, about how the dad just wants to give his daughter a fun vacation while sinking into a black hole of depression, and the daughter, too young to fully understand the depths of her dad's despair wanting as an adult to go back in time and help him, and I want to bawl.Easily one of the best movies I saw this year. If movie awards were to be taken at all seriously, this film would be nominated all over the place.Grade: A+",

            "review_title": "Woman struggle to clarify memories of troubled father",
            "content": "Like the very best art, writer/director Charlotte Wells's film MUST be seen more than once to be appreciated, fully felt and understood. Like the fragmented family it depicts, the film requires of its viewer connection, engagement, commitment.For example, on first viewing one wouldn't know the dark-haired woman dancing is the the adult Sophie, whose memories of a holiday with her father 22 years earlier make up the narrative. That dance montage recurs several times and at the end. On the last night of the Turkish holiday young Sophie declines her dad Colum's invitation to dance, but we see her adult version dancing and then the girl herself. Charactreristically, even when he's dancing with them he is dancing alone.The ending winds back to the beginning too. The film opens with Sophie filming a playful interview with her father two days after his birthday. That scene repeats later. At their airport parting Colum films young Sophie's playful ducking, posing and wide-grinned wave. A still of that grin freezes as a wall blow-up, from which Wells pans through the adult Sophie's flat, showing the pensive woman on her own birthday. That pan continues back to our (and Sophie's) last view of Colum, pausing his camera, walking back, down a hall and disappearing behind distant doors. The last-shot doors define hie absence.Like that last long pan through three sets, the film constantly plays with time. Instead of a throughway narrative we get the discontinuity of experiences remembered, shuffled, re-examined. The memory muddle explains the frequent asynchronicity, where the sound and image are at odds. We hear Colum on the phone in one position while we see him in quite another, tucking Sophie into bed. Sometimes he wears his cast, sometimes he doesn't.The key ambiguity is the shot of Colum walking fully-dressed into the night sea. It's an explicit suicide out of A Star is Born. In the next scene he's back in the hotel room. In a linear ploy he would have returned from the shore. But in a narrative that makes jumble and uncertainty its key principle that scene suggests his suicide. Not within that narrative period, but at some point, leaving adult Sophie searching her memories to deal with it.The film's central irony is that in this rare extended visit the young girl proves to have the poise, character and maturity of an adult, while her father reveals the weak, troubled helplessness of a child. Frankie Corio's performance of Sophie is miraculous. Her every look suggests a profound complexity of feeling. Freeze a frame and read. When she's locked out of their hotel room Sophie coolly sleeps in the lobby, then tries to assuage Colum's guilt. When she covers her father's naked body on her bed she's the adult tucking in the kid.Sophie is unruffled by overhearing two young girls discussing their sexual activity, the sexual play of the teens she meets over a pool game, the teens' later heavy drinking, even her spotting two gay men kissing in a doorway. The latter may shade Colum's \"new thing going with Keith.\" Matter-of-factly, she tells Colum of her having kissed young Michael.When Colum tells her that as she grows up she should feel free to tell him anything, the shot has them on a small float in the distance, against a wide expanse of water, hills in the background. The scale conveys the futility of Colum's promise, his helplessness to support her.In an early shot we hear Sophie's steady breathing, asleep in the foreground, while on the balcony behind Colum labours through tai chi exercises - while smoking! The deeply troubled Colum is reading about meditation and tai chi. He's at loose ends, between girlfriends and jobs. Through Sophie's description of her fatigue the camera shifts to show his face registering a far more profound exhaustion.He is also in money trouble. Just before we see Sophie gifted an All-Inclusive resort bracelet, Colum picks up a cigarette butt to smoke. He overreacts to Sophie's loss of a swimming mask. He complains that the hotel room provides less than he paid for. He and Sophie skip out on a restaurant bill. In a rare impatience she asks him why he keeps promising things (i.e., singing lessons) that he knows he can't afford. His purchase of an expensive carpet seems to deny that - but he buys it in a spirit of gloom, not joy. We're glad to see it in the adult Sophie's flat.Over Colum's unseen heavy breathing we see the adult Sophie rise from bed, then assure her woman partner that she'll tend to their crying baby son. A blurry montage of Colum leads to his wakeup call for the day trip that celebrates his birthday. Young Sophie enlists the tourist strangers to serenade him. Cut from that \"jolly good fellow\" to Colum sobbing helplessly, naked, alone in a dark room.At their last supper Colum pays for a polaroid snap of them together. While Sophie wistfully wishes they could stay at the resort forever we watch the photo slowly developing, firming up to clarity, a miniature of the slowly revealing montages we have been absorbing.And so to the title. My (wise) wife Anne suggests Aftersun sounds like a catchy name for a sunguard lotion, something to treat burns. We see Colum applying protective balm to Sophie a few times. Her cascade of memories are an attempt to salve that emotional sear. Aftersun also seems an inflection of Afternoon, the halfway division of the day so by extension a pivotal point in Sophie's complicated memories of her dad.",

            "content": "You have a video of a holiday in the past, when you were young, before life's burdens had amassed, with a father you adore, likes to take to the dancefloor, though he's generally withdrawn and quite downcast. A reflection of a time when eyes were new, interpretation was a seed, as yet to grow, but when you look back now, it's a different world somehow, revealing spaces not yet entered, or sought to go.It's a slow meander, beautifully filmed, with two incredible performances, although those two highlights alone don't create a piece that takes your breath away as much as you might like, until you sit down to reflect, and absorb what you've seen through your own eyes.",

            "content": "Aftersun is a film that I wasn't sure I understood when the credits started rolling. Then, as I sat and thought about everything I had seen, I came to believe more and more that it's kind of genius.What the movie lacks in overt substantive plot it more than makes up for in authenticity and subtle placement of character-building images and dialogue. In the moment, these often feel like tangents and the overall picture isn't clear.While it can make for a frustrating first viewing, the clarity that comes with the film's final shot suddenly puts everything into perspective and I felt an overwhelming flood of emotion for the two central characters.Suffering happen more often than not in silence, and it's the cumulative of this film's many quiet moments that drive home one of the most effective, nuanced messages of compassion that I've seen all year.This is a masterpiece of subtlety, arguably slightly to a fault, but it's refreshing to see it in the age of \"hammer over the head\" messaging in movies that we're currently living in.",

            "review_title": "A significant message in a film that's like navigating fog with landmines",
            "content": "It's been years since posting here and never before for a reason that entails major spoilers, so this is a serious alert: If you haven't seen the film and don't want major spoilers, wait til you've seen the film to read this. I myself went into this film, as i typically do, knowing nothing of what to expect (reading no reviews) and that surely accounts for much of the unprecedented degree of \"fog\" throughout my viewing (although the terrible audio we had, missing lots of dialogue, was also part of the fog), such that as we left the theater, baffled, i couldn't have imagined giving it an \"8\" or even writing here, but that's where the \"landmines\" come in ... After getting home, reading many critics' reviews, I began to see the film through such new eyes that i suddenly made sense of its plotline and meaning that went way beyond what any critic was saying. I just finished every 'user review' here too and it has persuaded me to write this because i don't see anyone interpreting it in the way I'm here to propose:I now believe that adult Sophie is (re)watching the camcorder that she has kept for 20 years with this one life-puzzle tape in it and now watches it (yet again?) with added poignancy and purpose for her now being the age her father was then. I believe she has probably rewatched this film many times searching for clues in her father that she didn't fully comprehend at the time. \"Aftersun\" may allude to a metaphorical \"sunburn\" she was left with from that trip and is forever dogged by.While for Sophie that trip meant reconnecting with a dad she loves and misses (wishing at the end that they could stay on together in hotels forever) and, despite all her hesitant inquisitiveness seeking to know dad better and how he sees the world, she had not at all perceived the ultimate purpose of the trip for her dad. In retrospect, he telegraphed the purpose of the trip for him in ways we viewers in the moment also didn't fully \"get\" as to their \"landmine\" potential: Especially when he teaches Sophie how to defend herself physically, to hold up her arms just right, etc., he becomes agitated that she isn't taking it as seriously as he wishes and urges upon her just how important this learning is. (Only he knows that he won't have future opportunities to teach her these things.) In other scenes, he's relaying life lessons about being true to herself, etc. For me the landmine only 'exploded' an hour after the film - to realize that Dad knew this was how he'd chosen to spend his last days, doing all he could think of to leave life lessons and self-protections for his beloved daughter's future life.We don't know what oppresses and depresses her father - and I believe two key scenes are in reverse-chronology (plausibly as adult Sophie's memory evokes them in that order): we see him enter the ocean and never return before we see him sobbing naked on the edge of the bed. (Of course, neither of those scenes can be from her watching the camcorder tape, i.e., they couldn't have been taped, but instead are either from adult Sophie's imagined scenes as to how some of her father's actions played out after she boarded the plane or from just the third-person narration stance that the film did often incorporate.) I believe a reason we'd seen dad fall asleep naked on the bed previously was background to give context when he sits naked and sobbing - and he's alone in the room. This is the truth of what happened after he left the airport through the double doors. He had planned this exodus but it filled him with grief nonetheless - a grief he'd been carrying since childhood when parents didn't remember his birthday(s) and he felt unimportant, untreasured, unloved - which would have given every reason for lifelong depression but we also could have been seeing a dad who was confronted, say, with a terminal illness or other reason besides \"simply\" depression. For whatever reason, I believe he bought the rug knowing it would be a tactile connection to him that he would be leaving for her (in his personal effects that would be sent to her). I believe he drank more at the end because as her departure grew close so did his intended plan to let the ocean take him away and he was drowning his sadness at leaving his daughter's world as he'd already decided to do. I think doing karaoke with her again was perhaps just too wrenching now that it was the eve of their final time together.I also believe that his saying \"I love you\" to Sophie's mom, that made her confused and curious could well have happened if, say, their marriage had ended because of his depression but there was still caring and love.I believe all this 'emotional history' of her two parents that she gets random clues about during that trip have become core pieces of a puzzle of who Sophie is to herself and yet adult Sophie still looks at the camcorder for more clues about what she might have missed in her father's words and actions during that trip.I think the 'disco shards' of memory that intervene in the film at times are adult Sophie's ongoing bombardments of puzzle pieces about her heritage - her parents' relationship that brought her into existence and what they were like ... given that at least one parent was capable of sheltering her from the full truth of his (suicidal) intentions.I myself find all these thoughts to be in the realm of over-interpretation, and I lay them out here partly as my own reality-check whether anyone else did see or could see the plotline and message in this way? Since none of the dozens of reviews I read tonight broached any of these readings of the film except for one commenter here who, almost as an aside, thought Sophie's dad at the end either a) went for cigarettes and disappeared or b) committed suicide, which the commenter sort of dismissed with an \"eek.\"My own view entails no \"eek.\" And if anything, especially reading all kinds of reviews that used the word 'vulnerability' to describe what her father seemed uncomfortable with. That made me think of Bren\u00e9 Brown's work (on the power of vulnerability - if you're not familiar google that on TED talks and join the 60+ million people who've watched her talk; many a suicide results from the shame of vulnerability) and how one possible message in this film could be a kind of outcry from an abandoned daughter, 20 years later, wishing her father - as she keeps rewatching him on the 'eve' of his suicide - might have not despaired to the point of ending his life because of shame or a sense of failure that may have undergirded his depression. And indeed some of young Sophie's questions of her dad on that trip can be seen as her probing to understand her dad's inner radar and (painful) life experience and learning.Please forgive my excesses of verbiage here or of what may seem off-the-wall over-interpretations. I write them largely to elicit whatever connection any reader might make and share to any of these notions of the film's message. Thanks.",

            "content": "I almost never watch films twice but 'Aftersun' was a rare case where I absolutely had to. I don't think this film can be fully appreciated on first watch. I saw someone suggest that after you watch it your mind will go back to little moments and re-evaluate their significance, and it will. But watching it again with the full picture gives the entire movie a different perspective. The second watch is almost like watching a different film.Kids in films, particularly in lead roles, can often be very annoying. That isn't an issue here. Frankie Corio gives one of the most likeable child performances I can ever remember seeing. Her chemistry with Paul Mescal was amazing. I read that she wasn't privy to Mescal's solo scene rehearsals, so that she wasn't fully aware of what his character was going through, much the same as her character Sophie wasn't. That's brilliant.Something that was very apparent on second viewing was the significance of the music in the movie. The first time through I remember thinking, \"there are a lot of good songs in this movie\". On second viewing you realise that every song used is telling a story. It's telling you what is going on, but like most people in the real world, we just hear a banging song and nod our head to it. Then later on we reconsider its true meaning.Finally, this film has one of the beast movie endings I can remember seeing. It's classy, heavy and thoughtful all at once. It's done in a beautiful and somewhat haunting way that will stick with me for a long time. 9.5/10.",

I understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter. I noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout. I just did not connect with the film at all. I imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me I was quite bored with it by the end. I have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me, it is simply ok.

Hasret.I just couldn't resist my tears. As a Turkish person, its just both amazing and heartbreaking from the point of view of the director that this word resonates with her feelings from a place she had this holiday with her late father. That it stuck with her...Even though it is not the same case at all, I remember the times as a kid I closed the door on my dad because he would come home late from work. That because he would promise me to come home early.Now, today I can't even imagine how saddening it was for him at those times and it wasn't even at his hands.Hopefully I will be able to share my love and gratitude my parents as Charlotte did here with such elegance through some way.

            "content": "A moving film about a girl reminiscing on a holiday to Turkey taken with her estranged father 20 years prior. The use of music is terrific, the two central performances are very touchingly delivered (Paul Mescal and the young Frankie Corio). It is one of the films of 2022. The fact this is Charlotte Wells' debut feature is nothing more than astonishing. She delivers massive assurance and confidence in direction, which pushes the narrative forward very tenderly as the girl (Sophie) tries to reconcile her relationship with her father Callum in two separate timelines.Along the way we are given snippets of her father's troubles. Wells' very cleverly weaves in a subtext that works to a crescendo in the last 10 minutes which includes one of the most brilliant transition shots in recent cinema (not hyperbole, it really is brilliant). The viewer is invited to join the dots on what has happened between the two timelines and there are several clues that help.Wells' debut has a familiarity with the work of fellow Scottish director Lynne Ramsay, and in particular her film 'Morvern Callar'. This feels lie the birth of another great director.",

This is a very impressive directorial debut. As children, we don't know much of anything. It isn't until later in life when it hits us. That realization of finally understanding what you never understood for so long. Aftersun depicts this idea so perfectly. It is told through a woman remembering a vacation with her father, and how she realizes that she never really knew him. Depression is not always obvious.

            "content": "I'm always happy when I see debut feature's from new filmmakers, Charlotte Wells is the newest addition to that list. After Lynne Ramsay and Ruth Paxton, here we have another brilliant Scottish Filmmaker with her feature debut \"Aftersun\" produced by Barry Jenkins and Adele Romanski. The story revolves around Sophie and her father Calum, a divorcee who must care for his minor daughter while coping with loneliness and mental health.The film opens with a handy cam footage of Calum where at first glance seems almost happy, until he is posed to answer a question by Sophie. The frame is paused, followed by glitches from the footage as we follow in flashback. Eleven-year-old Sophie vacationing with her dad. It is full of light, happy moments they shared between each other but it always fades into bitterness till the last goodbye.Don't think this is is yet another traumatic arthouse film with ambiguous narrative that drags out and goes nowhere. I promise you that this plot is smart, will immerse you avidly, sometimes choking on what is happening on the screen. Because it is very difficult to resist drawing parallels with real life. Some might feel this is a personal story or the life story of your friends is woven into the film.Firstly, the issues raised in the film like the coming-of-age, loneliness are not blown out of proportion or doesn't scream too loud. Even with the chic and sophisticated staging, filters the father-daughter relationship doesn't fall into the stereotypes. The bond between both is shot so beautifully unlike Hollywood directors who strongly exaggerate. On the one hand, i love how the director uses the location to reveal the characters, exposing the emptiness and with famous musical accompanies as background score.Secondly, kudos for Charlotte Wells as she cleverly registers emotions though it is never explained in dialogues. In fact, very little is explained in this atmospheric film. I loved the staging of a particular scene, Sophie takes a small glance through the keyhole as she watches girl \"hand job\" gesture while she brags about it with her friends. So many things would have gone wrong here but i appreciate Wells for drawing a line and keeping things delicate throughout the runtime.Coming to the performances, Paul Mescal is capable of transmitting tenacity and great fragility in the same shot as he stares into the abyss and the internal conflicts that lie dormant deep within him (the dance scene). He gives his best to hold the viewer in an atmosphere of melancholy and empathy. There are times when he does his best as a Father and especially the bare back shot of him sobbing is brilliant without excessive melodrama as the scene cuts to a letter he had written to Sophie.Frankie Corio is magnificent in her first acting debut as a 11-year-old, it seems like this was the role she was destined to play, a tailored made character. She is not too matured, whimsical or cute with dramatic intensity but does strike a balance with emotions and inhabits the typical 11- year-old mentality with lot of curiosity (liked how director used the Hookah pot instead of dumb question to register innocence). She hangs out with Michael, they don't introduce in the first meeting, it happens the second time. For me this ranks in the list of my favourite Child performances along with Stanislaw R\u00f3zewicz's Birth Certificate (1961), Shinji S\u00f4mai's Moving (1993), Dorota Kedzierzawska's Crows (1994), Patricio Kaulen's A Long Journey (1967), Kjell Grede's Hugo and Josephine (1967), Amir Naderi's The Runner (1984), Mariana Rond\u00f3n's Bad Hair (2013), Yared Zeleke's Lamb (2015), Achero Ma\u00f1as's El Bola\n(2000), Tony Gatlif's Mondo (1995), Nabil Ayouch's Ali Zaoua: Prince of the Streets (2000), H\u00e9ctor Babenco's Pixote (1980), Viktoras Starosas I Love the Headmistress (1978), Xhanfise Keko's Tomka and His Friends (1977), Maciej Dejczer's 300 Miles to Heaven (1989), Lynne Ramsay's Ratcatcher (1999), Byambasuren Davaa's The Cave of the Yellow Dog (2005), David Zellner's Kid-Thing (2012), Terence Davies's The Long Day Closes (1992), Samira Makhmalbaf's The Apple (1998), So Yong Kim's Treeless Mountain (2008), C\u00e9line Sciamma's Tomboy (2011), Andr\u00e9s Wood's Machuca (2004), Catherine Breillat's Fat Girl (2001), Jacques Doillon's Ponette (1996), Akihiko Shiota Canary (2004), Manoel de Oliveira's Aniki-B\u00f3b\u00f3 (1942), Andrey Zvyagintsev's The Return (2003), Ken Loach's Kes (1969), Shane Meadows's This Is England (2006), Karel Kachyna's The High Wall (1964), Vittorio De Sica's The Children Are Watching Us (1944), Wojciech Marczewski's Weiser (2001), Jan Sver\u00e1k's Kolya (1996), Petar Lalovic's Some Birds Can't Fly (1997), Pavel Chukhray The Thief (1997), Soo-il Jeon's With a Girl of Black Soil (2007), Louis Malle's Zazie dans le Metro (1960), Claude Jutra's Mon oncle Antoine (1971), Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's 400 Blows (1959), Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m's My Life as a Dog (1985), Cary Joji Fukunaga's Beasts of No Nation (2015), ), Yoon Ga-eun's The World Of Us (2016), Ingmar Bergman's Fanny and Alexander (1982), Lev Golub's Devochka ishchet otsa/Girl Seeks Father (1959), Yuan Zhang's Little Red Flowers (2006) Sean Baker's The Florida Project (2017), Edward Yang's Yi Yi (2000) and Carlos Saura's Cria Cuervos (1976).Closing, i will not recommend this to everyone as some will find it boring. To those who love slow burn drama, be prepared to sail along to the Sunny side of Turkey as Wells paints a portrait of life, Mental illness and Fatherhood, to say the least, centered on a arthouse narrative. I guarantee that this film's sensitivity and making will strike you at heart with the symmetry of its two protagonists alone .",

            "content": "While Aftersun doesn't necessarily dive deep into the main subject matter, I think this works in its favour.Delicately unravelling the story of the two characters as they spend a holiday together in the 1990. Scene by scene, we are given clues into Calum's mental health, and how he's subsequently battling with depression.What really makes this special is that it primarily plays out from the perspective of Sophie, his daughter. With a child's mind, it's harder to notice the emotional triggers and mood changes, which would be a red flag to any adult.While this film is definitely a slow burner, it works perfectly in this case. We are simply watching a father and daughter enjoy a seemingly normal holiday. Over time we see sneak peeks into Calum's mind, and how much he's struggling. But he's still trying to give Sophie the best holiday possible. You start to feel a slow tension building throughout the film, which hits (in my opinion) a really heavy ending.For me, in the final scene and following credits, I was left confused initially. But within a few seconds it all started to fall into place. With the final realisation that this was Sophie's last time she spent with her father before he (most likely) commit suicide. She watches back from a (now) adult perspective, and realises what her father was coping with - but was still trying his absolute best to make it special for her.This film wouldn't work if it was filmed in any other way. The slow pace really gives the viewer time to take in everything, as it's the small details that count here. An excellent film with excellent acting and a great soundtrack. Highly recommend.",

            "content": "A teenage girl (Sophie) and her father (Calum) journey to a seaside resort in Turkey for a brief but momentous vacation. Since her parents are separated and she lives with her mother, Sophie rarely gets such an opportunity to spend time with her dad. As they swim and snorkel together, share meals and a room, and talk about important things in life, the two begin to truly bond. Happy and cherished memories are formed, yet problems such as depression, alcoholism, and doubt surface as well. Sophie and Calum attempt to ride the waves that lift them up but just as easily take them under.Aftersun is an intimate and moving portrait of a father and daughter relationship that, according to the director who was at this Toronto International Film Festival screening, is loosely based on real people and her own life. The camera work is intentionally unsteady and from the point of view of Sophie. The filming technique is meant to evoke the sensation of Sophie looking back on treasured memories as if they were in a picture show. There are occasional jumps forward in time of adult Sophie reflecting on what these memories mean to her. The personalities of the characters are gradually revealed so the audience has a chance to meditate on who they are.Aftersun is the feature debut for Charlotte Wells. It is deeply personal for her. It first appeared in Cannes. There is a tremendously moving dance sequence that alone is worth watching the entire film. While the mechanics of Aftersun (the acting, images, story construction, etc.) are more than sound, it really rises above the ordinary and is so stirring because of its central themes; how we shape the memories that we hold and the important things we wish to say to those we love but often don't get a chance to say. \"Live wherever you want and be whoever you want,\" Calum tells Sophie. \"You can talk to me about anything.\"",

            "review_title": "A study of loss and regret.",
            "content": "This film seems pedestrian at first and for a long while into the story. Rather slow and mundane, it requires patience to allow yourself to settle into what might seem laboured and boring in that it's a rather simplistic story about a father and daughter doing the routine stuff we've all done on a package holiday. I'm not surprised some find it odd that the praise is so high for this film and for the acting because there isn't much overt straining of the acting chops here and nothing is addressed directly. I was sceptical until the last 40 mins or so. However, I realised that it is a film which exploits the art of storytelling from that place of reticence we all feel at times, when it's just too overwhelming to say how we're feeling and as a study in depression and regret it turns out to be very poignant and real in the end. Many have said they need to see it again to fully grasp the nuance here but I find that I will remember it for a good while and that is testament to the story and it's accomplished acting and direction, albeit very slight, almost whispers on a hot breeze. So, I'll set out how I understood it here, don't read on if you haven't seen it.His self loathing is revealed when he--mid normal conversation--spits at his own face in the bathroom mirror while maintaining a pretence at normality - talking to his daughter beyond the bathroom door. It was perhaps the first outright confirmation that he was depressed, full of a lack of self-worth and steeped in self beratment - actions which often accompany depression.Earlier, there were signs as he danced in silence on the balcony while smoking that his mental health wasn't great because it was off-kilter, an inappropriate moment to dance in silence, and to dance oddly as if self-comforting, nearly talking to himself, but not quite.The dim strobing scenes of dancing with Sophie as an adult flash glimpses of what she can now see, as an adult and mother, what she couldn't see then, a very serious and somewhat unhinged man, the reality of his state of mind she failed to see as a child. This is contrasted very well with the fond memories of her last holiday with him and there is one moment she recalls when he failed to wake and let her into their shared room, she was locked out, perhaps metaphorically and emotionally but gained access and found him naked on the bed. Perhaps this particular memory is her only clue as to his odd behavior that she recalls, but she sees him here vulnerable at last, perhaps clearly, and she pulls the sheet over his body as if to comfort and protect him while she keeps watch from the balcony.I found the place of his death unclear although I don't think we're meant to know exactly, some believe he stayed in Turkey, however I thought he handed her over at the airport in London (there was a sign marked London Luton) to a Chaperone. There is a non-contemporaneous shot earlier where he walks into the sea at night in Turkey, a clear signal as to his intentions, or perhaps the past when he committed suicide, just not maybe the exact place. This is confusing but doesn't change the sense of loss in this film.There is a palpable feeling of regret and he exhibits lingering love still for his daughter's mother and there's a sense that this is one-sided as alluded to by the daughter. Why say you love her if you're no longer together? There is also the picture of a man who hasn't been able to cope in the world and to succeed, as happens more than we care to dwell on ... the pressure on men to succeed and provide contributing to high rates of suicide in men. This is confirmed when his daughter berates him for offering to pay for singing lessons when she knows he can't pay for them. His shame is evident here.It's easy to just see this film as a mundane telling of a father & daughter on a typical holiday, however if you grasp his inner turmoil form the outset, that knowledge transforms the experience and culminates in a formidable and profoundly sad story of regret and trauma as a daughter, too young at the time to see the subtleties of depression in the man who was the father she loved so much, looking back and suffering, living with the loss and angst so many feel about not noticing that a loved-one was at that awful stage of being about to take their own life, but they didn't notice. There's huge guilt left behind as a consequence.In the end, this film is real cinema and reminds me very much of French cinema. It is accomplished and it is profoundly sad and moving.",

I was worried, and the reason for my worry was not the sea of scepticism that swept through, but the overbearing expectations that slowly grew deep within my conscience. I was doubtful that the film would live up to it, but now that I've seen it, I can say with certainty that it did, and in ways I never assumed.When the movie ended and the credits began to roll, I sat there in silence, at a loss for words and deprived of any sensibility to express how I genuinely felt. Aside from providing insight into a depressed soul and breaking open a portal to a self-loathing person's innermost despair, the most impressive aspect for me is how it made an instant connection, how seamlessly the film put across its message without ever becoming preachy or condescending in its portrayal.The touching relationship between Paul and Frankie (as Calum & Sophie) adds so much to the story's inherent ambitions. For a long time, I forgot they were actors, coming from different backgrounds; it almost felt like I was watching a real-life father and daughter spending some quality time together, reminding me of those good old days when I used to do the same with my father.Perhaps it's the film's simplified depiction of reality or its overwhelming relatability that made me fall in love, and I can't get enough.",

            "content": "It's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work - aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story - is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The \"looking back in fondness\" factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story. Considering all of the advance glowing reactions I had read about this release, I was really looking forward to it going in. Unfortunately, though, I came away from it almost as sad and disappointed as the protagonist herself.",

            "content": "I will go against the tide with AFTERSUN and say I don't think it's a great movie. Written and directed by Sophie Wells, AFTERSUN tells the story of Sophie (Frankie Corio) reflecting on a summer holiday with her father (Calum, played by Paul Mescal) 20 years before. She reflects on a few key moments from the holiday while trying to reconcile the difference between her father when she was 12 years old and the father she has come to know since.The story is told partially through flashbacks and is primarily set in summertime, which gives the film a dreamy, nostalgic atmosphere. The cinematography captures the beauty of Turkey's landscapes with its sun-drenched beaches and vibrant colours. It's easy to feel immersed in Sophie's world as she reflects on her father, who was suffering from deep depression, which she was unaware of.Unfortunately, AFTERSUN fails to deliver a compelling story. The film's slow pace and lack of character development make it hard to connect with the characters. We don't get much insight into Sophie's life before or after her father, making it difficult to feel emotionally invested in their relationship.The dialogue is often stilted and awkward, which I attribute to Wells's inexperience as a writer-director. She also relies too heavily on flashbacks which become tedious after a while due to the lack of depth in the characters.AFTERSUN also suffers from a lack of narrative drive. There are no real stakes or tension in the story, which is essential for any drama to be successful. The film meanders through Sophie's memories without really going anywhere and eventually ends with an abrupt and unsatisfying resolution.The performances from Corio and Mescal are adequate but don't quite make up for the shortcomings in the script. Corio can capture Sophie's innocence and confusion as she reflects on her father's past. Mescal can also bring a sense of sadness and regret to the role, which helps make the relationship between Sophie and her father more believable.Overall, AFTERSUN falls short of being a compelling drama. It lacks narrative drive and character development and fails to tug at our heartstrings meaningfully. While it may have its moments of beauty, it doesn't quite make up for the lacklustre storytelling or overall experience.",

The performances left me totally speechless. The subtlety and the natural flow of the dialogue and interactions takes a screenwriter with a DEEP understanding of the human condition.It isn't until we get older that we begin to understand the true anxiety and despair of being an adult, being our parents, and that the vision we had of our future selves at 11 years old was totally unrealistic and ridiculous, specifically for those of us whose anxiety and depression reveals itself to us later in life.",

It's the opposite of dramatic yet it keeps you engaged and glued to the screen through out as you care about the characters despite the simplicity of their day to day interactions. Paul Mescal plays Callum, a young father to an 11 year-old somewhat precocious girl named Sophie. The film in my opinion is about a father who tries his best to maintain a rock like mask to convey strength and stability for his daughter while being emotionally vulnerable underneath. Occasionally throughout the film that mask slips a little bit as Callum struggles to bear the responsibility of being a dad at such a young age and while facing his own personal troubles. At the same time his daughter, getting older and wiser, starts to explore the world of adolescence while on holiday where she also begins to notice her father's vulnerabilities. It's a sensitive film and one that leaves you enthralled and attached to the characters on a deeply human level even if that dramatic colonel doesn't pop the way you might except.",

Not that I needed back story, a narrative, or a neatly spelled-out denouement.

First, he deserved it. Secondly, it offers hope that more people will seek out this terrific, albeit heartbreaking, debut feature film from writer-director Charlotte Wells.Calum (Paul Mescal, THE LOST DAUGHTER, 2021) takes his 11-year-old daughter Sophie (Frankie Corio) on a vacation to a resort in Turkey, where they swim and frolic in the sun. Even though she lives with her mother, Sophie and her dad have a close bond. She's a very observant and perceptive girl, which is crucial given that Calum is a loving and caring dad, but he's also displaying some disturbing signs of depression. What's terrific here is that Sophie is smart, but not over-the-top; while Calum is a good dad, but not flawless. In other words, these are two normal people spending time together.There is a sadness to Calum, even though he is patient and charming. He thinks he hides more from Sophie than he actually does. His calm demeanor on the outside is clearly hiding burning emotions that his tai chi can't cover. While Calum is teetering in life, Sophie is teetering between independence and being daddy's girl. She recognizes his anxiety but doesn't yet possess the savvy or experience to know what it means - although she states this gem, \"It's nice that we share the same sky.\" What a lovely sentiment.The vacation is set in the 1990's, however the twist served by filmmaker Wells is that adult Sophie (played in glimpses by Celia Rowlson-Hall) is reminiscing some twenty years in the future by re-watching the camcorder tapes from that vacation. She's looking back with a different filter on what she experienced with her dad ... searching for additional insight to the man she so adored. Sophie has visions of watching her dad on the dance floor as \"Under Pressure\" blasts under the strobe lights. This prevents her (or us) from interpreting these as memories of bliss. Rather it's her search for meaning. Charlotte Wells drew inspiration for this story from her own childhood vacation with her dad. This is the first screen appearance for young Frankie Corio, but she perfectly captures the close relationship with dad. As movie lovers, we can only hope this is the start of a special story-telling career for Charlotte Wells, but even if this is her peak, it's a gem few ever match.",

            "content": "AFTERSUN (A) is a quietly devastating British drama from first-time director Charlotte Wells that demonstrates an understanding of cinema you rarely see even in experienced hands. The film is framed by an older Sophie reminiscing about a vacation she took with her father Calum (it's his 32nd birthday) to Turkey by watching footage of it taken on a small camcorder. The film spends most of the runtime observing the daily activities Sophie and Calum on their vacation at a cheap Turkish resort. While there is largely no driving conflict in these sequences, they certainly aren't boring. The director Wells and cinematographer Gregory Oke have found ways to fill every frame with clues, hints, and heartbreaking details about our two characters and the different struggles going on in their lives that aren't apparent in their daily routines. We learn that Sophie is coming of age and trying to make sense of her relationship to her father and to other boys. Where a film like Spielberg's The Fabelmans gives a very glossy/old school Hollywood vibe to his coming of age moments, Aftersun is willing to let its audience sit back, observe our characters and their interactions, and come to their own conclusions. Both films deal with disenchantment with parents and the mystery of the future, but I think Aftersun's passive vibe is much more effective in creating a reflective melancholy - at least I relate to it more anyways. We also learn that not everything is okay with Calum either. What exactly it is, I will leave to you to discover. By the time the film comes to its closing act, an observant viewer will have pieced many of the film's strands together in a way that the final sequences of the holiday and film not only confirm your sneaking suspicions, but an emotional wallop that few films truly earn. It's not cheap sentimentality nor is it a soaring score that left me teared up long after the credits - it's that the revelation that the film quietly about something else the entire time. Aftersun is a masterpiece in speaking volumes while saying little. It's not a film about answers or solutions, but an observation on memory, time, regrets, and our parents - especially our parents. About how their love can be felt despite their faults and despite the sufferings we never knew about.",

            "content": "SummaryThe director Charlotte Wells offers us a morose autobiographical story where point of view, subtlety and dead times combine against her intention to convey the protagonist's nostalgia for a lost father and paradise and the inevitability of not having understood him on time. A film where the tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss are only latent.ReviewA woman recalls vacationing with her father at a Turkish spa when she was 11 years old.Aftersun is an unfortunate conjunction of four topics widely covered by fiction: the autobiographical, the point of view, the subtlety and dead times.When a creator or creator faces a story with autobiographical elements, there is always the risk of falling into narcissism, when the memories invoked and especially the way of exposing them, are only interesting for the one who writes or films them and the nostalgia they generate is not produce resonance with the reader/spectator. Not everyone is Annie Ernaux, Elena Ferrante or Woody Allen or Steven Spielberg or even Joanna Hogg, to go to a more related style. And Charlotte Wells clearly isn't.With respect to the point of view, the director and screenwriter of this debut film narrates from the perpective of an adult who rescues her memories as a child, but maintaining a nostalgic and cut-out look as a child and perhaps filling in some gaps related to the reality of a loving father, very young but hiding a malaise and whom he had not seen for a long time; a discomfort that does not take long to emerge on the surface of a placid coexistence. These tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss can always be interesting. But this is not the case. Perhaps the strobe lights of the adult Sophie dancing represent that fragmented rescue of the past where tensions do not consolidate. Aftersun. A succession of vignettes about a more or less placid everyday life is not enough (such as applying sunscreen or post-sunscreen, the Aftersun of the title).And it is the point of view and the self-imposed clipping that are also linked to subtlety and idle times. There are innumerable examples of subtle stories with dead times, but at the same time powerful. But this is not the case. The succession of placid vignettes of that stay in the hotel in the 90s, seasoned with the inevitable home videos, try to rescue a lost paradise with weak ominous shadows that immerse the viewer in a slow and at times frankly soporific story.Frankie Corio naturally composes a charming girl Sophie and Paul Mescal (the handsome beach attendant in The Dark Daughter) at 26 perhaps looks too young for the young father who nevertheless composes sensitively.",

            "content": "Critics who have seen this film at festivals, where the director can reveal details in person about the film and answer questions to clear up misconceptions, can then write their reviews based on information the average viewer does not have. These critics then read other critics' reviews and, not wanting to be seen as churlish or unkind, tend to accentuate the same positive elements and downplay the elements that don't work or are under-developed in a film. This is why some films as mediocre as, say, Cameraperson or Moonlight or Petite Maman, end up on so many 10-best lists. I believe this is what has happened with Aftersun. It is gentle, well-imagined, filmed and edited with invention, and performed with naturalistic touches, but it is also underwhelming, content to suggest portentous events but unwilling to create even a hint of drama surrounding them. I had many questions about the characters and their back stories, and I don't believe that providing just a few answers would have hurt the movie's mood. In fact, they would have enhanced it. Aftersun is a lovely debut for the director, but it is also flawed in many ways, the flaws illustrative of many first-time films that in an effort to avoid being too obvious end up being too reticent.",

It's dull, very little happens and you realise after half hour of watching that the movie is going to stay that way. There's no real story o narrative. Just a series of memories / images from a holiday the adult Sophie took with her father years earlier. Paul Mescall is a great actor, I could watch him in anything and he's able to convey the complex emotional trauma he's unable to vocalise. What irks me is other users on here claiming you have to be emotionally intelligent to appreciate this film or have gone through depression. I find that offensive, as if any of us have had the chance to walk in another persons shoes. Ultimately this film lets down the viewer, by telling them very little. It's style over substance, a movie with a heart but not a beating one. Time and time again critics tell us what they deem art and what isn't. With Aftersun they've reached a new low.",

We're introduced to a young father and his daughter, spending time together on holiday in Turkey. Sunshine and sea. It's all very normal feeling. Calum (Paul Mescal) is a good dad. Doting. Sophie (Frankie Corio), growing up, her perspective in flux. Maybe it's the quieter moments, but I've a sense of unease. Maybe it's the lingering shots. Maybe it's the dark strings that creep in. Sophie has a lot of questions and a lot on her mind, perhaps they both do. Something is being left unsaid. Herein is the problem with writing about films like this. It's all about the feeling given off. It's a rare trick to pull off and marks this out as something a bit special. I'm also reluctant to spoil this for anyone who's not yet watched it. Mescal and Corio are both brilliant at portraying this. Dialogue is often sparse and it's the things left unsaid that weigh the heaviest. With a DV camera, Sophie records parts of the holiday. Standard blurred, badly framed memories. Clips of both of them sharing time... until Sophie who's just turned 11, asks her Dad \"When you were 11, what did you think you would be doing now\". Its pivotal question innocently posed. Aftersun is a beautiful piece of filmmaking. Wonderfully shot, perfectly cast, with the sort of narrative that envelopes you. I love that this kind of film kind not only garner critical acclaim but also find an audience. It gives me faith in the future of film... and people. \"Did you have a good holiday?\", \"Yeah, wish we could stay for longer\". That's how I feel about this film.",

The subject caved to the pressure from the majority even though their answer was demonstrably wrong. This must explain how Aftersun is heralded so widely by critics even though it is realistically the most boring and overrated snooze fest I have ever been suckered into watching.The trailer for Aftersun was a premonition of the movie to come. \"Gosh, who would want to watch that tripe\", I thought. Then the glowing reviews followed one after the other and I figured perhaps the trailer was simply unflattering, the opposite of so many others where the good bits are already in the trailer. Charlotte Wells must have been stupefied by the overwhelmingly positive reception to her first feature film. Hopefully Aftersun is a bit like Macarena, a one-hit wonder, with Wells drifting off into obscurity.This is how Aftersun should have been... It is 2018 and Sophie's 32nd birthday. She is now the age her dad was when she last saw him; they were on vacation together in Turkey in 1998. She received the recordings from his camcorder shortly after he took his own life, on her birthday no less. On her birthday every year she watches the footage, wishing that she could go back in time to save him from drowning in a deep depression. But a child of 11 years has no such language. She knows she should not blame herself and part of her is angry that she was not enough for him to stay alive.She now looks at her own life - she has a partner and a young child of her own. Her partner regards her with concern but she brushes it off. She knows that she should be happy but there is a void inside her that neither her partner nor her child can fill. She fantasises about dancing with her father; 32-year-old Sophie consoling 32-year-old Calum. Only by saving Calum will she be able to save herself from an all-encompassing depression.",

Definitely feels like a nice breather from most of the action-packed cinema we are used to today.A24 is definitely doing a ton of good for the film industry and has been putting out some of the best films in the past several years.

The second time I watched it, it wiped me out. Yes, it is a little slow but stick with it because it is incredibly moving. It's melancholic tone is perfect. The two lead performances are tremendously affective. Without some force fed annoying backstory, we learn Calum is a seriously troubled young man: Self loathing and deeply depressed. He communicates this without words. It is a brilliant performance.There have been questions about the ending.Here come the spoilers: I think it's clear, at least to me, that when Calum leaves Sophie at the airport, he will soon commit suicide.When the film opens, the adult Sophie is rewinding the vacation video tape of the last time she saw her father. ( Her father took the tape with him when they parted at the airport.) Later in the film we see her getting out of bed, and she steps onto the rug her father purchased on their vacation together. She has his belongings. But does this mean he committed suicide? I'd say do when you consider other key moments.There is a scene when we watch Calum walk into the sea. Is he committing suicide? It appears so, but he can't go through with it, because in the next scene Sophie finds him passed out, naked, in their room.Later when Calum is sitting on the bed, his back to us, sobbing. The camera pans down to a postcard that reads \"Sophie, Always remember I love you, Dad\" Why write and mail postcard to his daughter. Why not simply tell her or call her? Because he knows what he is about to do.Calum's walking in front of a truck, standing on the railing of his balcony, even his broken wrist and the wound on his shoulder indicate he takes risks that could cause his death. He is a man who wants to die.It's a rich film that needs patience, attention, and as I said, a second viewing. However, it is well worth the time. In the end it's devastating.",

The occasional conversation with their absent mother tells us the parents are no longer together and a series of ongoing vacation activities paired with brief flashbacks from the adult \"Sophie\" help us to follow the young girl's attempts to get to know her father better - and he, her - as they relax in the sunshine. This features a strong and confident performance from the young Corio and there is an engaging familial dynamic here between the two. His character is protective but indulgent, her's independent and curious - and auteur Charlotte Wells allows their characterisations to develop for us in a well paced, considered fashion. Nothing really happens here - and yet so much does with their relationship and their respective maturity. It has a realism to it - there are no \"jump\" moments as such, it's about evolution and both have plenty of scope for that.

Trying to finally resolve empathy and reality as she views the past from an older and perhaps more informed (if not wiser) perch.

He teaches her to play pool and water polo. She's also reading LOLITA. (It doesn't say that the child is a genius, but I just don't think there is any way an 11-year-old could understand LOLITA. There are a lot of literary references in it that an 11-year-old hasn't lived long enough to read.) Nothing much really happens in the movie, other than that the father and daughter get to know each other a little better. The actors (Paul Mescal as the father and Frankie Corio as the daughter) are both wonderful and give very moving performances, but there's no real story. Parts of it are mock cinema verit\u00e9 photographed mostly by a shaky hand-held camera. There are also a lot of rapid cuts that made me slightly nauseous. People prone to seizures should either not see this movie, or close their eyes for extended periods of time. The actors have Scottish accents that at times made me wish there were subtitles.

Paul Mescal and Frankie Corio absolutely stole my heart.If you don't connect with it, that is okay, but people PLEASE do not give this a 1/10 because it wasn't 100% up your alley.

It has been so inspiring to see just how much emotional wreckage a person can create for their child. Bravo, evil filmmaking jerks.

            "review_title": "Nice images and moments here and there, but overall I did not see the quality",
            "content": "\"Aftersun\" is a co-production between the United Kingdom and United States from 2022, so a relatively new and fresh film that is in the English language of course. The story takes place far away from both countries at a holiday resort on the seaside, but overall you can say the film is slightly more British because that is where the characters originate from. Scotland I think. The writer and director is Charlotte Wells, still a pretty young filmmaker in her mid30s now and as a consequence this is also the very first full feature film of her career after some short film works. Three to be precise if the number on imdb is correct. The film runs for 95 minutes without credits, so over 100 minutes if we include all the texts written on the screen at the end. The cast is really not big in quantity. There are two key players and everybody else is really minor supporting. The male lead is Paul Mescal and he has scored so much awards attention for his portrayal here. The female lead is Frankie Corio and for her it was the very first performance overall in a film apparently as she got picked for the part after the filmmaker had really many girls audition. As for Mescal, he is also still quite young (maybe people mistaking his character for his daughter character's brother was not meant to charm him, but they really thought so), but has acted for a few years already. You may have seen him in \"The Lost Daughter\" if you watched the film and did not only pay full attention to Olivia Colman. Anyway, with this one here I am really surprised that Mescal is getting nominated left and right and could even has a decent shot at scoring an Oscar nomination, but we will see about that. I did not see anything particularly special or outstanding about his turn here. If anybody deserves praise, it is Corio, but also definitely not on such a gigantic level.It is a father-daughter story from beginning to end. We do not find out about the girl's mother and there is only some brief talking about her later on and she also makes a phone call to see that everything is alright. Other than that, we see some of the other people who are at the exact same spot the exact same time like our protagonists, the other tourists. This includes a boy who is roughly the girl's age and with whom she shares her first kiss. Then there are a bunch of older kids that still like to hang out with the girl after witnessing her decent snooker skills. To me it felt as if there is a very sexualized atmosphere in the movie. This is obviously not a big surprise because we are at the beach with men being topless and women wearing not much more and teens during puberty, but still. There is a lot of making out from these teens and we also hear them talk about how one provided sexual pleasure with her hand to a boy the other day. So it is not a huge surprise if it leaves an impact on Sophie as she is hanging out with these kids a lot and also not a surprise that it indirectly results then in her first kiss as well. In a way, she wants to be part of the gang. The boy it happens with is the one she plays this motorcycle game there which looked really cool. I would have liked to play it too when I was that age. They even have a bit of a date if you see how he invites her by giving her coins for this machine.Another aspect that stayed in the mind for me here was the music. Not in terms of the score, but in terms of the songs you hear from beginning to end. This also shows you that the action there is set several years or even decades in the past. The songs are still in a way famous today, but maybe not played super often anymore. One example would be the karaoke night session there of course which was one of the weirdest moments because the daughter had to sing on her own there, even if it had been a tradition between her and her father in the past and this way we also find out that they have traveled together in the past on various occasions. So the two are close, but you can also see that when watching them. I liked the chemistry for the most part. Anyway, great songs here include \"Tubthumping\", \"Losing my Religion\", an Elvis number and many others. Check out the soundtrack if you wanna know them all. For me it was a bit of a journey back to my youth. And I still love listening to most of these numbers. R. E. M. Will always have a special place in my heart and I would go immediately to a concert if they ever reunited and came here. But now, let's get back to the movie: Many films have it in a way that there is a key conflict or huge escalation towards the end and this is the case here as well when Sophie does not find her way to the hotel right away and is lost a bit and there is trouble with her dad and her potentially being left alone. Well, she is lost for a moment only and then ends up getting home and it seems from her side at least all is good again, even if her dad is really angry at himself. Or disappointed is maybe the better word. And it may have hurt his belief permanently that he can protect her and take care of her on his own. But the night trip for Sophie also could not have been any better really with the kiss I mentioned and she is never in danger or anything.Speaking of Sophie, there are some segments in this film where the film shows her in the now. Very brief moments only and to me they felt thrown in pretty randomly somehow and added almost nothing. The movie would not have been worse or different without them and they just in a way were supposed to add a new layer to it all I guess, but it left no impact on me and also felt rather pseudo artistic. It also felt a bit desperate to me how they showed us that grown-up Sophie is into girls apparently, at least sleeping in bed with another female and maybe the idea was to get a stamp on this film that it is also a gay-themed movie. I mean I am okay with that if there is a convincing story to that regard, but it really all just felt for the sake of it and there I cannot be supportive. The problem is not that she kissed a boy first, not at all, this made sense and it was probably this way for many lesbian women. But also aside from that I cannot really see why this film has scored so many nominations and so much awards recognition for Wells and Mescal most of all. Like I stated earlier, I felt that the occasional nomination in a young performer category for Corio would have been enough. I wonder how her career will be going in the coming years. I am sure this is not gonna stay her only acting role by any means, but will be interesting to see if she can make it really big one day or just appear in two or three more films that will not be seen (or liked) by too many and that is it and then she disappears from the industry and leads a life away from the limelight. Everything seems possible With Mescal, I don't see a big career happening. Wells is also difficult to predict. But looking at the reception and the aforementioned awards recognition this film has been able to score, it was a big win for everybody involved, especially the three key players I just mentioned.I would say that some of the dialogue writing from the film was okay, especially some moments between father and daughter (also just one example, namely how he tricks her into making the same moves he does after she makes fun of those initially), but the majority of these you already see during the trailer and this is why I would say that here we do not have a film that deserves a positive recommendation. My suggestion is to skip the watch or if you really wanna go for it, then I assume that the small screen is also enough and you can see it at some point when it is on television. I was a surely disappointed by the outcome after before that hearing about all the accolades and also after liking the trailer that I have seen quite a few times before other films. In terms of big players at 2022 awards ceremonies, I would say that this is maybe a contender for the weakest film I have seen. I still wonder if my perception changes when I grow older, but I doubt it. Maybe I will not think it is as weak as I see it right now, but I doubt I will really like it one day. Never say never though and my interest in a rewatch is almost 0% right now anyway. For now, I give \"Aftersun\" a thumbs-down, a thumbs-up though for Barry Jenkins (\"Moonlight\") being a producer here. Nice to see him step into new territory and associated for once with a project that does not primarily focus on Black people or race-related issues. Variety is always a good thing. He should have picked a better-crafted film though.",

            "content": "This much awarded and highly rated feature film is more of a documentary covering the holiday of a 32 year old man ( a divorcee actually) and his 9 year old daughter. It is a collection of scenes of their holiday activities on a day to day basis. Surprisingly nothing of consequence happens throughout the movie. Only some memories are recorded on camera and on her \" mind camera\" as the little girl tells her father. The movie consists of some jerky/ unclear camcorder shots by the girl mainly on the holiday activities featuring her dad. Needless to add these are excessively amateurish and actually become quite irritating after some time. The storyline ( if I can call it that) is flat, uneventful and does not have any surprises or twists which I feel are essential for a commercial feature film. It is a recording of mundane holiday activities which includes dad applying sun tan lotion on his daughter's back, his braiding her hair, both swimming, both eating/ drinking, both watching a singing performance, both lazing around, both having a mud bath, she playing pool/ video game, both playing cards, she packing clothes. Most of the time she blabbers on and on and he responds in mono syllables. You get the drift ?Director Charlotte Wells has attempted to make a different kind of a movie with a highly simplistic plot where emotions are kept subdued. All scenes are recorded and presented in a matter of fact way. The narrative is caught in a limbo and just doesn't move forward. A point of monotony and boredom is soon reached and one wishes for some interesting development to take place but no luck here. The frame composition is mainly on close ups / silhouettes/ jerky frames .The cinematography however is good. Paul Mescal as the father plays the quintessential affectionate daddy making sure his little girl is happy. The director has not given enough focus on his internal turmoil. Good for him if he gets an award. (Surprisingly when his character has to emote, the camera focusses on his bare back as he sits on the bed sobbing and a long shot at night shows him sad and walking on the beach with back to the camera !)",

The film talks about their relationship and how it will evolve throughout the entire narration.But the plot is not the important thing in this film. I think this is one of the most emotional movies i have seen in a while, the important thing about this one to see how a father i ready to sacrifice himself for the happiness of his daughter. We see how Calum really struggles to enjoy his vacation until the final couple of days, he is clearly not okay and he struggles to maintain a sort of physiological and mental stability. On the other hand, Sophie is a 11 year-old girl who tries to enjoy her vacation and tries to put a smile on her father's face.This movie hit very hard, and the final couple of scenes leave us astonished, because we really don't know what's happened between the adult Sophie and his father, we only see a sort of foggy and strange conclusion to their events. But as i already said, this film teaches us of how we should enjoy every moment of our lives, because we will never know if those will be the final moments with some specific persons. At the end of the film, i was literally speechless, i didn't know what to say and i burst out crying, because i didn't even know how to feel about it.

Yes, the film is about memories, holidays and nostalgia... but are these feelings enough to make a great film, or a a great script? Unfortunately, the script is empty. The first reason is that the characters are not engaging, we don't know them, nothing is done to know them better, so it's not easy to identify with them or understand their journey and what they went through. Frankie Cario makes a great job, but her character is ordinary, there's nothing extraordinary on the paper. Paul Mescal is OK, probably too young for the role, and suffers an unclear character who lacks writing.For instance, LOVE IS ALL YOU NEED (Susanne Bier) kind of deal with these topics, and the characters are very subtle, deep and engaging. This is not the case here.You can't see what's the direction of this film, what these characters have been through and what they're looking for, which is frustrating. There's never a revelation, or at least subtle indications to give a direction to the film or influence our thinking. Even the present day is unclear, we know nothing about the woman's present situation.The script is inspired by the filmmaker's own journey or memory, which is, of course, respectful. But the only (major !) problem is that filmmakers tend to think that their own life is worth to tell a story and make a movie. Well, we all went through things and we all lived dramatic, or traumatic events, and have memories of these events and of our past. There's nothing extraordinary in this script, what the filmmaker probably thought was extraordinary is, actually, ordinary. There's nothing fresh, original nor modern, nor even in the way it's filmed. It's dull.An ordinary, slow, boring film in which nothing happens.

Yellow and blue colors and metaphors are also well explained. Charlotte Wells directed the movie well. Paul Mescal performed very well. His Oscar nomination may be debatable, but his performance is obvious. Frankie Corio was also very good. It's obvious that the last dance scene in the movie is a metaphor. The movie is actually about Calum. There is a forced subject in the movie that I can't make sense of and that doesn't add anything to the movie.

A significant debut from Charlotte Wells and a calling card for her two leads, Aftersun is a small film with a big beating heart, one of which you won't soon forget.4 1/2 rugs out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",

I know there are nuances, slow build up, hints and small clues that make this a study of a damaged young father and his daughter yet almost 1h and 15 minutes into the film and we are only seeying mostly a man and his child on a resort in Turkey and their normal vacation experiences throughout what seems to be a week.Again I am aware there's way more than that but to me that's just what it felt like, all the way through the end it just feels okay and somehow I was expecting a not so ambiguous message by the end, although it makes sense that don't decide to just be blunt give that the entire movie is made of subtill messages but still I just didn't got attached to it.The chemistry between the main actors, dad and daughter, is indeed really good that I can get onboard with, but that's just about it. I have to also be honest that one of the main reasons I watched this movie was due to the Oscar nomination, but I didn't feel it's that powerful, Paul Mescal is young and shows for sure promise without a doubt but still I don't fully agree with the nomination.It might still touch a lot of folks for sure, it just wasn't my cup of tea.",

The colour palettes are gorgeous and this movie really uses lighting well, it perfectly reflects the tone and mood. Also, the use of long lingering shots is very effective at capturing emotion. Additionally, I'd like to mention how realistic the video camera footage looks! I genuinely felt as if I was watching a real family holiday.The score is so unique and really works well, it doesn't get repetitive either and flawlessly sets the mood! The soundtrack is also used well, and the film often blends the score and soundtrack together which I found particularly impressive. The sound design and mixing is equally as good too.The performances from both the leads are absolutely phenomenal, and are two of my favourite performances in film EVER. They bring a sweet and touching father daughter relationship to life! Paul Mescal never fails to impress, and I have so much sympathy for his character. In addition, Frankie Corio is brilliant and effortlessly captures childhood curiosity and innocence.The film has an incredibly realistic portrayal of mental illness, and more specifically depression. Both Calum and Sophie's characters really resonated with me and I'm sure this is a very relatable and important movie for many others too.Lastly, the movie has a very interesting structure, and is consistently engaging. The pacing is fairly slow and steady, taking time to flesh out the story and the characters. The ending is completely heartbreaking, and the dance scene is one of the best scenes in cinematic history.",

I'm captivated by the amazing directing, it's impressive it was the directorial debut of Charlotte Wells. Aftersun might not be for everyone although it's incredibly well made and peaceful. Probably was smart not knowing anything before watching made it feel refreshing, mainly wanted to see cause Paul is nominated which is fairly worthy. The cinematography is genius I'm surprised that wasn't nominated the shots, scenery, and colors are so good. I crave how enjoyable this film is and astonishing soundtrack! I love how the main girl reminds of someone I hung out with a lot. Great experience of bonding, vacation, and charm!",

            "content": "Bolstered by outstanding performances from its cast, Aftersun is a poignant & personal portrait of love, family, reminiscence & recollection that reflects on the warm memories we remember & the cold reality they sometimes are, and illustrates it through a young woman's reinterpretation of a holiday she took with her father in her adolescence.Written & directed by Charlotte Wells in her directorial debut, the story is an incredibly evocative & autobiographical account and is pieced together through real & imagined moments supported with DVR-recorder footage. Wells utilises an interesting structure that quietly unravels the truths by letting the camera do the talking and concludes on a devastating note.The probing camerawork not only captures the father's melancholy but also the daughter's own burgeoning feelings of growth & observance during their last holiday together. The arrangement of events may seem disjointed at first but it all ties up eventually. Still, it's the performances that do the heavy-lifting and both Paul Mescal & newcomer Frankie Corio are impressive throughout.Overall, Aftersun marks a promising beginning for its debutant filmmaker and announces her as a talent with an original voice. Crafted with a mournful eye, told with heartfelt intimacy and also brimming with emotional sincerity, the story has the power to change the perception of what we imagine our loved ones to be and who they really are and ranks amongst the better surprises to surface this year.",

And dare I say pointless and pretentious?It took me 45 minutes to realise that nothing was going to happen in this film, and at this point I desperately hit Google on my phone to see if I was somehow missing the point or something really profound. I wasn't. The film, which detailed (and I mean really detailed) a father/daughter sun holiday, was about interesting as watching your great aunt's holiday photos of Rhyl on a slideshow in January. Yes, the performances were ok, but they were wasted on the monotony of an endless, interminable sequence of playing pool, eating meals, sleeping, and chatting with random strangers in the water. And all the while, nothing happened. They ate, they slept, they put sun cream on, and that was it for the entirety of the movie. Zzzzzzz.The Dad had issues, but I couldn't have cared less as there was no explanation of what they were and why he was experiencing them. The girl was sweet, but that's about it ... In her own reflections of herself, from an adult perspective she was impeccably behaved and too good to be true (Really? Show me an 11 year old who is perfectly behaved on holidays).I could go on about how boring this film was, but frankly I'm bored even thinking about it. So I'll stop here ...",

            "content": "Aftersun is a beautiful and moving film with fantastic performances by the two leads. It's not a strong narrative driven movie; it underlines subtlety, mood, ambience - like a long lost summer dream, and aesthetically not unlike Call Me By Your Name or Lost in Translation, to name a few.The film also tells you a lot about you, as a viewer, and how you've been formatted to think a certain way - many times while watching it you can't help but think that something bad is going to happen: 'this is the scene where she'll be humiliated by the other kids' or 'this when the sexual abuse or incest scene will occur' for example; fortunately, none of those things ever happen and the film is all the better for it.The editing and the naturalistic cinematography are great, the recreation of the late 90s by the various creative departments is fantastic (it feels most of all authentic, natural and believable, never too forced or caricaturised), and Charlotte Wells does a mesmering job driving the film movingly forward. The soundtrack is a great throwback to that era and Oliver Coates's score is beautifully envolving.Frankie Corio is a natural talent and her performance avoids any sort of over dramatisation or theatricality. Paul Mescal is incredible and a major force and their chemistry together is deeply felt. By the time the film reaches its ending you'll feel moved and broken but in no way depressed.For sure one of the best films of 2022. May it get the recognition and accolades it deserves!",

The film will break your heart. It is a subtle exploration of a father-daughter relation and at the same time takes a highly poignant and empathetic approach to the subject of depression.Paul Mescal will leave you in pieces with his heartfelt performance of the father who wants to ensure his daughter that no matter what he is always at her side, her confidante, her support system, a shoulder for her to cry on, a person who would always love her in any circumstance and would never abandon her. Frankie Corio has such an endearing screen presence and she pulls in a subtle act as the 11-year old Sophie.

There is a culture thing (playing mostly in Turkey), a nice touch for sure. Probably it could play in other countries too.

A ball that might have rendered it disappointing in the flesh.It's anything but disappointing.It's not plot driven, far from it.Really it's a mood piece that captures the innocence of childhood (the 11 year old Sophie's early moments of an impending puberty) and parental guilt (her divorced Dad, Callum, played beautifully by Paul Mescal).Together this father and daughter team create a simply breathtaking and utterly believable rendering of how an unlikely couple would spend a week on a cut price package holiday from Edinburgh to Turkey in the 1990's.As a Dad myself, it's incredibly evocative (OK, I don't carry the baggage of divorce with me) it also effortlessly captures the mood of early 1990's culture, including the rave scene, that I was too old for but totally 'get' its significance.Although much of the relationship between the two is positive and really quite intimate there's an underscore of dread and jeopardy.Something's gonna go wrong, right?The movie has an unsettling mood, right from the off and, at times, this threatens to break the surface. Water is a constant theme in the movie, pools and sea that suggest drowning.Drowning under the pressure of raising your daughter right, drowning under the pent up anger that presents itself again and again, subtly but scarily, like when Callum spits his mouthwash onto the bathroom mirror in the hotel. In the way he arrives with a broken wrist and then clumsily tries to remove it in a bucket of (again) water with a pair of nail scissors.Is suicide imminent?Sophie is charm personified, a bubbly (but not precocious) 11 year old played by 9 year old street find Frankie Corio.What a performance. You know the kind. Never acted before and looks set to win awards. Effortless and completely believable and compelling.Her adult self looks back on the holiday 20 years later looking for clues as to why what later happened might have happened. It's a forlorn search.First time Scottish director Charlotte Wells has created a piece that reminded me somewhat of Lynne Ramsay's masterful Allan Warner adaptation, Morvern Callar.But this is no me too.

One of the most strikingly earnest aspects of the film is it dialogue, it feels precise, managed and scrutinised for optimal emotion, but, also effortless, as good dialogue should, it's never strained, even at the most apparently banal points of conversation, feel real, yet stimulating, in a way that real conversation sometimes does not. It's a film that balances its delicate array of emotions tightly, also certain when to add comedy or emotion to a scene, like a five star chef making a soup, perfectly balanced throughout.The performances, too, of course, also convey this, Calum (Paul Mescal) and Sophie (Frankie Corio), feel like a father daughter with the levels of comfort, yet occasional discomfort, Mescal and Corio mange to make you feel like you have know them for years in a few hours.I am stunned that this is Wells' debut feature, there is a level of talent and craft that feels like a veteran of the industry made it, she knows when to push the creative boundaries with her direction and when to simply let a scene breath on its on. Her framing is top-notch, she frames her characters in such a honest, vulnerable, that you feel connected to them in a way very few films can. It feels like a combination of the Coens, Kubrick and Wes Anderson.The film's cinematography is stunning too, when it comes to capturing the beautiful and ugly moments, the score is perfect and the soundtrack is wonderfully '90s.There's so much more to say about this film, I could drone on for hours, but I feel like this film is best experienced for yourself. So, please go and see 'Aftersun', easily, the best film of the year and one of my favourite of all time, a true study of mental health and human connection.",

I am unsure if its because its a UK/Scottish movie or if its because its a female director, but this seems to have been getting rave reviews despite it being a fairly average film within this genre.The story is basically a father and daughter on holiday, the father is no longer with the mother and a camcorder is used to document the holiday. The daughter is 11 and beginning to come into puberty while the father is obviously struggling with health issues which are never made clear.There are many films which focus on holiday/beach/island settings in the arthouse world. This has a similar vibe to Movern Callar or any other of these types of movies which use this setting as a type of dream world where the narrative is deliberately confusing and from a female perspective. And thats the problem with this film. It really focuses on a male protagonist but written from a female point of view. As a result we have what appears to be a weak and over emotional father, unable to set out boundaries for his daughter and is really irresponsible to the point his daughter is at risk of harm. Of course this being 2023 this is supposed to be a depiction of mental health issues, yet these issues are never fleshed out to the extent we can sympathise. Its almost as if the fact the main character being male means this is not worth exploring. As previously mentioned the narrative is deliberately opaque, particularly the ending. Which seems to be the current trend, as if this somehow makes this a more valuable piece of work. As a result we have an ending that is supposed to leave an uncertainty about the fate of the father, which again almost means that his experience or character arc simply doesn't matter. The only thing that seems to matter is how the daughter feels about how she remembers the holiday.There is nothing deep or meaningful about this film, its actually fairly shallow. The fact that so little time is given to the emotional reflection of the daughter at the end while emotive music plays just reinforces that the majority of the time leading up to the incomprehensible finale was wasted. Its not that I didnt get the film, there is just very little to get. It seems as if you write a script whereby the male characters are this shallow and disposable and then write an ambiguous ending to force discussion this will somehow be a good substitution for a good script. Unfortunately too many people are too easily satisfied it appears, this will only appeal to studenty types who think talking about films like this will impress other people.I will say that this male actor seems to be carving out a very odd niche for himself which seems to be as the mumbling sensitive male in female lead narratives.

With little happening, there's heavy-lifting to be done elsewhere in the production. The recourse to home-movie footage, enigmatic mumbling, dipping into the future and, repeatedly, dark, unfathomable disco scenes aren't really up to the job. The film is pretty, but when nothing Instagrammable has appeared on the screen for a while, back we go to those old reliable Turkish rugs.Paul Mescal is nominated for the Best Actor Oscar, but even Best Supporting Actor would be a stretch. The film belongs to Frankie Corio as his infinitely patient daughter. Perhaps Mescal is not best served by some quirky direction. On a couple of occasions when he is called on to actually do something - shuffle cards, sob inconsolably - the camera looks somewhere else or films him from behind.",

Some of the more commercial and remembered novels tend to be more skilfully penned, like works by Sally Rooney, Haruki Murakami and Margaret Atwood.Back to this film: my partner and I were bored throughout. The best bit came with the dance scene and Under Pressure by David Bowie -- but it's a bit of a cheap trick to rely heavily on someone else's music to set the tone of a film -- particularly when the lyrics in the context of this film are so expositional.Overall this film lacked grounding, in terms of story and cinematography. It felt like a writer's brainstorm. It was about personal while failing to communicate something universal, and for that reason to many a viewer not singing its praises this year, it fell flat and will undoubtedly be forgotten.",

I didn't feel a sense of emotion, and I'm not some psychopath. If I watch a bad, boring movie, I'm not going to automatically assume it's some art film that's just too sophisticated for me. I mean, how insulting.The one thing I did think this movie was trying to do was to be an analogy for all of our nostalgic and formative memories growing up. Like, imagine if you could watch a pro-shot video of you on vacation trying to figure out life when you were 12. That would be pretty cool, right? But I have it on good authority that is not what this movie was aiming to achieve which is disappointing because that's actually a really creative idea.I'd like to almost go out on the side of the road with a picket sign protesting this movie. \"It's not smarter than you!\", \"Don't waste your time!\", etc, etc.",

The tenderness and the subtlety of the film still came through so much that I don't recommend watching this film when you are tired. I also loved how the film never explicitly stated what was going on with Calum (Paul Mescal). The Scottish accents were endearing now that I actually had subtitles for it.I think both actors were phenomenal in portraying perhaps one of the most heartfelt father-daughter relationships on screen recently. You could tell that even though there was some distance between them, most likely because Sophie (Frankie Corio) lives with her mom, they loved each other. I didn't realize until later it was adult Sophie looking for Calum in the rave, but that probably means her memories. In her mind, Calum remains as the dazed dancer, as she last saw him. This suggests that since that vacation, Calum has no longer been part of her life for whatever reason. Some suggest suicide, which I think is a valid explanation.Perhaps I had way too high of an expectation because I feel like I wasn't as emotional as I should have been. Next time, I'm watching a movie when I am of sound mind to better appreciate it.",

After all, what can you expect from a film produced by a patron of happiness such as the A24.Starting with the plot, the film deals with the complex relationship between little Sophie and her father, Calum. In particular, with the complexity for a child to understand the nuances of adult maturity, if not in retrospect. In the picture, this difficulty is exacerbated by what appears to be a discomfort that Calum struggles to hide. Aftersun, through its underlying melancholy (and thanks to Paul Mescal's excellent performance), is able to strike a deep impact, and convey a profound sense of longing, and sadness.The main problem, at least for me, was \"personal\", as I was not able to fully understand the meaning and the emotions that the movie intended to arouse, maybe because my own experience is very different from the one portrayed. Indeed, the film has a greater desire to accompany in the exploration of emotions with which one can identify, than to open up to those who are unable to recognize them in their experience. Because of this, the viewer can feel bored and disconnected from the events, as the story has a very bland and slow pace. In any case, it is still a very interesting production by the fantastic A24.",

The father seems to be separated from his wife and is suffering some melancholy. Meanwhile, his daughter is a 11 years old girl facing sexualisation of her environment but still being a kiddo. (which was the moment filmed with the more sensibility but not enough to be relevant).Daughter's character :\nNothing to say, the actress is really talented. She succeed to show the transition between 2 ages and also to show her attachment for her father.Father's character :\nI felt a lack of empathy for this guy. No element is showing us the past of this guy so we don't understand his behavior. The movie suggest a difficult past (young parenthood) combined with a drinking problem (more present at the end of the movie), but you don't understand. The guy is maybe facing difficulties but his daughter is lovable and making effort to show him her affection and it's just making him more sad. The worst part is when he's letting her outside without considerations. The shadow of a rape of this girl was making me uncomfortable during many scenes. You want to feel sorry for him but the reality is that you want to enter the movie to slap him and force him to take his responsibility. And, come one, it's not like if the daughter is thankless or in a teenage crisis. She just want to sing with him.Stroboscope :\nIs the purpose of those scene to detect epileptic spectators ? It was more confusing than anything. I was thinking it was implying the non consensual sexual relation between the father and the mother while, in fact, it was the girl 20 years later in a techno party with apparition of his father. Was it suppose to show us the similarity between the father and the daughter facing the young parenthood ? By the way, the young parenthood of Sophie was coming out of nowhere. I would have enjoy explanation for this parallel.Conclusion :\nA little too long for what is was. You don't understand where the movie is going. You re expecting a revelation at some time that will never come so at the end, you re having \"moments\" of this holiday that are not connected. If you give me the choice between Kikujiro and this movie to explore the relation between an adult not ready for parenthood and a kid, I will prefer Kitano.Sorry aftersun.PS: Why this movie made so much the unanimity ? 100% on roten tomato ?

A thin thread of bonding runs through it, and the father is quite paternal, but I never felt a strong love connection between them -- though they can be somewhat affectionate.With all that time to sit with my own thoughts and emotions -- I had to do something during all those slow parts -- I had a few flashbacks to touchstone times in my childhood, but they still didn't make the film worth sitting through.",

I kept thinking it would transpire that they were at the scene of one of those resort massacres back in the 00's, but nope, nothing but a lot of drinking, swimming, moping about, more swimming, a mud bath, more beer, more meals..... i don't really see what the point of this was, i mean if you want to watch resentful brits on holiday, there are way more amusing ways to do that, not least of which would be to jump on an easy jet flight to spain or somewhere and listen to the brits grapple with non-english speakers by assuming that yelling everything breaks all language barries, and of course like australians, they also love a drink and spend nearly all of their time on holiday drinking, eating and yelling....So yeh, its a movie where absolutely nothing happens, not a single thing of any merit that justifies its existence. I'm sure the arty types will adore it for something or rather, but we average every day joe types, well you know, at 50 years of age there are better uses for two hours of our time,, afterall time is growing limited and spending it on a film where nothing happens is not a good use of the diminishing time we have.

I am well aware of just how lucky I've been to not have to hang on to memories and old videos of people who mean so much to me.However, Aftersun made me feel so much despite my experiences or lack thereof. The ability to put the audience in the shoes of a character fully should never be underestimated. This is a film that is not only deeply touching but so smart in the way it goes about telling its intimate story. Some people, like director Charlotte Wells, are so inherently talented that when they can put even a little of that talent in display it's a wonder to witness. Every shot feels personal, whether she went through this experience herself or not, her directing complements her writing so beautifully. The story reveals itself bit by bit. The heartache only grows stronger as the runtime goes on. And the ending in particular is so powerful that it's kinda mind-blowing to realize just how much is achieved in such a low-budget film. Perhaps the fact that the movie feels grander than it actually is speaks to just how similar human beings are to one another. The fact that no matter where we're from or what we've gone through personally at some level deep down we can all relate somehow. There's just something so utterly heartbreaking when you realize that the more attached you're growing to these characters the more everything hurts.I can't imagine a better film than this will come out for the remainder of 2022, but who knows really. Another thing to mention is that Aftersun will likely grow on me even more on subsequent watches, which I am so looking forward to. Nearly perfect piece of art.",

The two actors have an adorable dynamic that is incredibly heartwarming yet heartbreaking to watch unfold in the 100 minute film.Sure it's great that Paul Mescal is getting recognition for his role as the vulnerable Calum, but I can't help but be disappointed that Charlotte Wells didn't get an Oscar nom for directing or writing.

            "review_title": "Understated masterpiece",
            "content": "These are a few things that come to mind having watched this movie:1) \"Getting\" the movie will require some thinking. There are two layers of meaning here - the obvious one, that you easily absorb after the viewing, and the hidden one, that requires some time and reflection to understand. Some of the most significant elements of the plot arguably happen off-screen, and hence are open to a degree of interpretation from the viewer. The most negative reviews of the film have one thing in common - they claim the director should have been more forthcoming with the \"key message\". I don't agree of disagree, it's up to the individual tastes - but if you prefer to be \"spoonfed\" by the director and their narrative, you will be disappointed here.2) The full emotional impact may hit you some time after you finish watching. Some reviewers say they were reduced to tears in the movie theatre - I wasn't one of them. In fact, I didn't think much of the movie once I finished watching. However, the next night I woke up at 4am and lied in bed, thinking about the characters. I spent the next day coming back to the key episodes of the movie, going through the reviews and finally broke down in tears over rewatching the last scene.3) The main actors give truly phenomenal performances. Paul Mescal brilliantly portrays someone very charismatic and likeable, but with a clear vulnerability. Frankie Corio is amazing in a role of a girl who is already not a child but not quite yet an adolescent. She loves and misses her father dearly, but he is already not enough for her - she is curious about the teenage life and what it will bring her. The chemistry between Paul and Frankie is obvious, and the authenticity of their interaction is incredibly convincing.4) Be ready for your personal memories to be evoked. My personal life has some parallels with that of the main characters - I have a 12-year-old daughter named Sophie from my previous marriage, we holiday together often, and I even do Tai Chi! I can't (thankfully) relate to all the aspects of the plot, but the beauty of the father-daughter relationship depicted in the movie, as well as the inevitable bittersweet goodbyes after the end of each holiday or weekend together, resonated very strongly with my own memories. Also, somewhat unexpectedly, the movie brought back another treasured but faded memory of me as a 14-year-old, holidaying in Turkey with my beloved late grandfather.5) The directorial style of the movie is slow and understated, but nonetheless very engaging. As a viewer, I am very impressed with how well the debutante director balances the understated and slow \"indie\" style with respect and care for the viewer experience - the movie is engaging and easy to watch, which in my opinion cannot be said of so many indie titles claiming to be \"exclusive\" and \"intellectual\", as opposed to the \"dumb\" mainstream.6) The musical score and cinematography (operator / editor work) are top class and add to the experience tremendously. Enough has been said of the carefully selected soundtrack that \"rhymes\" so well with what's happening on screen - but I also loved the beautifully crafted shot compositions throughout the movie, the consistency of colours, the beautiful images that reoccur throughout the movie and stay with you (the colourful gliders in the clear blue sky).Not everyone will like it - but for me this is a beautiful, powerful and intimate story that I am sure will stay with me for a long time.",

            "content": "Aftersun, the feature film debut by auteur writer - director Charlotte Wells is a beautiful and bittersweet film unlike I have ever seen before.Frankie Corio playes Sophie (from Glasgow Scotland) in one of the most authentic and likable performances I've seen by a child actor. Paul Mescal, an outstanding, luminary actor who shined in Normal People, plays Sophie's young father, Calum. Divorced from -- but on good terms with -- Sophie's mum, Calum is a loving parent who tries to hide the enormity of his emotional and financial struggles from his daughter while on holiday alone together at a hokey Turkish resort in the 1990s. The genuine, delicate, affectionate relationship between Sophie and Calum centers this piece.On her eleventh birthday, Sophie asks her father what he did to celebrate his eleventh. He recalls that no one in his family remembered it. On his thirty-first birthday days later, Sophie plans a tribute in public to her father that is so moving it is almost too much for him to bear. The disclosures are presented like puzzle pieces: the magic, mystery, and misery of being human.I watched Aftersun two days ago and am still thinking about the intimate, artistic, exploratory way this coming-of-age drama was filmed: the pace is slow, yet gripping; shaky cinematography captures the memories that are being re-analyzed by adult Sophie at the time she becomes a parent herself; quiet moments convey more in a glance or touch than words; layers of feeling wash in rythmic cycles like waves. The fimmakers do not pander to, spoonfeed information, dumb down their audience, or evade heartbreak. In my opinion, this movie is a masterpiece.",

It's subtle and through this it gets much closer to reality than most films can. The obvious example of this is how Wells' script creates the absolute believable dialogue between a child who is just starting to see that her parents maybe are not perfect and a man who is struggling on a multitude of fronts but is keeping it together for his daughter. It is this realism of the film that is so effective in delivering the emotional gut punch of an ending. Everybody has felt this immense sense of loneliness and you can't help but dread what you think you know is coming. Personally I'm a person who keeps cinema and reality separate and if I do cry at a film it's maybe the odd tear but I have never been unable to stop crying and this is what this film did to me which is a testimony to the fantastic storytelling.",

I am in the middle of that.During the film, there isn't too much plot, and deliberately so. It focusses more on the relationship between the father (Mescal) and his daughter (Corrio). While watching it, there isn't too much excitement or disruption, but after processing it at the end it all makes sense. Some scenes (for example one of the first scenes where Mescal is smoking a cigarette for a solid minute) feel too drawn-out, but after knowing why this is done I can't blame the director for it.Obviously the performances in this movie are fantastic, with Mescal's Scottish accent being spot-on to the extent when me, an Irish person, forgot he was Irish. Corrio also has a long career ahead of her, what a breakout role to have.On the whole, Aftersun was a film that doesn't have the most engaging viewing experience at first, despite the holiday aesthetics, but it does capture the tension of a compromised family holiday, with joy in the small moments but pain in the boredom too. It is worth watching because the ending contextualises the relationship.",

I was on board for most of it, but it got to a point where I wanted some conceptual elements to come in a lay out the stakes and drive a more meaningful, life altering plot for them both. It's like being given high quality wine and not having a proper wine glass in which to drink it. The film needed that \"wine glass\" to encapsulate and structure a compelling, driving element for these great characters to take it to another level, still pretty great though.",

And then I felt very sad and heartbroken.The reviews are right, it takes a while for it to fully sink in, to see what the fuss was about. It took some reflection for me to feel the emotions, the depth, to realize how heartbreakingly realistic everything I saw was, and thats when I appreciated how it was made, even if it was yes, slow & dull. It's meant to be that way and I don't think it would have had the same impact any other way.To be clear, the ending wasn't vague to me, I already understood what happened. But it still took a while for me to appreciate the film to that level, to get what the other viewers were saying. The beauty is in the subtleties, the things not said or explained. It's as if I was the daughter, recalling the memories of her father at a point in her life where she could meet him where he was (at a similar age & being a parent) and finally being able to understand his silent struggle and appreciate what that vacation really meant for them.I will say it's definitely not for everyone. If you want to be entertained go elsewhere.

Calum, the father, is separated from Sophie's (the daughter) mom and it's the holidays so he has her for the time being and they both take a trip to Turkey.The film is well paced, never once feeling boring even though much of what we see happening seems normal and simplistic. This film also takes the \"show don't tell approach\" and drives it to a hundred. This film has multiple different interpretations that goes to show that this approach worked wonderfully.After finishing the movie, I was left with plethora of emotions and thoughts which I have trouble putting into words. It's a highly realistic portrayal of depression and how seemingly normal events have a sad undertone to them. How suddenly this movie makes you switch from having a smile on your face to tearing up is downright fascinating.For a debut feature, this film is beautifully and intelligently shot. Some scenes that are vital to audience's understanding of the character or the story have been shot in a such way that has a flair to it. Also, this film makes excellent use of old time camcorder footage (which is integral to the story) by putting the viewer in the seat of the person who is recording this and get a sense of what they might be going through.I think this is the only film that has made me feel uneasy and increased my heartbeat with simply the acting (no special sound or video effects) and in my view, it's a stunning achievement.And the actors triumph in this film. Paul Mescal and Frankie Corio are absolutely amazing and are the driving force of this film. Mescal, in particular, has an articulate manner of showing rumination and sadness, that makes the film all the more complex and layered.Overall, this is a highly recommended watch and definitely one of the top films of this year.",

Sophie (Frankie Corio) at age 11 is on the brink of adolescence trying to understand and come to terms with a father who is clearly loving, yet seems to be struggling beneath the weight of his life. Paul Mescal gives a realistic, tender and very understated performance, and young Frankie Corio is simply endearing as Sophie. The film, co-produced by Oscar-winning Director Barry Jenkins (\"Moonlight\"), leaves it up to the audience to decide the fate of Sophie's father at the end of AFTERSUN.

As you watch this film the first time; after those airport doors close; you will sit there and will try to figure out what just happened. What did just hit you? You will sit and think in mixed feelings for a while. Then, pieces will start coming together. Then, if you watch the second time, you will start understanding the depths of this agonizingly beautiful film better and will appreciate everything about this film and about life in general; which gave me a sense of not taking anything or any loved one for granted in life. I suspect that you may appreciate this film more, if you have younger kids; you will run to them and give them the biggest hugs ever and again, you will make sure you will try not to take them or anything you care about for granted - at least for a while until something else beautiful like this film will remind you to do so.

It also is some what too slow for shock effect.I actually think the so called main theme is actually irrelevant to this film anyways. I feel the puberty or more so early puberty part is actually more interesting and better executed. There are some decent scenes about father daughter relationship, but mostly the better working scenes are about early puberty. It is all done mostly very subtlea and works wonders in such delicate and deeply humane experience we all have.However I was left bit underwhelmed, because I feel the mental health part didn't hit the mark and somewhat undermines other things I feel were better suited as main theme. Also it isn't groundbreaking and nothing really shines as exceptional. It is not bad movie however, and not even mediocre. Yet I am left feeling bit mediocre.

Did not know the movie was about a similar scenario, and did not know it was filmed in Turkey- where I'm from. It's also a weird coincidence that dad and I listened to Losing My Religion only a couple hours before we started watching the movie.The facts that Calum is someone who can't fully witness her daughter growing up, who doesn't earn lots of money (and thus, probably isn't 'successful' in life), and who's divorced, merging with the scene where Sophie talks about having an amazing day and then coming home to feel tired and somehow down, gave dad and I the impression that Calum couldn't even experience the joy of spending time with his daughter, because he knows at the end of the day, Sophie will go back to living with her mom, left me extremely heartbroken.Throughout the movie, I couldn't help but feel nostalgic, melancholic, and deeply bittersweet. However, after the ending, I was left confused, because even though while we were watching the movie dad told me Calum was probably depressed, for the whole duration of the movie, I was expecting to better understand what was up with Calum; the flashing nightclub scenes were what was bugging me and making me think there was a hint in them regarding Calum's state, I kept trying to connect that with all the other dots, and just couldn't. It was only after I read some reviews and trivia about the movie that I finally could realize those were linking to the connection between Sophia and Calum, and Sophia understanding him at a deeper level years after the holiday.I think it's also funny how Sophie, as a kid, can't tell what's going on with Colum, and how I couldn't tell he was having suicidal thoughts until dad told me- even though I'm 21. I guess dads will always be dads, and daughters will always be daughters.Apart from all the emotions I've experienced, I think it's definitely worth mentioning the spectacular acting of Paul Mescal (Calum) and Frankie Corio (Sophie) that makes the movie way deeper, and the amazingly done cinematography and art directory, which results in each individual scene being elevated from just being components of the movie, to scenes to stare at as pieces of art.I can tell this movie will have a place in my heart for a long time, and in my opinion, even if there are no similarities you can empathize with, Aftersun definitely is one of the greatest movies of the last couple of years in its genre.",

Night comes and it is there where the warm light that reflects Sophie contrasts with the cold light that reflects her father, showing the depression that floods him and the innocence of his little girl.Once we reach the end, all the pieces of the beginning come together and everything makes sense, you understand how powerful the message is, how powerful the performances and direction were, great enough to feel sadness, pain and emptiness with its melancholic denouement.",

            "content": "Movies about mental illness hold a special place in my heart, and I am always fond of filmmakers exploring the depth of depression in a very raw and personal manner. With Aftersun, the movie was made out of memories, and it was hard at first to connect to Paul Mescal's character, but as the movie progressed, we felt that he was lost and dying inside. Aftersun is a film about belonging, making memories, and you will find yourself bearing in-depth dives into their individual pools. Aftersun is the kind of movie that would make you sit for 15 minutes and rethink your interaction with the people you love and worry that, despite their joyful disposition, they might be slowly dying inside. Charlotte Wells has written and directed this movie perfectly and displayed a peaceful and apparently very personal skill. Every detail in this film beautifully utilizes the elements of filmmaking that were used to communicate emotions. I am still mad that Oscar overlooked her for Best Director.The film can be slow and has a weak plotline, but the movie is neither plot-based nor has its climax, and these elements can be concerning for selected audiences as the movie has no progression that the general audiences wanted. Even I, myself, worried for the first 30 minutes, as I'm unsure of where the film was heading or how will it progressed, but the beauty of this film was that we slowly learned the struggle of Calum in a very subtle way. The atmosphere was set to be somber, melancholic, and subtle, and these elements were well utilized, and Wells brought a lightness of touch to just about every element of this film. The movie was told from Sophie's POV, and it added authenticity to the movie as the sign of Calum's depression and mental illness were very subtle that it felt like we were in the shoes of an 11-year-old girl, and it only made sense that even as viewers, we too missed the signs.The performances are top-notch! Paul Mescal's nuanced performance was remarkably subtle and poignant that even without the overdramatic interaction of his character, his heavy emotions transcend. He totally deserved that Oscar nomination. But the star of the film is Frankie Corio, she captured what it was like being 11 years old---that innocent and curious young kid that slowly discovers her sexuality while creating fond memories of her father. Everything about Corio's performance that cemented her to becoming one of the best this year, the rawness and vulnerability of her emotions are mesmerizing in this unforgettable story about the infinite power of memories.There are so many things that I love about this movie that writing this review wouldn't suffice how the film has made so much impact on me on so many levels in different aspects. After watching this movie, it reminded me of what Soren Kierkegaard wrote, \"life can only be understood backward, but must be lived forwards.\" If you love movies that will touch you, Aftersun is a must-watch!",

I was able to feel everything here: happiness, joy, sadness... and, most of all, empathy.The bond between father and daughter, his hidden yet shown depression and her's still-growing life experience made me feel so connected to her, when my own mother had depression when I was a pre-teen. I knew there was something wrong, as a teenager - but, didn't know what, and why. Fortunately, my mother made through it, but it wasn't easy, and I wasn't ready at all to understand all her hidden feelings at all.I also could relate to the father, because I know how depression and losing hope feels. Had it for years. The film could translate this feeling to the screen and it was made perfectly. I can say that I already lived under both the father and the daugther's skin, and that's why I got the message of it very clear, clear as water.I cried a lot while watching it. Specially when the daughter sings \"Losing My Religion\" to her father completely alone, when he should be with her for it. The message for me was so completely there, made me remember many things in my life, and I couldn't help but cry. Depression smashes everything around you, nothing seems to be worth the effort, even when your own daugther is trying to cheer you up. I know how the father feels, and I also know how the daugther feels. There's no right or wrong, black or white, only the completely grey and melancholy that depression brings.The director made us feel such empathy all the time - the father's sadness, the daughter's growing, her memories about him in the future, with possible regret and shame for not being able to do anything at the time. The daughters' feeling when she's an adult can be irrational, however it is very real. Human's feelings, most of the time, don't make sense at all.This movie was almost a replica about a immense part of my own life. I won't forget this one, ever, and it's probably my favorite film right now.Since now, everytime I watch it, many memories of my past will come back to life. Already did it on the first time I've watched.And when I watch it again and the movie finishes playing on the screen, I will remember how lucky I am to have my own happiness and my mother's happiness back again. That we're still able to enjoy this life. That we are here and alive.",

The music, the cinematography, the prestigious awards this debut received and of course the talent of the writer/director are mentioned lots of times.But despite its arthousey, sometimes maybe even improvised feel (the handheld holiday camera) this movie has a screenplay as well. And the way the story is structured is the reason why some people \"left the cinema crying without even knowing why\".I was strangely moved as well. I was wondering why adult Sophie was so angry at her dad in her strobe disco dream. 10 minutes later on my way home it suddenly clicked and everything made sense. That was the moment when I started to cry.The storyteller takes the liberty of changing the chronology of events. We have witnessed the tragedy without realising it (for a complete theory see the \"landmines\" review of Aftersun here on imdb which I fully support - thanks for writing that!).For some strange reason in the European arthouse scene smart scripts are considered to be less worthy, or simply \"too smart\". When mundane craft collides with the metaphysical genius of the auteur. That might be the reason why the underlying tragedy of Aftersun is not widely recognised.By the way: I don't blame people for finding this little gem slow and boring. That was a risk Charlotte Wells was taking by the subtlety of its construction. I love filmmakers who are not afraid to take risks. This movie really touched me.",

The film is told from the point of view of the now-adult girl, and that is the film's strength (according to many viewers), and weakness (according to me).Even so (1) I will give director Wells all the credit in the world for making this attempt and (2) after viewing the film and then reading some of the reviews I found myself 'touched' by the work. But should a viewer have to read reviews to understand / appreciate a film? I think not.Memory / Remembering is not a linear process. Try to remember an event out of your past and you'll possibly find yourself remembering the results of the event first, then its beginning, then a day before the event even took place, and then back to the event itself, and so on. And as Aftersun is a remembered story the viewer is faced with its random-like nature. Events that occur following the vacation are inserted into the middle of the vacation tale. Uncertainties on the part of the adult woman (she cannot recall who her younger self might have seen dancing in a gay bar) cloud a possible plot point and explanation. A film-like mist or cloud separates the viewer from certain on-screen actions.The performance of Frankie Corio as the eleven year old girl is exceptional, even compared with other exceptional child-actor performances. Her facial expressions, the curiosity in her actions .... I cannot praise her enough. Paul Mescal as the father carefully navigates the line between telling nothing and divulging too much. We feel his pain.So, hard work. And as I said, I put it in. But not during the viewing. Only later, at home, in part with this very application open on my laptop.",

There isn't even any conflict in moments when you are waiting for it (in the second part of the picture, in the first part literally nothing happens, just a cut of random episodes from a standard holiday).The actors are emotionless, especially the dad, the music is listless, and the concept of found footage style does not give the movie any additional points. The movie aspires to seem smart and philosophical, but it fails. The director want the viewer to be emphatic to the characters, but does not explains anything happening on the screen. It feels like playing dark souls, where you need to scavenge and put together all the bits of information yourself to get the overall picture of the family, and if you are lucky you manage to do this by the end of the movie, which is too late.

The musical, but more importantly the lyrical content of the music which is used & edited to perfection helps narrate the words & meanings that someone in the depths of depression sometimes just cannot find the words to muster. This will stay with me for a long, long time & it is a beautiful film which captures a father/daughter relationship, but if you are particularly susceptible to poor mental health then I would exercise caution before watching it.

Calum is divorced from Sophie's mum and its a way to spend time with his daughter. Nothing truly extraordinary happens, but Wells and her cinematographer Gregory Oke keep the viewer in close at all times, observing the tiny details - a smile, a leg movement, a blink of an eye. It's in those moments, often seen from Sophie's POV, that count here.Corio and Mescal are excellent. The dialogue is mostly small talk, yet it speaks quite pointedly as spoken by the characters. Combined with the performances, one gets a sense not only of their relationship, but, of their lives together - even if the main body of the movie takes place over only a few days. The stylish camerawork (including the footage from the video camera) and editing are engrossing even with the fragmented technique. Wells seems to understand that the camera DOES lie. It can create it's own impressions. It can distort what is actually occurring. What makes Wells so canny is that she also comprehends that one's own memories can also be faulty.Wells uses all of the tools to poignantly create moments in time that will echo for a lifetime for Sophie and Calum - but, also for Wells herself and AFTERSUN's viewers.

            "content": "The golden rule in cinema is 'Show, don't tell'. In films, images should tell the story, not dialogue. 'Aftersun' is a perfect example of how that's done. This film is good because of what we see, and what those images imply. The storyline itself is secondary.In essence, 'Aftersun' consists of scenes during a summer holiday in a beach resort. Divorced father Calum has brought his eleven year old daughter Sophie, who lives with her mother. They're clearly having a good time swimming, relaxing, playing pool and participating in the occasional excursion. They're filming each other using a portable camera, and those images are part of what we see.But underneath the joyful scenes of a happy child and a loving father, there is a sense of something more unpleasant going on. The more the film continues, the more the viewer gets the impression that something terrible can happen at any instant. We are used to films that spell things out pretty clearly. When we see a weapon, we know someone will get killed. When we see a boy and a girl smiling to each other, we know they will fall in love. It doesn't work that way in 'Aftersun'. I started to look for clues of a dramatic development, but it never came. The holiday comes to an end, and only the final scene suggests things that might have happened, and gives the film a different meaning.'Aftersun' leaves much to the interpretation of the viewer. That can be frustrating or rewarding, depending on how you look at it. Director Charlotte Wells has taken the 'Show, don't tell'-strategy to its extreme: she tells us very little and shows us very much.Apart from the deeper meaning that is hidden beneath the images of the happy holiday, the film is remarkable for its cinematographic approach. Images of holidays can be extremely boring, even more so when nothing spectacular happens, but in 'Aftersun' they have a wonderful, emotional quality. Also, the home movie footage is very cleverly used. In one scene, the images of the camcorder are displayed on the small television screen in the hotel room. When the camcorder is shut off, we see Sophie and her father reflected in the glass of te screen. In the last scene, the use of those different images is even more prominent.Paul Mescal, who plays the father, is nominated for a 'best actor' Oscar. In a way, that doesn't really reflect what makes this film special. It's not only Mescal's acting, but rather the way in which ordinary, everyday events are made into a special story.",

I was moved to tears at some of these scenes when I thought of friends I had known who had gone through similar times and lost their lives.But as much as this film manages to capture on film hard topics on grief and loss, it never feels like it is out to exploit them. The writing is so good it does not force home the message like so many TV shows, films and adverts are trying to do these days when it comes to mental health or diversity.Also a shoutout to the young Scottish actress from Edinburgh, she was amazing.

Some people have just two simple categories to divide cinema: critic-favourites and fan-favourites. You know what both mean, so let me save my words. Charlotte Wells' Aftersun falls in the critic-favourite category, so if you like fan-favourite cinema then do yourself a favour and stay away from it. But if you love critic-driven films, then make sure you don't miss this one. You'll miss one of the best films of the year. Let me just tell you my table toppers in both categories. The fan favourite is \"Top Gun: Maverick\" or maybe \"Avatar: The Way of the Water\" (which I will watch in 3-4 days), and the critic favourite is \"Aftersun.\" I hope things are more clear now. Wells' Aftersun is about Sophie and her father, Calum. The film shows a holiday spent by them when Sophie was 11 and Calum was about 30. There is nothing else to it, but what a beautiful screenplay it has. There are no dramatic segments that make you wet your tissues; there are no useless arguments; there's no concrete ending (the happy one you always prefer), yet it absorbs you into the narrative. The storytelling is subtle and meaningful. You may need to rewatch it to understand them, or you may not even understand what they were trying to say. It's kind of a private affair. The words don't describe it, but the silence and realistic value take you into a deep study of the characters. Paul Mescal's performance is there to rule many nominations. He is superb, if that's the shortest word to describe it in its most brief version. Dear Frankie Corio, how cute you look there! If I were your age, I would have proposed to you, darling. Aftersun is a true modern-day, updated feature film when it comes to technical aspects. Charlotte Wells and the entire technical team have done a great job keeping it true to life and damn accurate. In every way, this is a must-see.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",

Rewatching it, there are actually many hints that tease at Calum's (Mescal) mental health and depression. 1) he bought that expensive rug knowing he couldn't afford it (possibly because he already made up his mind about suicide and decided he might as well spend the money) 2) he spit at his own reflection directly after Sophie told him about her possible depressive tendencies, almost as if he was disgusted with himself for possibly passing that down to her (this part was so jarring for me, it appears to happen for no reason, but when re watching it, I realized what Sophie had just said probably triggered him) 3) the spit spatter on the mirror looks like it could be alluding to blood spatter from a self inflicted gunshot 4) it appears like he drowns himself when he goes into the dark ocean and doesn't resurface 5) him standing on the railing as if he is going to jump 6) his refusal to tell Sophie about his plans while she was recording him 7) his urgency when trying to teach Sophie about self defense. I am sure there is more that I cant remember or that I probably missed.Also, I think the movie title itself is an allegory of depression. When Sophie is telling her dad about the amazing day they had and now that its over she felt like her organs stopped working and she feels like she is sinking. That is was Aftersun means to me. The feeling that you have after a long day in the sun and you just feel so drained and tired you could just sleep forever.As I mentioned, this movie is probably a little too much of a slow burn for most, and admittedly it does seem to stretch itself out a little too long. But ultimately, I think this movie is profound. For better or worse, I haven't really been able to stop thinking about it.",

It felt extremely authentic in all aspects - from the father - daughter relationship to Sophie's exploration of her new relationship and perspective on the world .My two complaints are that is was very very slow - it was clear what they were trying to do and it was a simmer and I reflect and usually like that - but this time it was just too much - I found my mind wandering and checking how much time was left . My second complaint is the scenes shown through the camera as well as in the rave were way too bouncy they made me a little motion sick - just over done .As has been stated by most the ending scene was AMAZING and really made the movie worth it - so powerful and raw and real . Watch it - probably just once though !",

            "content": "It's the late 90s, and eleven-year old Sophie (Frankie Corio) and her dad Calum (Paul Mescal) are holidaying in Turkey for the summer. For Calum, a boyish 30-something, bonding with the daughter he adores is a rare experience. They spend their days swimming, playing pool and soaking up the sun. That's about all that's conventional about Charlotte Wells' heartfelt and unhurried coming-of-age drama. \"Aftersun\" is a mosaic of hazy, fragmented memories interspersed with digital video footage, tethered to the present by an adult Sophie searching for the truth that eluded her in childhood.The movie is a brief window into the lives of two people at different crossroads of life. As Calum approaches middle age, Sophie is watching her childhood disappear in the rear view mirror. Calum is divorced from Sophie's mum, and has spent the last few years trying to hold down a job. Paul Mescal's remarkable performance is at times muted and at others brimming with affection. Newcomer Corio shines as the youngster still figuring out life and documenting it with a camcorder. The lo-res video clips reveal insight into their unguarded feelings. Sophie realises Calum is struggling financially when he goes to buy a Turkish rug and hesitates when he learns how much it costs. Calum keeps a tight lid on his emotions, but underneath something is troubling him.Scottish-born Wells based her first feature length film on experiences with her own father, making it feel wholly organic and authentic. Wells and cinematographer Gregory Oke use reflective surfaces such as tabletops, swimming pools and mirrors to convey a distorted sense of time and place. Some scenes with Calum and Sophie have a shallow depth of field, with one of them softly out of focus, lending the film an ethereal haze. One memorable scene involves a freshly snapped Polaroid of the two. The undeveloped photograph rests on the table, its subjects slowly materialising like ghosts coming to life while they continue talking away.As their holiday nears it end, Calum reaches out to Sophie, reassuring her, \"You can do anything, just talk to me about it,\" a memory the adult Sophie might lament as a promise never kept. The ending of \"Aftersun\" plunges into choppy emotional waters, allowing those bubbles of detail to storm to the surface to form a more complete picture, leaving it up to the audience to colour the story with their own deeply emotional perspective.",

So many reviews talk about the ease between father and daughter. In many places I saw the exact opposite. A discomfort, an awkwardness. Sometimes the dialogue from Mescal felt exactly like what it was- scripted lines that sounded uncomfortable coming out of his mouth. Sometimes the dialogue was BAD.This is basically a portrait of a depressed and struggling father on holiday with his daughter. Some of the visuals were lovely, and the daughter was very natural, but overall it didn't leave any lasting impression. Certainly not a masterpiece. Obviously had a lot of money for a film this size.",

I found that with time I understood his character more and liked it better, when understanding his difficulties, but it never fully showed clearly what in his life went wrong or why. I like the recorder as a stylistic device within the movie and the camera sometimes not being put directly to the characters but seing them in the background or through a reflection through the TV made me feel almost as if I would have looked at them in real life not in a movie. It was very creative and nice to watch. Also their communication was often rather through subtleties than saying something directly. Like the scene being more tense, when they talked about something uncomfortable, which was shown for example through Sophie scratching her fingers or Calum trying opening his plaster hand.Also I am sure there was a lot of symbols, some I was getting but some I did not understand at all. What I was missing was background information and the idea where the movie wanted to go and what it wanted to tell. It felt more like an experiment, which was successful, but could have been a lot better with a little bit more structure behind.Overall the vibe of the movie was very nice and relaxing and it finally lead to a overflowing of emotions on a deep level, but without clear storyline or organization I unfortunately cannot give this rather good movie a higher rating.",

            "content": "Underdeveloped, and premature, it missed the point of being nuanced and subtle and ends up saying nothing at all. This could have been typically the kind of movie I prefer the most, except the script was missing, and there were too many blanks to fill.What a lot of people assume is deep and emotionally rich but it's because they misunderstand the concept of a slice-of-life movie.Both main actors are amazing and so natural in their roles. I can watch Paul Mescal in any role, all day. The music, the cinematography, and the innovative shooting are all superb making the movie easy to watch. However, for a movie to qualify as a classic (as many critics are judging this as) needs more substance. Unfortunately, I realized within the first 30 minutes or so that the movie was going nowhere.It's a character-based movie with very little character. It hints at multiple themes (alcoholism, meditation, divorce, children as a young parent, sexuality) but doesn't go anywhere meaningful with them. It tells nothing about how that affects the characters (as they grow up) or their relationship and it just seems like empty symbolism.By the end, I was left with many questions, but not ones that come from being intrigued, but rather ones that come from being confused. This movie seems like a first half of a great movie. What I want, is more of an adult Sophie or perhaps a deeper delve into the backstory of Calum (in the second half of the movie preferably). In a way the movie feels like a debut movie, as in it has potential but fails to hit the mark and it is certainly overrated. Either ways, I needed a better revelation, a deeper story, more than just empty hints that fail to connect. I want to see more of the director, but not now, maybe after 10 years, once her style connects with a message.",

The director, Charlotte Wells, revels in wasting the audience's time.While there's plenty to like in this film (not the least of which is its relatively accurate portrayal of depression), it's accomplished at such a meandering, slow pace that it makes one wonder if this couldn't have been a 30-minute short rather than a feature. While I understand that the intent is to be slow (after all, the slow passage of time can be a symptom of depression) the overuse of this practice places the film in a rare category for me: boring.I, myself, and countless others around me have struggled with depression, and far be it from me to diminish those struggles, but the self-indulgent nature of \"Aftersun\" seems to serve the director more than it serves the emotional arc or the audience. Ultimately, I found this film to be disrespectful of the time the audience devoted to it.I understand the knee-jerk reaction to this review may be to posit that slow-burn films are not down my alley. Quite the contrary, I love works like \"Nebraska\", \"Before Midnight\", \"The Trip\", and \"Wit\". And on that note, one aspect I did appreciate was the film's attempt to show formative moments in young Sophie's life. In this way \"Aftersun\" feels like a female rendition of \"Boyhood\", the only issue is the film lacks the forward propulsion to make it nearly as impactful and far-reaching.Do not get me wrong-as a first-time feature director Wells has strong intention and clear emotional direction, but she was clearly not prepared to make a narrative feature or was conceited enough to believe that merely translating one's own vacation drama should qualify as sufficiently engaging.",

I had some idea the film would deal with some heavy themes, and that one of the main characters was dealing with depression, but I still wasn't prepared for it to unfold in the way it did while feeling so soul crushing.Looking back on it now, it feels like Aftersun is about the start of one character's life (as a teenager/young woman at least), and about the end of another's. It combines a coming-of-age narrative with a story about a man who knows his days are numbered, because he's come to terms with the idea that he's going to end his life. I read the ending in the saddest way possible - that when they said goodbye after their holiday, that was the last time they ever saw each other, and now the adult daughter is haunted by her memories of what was, in the moment, a seemingly happy time.I think all the scenes in this would feel even sadder in hindsight. Even if my reading's off, knowing where it's generally going would make the whole thing so much more emotionally potent. It does mean that Aftersun is slow-going for much of its runtime. It feels like it meanders and lacks purpose, but then the final few scenes really bring it all together, and ultimately make the film an immensely rewarding one to reflect on. It's heavy and even horrifically sad, but it's a powerful and very well-acted film that could become an all-timer on a rewatch (if I ever feel brave enough to revisit it).",

The way it slowly develops that plot is also fascinating, using small things like the gradually increasing visibility of Calum's drinking and the appearance and increasing frequency of the flashing scenes to slowly accelerate the films tension is superb, transforming it from a lush joy of the early scenes to a deep sense of loss at the end. The way camcorder footage and that one Polaroid are used to convey the films message is stunning, and the way the light grain and the rather retro - but admittedly still beautiful - color grading on the \"contemporary\" footage tied them together is great.

I don't want to give any spoilers so I won't say anything more about Calum the father played sensitively by the Irish actor Paul Mescal but to say the film and story are clearly about Sophie's ( mamma Mia anyone !? ) reflection on her reaching the age of her father 31 and reflecting back on their holiday together in Olu Deniz when she was 11 for his birthday - a growing up holiday where she had her first kiss with a boy but all the questions about what happened between then and now when she's in a same sex relationship with a child of her own watching back the holiday video with more questions than answers .The storytelling and editing had the feeling of a French drama but it just didn't work as well as it could have done or should have done - it gave the audience no clue what to feel just a feeling of an unanswered story without an obvious endPad.

Perhaps a bit of an idea of timing (1990s?) and setting could have helped too, so the plot (or what there is of a plot) would then have had more coherence.

It's ok that they built a suicidal character, but still, he didn't hurt anyone. On the downside, Sophy starts out kissing boys and watching straight couples and ends up gay married to a woman and a baby of nursing age crying for the mom' s breasts, which is kind of ridiculous.

It is possible to not be particularly impressed by their vacation scenes since they tell fairly little.But by the end, we experience a sudden, powerful heartbreak; Something that we did not realize was being built up.It wasn't until then I fully appreciated Aftersun's genius. We were almost completely oblivious to what was about to come, like Sophie. The final moments of Aftersun play like an hourglass arriving at an end, with the final dose of sand trickling through.",

At first I thought the adult daughter was Calum's wife!Frankie Corio as the young daughter Sophie is a talented actress - she has a bright future.

For example, imagine desperately having to peer into flashes of strobing lights to piece together head or tail of what's happening. It's like a director who just discovered the novelty of VFX and then decided to apply the technique to the entire film. You can glean repeated usage of this in scenes where the father rubs sunscreen over his 13-year-old daughter's body and when sunscreen isn't around, uses mud.

Aftersun's main focus is never about the veracity of the events, but the memories that remain from given moments in their lives and the impact that it had on them.A very contemplative film that explores in a unique way the themes it approaches and one of the most wholesome watches I've had.

            "content": "Aftersun (its title is never explained) is an excellent debut feature film by Wells, who did make three shorts previously, of which \"Tuesday (2015)\" also explored the father-daughter relationship. This film about a divorced father and his 11 year old daughter going on their traditional holiday together explores how memory can distort and be mixed with perhaps false memories, or wish fullfilment. Did all of it really happen, or was it just how an 11 year old interprets things she didn't have the maturity yet to fully understand? The style of filming however, is somewhat of a burden to a viewer. It consists of mainly close ups the faces, or wide takes where father and daughter are barely visible and not recognizable. The other characters in the film, (the teens, hotel personnel, other holiday makers) are hardly in frame, barely have lines. Only the 12 year old boy Sophie kisses is clearly visible. Aftersun is also clearly a film of it's age, when it comes how the young actress is shot. Even though it plays in a holiday resort, and Sophie is dressed accordingly and in swim wear, any and all salaciousness is carefully avoided. She's never shown in a bikini, but rather in a full, dark colored bathing suit. The one time there's a three -quarter shot of Sophie underwater, she wears a t-shirt. The kiss between her and Micheal is filmed from behind his head so it's pretty clear there was no physical contact whatsoever.While the direction and acting is in general wonderful, there are times when Sophie smiles too much. When child child actors smile at inappropiate times, they do that out cluelessness, embarrassement of shyness. In general it means they're bad at acting, but since Corio also had good acting moments, I suspect she was directed to smile, which tells us the direction wasn't up to par.This is a minor flaw in an on the whole lovely debut.7 oth 10The Melancholic Alcoholic.",

The film thrives on its subtleties and ambiguities, and I think this may turn away some viewers. However, these are the special elements that give the film its edge - you are not given all the answers, but you are given enough visual storytelling to form your own judgments about an incredibly intimate and organic story of a woman reminiscing about a vacation she took with her father in Turkey when she was a young girl. The moments of tenderness, honesty, and vulnerability between Calum, played with a raw and anguished sensibility by Paul Mescal, and his teenage daughter Sophie (a very natural, curious, and wise performance by Frankie Corio) make this a true touching charmer.Shot to look much like a shaky home video with hints of French New Wave influences, the scenes unfold quite seamlessly to make the viewers join adult Sophie in her journey of watching old video footage to deconstruct the memories of that shared experience she had with her dad. It's not so much about what Sophie discovers upon revisiting these evocations, but about what we, as the viewer, can infer or conclude based on these recollections. And these are largely based on dissections of quiet, symbolic moments interspersed throughout. Both beautiful and haunting.",

There is little dialogue and the pace is slow, but it subtly builds up to an ambiguous ending that resonates afterwards. Certainly not everyone will agree with this though, as the level of engagement with this film really depends on the viewers own experiences.The film is lead with two beautiful performances by Paul Mescal and Frankie Corio, who create a natural and heartfelt father-daughter relationship on screen. Mescal is at his best here and Corio is effortlessly compelling to say this is her first appearance. Their scenes are shot through a retro, grainy picture and the occasional Camcorder footage, which captures the films 90s setting and brings feelings of nostalgia. The concept of 'Aftersun' is such a simple one, but it is simultaneously complex and one of the most realistic depictions of mental illness.For more film reviews follow film.follower on Instagram.",

The performances are pretty solid, there's good cinematography, and overall the movie looks and sounds good.Where it falls apart is in my opinion pacing and plot.

Now mind you, I watched it without looking anything up except for the general reception, so I went in with a complete blank slate.Soon enough I thought this was going to be one of \"those\" movies. That is: full of seemingly pointless scenes that sometimes drag too long for no good reason. And I was more or less right, as by the end of it I kinda wonder what the director wanted to say about these characters. I appreciate not spoon-feeding the audience, but by the end of the movie we barely know anything about the father, other than that he's in some financial distress (but that begs the question of how he afforded what doesn't look like a cheap vacation oversea when he cares about losing a diving mask), and that he's depressed on some level. Other than some mood swings and quirky moments we don't really \"reflect\" on his personality that much.Plus, adult Sophie could be cut from the movie and absolutely nothing would change. We get 10 seconds of time skip about one hour in to find out she's lesbian and has a daughter. Neither of those have any relation to anything in the movie. Then there's another timeskip at the very end, and that doesn't add anything either.Overall a very anemic experience.",

At this point, time is no longer a lingering old image, it becomes a specific, private experience with a paragraph - the experience of father and daughter cannot be aligned regarding tomorrow.The biggest difference between adults and children is tomorrow. Tomorrow for children is pocket change, as if there is always another token that can start a new game by being invested. A lot of tomorrow is like the all-inclusive wristband at a resort hotel, which Sophie inherited from a mature older sister. She was proud of herself that night, kissing the little boy by the pool is a billionaire's demand for more freedom; tomorrow for adults is a part of the future, and the future is often dark, constituting Calum's moments of losing focus, crying, and going to the deep sea.\"You excited for tomorrow?\" Calum nods slightly. A standard adult response. Years later, Sophie will also remember her father in an adult-style ambiguity, that summer, the experiences during the trip, and everything becomes unimportant, only emotions are real. Emotions anchor people to time.The lost time cannot fill a heart today. We still don't know the father's life (why did he cry loudly in the middle of the night? Why did he separate from his wife? Why did he have a 10-year-old daughter at the age of 30?), because life is a narrative concept. \" \"aftersun\"\" does not pursue the accuracy and completeness of narrative, it only shows time. The father is the person in time, he has no origin or destination, on that time slice, the 30-year-old father is eternal. Today's Sophie is not the Sophie by the pool, time does not change anything, everything in the past is eternal. This is more thorough than Proust, who once wrote:\n\"It seems that it is only through some eternal changes that we feel the great differences between the samples taken at intervals, and feel that we are the same as them and also follow this rule. They are still themselves, but are no longer like them\".At the end, the father turns off the DV, leaves, opens the door, and it's the dark dance floor with chaotic lights. What is the constantly flashing dark dance floor in \" \"Aftersun\"? I think it's like a nightmare, an unhappy thing, hidden in the gap of time. To return to that holiday, or another better holiday, you must follow time, pass through the dark dance floor, and pass through these shadows. How heavy and simple it is.",

I admit I was waiting for something to happen for a bit but did realise the type of film this was going to be, so slowed down and just watched it. It's an odd film, not much happens but it really worms its way under your skin. You really are effectively watching someone's holiday. It's normal, like the everyday holiday that we've all been on. And that's why it works for me. I found the film and the ending very charming and I was moved by it.My advice/ DON'T READ ANYTHING ABOUT IT. Because when you do, my Lord it makes the film much less enjoyable.When watched as I did, it's a lovely little film based on normal life and families and not always knowing what's going on with people, behind the smiles, everyone trying to make moments special, families, regret, love and loss. When you read about what the film is intended to be, it veers quickly into so damn pretentious and rather obnoxious. It also falls short as it relies on the viewer to make a number of assumptions that just aren't shown, which is irritating. I'm going to try and forget I read any of that stuff and just remember the film for what I thought it was and will rate it accordingly.",

Paul Mescal gives the performance of the year no doubt, where he's able to express balance of being a compassionate and reckless dad and having this deeply painful depressive state bubbling up a lot of the time, in a really subtle and nuanced way.The electronic ambient score by Oliver Coates really adds to this ethereal ambience I've mentioned before with its use of synths in this minimal soundscape, which all culminates in the 'Under Pressure' finale, something that feels transcendental in all its elements.",

It feels like it's captured the emotions of being a teen on a family holiday so perfectly it shocked me. The twinges of jealousy of other lives, romanticising some of the older kids, the colours even!But unfortunately the overriding feeling for me was it needed more story. Something needed to take me from scene to scene and feel like I was watching a movie. By half way through it felt like I was sitting in an art museum watching one of the art video installations. Lovely film work, an emotional theme, but not enough to grab you for a feature length film.A 6/10 for me, but any movie that pushes to try something new grabs an extra 2 stars from me to see more movies like it!",

The young Sophie is still getting to know who she is and what might have caused their relationship to be seeming strange sometimes.The end of the movie shared a peak on the adult Sophie revisiting their summer vacation, and relieving her old paternal memories. But at the same time, Sophie's expression gives the feeling that she is trying to understand something, and, in my point of view, she is getting to realize that her father wasn't all there because other things rather than having no money and no girlfriend were affecting him, like his mental health, something that made her young self be, sometimes, upset on how her dad wasn't happy and excited all the time, like she was.",

And because you had to unravel the subtleties of the film people are calling it a masterpiece.. which makes absolutely no sense. If you want to see a film that's gripping or entertaining, watch something else. This felt like watching paint dry and had me scratching my head throughout wondering when something would happen and what the point of the film was.",

I found it hard to breath sometimes terrified that something bad was going to happen to one of them. When the movie was about to end I fooled myself into thinking they made it home safely which they probably did. Once it sunk in that Calum was gone I felt my heart break into a million pieces. I will watch it again for sure because I feel an emotional attachment and I want to learn more about what transpired on that sunny Turkish holiday. No other film has affected me in such a way but I suspect the rawness was heightened by a recent trip home to see my Dad and finding photos from his youth and early days of being a new parent in the 60's that he had not seen for decades. Memories are so powerful.",

Like that film, it moves between the present and the past. They both have a very saturated palate, an evocative score, not too much dialogue, and compelling performances.

It's easy to see a tragedy, and movies typically tend to the extreme. But there are plenty of people who walk around with baggage similar to these two, and who live out their lives without any cinematic resolution, redemption, or reconciliation. Absent any clear moment of tragedy, it's just as plausible to think that everything after the Turkish vacation was and will be as un-unique as the vacation itself. Back and forth between mild happiness and melancholy, with occasional moments that could lead to something life-altering, but that don't.

For example, 3 mins of Mescal smoking a cigarette and moving around the balcony. 2 min shot of his breathing underneath a blanket. Just because a film is well acted and has a couple of artistic scenes, doesn't make it a good movie. There is no plot, and look vacation artsy movies can be good: The Descendants for example. This was just dull, boring, and thinks way too highly of itself. \n\nSo we're *Spoiler* watching a girl who in present tense is watching old footage of a holiday and remembering her dad when she was young. Although, this resort holiday she's remembering has absolutely no substance to it. \n\nHe's just a normal dad and she's a normal girl. They have nothing interesting about them, there's a total lack of plot. I don't know who this movie is for, other than just for people like Mescal, who is great, but for people like him to secure BAFTAs and emmys for a movie that realistically wasn't good but for art's sake we'll pretend it was so moving. \n\nAs I say, I can handle movies of this nature, The Descendants, Call Me By Your Name, etc, all holiday focused movies. But the difference with them was that there was 1) plot, and 2) the location was idyllic. \n\nThe only thing I think this movie probably invokes is just remembering to look back and remember how you love someone, and remember your family. Hold on to precious memories and youth. \n\nBut frankly, this movie has as much depth as a \"live laugh love\" wall sticker. And even then, at least that statement is clear and knows what it is.\n\nWhat is aftersun other than just another slow paced artsy film?",

Charlotte Wells' extremely well-crafted debut gives no clear answers about what is troubling these characters, but the way it captures the fleeting moments of joy and sorrow is rewarding enough.Paul Mescal shines as a loving yet tormented father, and Frankie Corio is a magnificent revelation; their chemistry together is off the charts.Wells' visual resources are most impressive. The way she puts together the story feels like actual memories fused together with nightmarish thoughts, where the key to what's happening lies. But the best part is that it's up to everyone to decide what to make of it.And this is what sets apart great films from common ones; they make you feel, remember and think and the same time. 'Aftersun' is a masterpiece about raw emotions and the moments we wish were never gone.",

Before even going into thisA woman reflects on a vacation she took with her father in Turkey as a child and tries to recall through faded memories and camcorder footage the man she saw as her father vs. the man she sees him as as an adult. Before even going into this gem, I had a gut feeling it was going to be special and tender in ways I couldn't quite describe or fathom. And after walking out of the theater in an almost trance-like state, I can confidently confirm that it's almost everything I imagined and expected it to be and then some. Gentle, tender, quiet, and subtly heartbreaking, it's a film that made me dig deep into several long-dormant memories and recollections of my childhood, family, divorce, relationship with my parents and especially my father during that time, etc. It's the rare film that's made me rethink and revisit so many long-buried and left behind memories that I either never had the answers to (and probably never will) and makes me see certain things in a new and different light (for better or worse.) Paul Mescal and Frankie Corio are such a loving and heart-melting pairing here as father and daughter. Although cryptic in parts, I believe it's one of those films where it's up to you to take away your own personal meaning from it, which I most certainly did. Overall, I'd say it's entirely possible that I've witnessed my new favorite film of the year so far, but it goes so much farther and deeper beyond that. It's a film I can tell that will almost certainly stay with and haunt me indefinitely (again, for better or worse.)",

ThisIt\u2019s one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it\u2019s something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist\u2019s youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn\u2019t feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film\u2019s poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters\u2019 dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What\u2019s more, this offering\u2019s camera work \u2013 aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story \u2013 is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The \u201clooking back in fondness\u201d factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story. Considering all of the advance glowing reactions I had read about this release, I was really looking forward to it going in. Unfortunately, though, I came away from it almost as sad and disappointed as the protagonist herself.",

How can the critics and the audience infer anything at all about the adult Sophie when nothing subsequent to the airport drop-off is shown?

That's why I think its conclusion is the part that left the most lasting impression on a large part of the audience.A very enjoyable film, but I don't think it's worthy of the mark it's making.",

An adult Sophie, on her birthday, looks back at twenty year old film footage of the last summer holiday in Turkey when she was 11 years old spent with her estranged father, Calum, played by Paul Mescal in his recent Best Actor Oscar-nominated role. Sophie (Frankie Corio) at age 11 is on the brink of adolescence trying to understand and come to terms with a father who is clearly loving, yet seems to be struggling beneath the weight of his life. Paul Mescal gives a realistic, tender and very understated performance, and young Frankie Corio is simply endearing as Sophie. The film, co-produced by Oscar-winning Director Barry Jenkins (\"Moonlight\"), leaves it up to the audience to decide the fate of Sophie's father at the end of AFTERSUN. The sense of melancholy I felt while watching the film left me with the understanding that for Sophie, 20 years of loss seems a lifetime, while her memories feel like only yesterday.",
