            "content": "\"The Banshees of Inisherin\" is an idiosyncratic blend of funny, sad, and more than anything lonely, acted by one of the best casts of the year.Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are two friends who have a falling out because one simply doesn't want to be friends with the other anymore. Why? Because he's become aware of how quickly his life is slipping by and he doesn't want to waste it on dull people. The other takes offense, obviously, and starts out trying to win the other back until his friend's obstinance causes his simmering animosity to boil over.At first I was relating to Gleeson's character because I've felt like him. Life is too short to spend on relationships that don't add value. But as his behavior gets more and more extreme and.....well....let's just say out of hand (wink, wink), we start to realize how unwell he is and sympathies shift to Farrell's character. Until we start to realize how selfish he actually is and how much his own actions are driven more by wanting to be liked than by concern for his friend. And that's one of the things I liked most about the movie. These are characters dealing with the existentialism inherent in being a human being living on the planet, warts and all, and we see ourselves in all of it, both the good and the bad. Though set in the 1920s, this very much felt like a film inspired by the isolation and loneliness brought about by a global pandemic.The standout of the cast is Kerry Condon as Farrell's sister. She's an antidote to the male angst pervading this little Irish village. While the men are content to stew and whine and complain about dull pointless lives that they don't do anything to change, she gets fed up with how boring they all are and decides to grab her own bit of happiness. Also good is Barry Keoghan as perhaps the film's most heartbreaking character.And lest everything I've written above makes this film sound dour and depressing, did I also mention that it's very very funny? Funny in a Martin McDonagh way, to be sure, but it'll have you chuckling if you get his particular vibe.Grade: A.",

Patient, but alert and attentive to catch the subtleties of the slow-burn plot.Oh...I should mention it is very Irish. If you don't know what that means, well... watch the film and you'll get a glimmer.The acting and scenery are marvelous, as others have noted. The plot as a metaphor for the Irish Civil War and so on.The strange sudden \"unfriending\" and the bizarre twists and turns it takes as a commentary on human nature and isolation amid a tedious present and an uncertain future.There's no hand-holding and you have to read between the lines to understand it well. The humor is dry, dark and subtle, sprinkled in by small doses.I suppose I must have been in the right mood to appreciate it, and largely absent expectations (other than that there would be good acting, which was so).People expecting more of a comedy will be disappointed, I think, as will those expecting a light-hearted or uplifting conclusion.Still, I thought it was quite interesting, and certainly different.",

So you persevere, keep holding out your hand, but all that does, is cause the flames, to be more fanned, out of spite your friend wont linger, raises more than a mid-finger, it's like you've been black balled, suppressed, banished and banned. More diplomacy results in loss and pain, while there's nothing to be won, you won't refrain, the lines have now been drawn, only one thing this will spawn, it's as avoidable, as it's stupid and insane.Reflecting the friction and war taking place over the water, and the reasons for it, with four outstanding performances, although Barry Keoghan absolutely knocks it out of the park, a film to get you thinking about what it means to get along, and the repercussions when two tribes don't, even over the most trivial of torments.",

            "review_title": "Promises broken",
            "content": "It is 1923 and the Irish civil war has not reached the small island of Inisherin. 40-something Padraic lives with his sister, eking out an agricultural living, and spending what appears to be quite a lot of spare time at the pub with his best friend for years, olderman and fiddle player Colm. Then, one day, Colm tells him that he doesn't want to be friends any more, without providing any sort of reason (he does later). Padraic is devastated and confused and persists in bothering Colm for understanding in the face of Colm's blunt statement that we wants Padraic to leave him alone.I loved Martin McDonough's In Bruges and Three Billboards (Seven Psychopaths had its moments), and Colin Farell and Brendan Gleeson easily find their In Bruges chemistry again. The cinematography, sets and locations, are bleak and beautiful, the acting from all the cast is great, and the script, often funny, thoughtfully ruminates on friendship, loneliness, isolation, mortality, stubbornness, and various other related concepts.Yes I was disappointed. Why? The synopsis above comes from the trailer, and although the story of these two once-friends does progress further, there are two things it never does.One, it never explains Colm's decision. Colm gives his reasons but, frankly, they are irrational, as are his subsequent actions. I can understand Padraic'ss frustratiin, because I shared it. None of it made sense unless an external agency was at work - depression, dementia, psychosis, witchcraft...Two, it never resolves. The two obvious resolutions would have been reconciliation or tragedy, but the film never gets as far as either, which left me dissatisfied.This film, to me, broke its promises.",

            "review_title": "A thought-provoking story of helplessness",
            "content": "It is a well told dark comedy that keeps you wanting more, in a time when Ireland was full of despair, not long after the war of Independence and a long-suffering period that brought about a post-colonial inferiority complex (still hasn't been addressed to this day), a struggle for an identity, a repressive church, superstitions, isolation, mass emigration, poverty and to top it all off a brutal civil war. This film does a great job to put you in the psych of the time and to top that off the cinematography, costumes, music and atmosphere are wonderful. The film is itself a bit of a conundrum, on one hand it leaves you thinking nonstop about the story and the premise, while on the other hand you feel cheated by its abruptness.P\u00e1draic \u00f3 S\u00failleabh\u00e1in (Colin Farrell) is just a nice man who struggles to deal with losing his friendship with Colm Doherty (Brendan Gleeson) and the further loss he endures. Colm, himself is in a fight against time and his age. The dark struggle of helplessness or despair is rife on the Island, but the story telling is done so well it comes across uplifting at times with light-hearted comedy sprinkled on top. Siobh\u00e1n n\u00ed S\u00failleabh\u00e1in (Kerry Condon) is a rock to P\u00e1draic, but she is herself tied to the antics of the Island and Dominic Kearney (Barry Keoghan) must suffer with his own demons while he searches for love.Both leads Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson knock it out of the park, but the two shining stars for me were Barry Keoghan and the beautiful Kerry Condon. I thought the film was going to take a turn for the D'Unbelievables at one point when Pat Shortt who plays Jonjo Devine and Jon Kenny who plays Gerry pop up on the screen, but after a brief scare they turned out to be a good addition to the banter and gossip in the pub scenes.It's not perfect and lets you down in a few areas. Some of the dialogue feels out of place especially for the part of Ireland and the time period, which was a shame, as it transports you out of the screen and back into the cinema (this seems to be a modern trend with period film). The setting was also a bit too squeaky clean; brand new clean clothes, polished teeth, shoes galore, fresh faces (apart from Colin Farrell who did look like he spent years working in the elements) the poverty of the time could have been showcased a bit more.My wife and I both enjoyed this film immensely. Any fan of dark comedy, this film is a must see with a word of warning: I would be aware if you are going to see this movie and you are emotionally fragile, that it does tap into the dark side of your brain and leaves you in deep thought when it is finished.8/10.",

The Banshees of Inisherin is the best a Mcdonagh movie has ever looked, every scene has a visual landscape setting and color tone is completely balanced.The movie revolves around 3 arcs and all the 3 have their perfect conclusions and intersect cleverly. It's one of the best writing you will ever see. Like 3 Billboards there is a perfect blend of humour and tragedy. The stories revolve around Colin Farrell coming to terms that his best friend doesn't want to do anything with him, his sister played by Kerry Cordon trying to find the ultimate purpose in her life and Dominic played by Barry Keoghan, who is living a worst life possible.Colin Farrell has been doing some great work over the last 20 years and this is his Eureka, Eureka moment. The Banshees of Inisherin is the best movie of the year so far and deserves both commercial and critical acclaim. Very rarely movies that satisfy everyone are made, this is one of them.",

Served by a magistral group of actors and actress, \"Banshees\" takes you to stunning Irish landscapes and numbs you with its comfortable scenery, cute farm animals and lovely violin tunes in the good old pub... Until men display a classic story of pride and stubbornness.Like a dark children tale, the movie seems to be a metaphor of the stupidity of war and humanity's contradictions. Collin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and a scene stealing Barry Keoghan are just wonderful at creating those flawed and unique men spiraling into their destiny. While Kerry Condon as the reasonable woman represents perfectly the fatality of this world.Martin McDonagh created a fantastic piece of filmmaking, a sadly very timely message that I would love to see adapted as a play.",

            "content": "As \"The Banchees of Inisherin\" (2022 release from Ireland; 114 min) opens, the Colin Farrell character, a guy named Padriac, stops by the Breandon Gleeson character, a guy named Colm who is Padriac's best friend. That is, until that moment. For reasons unknown, Colm wants nothing more to do with Padriac. \"I just don't like you anymore\" Colm offers. The calendar shows \"April 1, 1923\", and Padriac doesn't take this unexplained change of behavior by Colm very well... At this point we are 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the highly anticipated reunion of writer-director Martin McDonagh, and lead performers Farrell and Gleeson, 14 years after the now classic \"In Bruges\". I too was eager to see how this reunion would play out, but then something completely unexpected happened: I found the Colin Farrell character to be irritating and off-putting, to the point where it was almost too much to bear or see. Without spoiling anything, I will say that things are somewhat better in the movie's second hour. But I could never get into the proper flow of the movie, let alone rave about it as many others have done. I completely understand that my viewpoint is definitely in the minority. And that this film has been hailed critically (it's currently rated 97% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). The most striking thing about the movie for me was the strong performance of Barry Keoghan (who starred in \"Dunkirk\" a few years back). This is a subjective opinion of course.\"The Banchees of Inisherin\" premiered at this year's Venice Film Festival to universal acclaim, and opened in theaters a few weeks ago. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was attended okay (I counted about 15 people). If you are a fan of Martin McDonagh's earlier work of or Colin Farrell or Brendon Gleeson, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",

Even the other minor characters were well written and very well acted by their respective actors. I can't think of a single actor who did a poor job, heck even the animals did a good job. Excellent cinematography as well.However, while the dialogue was extremely well written, the script itself was somewhat lacking.

Stupid really. An inexplicable turn on a friendship; never explained; and never resolved.It seemed more like a play to me than a film.

However, it was ultimately unsatisfying because it never really rose above a persistent, downbeat nihilism.I took the movie as a kind of allegory on human irrationality and miscommunication, seen vividly on the mainland during the Irish Civil War, and in microcosm in the relationship between Padraic and Colm.It was also an extended study on the wages of untreated mental illness, as Colm chose to do nothing to treat his \"despair\" (that is, depression), and instead wreaked havoc upon himself and his erstwhile best mate.My problem with Banshees is that the great movies that reflect the insanity of the human condition, at the end of the day, still have something redemptive about them. The great anti-war, movies-Bridge on the River Kwai, For Whom the Bell Tolls, MASH, Atonement-all deliver some form of redemption amid the pain. Banshees only leaves one feeling hopeless at the end. The very bleakness of the movie unfortunately drags it down.",

This film clearly tells us no: the island, an enclosed place where everything is concentrated and which the surrounding sea keeps compressed, deeply affects its inhabitants and permeates them with itself, sickens them with its own disease. The latest film by Englishman Martin McDonagh (in his 4th feature film, with 3 films behind him, all of which are top-notch) is absolutely superb: for storytelling ability, for location (evocative, rocky Irish island), for the brilliance of the screenplay (let's face it: McDonagh writes really well!), for acting (impressive Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, also excellent Barry Keoghan and Kerry Condon). The story is told of Padraic (Farrell), good and kind, who, overnight, loses the consideration of his greatest friend, Colm (Gleeson). Why? Because I don't like you anymore, because you're boring, Colm replies to him, and I don't want to waste my time with you anymore. And Padraic, who is not as sharp and intelligent as he would like to be but is esteemed for his courtesy and good spirits, does not understand this. Colm, who plays the violin and composes music, is obsessed with the passing of time, with the need to indulge his art in order not to be forgotten. His art demands total exclusivity from him, leaving no room for the banality of feelings. But is this the real reason, or is Colm going mad? At this point, what follows is a jeu de massacre between the two ex-friends, surrounded by various minor characters that McDonagh knows how to connote with felicitous psychological notations and a keen sense of humor. And then there are the animals, almost sacred emanations of the island, loved and respected, more than human in their affective reactions. And there is the war, distant but present, of which ominous explosions are heard in the distance. And finally there is the old witch, a representation of Death that rivals even the Bengt Ekerot of \"The Seventh Seal.\" In short, a beautiful and poignant film like few we see. Not to be missed!",

The scenery and filming were fine.

If that was the point, it was awful. If that wasn't the point it was still awful. I think it might have also tried to be deep by having a civil war between two characters to reflect Irelands civil war. If so, I still wasn't impressed.

We also get to know the town's sadistic policeman who abuses his son Dominic, known as the town fool, a genial bartender, gossipy shopkeeper, and old female ghoul who shadows P\u00e1draic warning him of impending deaths on the island.The escalation of bizarre and tragic negative events and actions did nothing positive for me.

One day, Gleeson tells Farrell he doesn't like him anymore and doesn't want to speak to him because he has nothing of interest to say. The consequences affect them both.An intriguing and occasionally ambiguous take on love and friendship in a strange stand alone world where priorities that drive people are often quite different from what most people are used to. It is also nicely balanced with a sharp, often quite dark sense of humour and features a wide array of lively, eccentric support characters. Key here though and keeping things altogether are the leads who are universally good ie Gleeson, Kerry Condon as Farrell's sister, Barry Keoghan as the local idiot keen to fall in love. Best of all though is Farrell giving one of his finest ever performance which should get him a few award nominations.",

The execution was bad.I found myself after the first 15-20 minutes I was wondering where the film was going & what the conclusion was going to be because, as I said, I looked up the synopsis prior to watching & sort of got the gist of what to expect. But even the synopsis didn't exactly help as it felt out there. In fact, I couldn't even remember the name of the film, never mind the synopsis without looking the film up. It doesn't help the intrigue if you know what I mean...The humour of course, was dark & the dialogue along with the humour wasn't bad. But, the film felt depressing & seemed to drag on & on with little for me to go. I mean, you got the story, but the above question of where the film was going kept niggling away at me. It was getting repetitive to the point of annoyance & then when it ends, you're left thinking ok, so what was the end goal of the film. It was a bit of a pain to finish, yet somehow, you kept watching to see what would happen as you were lead on by curiosity as to when & how it would end.The film is too out there & again is one of those films which gets critical acclaim for being different basically. The ending explains nothing & for such a simple yet annoying story, which, for the middle part/bulk of the film, offered nothing as to why 1 guy stopped being friends with the other, (aside from him being too dull...), as the film was 1 hour & 48 minutes too long & got nowhere. There could've been more to the film in the middle, but no, they added depressing scenes & annoying bad characters in between just to beef the film up for no reason.Anyway the film is too long, the pacing is dreadful & the story is annoying yet simple. The ending is out there as much as the title & synopsis. Seriously, & they say this film is the best of the writer & director? Wow...Overall, it's a bland, overly long film with a simple, yet annoying story. There's humour, some beautiful tranquil scenery, but aside from that it's a weird film & not one you'd watch with your friends or family unless you like these sort of films.3/10.",

            "content": "Writer-director Martin McDonagh's dark comedy-drama is one of those films that leaves me (and probably many other viewers) scratching my head, making me sincerely wonder what all the fuss is about. In this fable-like Irish folk tale about two longtime friends (Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson) whose relationship suddenly reaches an impasse, they struggle to come to terms of where things go from there in the aftermath of this scenario. There's just one problem here: the picture's razor-thin premise with its virtually nonexistent back story doesn't provide enough basis for why the dissolution of this friendship occurs and then escalates to a tale of inexplicable desperation and truly bewildering retributive self-abuse. Indeed, we seem to know more about the setting of the story - a small island off the western Irish seacoast during the waning days of the new republic's 1922-23 civil war - than we do about its characters, their relationship and their motivations. To compound matters, the narrative stretches out far too long, taking a seeming eternity to unfold with no particularly satisfying payoff, punctuated by lame attempts at humor that mostly fail to land. To its credit, this offering features fine performances by its two principals, as well as superb portrayals by Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan in supporting roles, all of whom have garnered Golden Globe Award nominations in the acting categories. There's also much to be said for its gorgeous cinematography and atmospheric Carter Burwell original score. However, it's truly mind-boggling to understand how this film has earned eight total Globe nods and four National Board of Review awards, among numerous other inflated and questionable accolades. This tediously dull, slow-paced effort falls woefully short of the fine work the filmmaker achieved in previous films like \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" (2017) and \"In Bruges\" (2008) (not to mention its lack of the snappy on-screen chemistry that Farrell and Gleeson achieved in that off-beat comedy), accomplishments that make this release come across as a great disappointment by comparison. In fact, at the risk of overstatement, \"Banshees\" could have been edited down to a short, and it still likely would have been a letdown. Catch this one at your peril; at the very least, it's now available for online streaming, so you shouldn't have to venture out if you really want to watch it.",

This is evident by the last interaction, when one says the ira and free Irish with stop soon because there was pause, and Colin's character responds that it won't end and that's a good thing.This was the writer's attempt to depict civil wars as pointless beginnings that escalate to the point of useless bloodshed, and that escalated into perpetuity until there's nothing left to kill or destroy.I still think there could have been a more succinct and deliberate ending, but his sister leaving and both men having nothing (even less than what they started) with no resolution or even addressing the original problem was the whole point of the metaphor. At the end of civil wars, no great resolve happens, no one is left with more than they started with, and all that's left is a melancholy spirit and despair.",

This is normally a device that causes tension but here it seems dumb. The two main characters keep running into each other both by chance and intentionally, especially because there seems to only be one pub that neither of them want to stop going to on a daily basis.If that was a set up for a dark comedy, it would make sense but don't fool yourself. While there are a few moments early in that might make you chuckle, THIS IS NOT A COMEDY!Something funny with a resolution is what I was expecting. By the end I felt terrible and angry which was quite a deviation from the film I thought I would be watching. So be careful what you're expecting.If it's a well acted, beautifully set, confusing statement about human relationships with no real resolution then watch with pleasure.

I've eagerly waited months to see Banshees of Inisherin and then couldn't believe my eyes at the cruelty, misery, despair and general awfulness of the film. And it's labelled \"comedy\"? The most uncomedic film I've seen in many a year!Any funny lines were already revealed in the trailer, so when I finally saw the film I was well familiar with anything humorous in it. Every charming moment was spoiled by the trailer. So the trailer was, in the end, more entertaining than the actual film.Two mentally ill men, apparently long-time friends, spend most of the film going out of their way to make each other's lives miserable. As if they weren't miserable enough already, living small, restricted lives in what is, undeniably, a gorgeous location. Why one, a fiddle player of all things, decides to dismember himself in \"retaliation\" for his one-time friend \"bothering\" him, is beyond me. Clearly the man is mentally ill and needs serious help, but I don't care to sit around and witness them both going to hell in a handbasket.Maybe it's all meant to be allegorical and has some deeply profound meaning that's gone over my head. To me it's two hours of despair, nastiness, bloodshed, stupidity, and a total waste of time. What a dreadful disappointment!",

The film amounts to nothing more than a badly written shaggy dog story which leaves you wanting the 2 hours you spent watching the film back.

To call \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" a black comedy would be somewhat of an understatement, but if you pay attention and listen very closely, almost every line of dialog is understatedly hilarious, but set within a context so dire that the effect is muted by the desperation and solemnity of the characters. The film almost becomes depressing at times, as P\u00e1draic S\u00failleabh\u00e1in (Colin Farrell) attempts to come to grips with the sudden loss of friendship with drinking buddy Colm Sonny Larry Doherty (Brendan Gleeson). It all boils down to a simple statement by Colm - \"I just don't like you anymore\" - but as the story progresses, we come to a better understanding of the dynamic at work with the older Colm and his devastated friend P\u00e1draic, who's insistence in trying to understand what's happening eventually leads to a disastrous outcome for both parties. Notable supporting performances by Kerry Condon as P\u00e1draic's sister Siobh\u00e1n, and Barry Keoghan as a well-meaning but dimwitted friend of all, make this an often sad and frustrating exercise for the viewer, and as the story reaches its stunning climax, one is left with a sense of loss and profound inability to reconcile one's feelings about what was just experienced. And yet personally, I was left in awe by the picture and even more so by the mesmerizing performances of Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson.",

It is completely senseless. Two men on a remote Irish island are best friends in the 1920s. Both are very lonely men. One, the older one, suddenly refuses to see or speak to the younger one. No explanation given. Naturally younger one wants an explanation. He's devastated and lonely. Pressing for a reason, he's told he's too dull suddenly, that the older guy wants time and space to work on his music (dubious fiddle playing in the pub). Younger guy keeps on bugging him for a better reason and older man says he'll cut off his fingers if he asks again. He asks again and old man cuts off all his fingers on one hand. Clearly, he can't play the fiddle anymore and there's a bizarre scene of other fiddle players playing in the pub while he manically punches the air with his bloody stumps. Younger man's pet eats the fingers (yes, it's that kind of film) and chokes to death. Young man very sad and burns old man's house down. Meanwhile, just to lighten the mood, young simple guy on the island who is being fiddled with by his father drowns himself. I don't know why. I don't really know why anything happens on this island.

Instead of lovers at odds, we explore the fall out when Gleeson's Colm decides he's had enough of his life long friendship with Farrell's Padraic.It is a unique conceit, and the result is a bitingly funny, razor sharp screenplay that has so many layers and depth to it. It never once drags or feels overworked, and the balance between drama and comedy is struck perfectly.The performances from Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are flawless. The comedic timing, the depth, the drama. Incredible. Supporting turns from Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan are just as good, as are the result of the relatively small cast.The film is beautifully shot, capturing the natural landscape wonderfully.

In fact if there were sme twist ending and they were never really friends or Gleeson was just an imaginary friend Farell made up because he didn't have any but no! Gleeson and his sons are incredible actors but I wish he didn't take this tole as it didn't do him any favours! In the end it was just horrible, watching paint dry would have been a better use of my time.",

When I saw the reviews for this movie, I came running to HBOMAX because I had to see what all the buzz was about. I mean, I HAVE TO be missing something, right? This movie was a snooze fest, absolutely uninteresting, and incredibly boring. I have a great sense of humor and I found none of this funny at all. It's a story about a guy who suddenly decides he wants to stop being friends with his buddy, and for why? Because he finds him dull. The love for this movie has got to be one of the most bizzare things and easily cements it as one of, if not the most, overrated film of all time. This was awful.",

Fields full oif stones, stone walls everywhere so that some land might be cleared, a bleak existence for most, a struggle where the pub provides the only entertainment. Two friends fall out, Colm (Brendan Gleeson) decides that he won't speak to P\u00e1draic (Colin Farrell) anymore because he's too dull. But he's always been dull retorts Siobh\u00e1n (Kelly Condon), P\u00e1draic's sister. It's not that P\u00e1draic is stupid, it's just that his small talk is maddening to Colm. Colm feels he must devote his time to composing tunes, to leave a legacy. He is a gifted violinist and students come from all over Ireland to leatn from him. Things worsen between the duo and Colm threatens to cut off a finger each time P\u00e1draic speaks to him. The film becomes dark, very dark, there is a line of black comedy which runs through it but at times even that cannot leaven the existential despair at play here. Siobh\u00e1n alsi knows that the island offers her nothing, either in employment or relationships but a past is hinted at. The supporting cast is also superb, Domnic (Barry Keoghan) a simple minded lad who displays great insights at times, his abusive father Peadar (Gary Lydon) is the violent local guard. Set in 1923, it opens on 1st of April, the civil War is drawing to a close but gunfire can be heard from the Galway coast. This has little effect on Inisherin's populace except that Peadar gets extra pay to go and attend an execution. Some great dialogue, especially in the pub and two confessional confrontations between Colm and a priest (David Peaese). Not a film you'll forget in a hurry. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh. 9/10.",

            "content": "I'm disappointed in myself sometimes for not enjoying a film that I've been looking forward to for awhile and is from a filmmaker whose work I mostly have in my all time favourites. However, I have to be honest and such is the case with Martin McDonough's The Banshees Of Inisherin, a film whose drop dead gorgeous Irish scenery is about the only thing I could take away from an experience that otherwise left me cold, jaded and sadly indifferent. Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell once again share the screen here, but nowhere to be found is the subtle poignancy, bruising deadpan camaraderie and heart-rending downbeat catharsis of In Bruges. In telling the story of two lifelong friends who find a gulf forming between them when one of them (Gleeson) suddenly decides he doesn't want to be friends with the other (Farrell), McDonough starts at a place that's ripe for interpersonal exploration and just decides to go this bizarre, surreal route that takes these characters that to all outward appearances seem human and shoots through a prism of off kilter dialogue and character choices that just don't seem... genuine. This filmmaker began his career from such an emotionally authentic place In Bruges, pure comedy/tragedy brilliance in a classic that still endures and he scored high points again with Seven Psychopaths, a terrific meta comedy that showed off his talent for the absurd within a seemingly benign setting and has only grown on me with time. But then he did that Three Billboards thing that simply didn't work for me, an ill conceived bit of off kilter clunkiness that doesn't ring true like his past work. He's done that again here, and not that there's anything wrong with being meta, arthouse or deliberately quaint and thorny in one's writing process to get themes across, but it still needs to have weight, feel like it's set somewhere in this galaxy with characters that feel somewhat human, and this just ain't it. There are a few well timed jokes and teary eyed stuff that holds attention momentarily and some legitimately drop dead gorgeous scenery, but this is mostly an inexplicably alienating, dour, willfully sombre piece of non-storytelling where the character's twilight zone interactions left me detached and listless. The most effective performance and character is Kerry Condon as Farrell's sister and she has the good sense to walk out of the film midway through, which I never do but almost wish I did here. McDonough is a talent but he needs to pull his head, and his typewriter out from his behind and dial back the terminally impenetrable aspects of his process, maybe do something simple and sure of heart and mind like Bruges again. A load of wank.",

It's a fictional archipelago off the coast of Ireland with a population of around 100. That's lonely and at times mad, but it dramatizes human stubbornness like few other films ever.Padraic (Colin Farrell-Oscar worthy performance) realizes that his best friend, Colm (Brendan Gleeson in just as good a performance), no longer wants to talk to him because Colm believes Padraic is a dullard, who is keeping him from composing music for his violin. That's the core conflict of this drama because the intensity of their separation and Padraic's being unable to understand Colm's need to be alone at this time of his waning life.During the repetitions of their separation, characters walk beautiful roads with ancient stone borders emphasizing the narrowness of life and the stunning beauty outside the road and the spare homes that provide room and board but nothing else. The \"else\" is provided by numerous trips to the pub, where gossip is traded, lives parsed, and laws broken without recourse.The bro breakup is as intense as any split anywhere at any time. Like the Irish Civil War constantly reminding the island of the world's ability to fight inside itself, the conflict of two best friends mirrors the ability of brothers to fight each other for the smallest of reasons anywhere. One of the best movies this year and anytime.",

I've said this before reviewing another film, but if I could I'd give this one a zero and the one word review. Ok. A bit harsh. Maybe even a one is too little? But no more than five! Nearly there with the word-count.

This film started out so well. It was actually funny, in a twisted way. The cinematography was excellent, but you'd expect it from professionals. Even the actors were excellent. The pub scenes initially were also 'fun'. Then it all got weird - and then it reduced to 'deranged'. I also draw a very clear, simple line when animals die or are killed as part of the story. How's that for a spolier. I know it's not real, but in this day and age when the whole animal kingdom is being utterly and ruthlessly destroyed, often by default - and animals suffer so much neglect and abuse - it's just sickening and supremely cheap.

            "content": "I have been trying to catch up on some of the films under consideration for awards season and found this one on cable. It was nominated for the Golden Globes under comedy, so I thought it might be amusing. Alas, this is neither a comedy (it does not even qualify for \"dark comedy\") nor an enjoyable viewing experience. I would say that the only people who could possibly enjoy it are those who mistake misery for greatness or spend their spare time pulling wings off injured birds.Set in the 1920s in a small Irish village, the film focuses on two men - Padraic (Colin Farrell) and Colm (Brendan Gleeson) - who are ostensibly best mates. Colm without reason suddenly decides to end his friendship with Padraic in as abrupt and cruel a fashion as possible. When a shocked and desolate Padraic tries to find out why and apologize for any offense, Colm with a total lack of emotion tells him he did nothing wrong. Colm apparently feels he is destined for greatness and immortality by composing a song bearing the title of this tripe, and every moment that he spends with Padraic (ostensibly with the majority of the village) is wasted, because they are all dull, stupid wastes of space that drain his creativity.Colm then ups the ante by eventually telling Padriac that if he sees him or tries to speak to him, Colm with go on a binge of self-mutilation. A ridiculous gauntlet to throw down since the village is the size of a postage stamp and they frequent the pub around the same time. So unless Padraic literally sells his home and moves away, avoiding each other is impossible.The film - already a slog - then descends into a further despairing pit of unwatchable nonsense. It is obvious early on that Colm is psychotic and needs to be locked up for his own safety and the potential danger he holds to those in the village. By the time he starts hacking off parts of his body (a self-defeating endeavor given a musician would need things like fingers) and flinging them on neighbors doorsteps, the film becomes completely ludicrous. When Padraic's beloved pet donkey - and ostensibly only other friend - chokes to death on one of the Colm's severed body parts, then film rockets further into pointless cruelty.I get that this is 1920s Ireland and the mental health system was not the best, but they did have asylums for people like Colm and the reactions of the villagers to Colm's behavior strains credibility. By the time the hacking starts, you know even then that someone would have come and taken Colm away to be restrained.Full disclosure is that I did not watch the film all the way to the end because it had become so repellent and the characters so loathsome or stupid by the 3/4ths mark that unless there was some epiphany, the film was a waste of time. I gather from speaking to those that did finish it, that its downward spiral does not get arrested and the film ends on a depressing note with a message that seems to denigrate kindness, friendship and love as nothing worth aspiring towards.The only other plot of note centers on Barry Keoghan as the village idiot, who adores Padriac's sister Kerry Condon. Everyone ostensibly cannot stand him, but put up with him because his dad is the local constable and lives to bully him and make his life hell. FUN!I will give credit where it is due. The scenery is lovely. Farrell does his best with the lead role, even when it stops making sense. The ill-fated donkey was cute.Of the remaining cast, Keoghan pretty much rambles his way through the stock village idiot role. Critics have invented superlatives for Condon's acting, but she is shoe-horned into the cliched role of the long-suffering Irish woman trying to be the voice of reason and empathy to a bunch of brutal and dumb men. She does nothing new here that has not been done by legions of other actresses that preceded her. Gleeson is dreadful. The character makes no sense and has no dimension. He is a cruel nut and Gleeson does nothing with the part. Then again, who could possibly find anything of worth in this role.I have nothing against tragic films or films that end on a downbeat note. But (especially after the three years of hell that the world at large has endured) that tragedy needs to be earned and Banshees does not earn it. Everything bit of misery documented herein is self-induced and tiresome. The characters are ill-defined or pitched on one strident note and become more unsympathetic and hateful as the film progresses. The film is not funny or profound or insightful. Quite the contrary, it seems to be under the impression that relentless and often nonsensical bleakness translates into some form of greatness. It really troubles me how many people are buying into that foolishness.",

The film comes to life as a result.The subject matter is quite odd - so odd that the film depends on acting rather than storyline to succeed. Two friends meet and go the local pub each day at 2 pm. One day one of them has had enough of the tedious routine as well as his friend, who he has deemed 'too dull'. They engage in a battle of wits and one-upmanship leading to the climax. By this time the story has lost its humor and charm and becomes a vendetta, thereby negating its main assets.The Irish countryside is gorgeous and adds immeasurably to the films value, along with the ingrained sense of humor of the townsfolk - unintentionally funny and blunt. Sometimes I think writers don't know how to end their story, and this may be one example.7/10 - Website no longer prints my star rating.",

            "content": "First off, i didnt casually stumble into a cinema showing this film; i know who Gleeson is and would not have missed it for the world.(to be honest, i had been left wanting for more since The Tragedy of MacBeth)Banshees Of Inisherin is, in media res, the story of of one person out of a couple of friends (Gleeson) who decides he isn't friends with the other no more.Being this a isolated Irish island in the 1920s, the other (Farrell) wants to know why.Now, despite what IMDb may think, this film is *not* a comedy. This very early section may seem vaguely farcical at the very first, making you think it's gonna go down as one of those light comedies \"how will the good simple man win back this friendship? With the Power Of His Heart !\" but, nah, nowhere near.No, we are not a long walk away from Gleeson's character starting to mutilate himself. This film got GORE, and not even the splatter kind that you can laugh at.As the .. ugh .. \"script\" progresses, Gleeson and Farrell fight over Gleeson's unwillingness to concede, and Farrell incapability to understand. But, the film doesn't have a moral, doesnt have a point to make about, idk, pick any topic already done a million times, the inevitability of death, the desire to leave a mark on the world, the importance of friendship, whatever.And neither character has the means to help this point appear. Because Farrell isn't a man with a heart of gold, he's just a moron. And Gleeson isn't a poet, he's delusional. They are both bad, but not bad and damned, just bad and mediocre.Unfortunately there is no acting, no photography that can hold up when you script is this weak.You can't just throw a cloak on an old lady and have her cosplay as Death from Seventh Seal, and call it art.About halfway through, this film reminded me of another film i didn't like, but, i have to now consider that the other film Hrutar (2015) was better. Two brothers, no longer on speaking terms, are forced to swallow their pride and rejoin as a family due to the hardships of life.Yeeah, Banshees doesn't even have that. It's got nothing.My vote: for being competently filmed and with, you know, spectacular acting, 5.5/10 - the script is terrible.",

In the age of social media it's everyday bigger the need to \"fit in\" with the rest of the flock, so many pinch their nose and walk through the stench. So we have this hugely hyped, and awarded, movie that we must like. I really wanted to do it. Then I found the detective from Mr Mercedes doing the same part minus the badge, Farrell completely miscasted reminding me of a Joey Tribiani without his sandwich jokes, and the rest bleak and depressing as they come. I am sure that is what that director wanted to achieve, and hey, mission brilliantly accomplished. Gleason cuts his hand without any reason and it's never explained. The whole movie it's just a waste of time. Maybe there is a message that not Irish people can't receive, it might be. I loved these guys in the other movie that made together, \"In Bruges\", but here there is nothing of that magic. It is a small movie that without the hype and watched in a little essay cinema might have a sense and a place. With the the trumpets and and the lights of Golden Globes much, much less.",

He is the emotional heart of the film and he brilliantly made me feel empathy with his character. I thought his performance was an absolute masterclass\n2) As is the case with all good works of art, I have certainly been thinking a lot about it after seeing it. The deeper meanings and the messages of the film have been playing on my mind a lot in the 24 hours since I saw the film\n3) The second half of the film is certainly much better than the first. There is a film almost exactly halfway through where Farrell's character gets drunk on Whisky and confronts Gleeson in the pub; this scene is easily the best in the film and felt like a turning point for me\n4) It is a top quality production with superb music and cinematographyNEGATIVES:1) The first half of the film was painfully slow and really didn't add up to enough to justify having such a slow build up\n2) As the title of this review states, I love McDonagh and all 3 of his previous films. They all have incredibly precise and perfectly written scripts. This film, however, felt wandering and aimless and by the end I felt as though so much of the execution of certain themes could have been better. There was no satisfactory resolution between Farrell and Gleeson nor any proper explanation for Gleeson's actions. There are glimmers of Gleeson's humanity still being present, such as when he helps Farrell after he is beaten up by the policeman, but every moment of humanity is followed by a contradictory moment of madness of him cutting his fingers off. Whilst I felt great sympathy for Farrell's character, Gleeson's character just annoyed me and made no sense to me. If he's so passionate about only wanting to focus on making a piece of music that he'll be remembered for, why is his seemingly only sacrifice to cut off Farrell? He still goes to the pub all the time? And why does he cut his fingers off and make himself incapable of playing the music he wants to be remembered for?3) The character of Dominic was just a complete waste of time.",

Who in the world would vow to cut off his fingers if Farrell/Padraic spoke to him again and actually go through with it and cut off all fingers and thumb of his hand??? No way!

However, I found myself too bored to care. The story at face value was so simple and straightforward that it just didn't hit me on a personal level. I kept waiting for a payoff that never came and the story ironically just stayed dull. It's a breakup story set on a rural island full of miserable people who are stuck in a depression spiral...yeesh. The acting was good, the setting was unique and the direction was solid. I'm seeing some notes on great cinematography though? I don't really think so. Ultimately, this was a quality-made film whose message is not at all thought-provoking as it thinks it is (from my point of view). People need healthy social interaction. Also, some people are better off living in certain types of communities than others in would likely be happier if they found a good fit for themselves. Like yeah...I know.",

Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson do not deliver memorable performances here - their characters are poorly written, so it's hard for them to bring them to life. Barry Keoghan is also pitiful to watch as Dominic, the island's dunce, although Kerry Condon stands out as Siobhan, the disgruntled sister of Farrell's Padraic.There are also just unnecessarily gross scenes, which are probably meant to be funny...but they do not land.

The ones the critics love but in a few years time, people will be scratching their heads wondering what all the fuss was about.Set in the early 1920s. Ireland is tearing itself apart with a civil war, wanting independence from Britain.In a small island of the coast, P\u00e1draic (Colin Farrell) finds his best friend, Colm (Brendan Gleeson) has made his own bid for independence. He no longer wants to talk to P\u00e1draic as he is a bore and life is short. Colm wants to produce music, leave something artistic behind. Inane chatter is not part of the deal.This comes as a shock to the dimwitted P\u00e1draic. His life in the island is his sister Siobh\u00e1n (Kerry Condon) his miniature donkey Jenny and Colm.He cannot believe that Colm would abandon him and thinks it is a joke. Colm is not joking and begins to cut off his fingers each time P\u00e1draic speaks to him.This is a black farce. Maybe it is an allegory of the Irish civil war or about mental illness or toxic masculinity.There is a sadistic cop who constantly beats his simpleton son Dominic (Barry Keoghan.) He also picks on P\u00e1draic for giving shelter to his son.By the end P\u00e1draic realises he is on his own. His sister has gone to the mainland, his donkey has died, he finally fathoms that his relationship with Colm is toxic. By which point Colm has no digits left in one of his hands. No wonder he had to give up the fiddle.The film is bleakly funny, the acting is good. It is a small scale film but I felt cut off by it.

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. IN BRUGES is a cinematic litmus test. It turns out, whether someone is a fan of that movie or not is a particularly dependable indicator of similar or disparate tastes in dark comedy material. For me, it's a film I never tire of ... whether re-watching in its entirety or catching just a few scenes while surfing. The plot is bleak, yet we laugh. The characters are sad, yet we are charmed. It's the perfect blend of character, story, and setting ... and proves how exceptional and precise screenwriting can be. So why am I writing so much about a movie from 2008? Well, that film's writer-director, Martin McDonagh, is back, and he's brought along that film's co-stars, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson.Now don't think this is yet another in the endless stream of Hollywood sequels. It's not. These are (much) different characters in a (much) different setting. What does remain the same is the onscreen magic when Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson collaborate with writer-director McDonagh. It's how some singers are meant to sing one song (Sinatra belting \"New York, New York\"), or how some athletes are tied to a particular team (Sandy Koufax to the Dodgers). These three talented men are at their best when working together.Padraic (Farrell) and Colm (Gleeson) have been best buddies for most of their lives. Every day at 2:00, Padraic fetches Colm and they head to the pub. One could set their watch by this. That all changes one day when Colm refuses to answer the door when his pal knocks. Later that day, he informs Padraic that they are no longer friends, as he refuses to waste another moment drowning in inane conversation, and instead will focus on fiddle music and living his life to the fullest. Padraic is shook and confused ... as are the bartender and the other folks in this quaint (fictional) seaside village in coastal Ireland. There is a certain symmetry with the civil war playing out on the mainland and this break in a friendship. A crack about not knowing why the sides are fighting in the war adds yet more symmetry as Padraic searches for meaning in the rift.When Colm finally tells Padraic that he doesn't like him anymore and he doesn't want his old friend speaking a word to him, we initially understand and agree with his reasoning, even if it seems a bit harsh. Padraic is a bit of a bore - a man satisfied with his work as a milk farmer and spending off hours petting Jenny, his pet donkey, before blowing a couple more hours chatting at the pub, and ultimately retiring to the tiny cottage he shares with his erudite sister Siobhan (a superb Kerry Condon, \"Better Call Saul\", \"Ray Donovan\"). Dull, dim, not a thinker ... all descriptions of Padraic we hear, though his self-reflection finds a gentle, kind soul - mostly harmless and enjoying his daily life. Well, that is, right up until his best friend locks him out.The interactions between Padraic and Colm are fascinating to watch. The two actors play off each other so well, we find ourselves hoping they will be together on screen without a break. It's here where McDonagh's script really shines. Ms. Condon as Siobhan and Barry Keoghan (DUNKIRK, THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER, 2017) as Dominic both play significant roles (as does Jenny the miniature donkey). What initially seems like commentary on a shattered friendship between two men expands significantly thanks to these two characters. It reminds us that our network, regardless of how small, has an impact on others, even on a remote island in Ireland. The script and actors blend here to drive home the point.Siobhan begins to question her own existence and how she might pursue her own dreams. Local boy Dominic is the son of an abusive policeman, and his troubles seem to run deeper than just being the town oddball. He likely has mental issues, yet occasionally shows flashes of hyper-awareness. He befriends Padraig after the split, and his unconventional personality never quite sits well with others. When Dominic's own dream gets shot down, he doesn't possess the capacity to handle it well. The story and the island sustain tragedies, both small and large, and to top it off, there is a creepy old woman in the village who has visions of death.Once we have settled into the drum beat of the split between Padraig and Colm, McDonagh raises the stakes, bringing an unusual form of violence into the proceedings. This catches us and Padraig and the whole of the village off guard, and makes for a stunning visual and eye-opening shock. There is no way to go into further detail without spoilers that should not be conveyed. What you need to know is that this is expert filmmaking, superb screenwriting, and the best acting of Colin Farrell's career ... leading the way for other excellent performances. Facing one's own mortality is never easy, and we can each relate to Colm's search for meaning as he sees time slipping away. The film also treats us to the best ever confessional scene, and more frequent uses of the word \"fecking\" than we've ever experienced. The beauty of the island is shown, but never featured. Instead, McDonagh does what he does best - delivers memorable characters and dialogue and unforgettable surprises. He also makes us wonder if our laughter is socially acceptable, causing us to be thankful for the dark theater.Opening wide in theaters on November 4, 2022.",

The film doesn't catch your interest and the plot is also not surprising as it is not a strong story.All in all, I was very disappointed with this movie, but maybe it was because I expected too much from it, but I didn't see what I wanted to see.",

The plot is ludicrous and thin as a wafer, the acting wooden and forced, there is no character evolving (or character writing in the firs place), they are all dumb or psychotic, or both and that's that. The movie is too long because after the first 20 minutes, a discerning movie fan knows the outcome, the gimmicks and the message.

But what I don't get is the high revery for a pretty, but middling movie. What kills it for me is the B.o.I.'s glacial pacing. It is so slow, so much nothing happens and it's so repetitive. When the movie attempted to go weird, it doesn't feel earned cause the level of insanity is never really established. The accents feel way too over the top and heavy, and for a dark comedy, very few of the comedy lands. By the end, I was more bored than I was invested.

The irony of the film being so dull is that the whole point of the film is that a man (Brendan Gleeson) who suffers with depression stops talking to his friend (Colin Farrell) because he says he finds him too dull. Half an hour in, and that's it. Colin continues to speak to Brendan, so Brendan threatens to chop off his fingers if his dull friend Colin continues to speak to him. Colin speaks to him, so Brendan chops off a finger. The village idiot tries to befriend Colin & chat up his sister. Colin speaks to Brendan again, so he chops a load more fingers off. Well that's an hour gone! Colins's sister moves away and his lovely little donkey chokes to death on one of Brendan's discarded fingers, so Colin decides to set fire to Brendan's house the following day, saying that he'll do it whether Brendan is inside or not- which is exactly what he does. The village idiot is found drowned. Brendan leaves the house whilst it is going up in flames, and Colin find him alive and well (well, apart from the numerous missing fingers) the next day. And that's your lot!This was not only one of the dullest but the most miserable films I have ever seen and if it hadn't been for my husband leaving it on until the end there's no way I'd have wasted an hour and a half of my life on this rubbish.

The core story arc of a lifelong friendship being terminated has so much potential for psychological nuance but not here.

While both start morosely into their pints of Guinness.On the upside the Irish seaside looks wonderful (although I don't know how they managed to find so many days without rain), the dialogue brogue charming and the acting solid.

            "content": "The latest film from Martin McDonagh, and given how good his track record has been, I was really looking forward to this one. After seeing it, I think I'd put it a little behind In Bruges and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (not by much) and ahead of Seven Psychopaths.Like most of his films, it blends very dark comedy with very heavy subject matter, and here, the two are balanced exceptionally well. The premise is also an intriguing one that despite its simplicity, hasn't been attempted by many other films (to my knowledge). Essentially, there are two close friends, and one of them decides he doesn't want to be friends with the other. The other naturally protests, with the first friend then threatening severe consequences if he continues to try and rekindle the friendship (or even talk to him).There are hilarious scenes, really emotionally devastating scenes, and some scenes that do both at once. I think that overall, the best part of the film is its screenplay, as it balances the comedy and drama brilliantly, features exceptionally well written dialogue, and creates solid characters who you get to know well throughout the film. It helps that the acting is also great, especially Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson in the lead roles.There are a couple of minor side characters whose inclusion I didn't think added much, and the final act is a bit oddly structured. The ending is also one I'll need to sit with a bit, because it did leave me with an unusual feeling.Returning to this film again may well improve it, as despite the simple premise, there's a ton going on here, and a great deal to think about it. The themes surrounding hate, fear of loneliness, a societal divisions, and the difficulty of forgiveness all feel very relevant to the 2020s, even while this film is set in the 1920s. In the end, I'm happy to rate it a strong 8/10 for now, and I wouldn't be surprised if I felt compelled to give it higher if/when I give it another watch.",

Now dark and macabre can work in a setting which is slightly off kilter but this is set in a very real time (1920's Irish Civil War) and a very real looking community so the events just do not work, not on any level. The two principal players give fine performances, Gleeson's is a bit of a riff on his Calvary character, but Farrell makes his character's bewilderment and anger very believable. Fine support is also forthcoming from Kerry Condon & Barry Keoghan but none of this helps a plotline which is totally unbelievable, medically impossible and thoroughly depressing. Much has been made of how this is a parable about the Irish civil war or a commentary on toxic masculinity, it's not, someone came up with a bizarre central theme and then clothed it in normality to make it seem like art.

Beautiful music, stunning cinematography, some lovely comedy and an intriguing story about companionship on a tiny island in 1923. Thirty minutes in, I was well and truly hooked. This was shaping up to be a classic.And then....boom! It all gets rather silly. Fiddle-playing Gleason makes a big speech about how important his music is to him, then starts cutting his fingers off to try and stop Colin Farrell from talking to him. Eh? Who would do that? This barbaric self -mutilation would be unbelievably painful and probably lead to a massive infection. But no, he carries on stoically as if he'd over-trimmed his fingernails.Continuing the madness, Colin Farrell still doesn't \"get it\" and decides to burn Gleason's house down regardless of whether he's inside or not. Gleason miraculously escapes the flames and the two of them mumble some incoherent nonsense to each other the following morning. THE END.What a shame.

You will find the acting skills of Farrell and Gleeson again, but you will be left waiting minute after minute for the humour to burst out. It never does.The cinema audience had a few chuckles, which frankly felt forced because we were all invested in making this humorous to justify our love of McDonagh, to validate the hype, to not feel we're missing something. We are all post-graduates so we're aware of our Shakespeare comedies and tragedies (see other reviews) - and we were all left VERY disappointed.This is a mis-billed film and the trailer heavily implies another dark comedy that you'll find once you watch the full film. In reality, it's nothing but darkness, slowness, and a teaser to wrack your brains into working out what the heck the point was.The best I can do is say it's an allusion to rural living pre modern age, when our grandparents would tell stories of their parents and neighbours who bore grudges, and over generations in the pubs the stories became ever more fanciful with the telling, so that in the end we never really know the truth.",

But this one...good God! OK, I understand an absurd situation, I can understand that each of us have our own strangeness and moods, I can accept that Colm just decided to cut ties with Padraic just like that. I can even accept that because of cultural differences and a different mindset in different eras, I might miss some part of the message in this movie. The act of cutting his own fingers, as extreme as it is, represents the pinnacle of the extreme reactions someone might take, a price to pay to be left alone. But at the same time it seems so unnecessary, so pointless, so uninteresting. Siobhan's act of leaving to find a new life, that old crone, the dead donkey...it's all too much.I felt like I was watching something so weird and bad that it makes you want to watch more hoping to find a meaning.It's like a car crash, you can't look away.I get that it's the kind of movie that you either love it, or hate it. I can accept the existence of this movie. But when it starts receiving awards and praises, you start questioning everyone's sanity, your own included. Am I the crazy one, or they are? It's like watching the naked emperor, but you also notice that the emperor also forgot to take his sanity pills.I was reluctant at first at writing this review...but I couldn't help myself.

Animals die or are endangered by human carelessness. Friendships dissolve. Love is unrequited. And the future is bleak. Like I said, sad.But sadness should be in the service of something more. There should be something for the viewer to take away beyond the fact that life can be, and often is, sad. And I wish that were the case with 'Banshees', but unfortunately it is not. This is sadness for its own sake. Add sad music. Add a rock-strewn island off the coast of 1923 Ireland. Add wind and cold. And what you have is - and excuse the use of this word - a real 'downer'.Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell play old friends who are suddenly, inexplicably, on the 'outs'. And it is this ruptured relationship that triggers a series of terrible events that seems to have no borders, no end. And, well .... that's it.Following the viewing of the film I researched other critics' takes on the production. I could not believe my own interpretation. Was there something I missed? And I'd like to tell you that, yes, there was. But there wasn't.That said, If life is not going great for you and you're in need of a couple of hours of even sadder sadness (to put things in clearer perspective), you might try 'Banshees of Inisherin'.",

But, in the end, it is no inconvenience to drink it all in, as the sad story of a failed friendship is played out against the backdrop of an indifferent natural world.So, it's 10/10 for a masterpiece of writing, superb performances, and -- except for those minor Malickisms, tactful and sensitive direction.As the Irish Civil War blasts and rages on the mainland, different kinds of struggle take place in the lives of four islanders. The emotional journeys are charted with exceptional compassion and skill by Brendan Gleeson, Colin Farrell, Kerry Kondon and Barry Keoghan. Farrell in particular, in the role of a lifetime, moves believably and poignantly from skin to stone in the course of couple of unforgettable cinematic hours:The supporting cast boasts several treats, my favourite being the venerable Sheila Flitton, enjoying herself hugely as Mrs McCormick, one of those people we go out of our way to avoid.",

An hour and fifty three minutes to be exact. The location is beautiful and the acting was decent. Life's an existential quagmire.

Gleeson provides absolutely zero reasons for his decision other than that Ferrell is \"dull\".The incomprehensible and gratuitous use of self mutilation is revolting. No set up, no explanation, it is grotesque and pandering.In fairness, Stef liked it a bit more (she gives it a 4) claiming that it is about isolation and how people react to it- some leave, some go mad, and some go silent.

That film takes the piss out of the fawning cult of high dining, especially the bread dish with no bread. Charge people enough and they will eat dirt and love it.

Instead, it keeps showing how people can be so insane and life in a small isolated island can be so dull and depressing.I think both main characters are just too weird. Maybe one is too lonely and the other one is just too confused in himself. If a friend decides not to be your friend anymore (although the reason was too mean but it is understandable), you should not keep trying to bug that person anymore, especially when he is crazy enough to cut off his fingers to chase you away from his life. And what kind of person would really do that just to show...I want you away from my life? Only crazy person does that! So, there are too crazy insane men on the island, there is one woman who can't stand the whole insanity of them anymore and move away, there is one poor boy who is hearbroken, abused by his father, and end up dead. There is a witch-like old woman who keeps walking around that saying that the future of the island is bleak. I was thinking...Gosh, what am I watching? And there is no answer, no solution, nothing at the end. The only nleasant thing about the film is that all the farm animals are friendly and the people there treat them so well. But that's all. I don't see any worthwhile theme of this film. I can't help thinking those who love it must have some kind of sarcastic nature or hidden darkness in themselves.

However, as Colm's resolve only strengthens, he soon delivers an ultimatum that leads to shocking consequences......With The Banshees of Inisherin, expect the unexpected, because it slowly begins to boil halfway through the film, and it doesn't let up until the end. It's a simple set up, but in the hands of Mcdonagh, and two amazing performances from Farrell and Gleeson, this is one of the most triumphant films of the year.It starts off simple enough, one friend says to another that he doesn't like him anymore, which is straight to the point, but a little baffling to P\u00e1draic. Even more so when Colm doesn't give him an explanation. And then because their is no real rationale, the tension mounts up, not severely, but there is a hint of an unnerving air about the film, and you begin to dread when the two cross paths, especially considering what Colm will do if P\u00e1draic speak to him again.The tension gets cut up though by moments of pure hilarity, you never thought you'd laugh at the words bread van, but this had me laughing out loud. But it breaks the tension only slightly, because you know that there will be consequences because of the actions.So should P\u00e1draic be at cause rather than effect?You'd like to think so, but in the same breath, you are thinking why should he? The explanation as to why he doesn't want to speak to him isn't satisfying enough for P\u00e1draic or the audience, but that's the only rationale he gets.The film is very touching in places, just because Colm isn't talking to him, it doesn't mean he cares, and this shows in one sequence, and it's a really warming part, to a very cold film.The performances are wonderful from everyone, and this has to be in a lot of peoples top tens of the year, because Mcdonagh has made yet another fabulous piece of work that is warm and funny, but at the same time, tense and bleak, with an air of despair about it.....",

I never cared about either of the main protagonists, just disturbed by their actions, by the finger cutting and the stalking both of which seemed absurd. Some critics have pointed to absurdist drama like Waiting for Godot as a reference but I don't think that works. Godot speaks to universal themes and there are no big themes in this film, just a miserable island full of miserable people (despite the few mildly comic moments) behaving irrationally and self destructing.If it's supposed to be an allegory on the centuries of bloody conflict in Ireland then I think the film is being very patronising. Conflicts don't arise out of nothing and they're usually not irrational however horrible they may be. For the allegory to work we don't need a lesson in Irish history but we do need to be taken on the journey from friendship to bloody conflict and care about the damage and hurt. In this case, far from caring I was left frustrated, wondering what on earth the characters were doing! And all I could come up with was that they were probably just being used to make an allegory.Regarding production values and scenery, yes they're great as many people have noted but these days, so what? There's more than enough money and technology for that. What is much harder to find in a serious film is good writing and a story that wil make you see the world at least a little differently than when you walked into the cinema.",

By rooting the action so firmly in a real time and place, with characters one is supposed to accept as realistic, the fantastical events felt detached from the context.It all felt like a pointless attempt at being clever.

Martins's directing gives us atmosphere and a brooding sense of the lonely but intense whilst still belonging feeling of living in a small community.Historically it is also superb; even the film's title is clever and apt. Boy, this should have been a 10/10 for me all day long. It kicks off well; we are confused yet want to learn why Colm dislikes his friend. Did he discover that Padraic was having sex with his sister since the way they live together, and often historically, that would have been wrong enough? Perhaps Colm secretly loves the sister in the mix at the same time too? Or perhaps it was because Colm has to leave to fight in the war and / or has a secret that he needs to keep from Padraic?I sat with baited breathe.Then discovered no. He decides that his mate is just boring. Then to make his point his cuts his fingers off one at a time and then his mate gets pissed off and tries to kill him, we think, by burning down his house. Now I may have that bit wrong because I switched off after the first finger was chopped off.I mean what the heck was that all about? The film just becomes the worst two things possible, horrible dark and horrible boring.I poured myself an Irish whiskey and sang Molly Malone and went off to watch something that didn't both break my heart and leave me wanting to sit in the dark depressed.Martin please come back with something better for us. Please.",

Beautiful cliffs, vast green landscapes and the elements in a fictitious island backdrop of Inisherin supposing circa 1923 or so, but then the characters come in and the movie feels like watching children reason or at least try to. The story felt ridiculous, sort of reminiscent in a way like \"Fargo\" - in how pathetic the whole fiasco was. A stir up for the point of stirring if anything else. No one but the sister character seems to have much sense in the bumpkin town. Hard to give it weight as a fooI's tragedy; can't really recommend it though it wasn't quite bad either with some entertaining moments 6/10.",

Barry is the glue that holds this film and all of its elements together. His character, Dominic has the elements, but Barry's performance may be one of the greatest of all time.This must see film has you at the edge of your seat in anticipation with one eye shut, makes you laugh; feel the loneliness that the characters are feeling and the love and heartbreak of both man and beast.",

The characters are all simpletons -- well duh, that's the point! Their actions in the later parts of the movie are unrealistic -- well duh, it's a metaphor for the war! And so on. So how does one get around this?I think the punchline is that it ultimately doesn't matter whether it's part of the point; the only thing that matters is the viewing experience. And for me, that experience was one I could do without.I think the part that bothers me the most (aside from the fact that this kind of self-harm disturbs me on a visceral level) is the unreasonableness of Cole. I'm here for the premise and even for taking drastic measures, but not after two days. Have a bit more patience, and if your former friend still bothers you after a month, then you can cut off your finger. And don't start by ignoring him out of nowhere. This behavior is just so incredibly childish.And again, you can say Cole isn't meant to be reasonable, and that's fine, but then, what emotional connection am I meant to have to this film? Who am I supposed to be rooting for? It sure isn't P\u00e1draic, who is, in fact, exceedingly dull. The only tolerable person in this entire movie is Siobh\u00e1n, and for what it's worth, I did like her.Perhaps I'm not supposed to be rooting for anyone, but if that's the case, I don't know why I would watch this movie. The stuff that happens is not entertaining enough to keep me interested, it's mostly dull or gruesome, neither of which is interesting. The best I can say about it is that some parts are very funny, and they're funny in a pretty unique way. But ultimately, the movie just left a sour taste behind; it succeeded in making me feel things, but they're not things I want to feel.",

Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell were in top form and I'll probably always watch any movie in which they have a lead. Kerry Condon made me think \"Why isn't she in much more?\" and Barry Keoghan remains one of the most riveting actors on screen. Beyond the performances, the film is beautifully shot and the dialogue is often hilarious (though I recommend subtitles for anyone who isn't actually from Ireland!).But good god, this movie gets darker and darker and more depressing as the minutes tick by and, worst of all, it left me confused. I read Alexis Potter's excellent review in the Arizona Republic and learned that the story is an allegory for the Irish Civil War. That's cool, I guess, but it was lost on this guy and sans that knowledge and background going in, I was left feeling like I spent 2 hours with a small group of drunk, depressed, unkind people who's struggles go unresolved.",

Colin and Brendan play 2 life long friends living on an island off the coast of Ireland during the 1920's. One day, Brendan tells Colin that he doesn't like him anymore and wants Colin to never talk to him again-which is kind of hard to do on an island. They both go to the same pub everyday and Colin tries to talk to Brendan and find out what he has done but Brendan tells him he is just tired of him. Colin keeps at him until Brendan gives him an ultimatum; If Colin talks to him again, Brendan will cut off a finger, each time he does. This is where the stubbornness comes in. Will Colin keep talking to Brendan or will Brendan actually start cutting off his own fingers? Oh yeah, Brendan is a fiddler and really needs his fingers. Kerry plays Colin's sister and Barry is a friend to both Colin and Brendan. FYI: A Banshee is a ghost like figure from Irish folklore that usually screams and forebodes a death. In the movie, The Banshees of Inisherin is the name of a song that Brendan plays on his fiddle.It's rated R for language, violence and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be alright as a rental.",

I watched this because it's getting a lot of rave reviews and it's also predicted to be nominated for Best Picture in the Oscars. Also, I do love McDonagh's Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.The film has a simple plot line. Set in Ireland in 1923 during the Irish Civil War on an isolated community, a man named Colm suddenly gives his best friend Padraic the cold shoulder. Padraic begs to know why his former best friend doesn't talk to him anymore.Aside from that, I think the movie also explores loneliness and depression in a sleepy village where everyone knows about everyone.It's supposed to have some comedic elements, but honestly I haven't really laughed much. The story turned more interesting though when Colm literally cut his fingers. I didn't expect that. But they never explained why though. I also wish they explained more why Colm suddenly didn't talk to Padraic. I mean, just because he's boring?? Really?? And he had to literally freakin cut his fingers too? Why?? It just didn't make sense, at least for me anyway. Or maybe there's a deeper reason but I just didn't get it because maybe I'm not a deep thinker enough kind of person. Maybe Padraic really is depressed or has some mental health issues or whatever. The ending of this movie is unsatisfying.Fantastic acting though, everyone was amazing. I'm sure Farrell and Gleeson will be nominated for Oscars. I was particularly impressed by Farrell. Superb acting, the cinematography is beautiful as well.

Okay, sounds kinda interesting on paper. But Martin McDonagh's film is painful to watch.For one, it's hard to find any real humor here. I didn't so much as crack a smile once throughout the 116 minutes. Yes, the story is supposed to be dark, but it's dark in an unironic way. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson do not deliver memorable performances here - their characters are poorly written, so it's hard for them to bring them to life. Barry Keoghan is also pitiful to watch as Dominic, the island's dunce, although Kerry Condon stands out as Siobhan, the disgruntled sister of Farrell's Padraic.There are also just unnecessarily gross scenes, which are probably meant to be funny...but they do not land. Even though I have Ireland in my blood, I just didn't get the humor here.Yes, 'The Banshees of Inisherin' will go on to win many more awards, but just because \"everyone\" says a film is good, it doesn't mean you have to like it yourself.\"",

So why even have it? What's the point? Where can any actor go with that?This is a story about fear of mediocrity, fear of success, fear of failure. A calico quilt of quirky people, contentedly hiding from life. On an island only a boat ride away from possibilities that could change their dark outlooks on life in a heartbeat.WHY didn't we see any of that? Why didn't McDonagh explore that instead of making us WAIT...and WAIT...and WADE through a thin, DARK, depressing, bland goulash of words?Aye it was a treat for the eyes. The cinematography was stunning.The acting was top notch by all.Which is what makes it so sad.Viewers will walk away from this film extolling its \"greatness,\" but when you scratch the surface and get down to the origins of that \"greatness\" you may be left with the question, was it really great?Have we become comfortable with supporting/lauding/honoring/awarding mediocrity?So many stones were left unturned.NO exploration of the meat of this story were ever given their moments. This travesty made it painful to sit through.Brendan Gleason a strong and brilliant actor, he should have fought for more in this role.He should have stood up to the \"golden boy who can do no wrong\" and asked, \"what's the point?\" \"There are gaps as wide as the Grand Canyon here, and they deserve to be closed.\"Tragically, Gleason didn't... no one did.",

            "content": "The movie is basically a buddy flick about a close friendship gone sour. The acting and scenery are great, but the story leaves much to be desired.Brendon Gleeson and Colin Ferrell live in a small town set long ago. They lived at a time when Pub culture was still going, and men were allowed to socialize regularly . Suddenly and without explanation, Gleeson decides to end the friendship. Ferrell is understandably upset, and demands explanation , yet Gleeson refuses to give him one . The story unfolds around this somewhat weak premise.Ferrell is friends with the town idiot, and it surfaces that father of said idiot is abusive. The story is both a sad reflection and statement about male friendship in our world today. They have the obligatory scene where they make it clear that the friendship is entirely platonic. This device was unnecessary in films made decades ago, yet in films made recently they seem to have to rub our noses in it. In addition , the innuendo about sexual abuse of the idiot was unnecessary and offensive. Not only was it not very credible in the context , but may be part of the reason they have to pay adult men to work in the \" Big Brother \" program, as men are rightfully afraid of an allegation of abuse . It also sent the message that the state of simply \"being naked\" was abusive, and may be one of many reasons we now have many grown men afraid to use a locker room.The ending of the story was the only good part, as it was a surprise and the writers didn't chicken out. However, they could have written a good story about friendship going south with some realistic moving parts like we have in real life. It was a missed opportunity to examine male friendship realistically and sadly correlates with the data showing men have less close friends today than their grandfathers did. Maybe guys would have more friends if they made more movies that didn't mention sex, as the vast majority of male friendships don't have any.",

            "content": "Quiet, softly spoken dramedy that ventures into darker and more sombre territory as the runtime wears on, writer/director Martin McDonagh's newest venture that reunites his In Bruges leading men Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, is a worthy Oscar frontrunner that allows its mastermind further chances to shine on the big stage while giving its lead ensemble a solid chance at cleaning up their respective categories at many a major awards ceremony.Set in 1923 during one of the various Irish civil wars that was taking place at that time, with The Banshees of Inisherin McDonagh transports us to the small island of Inisherin where two long time friends, Farrell's kindly but simple P\u00e1draic S\u00failleabh\u00e1in and Gleeson's moody and contemplative music loving Colm Doherty, find themselves at an awkward impasse when Colm lets P\u00e1draic know that he no longer wants to be friends with him, making waves in their small community and throwing the two polar opposite souls into a whirlwind of long lasting consequences and life changing moments.As has been the case with his previous works that includes the slightly off the boil Seven Psychopaths and the brilliantly realised Oscar winning Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, McDonagh's innate ability with words and drawing out strong performances is on show again here with Banshees arguably his most well-rounded feature yet that is is wonderfully captured by DOP Ben Davis and scored by frequent Coen brothers collaborator Carter Burwell, combining with the on-song cast to give audiences one of the the most complete cinematic packages that was delivered in 2022.Running hot over the last few years in one of the most impressive career comebacks of the modern era, Banshee's gives Colin Farrell his best chance yet at Oscar glory with a fantastically layered character in P\u00e1draic.Standing out amongst a talented cast, Farrell is as good as his ever been as the sincere and insecure local farmer and being supported by Gleeson, the glowing Kerry Condon as P\u00e1draic's long-suffering sister Siobh\u00e1n and a scene-stealing Barry Keoghan as local village trouble maker Dominic Kearney allows the well-liked Hollywood actor a perfect platform to showcase his talents with Banshees a genuine chance to see its four main performers sweep in a rare acting category bonanza come the soon to be held Academy Awards.As much of a pleasure as it is to see McDonagh at work once more, his actors ply their trades and enjoy a film that is unpredictable and entirely unique, it's hard too know if Banshee's metaphorical narrative and somewhat unresolved finale will work for all as there is likely to be a not so insignificant amount of audiences that don't connect with this character driven tale the way in which others will lap up every minute and at days end Banshees may be a joy to watch unfold for most but its not a film filled with deep or long-lasting impressions.Final Say -A film that is likely to find itself on the Oscar main stage in multiple facets, The Banshees of Inisherin offers up an acting/writing masterclass that in turn produces one of the most original and interesting films of the last few years.4 1/2 bread vans out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",

I've read many a review here praising the acting but Gleeson and Farrell but both look old and tired and fail dismally to rekindle the In Bruges flame. The standout performance comes from Kerry Condon however she has the distinct advantage of playing a character with a kernel of truth to it. The rest of the characters are generic Irish avatars, the publican, the priest, the nosey shop keeper, the brutal copper and yes the brutal copper's idiot son. I'll give it points for some beautiful atmospheric scenery but to be honest you'd have to be a charmless nerd to make rural Ireland look bad.

And the main characters... Oh, my.You may start out liking Farrell's character and having some sympathy for him being ghosted by his best mate, but by the time you're half way through the film you've realized he's just selfish and self-centered and has no feelings for anyone but himself, and perhaps his donkey. And Gleeson's character is so self-destructively depressed, the ending of the film actually ends up being an unexpected and rather stupid twist in the tale...After hacking off all his fingers and rendering himself incapable of playing the violin he'd supposedly cut off ties to Farrel's character to explore, you'd have expected him to jump at the chance of his ex-mate burning him to death in his own house, but instead he somehow returns to normal and is all \"sorry mate, let's be friends again\" by the end?! But of course his self-centered mate is more concerned with killing him over the accidental death of the donkey than rekindling their friendship, which leaves the end of the film both grim and unbelievable.There was some good acting in this movie (which is why I gave it 3 stars) and I get it was supposed to be a metaphor for the Irish civil war, but substituting a dour metaphor for a plot makes this a really lousy film. I'm quite surprised Gleeson's characted didn't cut off his nose despite his face to be honest...I 'get' this film totally, I just don't like it at all, on any level.",

There is no explanation of Colm's depression (maybe the book provided it but it's not explored in the movie). The small island microcosm is nothing admirable: a nasty policeman abusing his son, or the gossiping vendor. I'm also at a loss to understand why the movie is described by critics as a comedy, since especially at the end you're left with a sad feeling after having witnessed self-mutilation and suicide.Is there anything good to say about the movie?

            "review_title": "Perplexed and disappointed",
            "content": "I've followed the work of Martin McDonagh since his early days as the wunderkind of theatre, with plays like 'The Beauty Queen of Leenane' and 'A Skull in Connemara'. I was taken, as were many, by the imaginative capacities of the writer: the hilariously absurdist situations, the witty dialogue, and the sharp characterisations. So when he branched into films, I was eager to see the results.On the whole, I haven't been disappointed. 'In Bruges' was a masterpiece. A cleverly-plotted dark comedy-drama with those trademarks of dialogue and characterisation. It eclipsed 'Seven Psychopaths', which was supposed to be his first big widescreen offering ('In Bruges' was actually, I think, a bit of a side project - McDonagh thinking of it as the B-side, if you like... or the lesser of a double A-side at most!). 'Seven Psychopaths' was okay, nonetheless. It felt a bit over-populated, though, with too many 'big stars' trying to shine. 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' brought it back down to a more manageable handful of great characters. And even with massive stars like Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell and Peter Dinklage on board, it was evenly and brilliantly directed, with each player getting their chance to shine without necessarily outshining each other. Again, great dialogue and characterisation, and a clever and original story.With that heritage to go on, and with a return to the triumvirate of McDonagh, Farrell and Gleeson - plus a return to the times and places of the earlier plays - I pretty much knew I was in for a rare treat with 'The Banshees of Inisherin'. For once - even before I'd seen so much as a trailer - I also knew that the hype was going to be right. All the dozens of award nominations, too. It all pointed in the right direction.So... maybe I just had too much of a build-up over the years. Too many expectations. I feel a bit of a fraud actually, writing this review.... because I still haven't managed, in spite of four attempts now, to finish watching this film. It still sits there, on my hard drive, downloaded from YouTube early on when the price was still high (it had to be worth it, didn't it?), waiting to be finished. But to be honest, I really don't know if I can be bothered. I mean, there's only about 20 minutes to go - possibly including the end titles. Will I ever get there? Only, I think, if someone - here or somewhere else - can convince me that 'Ah... the best is yet to come. The ending will bring it all together, and make sense of the whole.' Will it? Really? And will it magically make the rest of the film 'better', somehow?I don't know what to say. All the promise, with this writer and director at the helm and these two fine actors (among others in the film). I've never felt so profoundly disappointed. The elements are there: the absurdity, the setting, the darkness of the comedy in the drama. But it's like putting all the best ingredients together to make a fine hearty stew, with the result being tepid and tasteless, and full of hard lumps. The story is just daft. Utterly unbelievable. That someone with a special musical talent could destroy the ability to produce music by gross self-mutilation, and over something like a friendship that didn't seem to have any real basis, anyway. You can be thrown together in a small, tight and enclosed community for all of your life, and feel stifled by it and its people. But isn't that where the imagination comes forward and takes its place? As a musician myself, also living in a bit of a cut-off and narrow community... would I wilfully destroy my means of escape because a friend of mine is boring? Not just smash up my piano (that can be replaced), but cut off the fingers that enable me to play it in the first place?I can, of course, understand the arguments saying that this needs to be seen as a metaphor for the struggles of creative and intelligent people in a world of dullness and stupidity. But for me, that still doesn't work here. The characterisation seems superficial to begin with. I didn't find myself feeling any kind of sympathy or attachment to any of them - except (and just about) the sister, Siobh\u00e1n. She, it seems, is central. She can see the world beyond, and yearn for it - in spite of its dangers. She's well aware of the limitations of her environment and opportunities. But her story, which would be interesting, is overshadowed by the rest of it. It's like a mash-up of McDonagh's earlier plays, with some Beckett-like absurdism woven in - plus a liberal dose of Father Ted-like characterisation. It's in the dialogue, too. I worked for many years around older people from the Republic of Ireland, and never heard them speak like that - with 'fecking' used as just about every other word. It's funny for a while, but then just becomes tiring and stupid.But maybe that's all a part of what this film seems to be trying to say too, in other ways. Everything, even language itself, becomes tiring and stupid, and full of cliches.I've given it 5. I honestly don't know if that's too high or too low. It feels about right.I'll wait on to see if someone can give me the incentive to watch those final minutes. Maybe, if I've nothing better to do - like unblock the sink, or wash the doormat - I'll muster the energy.I can't help thinking it won't be worth it, though.",

Every quality that can be judged in this film is top notch, but with there being no point, I'm only paying to be disappointed--superb pun intended.My best advice is to wash it out of your brain, if you've already watched it, and fill in the gap by watching \"Wild Mountain Thyme\"--a beautiful, uplifting masterpiece which is also set on the Emerald Isle.",

Story thus far wasn't compelling, and I found it tedious to bother with any more time to it. I am dumfounded why this movie and Farrell are getting so much Oscar buzz. Farrell is a favorite of mine, but this role doesn't seem to be anything extraordinary from him. I'd like to get my rental cost refunded, but I don't see that happening.",

            "content": "The Banshees of Inisherin is 2022's Power of the Dog for me. A film I can appreciate for its technical brilliance, gorgeous setting, fantastic performances, and interesting ideas. It's a film I admire, but I can't say I really enjoyed.Maybe that's not fair, there are things I enjoyed about Banshees. Barry Keoghan's performance for me really steals the show; this man is so committed to every single performance, I literally forgot it was him at points. Farrell and Gleeson are their usual selves, but honestly, neither really stood out to me (and for me, Farrell's best performance of the year was in The Batman).The film really gives you a sense of understanding the island (town?) of Inisherin, a gorgeous little place with rolling green hills, a jagged coastline, and an oppressive sense of isolation. The costumes are perfect, the set design is great, and even the writing is really strong too. There are some legitimate laugh out loud moments (and some eye rolling 'quirky' moments as well).But...for all that, and frankly, for most of McDonagh's films, there remains a sense of distance. I like seeing this movie as an allegory for a pre-modern approach to mental illness (it's a theme subtlety worn throughout the narrative) and a depiction as to how this would've been understood in a society where it really isn't. Everything else, symbolically and thematically, feels like a bit of a stretch to me. Okay, yes, the Irish Civil War was bad...but to make it out as a random manifestation of violence and not the result of real political disagreement seems like such an \"artistic\" way of looking at the conflict.There's also, let's be honest, no real plot here. The movie trods along with the same conceit that was introduced in its beginning, nothing more and nothing less. That isn't a bad thing and trust me, I don't mind slow stories, but I can't help but feel it was treading water and way too long.At the end of the day, this is an admirable film, but it's not particularly entertaining, profound, or memorable. I can remember In Bruges to this day. I doubt anything from this one will stick with me.",

Barry Keoghan and Jenny the miniature donkey stand out as supporting characters.So, in the end, disappointing and overrated.",

The entire cast was phenomenal and also included memorable performances by David Pearse, Gary Lydon, Pat Shortt, and last but not least Sheila Flitton, excellent casting by Louise Kiely.

            "content": "The glorious Triumvirate is back: McDonagh, Farrell, and Gleeson. Let's go baby, grab a pint of Guiness, St. Paddy's comes early this year.But wait ... no sooner are the boys united than Brendan Gleeson becomes some sort of super nerd who wants out of the reunion. And he won't say why. And he's being _very_ passive aggressive about it. I swear, it's a testament to the man's acting ability that he so adeptly plays your emotionally insecure girlfriend from high school.And that's pretty much the whole flick. It is completely unbelievable from a human standpoint, to see this grown man acting like a 12 year old (and the movie does acknowledge and lampshade this to some extent). Then the reason comes out: it's cause it's an _allegory_. What are you, some rube? You don't get it? It's an allegory about the pointlessness of the political conflict in Ireland at the time. You see, the main characters have a pointless conflict just like the pointlessness of the political conflict._facepalm_Here's the thing: grand political conflicts are power struggles between large groups. They make sense in that regard. They don't make sense in the context of a friendship. And that's the movies point: when you humanize these large political conflicts they are dumb. Large political groups are dehumanising. Okay great, I'm sure you could impress your emotionally insecure girlfriend from highschool with this one, but I expect way more from a man of McDonagh's ability.Because the forced political allegory tanks the whole thing. We're emotionally manipulated by watching the characters we love on screen struggle, yet there is no point to their struggle beyond this rote political message. There is no human insight to be found, because the central conflict is not human, but this grand political conflict projected onto human individuals.But wait, says the champagne sipping sophisticate, that is _just the point_. You are left feeling like the victims of the Irish Civil War, throwing your hands up at the pointlessness of it all.Well, one that makes McDonagh a war criminal for springing this on unsuspecting audiences, but two: no. The point is a movie like In Bruges, where *spoiler for In Bruges* Gleeson becomes a father to the lost Farrell, teaching him about beauty and tradition, and ultimately sacrificing himself to save his foster child. This is a profoundly human exercise --- we are given insights into lives we haven't lived. We share emotions we ourselves may not have felt, but that are very real to our condition. We leave the theater with full hearts, we kiss our loved ones, we feel joy in this existence.This sort of petty, nihilistic, \"no one can be happy cause war is a thing\" trash is very much not the point.I can't bear to give this movie less than six stars because most of what I love about McDonagh, Farrell, and Gleeson is on display here. It is beautifully shot and acted. The script is witty. It is an interesting movie. It's just such a massive load of wasted potential. And wasted for such a petty political message. It would have been so easy to change what's here into something beautiful. But no, beauty is for rubes. It'd be so easy to change what's here into a deeply human exploration of friendship: Farrell and Gleeson would bring it to life. But no, what's important isn't humanity, it's politics.War is bad and pointless. We know. So are political allegories.",

An intriguing blend of sharp script, smart direction & splendid performances, The Banshees of Inisherin is absurd, amusing, poignant & emotionally compelling all at once.Written & directed by Martin McDonagh (Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), the story concerns two lifelong friends who find themselves at an impasse after one abruptly ends their relationship. It's a deceptively simple & downright ridiculous premise yet McDonagh creates a surprisingly alluring tragicomedy from it that not only delivers on dark humour but also comes smeared with an undercurrent of melancholy.Although it takes a while to get the gist of what the story is all about, the interest is piqued from the start and the clever writing makes sure it doesn't fizzle out at any point of time. Colin Farrell & Brendan Gleeson are excellent throughout and share such an amazing camaraderie that their long-term friendship is thoroughly convincing. Kerry Condon & Barry Keoghan also shine in their supporting roles and contribute with strong inputs.Overall, The Banshees of Inisherin is perhaps McDonagh's most emotional offering to date and marks yet another solid entry in his short but impressive oeuvre. Definitely amongst those films that get better the more they are allowed to simmer, it presents the British director in control of his craft and is furthermore elevated by top-notch performances from the entire cast. The feel-bad cinematic treat of the year, McDonagh's latest is worth your time.",

There is no end, none whatsoever, nothing a punch in the face would not have achieved with much less fanfare, and we know this character doesn't mind dishing out a box.The moral of this story? That which is so dullest I shalt make dull of my life to match thous dullness.I really don't know, make it up, there is no story here.I've noticed a trend with this directors films having no payoff, same again here. There is no emotional attachment to any character. As many more have said there is no resolution. Wish I had stuck to my guns and not watched this, my gut instinct of the trailer was spot on.Lastly, the scene with the dim chap declaring his love was utter cringe, as I watched I declared it should have been cut. It was ridiculous and the payoff from it was utterly pointless.",

If I'm really grasping at straws the only theme I found interesting was that of being \"nice\" and valuing the simplicities in life versus doing something supposedly meaningful or legacy producing and creating internal meaning beyond your reliance on external relationships. On one side of the coin, Padraig sees life's beauty and meaning in simple human connections regardless of how seemingly insignificant they are. On the other, Colm has a midlife/ late life crisis and is concerned he's wasted his life away leaving behind a meaningless life with no legacy to show for it. Meanwhile we see Padraig's sister stuck in this dilemma as well having to decide whether to let her intelligence be wasted away on an island or travel for greater opportunity on the mainland. The characters decisions on how to approach life are somewhat interesting in this sense as many of us in our own lives are conflicted on whether we should place more value on career success versus meaningful personal relationships and whether both are possible.As others have mentioned there are some beautiful shots off the coast of Ireland, although these can also be found by watching NatGeo as well. The acting is quite good, but do not expect to see anything thrilling or even exciting in this film. There is also some weird (physically graphic material) included.Overall, this film is made for a very specific niche audience and therefore I really don't think it should be anywhere near awards such as Best Picture.",

Therefore, in a country where Spanish is spoken, like mine, it seemed to me that preserving the word \"banshee\" was the correct option to refer to Martin McDonagh's film, a new contribution to his short but stupendous filmography and his return to British cinema, after doing in the United States \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" in the United StatesRenamed \u00abLost Souls of Inisherin\u00bb, \"banshee\" seems the appropriate term, because it is a film rooted in Irish traditions, based on an exemplary script (written by McDonagh) that contextualizes the story with accurate and scarce data, to gives us the portrait of a society in the 1920s, encapsulated despite its magnificent landscapes, trapped in a country at war against England, made up of men and women dedicated to tasks attached to the land, on the fictional island of Inisherin.Considering McDonagh's extensive and award-winning career as a playwright, it comes as no surprise that he holds our attention for almost two hours without ever straying from the central issue: the sudden break in friendship between two men, when the older man, Colm Doherty (Brendan Gleeson), gets tired of P\u00e1draic (Colin Farrell), who could well be his son. Colm's reasons are simple: P\u00e1draic bores him and he wants time for himself, to dedicate it to music before he dies. If P\u00e1draic insists on speaking to him, Colm threatens to cut off his finger. And in an environment where excessive testosterone permeates every corner, Colm does not take long to do so.The rupture leads to absurdity and violence, sparks mixed reactions among friends and neighbors, exposes the role of authority, and leads P\u00e1draic's sister Siobh\u00e1n (Kelly Condon) to make a drastic decision, made worse when the enigmatic Mrs. McCormick (Sheila Flitton) announces that there will soon be a death, or perhaps two, on the island. (*)Conceived as the third play in the Aran Islands Trilogy, after \u00abThe Cripple of Inishmaan\u00bb (1996) and \u00abThe Lieutenant of Inishmore\u00bb (2001), Irish actors Farrell and Gleeson agreed to act in it seven years before production of the film was green-lighted. Both are formidable and deserve a round of applause for their performances, bolstered by two other Irish performers: Condon as Siobh\u00e1n and Barry Keoghan as Dominic, the island idiot and battered son of the town policeman. Films so well basted are rare. Recommended.(*) Mrs. McCormick is the closest to the banshees in the title, if we were to interpret it. She is followed in character by the mean village shopkeeper, Mrs. O'Riordan (Br\u00edd N\u00ed Neachtain), and perhaps Siobh\u00e1n, who, seeing them both, glimpses her fate.",

The Banshees of Inisherin is getting all the praise from the critics this year for its poisonous take on friendship, which is far away from regular mainstream attempts. The film has a lot of moments for the critics and those who love meaningful and realistic cinema-even if it's slow and exhausting. This film falls into that category. I don't know how many people would agree, but that's what makes it quite boring for mainstream cinema lovers. A runtime of 113 minutes is not long, but here it looks so. Why? Because you don't provide entertainment or engaging elements. We have seen many films made about friendship, sweet and toxic both, but never a brutal one like this. Maybe we have, but that wasn't as subtle or devastating as this. The film follows lifelong friends who find themselves at an impasse when one abruptly ends their relationship. The second one tries to rekindle the bond, but the other goes mad and violent against it. Somehow, this leads to revenge and inner complexity that turn into criminally unjustifiable events. What powers the slow screenplay is the realism and character study. The film reunites Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, who previously worked together on McDonagh's directorial debut, In Bruges (2008). The performances of both are like a battle of the titans. You get immersed in that face-off, which doesn't have any aggressive scenes; you just enjoy the pauses. Martin McDonagh's writing is a bit dull, but his direction makes up for the loss. Overall, a good watch, but looking at the hype around it nowadays, it seems a bit overwhelming. Give it a watch for the performances and commitment to the topic.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest.",

As I have said in my other reviews, there are a lot of movies lately with good acting and horrible writing. This is another example. First of all we have a period piece with good sets, wardrobe, pub, horses, everything, so DO SOMETHING WITH IT ! Whats wrong with you? Those were the most boring pub scenes in the history of film-making! Good acting with nowhere to go. Kerry Condon overacted the whole time, I guess she thought she was still in Hamlet. YOU'RE NOT IN HAMLET ANYMORE, KERRY! Get over yourself.Ok, so the storyline. Guy cuts fingers off for no reason. Ok, brilliant! Holy horsepie, seriously? Seriously. No, Seriously? No. Yes, that is the storyline. Maybe this is Celtic humor, or Celtic horror, or Celtic history, don't know, don't care, never will. Guy burns down house. Holy fire batman, wowza wowza, fire! Fire! Fire! Geez, this is cowpie.The sad scene is when Colin's baby mule Jenny ate an artichoke and died, or a finger, sorry, i think Jenny Artichoke was Irish. See, thats funnier than anything in this movie. Was this a black comedy, nope, was this a drama, nope, none, was this an artsy film, nope, no artistic value or merit, was this a bland non-alcoholic Irish coffee? Yes sir! This is bland non-alcoholic Irish coffee! Not worth the money or the time.Oh, Jenny Artichoke come home to Colin and stop his tears. But wait, hold on, hold on horsey, hold on, this would have been a good 15 minute short film, but not a great one. Edit this beast down to 15 minutes and i'll give it another star.",

One dimensional caricatures interact in a darkly comic manner with a stunning coastal backdrop. I was beyond unmoved. I was irked. The Irish Civil War and its aftermath was a horrowshow. But the victims were not just the men. McDonagh chooses to ignore this. Wives were committed to the struggle too. They took part in a supporting role. They were widowed if not during, then within a few years after. They raised large families in poverty without the normal neighbourly support. They faced down parish priests who saw slave labourers in their children. This movie is an insult to the people involved.",

The film is set in 1923 on a very simple and laid back island in Ireland. We have become conditioned to seeing CGI and over the top story lines and/or action sequences. So it's nice to see a film that relies on its story and performances. I feel this setup is the reason people have heaped praise on this film, a real story that isn't Marvel or another action/CGI film. The story is also relatable and understandable. One can see how a person might grow weary of a friendship or companion when you had little choice to begin with. They were an odd pairing from the start.My only contention is the story could have delved into something deeper. This simplistic setting could have explored the complexities of the human experience, no matter what the year was, you would find it deeply relatable. It could have been more thought provoking and questioned societies conventions or very nature of friendship, human fragility or something existential. In my humble little opinion this could have taken the film to a deeper level and a higher rating for me.",

            "content": "My Review -The Banshees of Inisherin (2022)My Rating 10/10This is my favourite movie of 2022 for a multitude of reasons .I don't use the word genius lightly but in Martin McDonagh's case I think genius is the perfect description of his talent to write for the cinema beautifully and direct his talented actors to perfection.Two previous films of Martin McDonagh's movies are great all time favourites of mine they are In Bruges 2008 and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017).It's probably partly my Irish Celtic ancestry because The Banshees of Inisherin joins those two previous Martin McDonagh films and now belongs on my all time favourites lists .I've seen it twice already and as far as character insight ,simplicity of story and the beautiful but austere location are concerned this is the finest movie I've seen since last years Jane Campion triumph The Power of the Dog which also is about a complex male relationship between very two different men.Power of the Dog was about sibling rivalry between brothers The Banshees of Inisherin is about male friendship, loneliness and geographical isolation.I really can't think of any other movie that depicts a non sexual male friendship with the emotional intensity and intimacy that these two polar opposite characters portray.Colin Farrell gives the male acting performance of the year so far as far as I'm concerned cast as P\u00e1draic S\u00failleabh\u00e1in a simple gentle sensitive Irish dairy farmer living in a hut on an isolated island with his sister Siobhan plus his much loved miniature donkey Jenny when his sister allows Jenny inside.Colm Doherty played with equal brilliance by Brendon Gleeson who suddenly rejects his friend Colm both actors give Oscar worthy performances.Hopefully they won't both get nominated in in the Best actor category as that would jinx their chances of either winning.These two great Irish actors who also had acting triumphs together in Martin McDonough's \"In Bruges \"have been waiting 14 years to star together again and it's been well worth the wait .The plot sounds simple but just imagine living on a rural isolated island with a tiny population and the shock and rejection if your best friend who you've shared much of your life experience with suddenly went strange saying \"I don't like you anymore \" and don't talk to me again .Set on the fictional island of Inisherin in 1923 where Colm can hear the gun shots and conflict from across the bay from the Irish Civil War these two lifelong mates P\u00e1draic (Colin Farrell) and Colm (Brendan Gleeson) engage in a battle of their own after P\u00e1draic is told by Colm to go away and not speak to him again. P\u00e1draic ironically makes a comment as he listens to the distant guns and explosions of conflict \" Good luck to you Whatever it is you're fighting about ?P\u00e1draic persists in trying to make amends, meeting resistance from Colm at every turn. The row escalates under the watchful eyes of the entire village as Colm makes good on a gruesome promise.That brings me to the other great characters in The Banshees of Inisherin the village folk who all add to the humour ,charm and magic of this outstanding movie.They include Kerry Condon as Siobh\u00e1n ,P\u00e1draic's much loved and educated sister who longs for an escape from isolation asking her brother ,don't you ever get lonely P\u00e1draic?Kerry Condon should be definitely nominated for Best Supporting Actress Oscar she is outstanding.As is Barry Keoghan in the role of Dominic Kearney a not so simple minded villager with a monster abuser for a father who happens to be the village Police Constable.Barry Keoghan as Dominic should be among the many Oscar nominated actors in this movie his scenes with P\u00e1draic are truly touching and very funny.The most mysterious character in this movie is Mrs. McCormick played by Sheila Flitton who warns P\u00e1draic that death will come to the island soon as she appears like a banshee which in Irish legend means a female spirit who warns of a death in a house.The threat of death-as if brought by a banshee-falls over the village of Inisherin as no one knows just how far the feud between P\u00e1draic and Colm will go.Colin Farrell and Brendon Gleeson are real life friends who's professional careers merge seamlessly in this film as they did In Bruges their on screen chemistry together and rapport is a joy to behold.The Cinematography by Ben Davis is glorious and captures the wild beauty of Achill Island in County Mayo on the West Coast of Ireland with glorious shots of the sea the fishing boats and the sky at times looking like an artists canvas.The scrupulous attention to set detail by Production designer Mark Tildesley adds to the visual joy of this movie . I read that even The J. J. Devine Public House was purpose-built for the production on Achill Island .in County Mayo then demolished as the Production team had no building permit .Banshees of Inisherin is another movie to be seen on a Cinema screen because of its intimacy and beauty it also has some very funny moments that capture the unique charm of Irish rural village culture and superstition,it's truly a magic movie.Carter Burwell master movie score composer of movies that include Carol 2015 , Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri 2017, The Fargo television series ,Twilight and In Bruges 2008 has added another of his best and most evocative music film scores to The Banshees of Inisherin .",

Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan put their all into their performances.

You can attempt to find out why, but the final outcome remains the same. Picture that, then put them on an Irish island in 1923 in the midst of an Irish Civil War. There is the core of the story and it is a tale you can sense could be told in front of a campfire. If you know any silly stories of Issac Bashiv Singer, you will likely enjoy this film. A film with oddball characters who are so buried deep into their idiosyncrasies you sometimes want to yell for them to get out of their own heads. But in a world where no social media exists and in a town less then a few hundred, it is remarkable that director Martin McDonagh makes this town feel so claustrophobic. This is because this is a place where everyone knows each others business. Questions rise to the top. For instance, Paulraic (played wonderfully by Colin Ferrell) lives with his sister Slobhan (Kerry Condon) and with a close knit donkey named Jenny. One day Paulraic's lifelong friend Colm (Brendan Gleeson) decides he no longer wants to be friends. In any way. Now, in modern days you can move on. On a far off island, it's probably impossible to find someone who you can converse with. In Paulraic's case, it's either Colm or a slow-witted kid who has no filter and is the son of the local constable who has been abusive. Those are his choices. That same fateful moment, Paulraic believes Colm is sassing him with a long running prank. But he means it. The trailer would have you believe a great deal of wild back and forth will happen. Instead, it's a quiet grudge in which both characters do still speak to one another. The story skates wonderfully in that world where you are wondering what frustrations Paulraic could bring his dead old friend. As I imagined, it would be Paulraic making more of nuisance of himself. BUT, that isn't the case. There is a legitimate reason for Colm to ignore Paulraic. And also a legitimate reason for Paulraic to value Colm's friendship. That is remarkable sense of storytelling. An American version would have you feel animosity towards Paulraic.Gleeson plays the Colm character with a great deal of humanity. The man has been feeling stuck on the island. He's suffocating under being irrelevant. Whilst Paulraic is perfectly fine in the mundane world. In Colm's case, he is nearing an age where he feels like he needs to make a mark in the world. A lot of artists feel this way. What legacy can one leave if you aren't married, and don't have children. A world awaited Colm and Paulraic is reminder of an anchor that holds him to the island. In a lot of ways, Paulraic's sister feels the same. It is much too suffocating of a place full of depression where the elderly women of the town live for bad gossip.McDonagh loves his small town stories. No doubt a sense of breaking away from the small world to see the big one. Or at least do the bigger things life should have in store for us.There is no satisfying ending here. Sorry to break it to you. The resolution runs out of gas. There is a glimpse at the end, where you believe it would escalate into two friends physically hurting one another. Instead, it mellows out. Perhaps that is the resolution between two friends. It does leave you wondering how it continues from there.A nice escape from the technology that bears down on us. It's nice to see a movie where there is no smartphones, electricity or even running water. It's just people and behavior.",

            "content": "A legend in the theatre, Martin McDonagh's film career has been patchy at best; close to sublime with \"In Brughes\" and \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" and almost irredeemably bad with \"Seven Psychopaths\". At least until now, since McDonagh's new film isn't just the best thing he's done on screen but very possibly the best thing he's ever done.On the surface, \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" is a very simple affair with a plot that could have been written on the back of an envelope. The setting is the ficticious island of Inisherin off the mainland of Ireland. The year is 1922 and the Irish Civil War is raging. Padraic, (Colin Farrell) and Colm, (Brendan Gleeson) are seemingly best friends until one day Colm tells Padraic he no longer wants to be his friend, that he finds him 'boring', and so what begins as a dark comedy worthy of Beckett or indeed the McDonagh who gave us \"The Beauty Queen of Leenane\" turns slowly but inexorably into a tragedy worthy of Ibsen and dealing with such themes as loneliness, depression, masculinity and friendship and with an ending as sad as any I've seen in the cinema, (though others may see it differently).Of course, it all could just as easily have fallen on its slightly absurdist face. Here is a scenario that could have gone any which way; McDonagh is hardly known for his subtlety and yet he never puts a foot wrong. By the time we get to the last act you could hear a pin drop in a packed cinema.It's also magnificently acted both by Farrell and Gleeson in career-best performaces, both underplaying to the extent that they totally disappear inside their characters and there is a third magnificent performance from Barry Keoghan, (please, just give him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar now), as Dominic, ostensibly the village idiot he may just be the most intelligent person on the island and that is his tragedy; such intelligence can't be contained especially when it goes unrecognized.

            "content": "THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN (B+) asks, \"Can you just suddenly end a friendship?\" The question plays out over the rock wall strewn Irish island (No Man is an Island?) of Inisherin in the 1920's. The inciting conflict is simple, what if one member of a long-time friendship between two Irish men (Colm and Padraic) wants end their friendship. What consequences would develop from that? Colm, played by Brendan Gleeson, one morning decides to stop being friendly with Padraic, played by Colin Farrell. When the two country friends finally sit down and chat about it, Colm opens up, \"I just don't like you anymore\" and walks off. All of this happens within the first ten minutes of a 110-minute film. We learn later that Colm has been dealing with the meaningless of life, suicide, and that he can no longer put up with Padraic's dull and aimless chatter. Colm wants to focus on making music and being more thoughtful, something that will be remembered past his life. The rest of the film observes the fallout of this relationship that may or may not result in the cutting off of fingers and dead animals. In following this fallout the film explores the purpose of friendship and life. Should friendship be an equal relationship? What should we get out of friendship if anything? What does it do to a person inside when they are denied friendship? What is the effect on society as well? Should life be about friendship or achievement? Do the two need be against each other? I found myself fairly caught up in the story and the questions that arise from it. There's a lot of insight to be had here. Unfortunately, the film lags about halfway through and writer/director' Martin McDonagh's penchant for taking his stories to extremes (which absolutely sank Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri for me) takes the story in directions that just took me out of it. I'm sure others will have different results. It's an interesting meditation, parable like, that is weighed down by a need to shock (if it is just a tragedy) and the lack of redeemable qualities (if it is meant to be more than a tragedy). It's a bummer because the reunion of Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Martin McDonagh, the key trio behind In Bruges, made this one of my most anticipated films of the year.",

            "content": "It's a relationship-gone-bad movie set in 1923 on a small island off the coast of Ireland. It follows the deteriorating relationship between two former friends that escalates to a bitter ending.Colm Doherty (Brendan Gleeson) is an older man who lives alone with his dog. He enjoys fiddle music and trying to compose some tunes as he's become more aware of his mortality. He has wearied over time of his younger neighbor, P\u00e1draic S\u00failleabh\u00e1in (Colin Farrell). P\u00e1draic is content with his hum-drum daily life with no aspirations to change. He enjoys his farm animals, especially his miniature donkey, and lives with his unmarried sister, Siobh\u00e1n (Kerry Condon), perhaps the most educated and intelligent person on the island. Another nearby neighbor is the younger Dominic Kearney (Barry Keoghan), son of the village policeman, Peadar (Gary Lydon). Peadar regularly beats Dominic, who is mildly challenged intellectually and has few filters on his conversations.Colm tells P\u00e1draic that he finds him dull and wants to end their relationship in order to spend more time on his music. P\u00e1draic, who is lonely except for Colm, his sister, and his donkey, refuses to accept Colm's request. The tension and trouble escalate throughout the film. Siobh\u00e1n and Dominic escape in their own ways, leaving Colm and P\u00e1draic in conflict to the end.Some describe this as a dark comedy. That characterization doesn't fit, though there is much humor along the way. It is more of a parable about the Irish Civil War and The Troubles that lingered through the decades. One laughs to keep from weeping about the breakdown in relationships.Gleeson, Farrell, and Condon are excellent in their roles. Lydon also performs well. The Mrs. McCormick (Sheila Flitton) character was an unnecessary diversion in the story, but on the whole, I found it well-crafted. The ending was a surprise, but it made sense. I recommend it.",

            "content": "Another film I managed to catch on VOD, The Banshees of Inisherin is likely the most personal film that Martin McDonagh has ever made -- if he did indeed base this on experiences of his own; all I know for sure is he's back to his roots, filming in Ireland and reuniting Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, the starring duo of his In Bruges (2008). It's hard to settle on what exactly to write here, as it's one of those movies where nobody can quite decide on what the film is about.What most will agree on is the following surface-level reading: It is (A) a tale of lost friendship and (B) one of the most Irish movies ever made. (Subtitles are recommended even if English is your first language.)It is also one of those movies that made me want to yell at the screen, and I mean that in the best possible way. It's a film where things progressively get worse, and each time they do, characters will insist on making them worse than worse. We want to clobber sense into them at every turn. However, we aren't frustrated because they're poorly written or too stupid to exist; we're frustrated because we can believe that these geezers are real and that their lives and situations would've led them to a point whereby this makes sense to them.It helps that the actors are absolutely perfect; critic Glenn Kenny remarked that, for all of McDonagh's successful attempts at making films about America, \"nobody does self-loathing quite like the Irish\". In addition to the transfixing chemistry between Farrell and Gleeson, Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan appear in show-stealing supporting roles.The film also makes marvelous use of the Irish vistas (featuring several memorable shots of peaceful fields lined with dry stone walls and minuscule figures brooding atop the towering coastal cliffs) and Carter Burwell's score is both beautiful and haunting where it counts. And yes, there are many ways to read the text -- the significance of the equids, the cloaked whatever-she-is that lurks about the island (usually before something terrible happens), the possible Irish History allegories to be found, the existentialist question of basing your identity around your relationships (and the self-destruction that may take place once they end)...In any case, it's just a fe*king good time.",

            "content": "It would be easy to dismiss a negative review of this film as \"not getting it\", but rest assured this is exactly the kind of film I love, and I entirely \"get it\". It's slow, leisurely in its storytelling, handling despair and loneliness and purpose of life, with a sense of dark humor. And there is plenty of humor, some of it is even funny, but most of it just doesn't land. In the theater where I watched it, only the first confessional scene got any kind of audible response. If it were just that, then the film could be merely passable.But the bigger problem is that the underlying tension is just never terribly compelling, despite some rather drastic events. Dealing with despair and hopes and wasted lives is always going to be a tall task, but I had just hoped for more. As the story slowly unfurled, I hoped it would become a socially kafka-esque tale in a small Irish village, but to no avail. Instead it became a rather familiar, if understated, duel of the spirits.Technically, I think the filmmakers relied a bit too much on setting and cinematography and not enough on writing. There are magnificent shots within the film, which only work to remind the viewer that this is a film, and a visual message is being conveyed. (I recognize the burden is on the viewer to suspend disbelief, but when the sledgehammer comes, it takes a moment to reorient oneself.) And the acting is serviceable. Notably, in a perfect example of a backhanded compliment, Colin Farrell is perfectly cast as a dullard. The role of Dominic was played with vigor, let's say, but it actually starts to grow on the viewer. The portrayal of the sister however, even accounting for dueling defining character traits, was, to be kind, overwrought.It's one of the oldest clich\u00e9s, but applicable here, that in a very meta sense, this film made me wish I had that time back. Time I could have been doing something more productive, even if it was just watching a better film. That's not just a tired old criticism, it shows that I get the film.",

What kind of person (a musician at that) would cut his fingers off because his ex-friend kept talking to him wanting him to allow his friendship again. And Colin's character only has one friend, his pet donkey Jenny, because of this dark God forsaken island he lives on has very few people living on it.

These two it's clear are thought to be best friends and when Colm says \"I just don't like you no more\", you can see P\u00e1draic's confused heart break. It's a simple world of dry stone walls, rural countryside, log fires, candlelight, Jenny the donkey, fiddles and wooly jumpers. All adding to P\u00e1draic's melancholy. To be honest Colm doesn't seem happy either. Despite all this The Banshees of Inisherin is a comedy. Not the crass stupid blockbuster kind, but the gentle heartfelt kind. Dominic (Barry Keoghan) alone is fantastic, \"Pay no attention to wars, I'm against em, wars and soap\". Funny as he is, he's no comfort to P\u00e1draic or P\u00e1draic's sister Siobh\u00e1n (Kerry Condon), who Dominic is chasing... pinning all his hopes on. P\u00e1draic doesn't understand why he's lost his friend. Until Colm explains that he's tired of idling the time away. He wants to be more productive, to leave a legacy. The island of Inisherin off Ireland is both beautiful and desolate. It's a good metaphor for this film, about loneliness and purpose. It's shot through with understated dry effortless humour that warms the soul sumptuously from the screen, but despite P\u00e1draic's best effort to stay away from Colm as instructed. His niceness makes it hard and before long Colm's ultimatum unleashes an increasingly dark string of events. It's the sort of film that cuts deep. Etching something meaningful.

On the exterior, it has some of the most beautiful landscapes the human eye can witness, yet there's a sense of seeping melancholy and nonchalance that's nearly incomparable. This is the perfect setting to tell the story of best friends Padraic (Colin Farrell) and Colm (Brendan Gleeson), where one fine morning in the island of Inisherin, the latter decides he wants nothing to do with the former - no friendship, no loose talk, no interactions at all. Like any of us, Padraic believes it's all a joke at first, but he's shocked to learn that Colm is taking it all the way.Poor Padraic is told he's dull and not smart enough to engage in any meaningful interactions whereas Colm intends to spend more time creating art (in this case, music) that generations of people can resonate with. This turmoil affects Padraic more than anyone, and losing the only real friend he had is something he finds difficult to digest - Farrell delivers an amazingly vulnerable performance here. One can draw parallels to this with the the faraway sights and sounds of the Civil War that's going on in the Irish mainland, but Inisherin feels like it's cocooned from it. Even the people who reside there barely discuss the war except for a cop. Barry Keoghan, who plays the village idiot (and Padraic's buddy), is sensational. I can see what Matt Reeves sees in him when he's going to take up the role of Joker.Another performance I truly adore is that of Kerry Condon, who plays Padraic's sister Siobhan. She speaks and acts like the only practical person in the whole island, but is downright emotional when it comes to her brother. Then, there's the horde of animals of Inisherin that includes Jenny the donkey, Colm's dog, a bunch of cows and horses, all adding to the silent beauty of the place. Martin McDonagh's film begins as a dry comedy, and it remains one almost all through, even when it embraces its darker (and more complex) sides. The humor itself is well-timed and situational, having you worry less on one hand, and also shocking you just minutes later with visuals of mangled fingers and gory bar-tables.It's all perfect material for theater, but McDonagh's confidence (in the writing and direction) makes it work as cinema. Its central theme is deeply resonating, especially when viewed in an era where ghosting is so commonplace. Ben Davis' cinematography and Mikkel E. G. Nielsen's edit work fully support McDonagh's vision. That's an incredible feat, no doubt!",

The younger man, a \"good man\" as noted by all, is then driven to malice, cruelty, arson, and attempted murder. How do we get there? Through unbelievable idiocy; insanity not noticed by anyone, thus ignored; and an abused young man, lost in unrequited love, and a monster of a father. The ending, just absurd and insulting.

We were teased into going to see this because Farrell and Gleeson had teamed up back in 2008 for the excellent \"In Bruges\". This new movie reunites these two and, similarly, starts off in a slow and moody fashion but just plodded to its tiresome and witless conclusion. The film could have ended at any time in the first 45 minutes and you would have been as depressed as the central characters had you stayed for the full 114 minutes. There is the standard stupid Irish person that you would come to predictably expect. What was not predictable was how truly dull this was. I had been told, in advance, that \"If there was an Oscar for landscape this would win\". Thankfully there isn't so this will be a forgotten work in moments... with no red carpet celebration.While were leaving the cinema some people seemed to be still in their seats. Asleep perhaps? In spite of some promised, but absent, dark comedy there certainly would not have been any \"post credits funny out-takes\" to wait for.Finally, there was an obvious goof in the first 10 minutes....

Unfortunately, I didn't find it as good as any of his previous films. It's good to see Farrell & Gleeson back together again, as well as a predominately Irish cast playing Irish characters. The plot is simple - Colm (Gleeson) decides he doesn't have time to be friends with Padraic (Farrell) anymore, so Padraic, his sister Siobhan (Condon) and another friend, Dominic (Keoghan), try to find out why.Part of the problem is their isolation, living on the (fictional) island of Inisherin off the west coast of Ireland in the 1920s - there's not much else to do or many other people to interact with! There are plenty of chuckles as the news spreads (via refreshing accents not often heard in Hollywood films) and Padraic tries to comprehend what his long-time friend is doing to him. The 1920s era means there's no cars, electricity or large buildings, so the scenery (real-life islands of Inishmore, off the coast of Galway) and sunsets are stunning, almost their own character.The acting's great, particularly Condon, with Keoghan purposefully annoying, Farrell often bewildered and Gleeson adroit. While it's a comedy, it's very dark and bleak - definitely more of a black comedy or \"dramedy\" than anything laugh-out-loud. Definitely lots to enjoy, but the ending and overall plot left me gloomy, when I was hoping for a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel.",

I simply watched it without mentally preparing for what I was about to see, and in all honestly that's how I think it should be approached, if at all possible.The reason for this is because it's none of those things, and yet all of those things. To have it lean one way or the other to influence the viewer will do them no favours as it doesn't have enough of the elements of any genre to BE that genre.The trailer makes you believe this is a comedy. I disagree. I think this film represents all the good and bad that can happen in regular life. Sometimes life is funny, sometimes it's slow and boring, and sometimes, it's awful. The angles that the situations these characters go through are unique, but still has a message about what life is like, and perhaps a lesson about the right and wrong way to handle things during the times when things don't go your way.One of the most pleasing things about this film as someone who is not from Ireland, is enjoying the scenery of the Aran Islands. Also charming is the time this film is set in, which is in 1923 when people obviously didn't rely on cell phones and gadgets, allowing them to actually see people in person. This enables today's films that are set in the past to allow characters to knock on doors or meet at pubs to have conversations.The character that is not credited in this film, but should be, is that of Friendship, and how important it is in our lives. Friendship can turn bad making things stressful in every way in our lives, but when it's good, it makes everything worth while. One can't help but reflect on their own life while watching the relationship between Padraic and Colm turn bad. It's hard not to think of the friendships we've all held on to but should have either let them go, or think of the people we let go, but should have hung on to.This film stayed with me for the entire evening after watching it, and all the next day, thinking about the simple things that we can all relate to.Perhaps that's making more out of this film than it really is, but then again, maybe that's the whole point.",

An island so beautiful that when we left the cinema we immediately wanted to go live there...or maybe visit. And please, please, see it at the cinema.An interesting 20th century time period - I did not know that the Republic of Ireland was still governed by the British then, so I learned something historic on top of learning something about myself.It's an-anti buddy movie of sorts. Why does Colm now hate Padraic? Colm must hate him, because of the extremes he goes too with his fiddling fingers. Literally as I'm writing this, a couple of weeks later, I'm musing on these two former friends, Pad's sister Siobhan and donkey, the pub; Dominic, Pad's young friend, grown up like the psychological version of rickets from the island-isolation from his own age (covid-lockdown, anyone?) cemented in by an abusive father-son relationship which everyone ignores, and his dazzlingly awkward precursive monologue with Siobhan. And island life - the beauty but how beauty is not enough, not even in the sea and the cliffs and the hills. So much but I won't say anymore because, please see it and let it talk to you, quietly.",

Without going into too much detail, this story doesn't have a nice, happy bow tied on it by the finale, instead more of a black cloud lingering above that manages to let in a few streaks of light.Sporting perhaps the best group of performances of the year, Banshees carries some heavyweight awards contenders. The highlight for me would be Keoghan's rather difficult role played to perfection. Farrell and Gleason are the consummate sparring partners and Condon brings some wild, yet sensitive energy to the film. The vistas are simply gorgeous and Burwell's atmospheric score hangs over the film like a hazy fog.McDonagh has crafted another richly compelling film that challenges viewers, yet serves as a rewarding watch for those looking for something different.",

Is part of the theme of the movie that men are inherently depressed, self absorbed, and self destructive? The one major woman character is the only one who has the insight and motivation to change anything for the better and to extend sympathy to anyone. (I do think Dominic cares for others but he is fatally damaged by his father's cruelty and his attempts to connect aren't successful.)The best part of the movie is the scene where Siobhan leaves. That was virtually the only enjoyable thing in the movie to me. Then her brother can't even understand her letter really, won't even consider visiting her.My takeaways from this movie: I will seek out movies/series that Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan are in; their characters seemed more alive than any others.

With The Banshees of Inisherin happened the exact same thing. To be fair, Martin' Three Buildings suffered also from the great deal of depressive atmosphere and unlikable characters, so I'm guessing this is just his style - he tells the stories of people frozen in time, without a past, without a future, just lucky to be alive at that moment when we're watching the movie.Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are fantastic together and their duo's chemistry is palpable throughout the movie, even when their characters aren't speaking to each other but I once again found myself caught between trying to feel their entities and empathize with them and trying harder to find a real purpose of this whole thing as a body of work. The depression and hopelessness fills every corner of the screen and no breathtaking landscapes of Ireland, no occasional jokes (although very witty at times), no eloquent pieces of dialogue and no great acting couldn't let this movie to stay in my heart for a longer time than I was hoping for.Martin McDonagh goes over the top again and expresses a quarrel between friends as something surreal and hard to comprehend. Naturally people drift apart as life goes on, sometimes it even happens in a blink of an eye when one day everything's fine and the next you don't want to see or hear this person ever again but what could've been the best portrayal of human relations turned out to be an exaggerated, bizarre, overbloated (but not in the runtime - two hours go by pretty fast, I have to admit) and not too pleasant experience of a movie that's still better than 99% of all of the movies of nowadays.The banshees of Inisherin is a unique blend of tragedy - when you see people bored to death with their day to day life and how weird they manage it - drama - when those same people try and fail to communicate with each other - and comedy - when you hear what they have to say to each other when they try, - and any other actor or director attached to the project could've ruined it within minutes but Martin, along with Colin and Brendan, make you stay until the end without really trying.",

I'm not knocking the acting, and the scenery was amazing, and perhaps it wanted to make points about \"art\" and remote communities and communication, but it was like one of those films that was originally a play, and shows it.I didn't feel that there was any satisfactory resolution and the audience is just left hanging with an uncomfortable feeling of disquiet.It would have been better had I not been told beforehand that it was a comedy, because it's not.

            "content": "In playwright Martin McDonagh's new film the context defines the plot. A few scenes of remote gunfire connote the Irish Civil War in 1923. The Western island setting is remote from the war, with only that occasional aural connection. Yet the village drama is a miniature of the civil strife that erupted after Ireland won its independence. The mainland war replays here as a conflict between two friends.The folk musician Colm is suffering from despair. Sensing his imminent mortality he composes a folk tune to provide some afterlife. Exposing that futility, the song's (as the film's) title just sounds good. It has no reality. There are no banshees there.More damaging is Colm's other resolve. To cease wasting time on his longtime close friend Padraic, who is a standard dumb bloke. But as Padraic's bookish sister Siobhan reminds Colm, all the men on that remote isolated crag are dumb - or they would long since have left. As she eventually does.Like the civil war, indeed like most wars, that small difference swells into a tangle of destruction, both mutual and self. When Padraic refuses his old friend's insistence upon being left alone, Colm chops off one of his own fingers for each day of offence. He is quickly reduced to one fingerless hand. That ends his fiddling pleasure, leaving him to stab his fiddle into the air in mute musicianship. Once he is unable to play his tune it won't outlive him.When Padriac's donkey Minnie (persuasively performed by Minnie) fatally chokes on some fingers, his injured innocence turns mortal. Rejecting Colm's apology and offer of peace, he burns his former friend's home to the ground. Even then he refuses to make peace. They won't be \"quits\" until Colm dies. \"Some things there's no moving on from. And I think that's a good thing.\" On such stubborn squabbles are most wars waged.The apparently homey little community is rife with aggression. Humorously, Colm disdains of the law: \"If punching a policeman is a sin then we may as well pack up and go home.\" The priest who hears his confession himself erupts into indignant violent profanity. In another family, the father mercilessly beats his wife and son, who drowns himself when Siobhan confirms his expectation that she would never fall in love with the young boy.At the end Padraic, having supposedly won his satisfaction, is left alone. His sister gone, he brings his cows and horse into his house. This is his finally stable relationship. Colm is left with far more isolation than he requested. Indeed the entire community is left - as Colm admits to and suspects Siobhan of sharing - just \"entertaining myself while staving off the inevitable.\"\nThere is a true serenity and beauty in the island's bleak landscape. And even in this doomed community, a warmth and pathos emerge from the small, tense lives of paralysis and despair.And note this: if a calendar turning up April Fool's Day did not establish the 1923 setting there is nothing in this film's setting, speech and themes that could not represent today. If we don't see ourselves there we're the April Fool.",

The fact that we are so misrepresented by our fellow countrymen is disappointing. The most believable performances are by Pat Short and John Kenny who are unfortunately relegated to bit parts with very few lines. Barry Keoghan is the worst of a bad lot, he seems to have a different accent for every word.Again, as someone who comes from the west of Ireland I am very well acquainted with the inherent comedy and humour in our dialect of English, all of which was absent in this films script, the writers instead opted for a kind of hybrid of Americanisms, leprechauns and pirates. None of the idiosyncratic slang or sayings which I heard growing up were used. I was sincerely disappointed to see yet another film that portrays western Irish people as nothing more than bumpkins and simpletons, driving the few marginally intelligent people in their community to desperation and melancholy.

And the film gains in poignance and interest by being presented through dialogue that is as mordantly funny as it is insightful and a setting that is as starkly beautiful as it is isolated and lonely.Then Colm cuts off his finger and the film takes a lurch from the light/dark to the dark/darker as heavy handed allegory takes over from realism and the film becomes less and less compelling and more and more histrionic.

I have visited farmhouses where the lone farmer had hanged himself, leaving a cow to die and mummify in the barn. This film trivialises that sad situation.With pretensions of Greek tragedy (think Medea) this film is an embarrassment of fakery. Set in the Aran Islands in 1922, twelve years before Robert Flaherty's famous 'Man of Aran', it is a mishmash of inauthenticity and pointless horror. The script is simply unbelievable, the dialogue completely inauthentic and the indoor d\u00e9cors are about 50 years later than the Irish Civil War, gratuitously referred to. Being a rural Irishman myself, in the 1970s I visited people whose 'humble, thatched dwellings would have been much the same as those in the Aran Islands in the 1920s - apart from the wonderful novelty of bottled gas. I visited people whose sole means of cooking was an open fire, with kettle, griddle and hanging pot - and a collie nearby.When I was a child in the 1940s, it was quite common for chickens (another essential to life) to be in kitchens, but the makers of the movie obviously thought that a pony and an ass would be more of a laugh.'Black comedy' it is not. If it is a satire, it is of the crudest and most pointless kind. Allegory ? If so, impenetrable.Being filmed mostly on the Aran Islands, the 'scenic' shots and backgrounds are wonderful. They would have needed to be in thick fog not to be!Most of Ireland was in the grip of extremely pious Catholicism at the time, so the confessional scenes are simply grotesque. The swearing is not only inauthentic but in-your-face gratuitous. Nobody could have said 'It takes two to tango' on the Aran islands. 'Anyways' is a modern Americanism. No island policeman would have behaved in the way portrayed here; he would have been found drowned had he done so. And that's another huge flaw: there is no mention of the actual and crucial livelihood of fishing, upon which everyone on Irish islands depended. Did no-one associated with this film read the detailed books about precarious life on the Blasket Islands by Maurice O'Sullivan, Peig Sayers and Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Criomhthain ?I don't know why excellent actor Brendan Gleeson agreed to take part.The clothing is wrong. The bar very wrong ('whiskey' spelled 'whisky' !). (It is only recently as a result of Anglo-American cultural pressure that Irish bars have started calling themselves 'pubs'.) It was interesting that a postbox changed colour from bright British red to Free-State green during the action. The cottage interiors are far too luxurious. All the d\u00e9cors (and the actors) are far too clean. Most furniture would have been home-made, except of course in the priest's house. The character of the priest is simply a ridiculous New York caricature. As the title warns us, the whole gom film is a cheap burlesque with a good dose of ludicrous horror to increase the takings.",

            "content": "Sometimes the simplest of films can become one of the best of its consecutive year, or even an already great filmmaker's finest work. Martin McDonagh is one of my favourite working directors today. Whether you're talking about his excellent and hilarious debut with In Bruges back in 2008, or his award-worthy Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri in 2017, he is a filmmaker that hasn't made a single film that wasn't at least very, very good, at least to me. The Banshees of Inisherin marks his latest directorial effort and arguably his best. It's been a while since I went to the theatre and felt the filmmaking just leaping off the screen, but this one did that for me.The Banshees of Inisherin follows P\u00e1draic (Colin Farrell) as he lives a straightforward life on a small island in Ireland called Inisherin. Drinking at the local pub on a daily basis and only having one lifelong friend in Colm (Brendan Gleeson), he quickly learns that Colm no longer wishes to be his friend. Colm has his reasons, but they really don't make any logical sense, thus sparking P\u00e1draic's confusion and curiosity. Colm's one request is that P\u00e1draic just stop talking to him altogether, otherwise he is threatening to harm himself. That's it, that's the only story to this film, other than the very incredible dialogue that makes it all worth it.This film is a masterwork in how well a movie can work if you have great characters. P\u00e1draic and Colm are both very well written and Farrell and Gleeson both give arguably their best performances here. They both had me laughing hysterically and feeling awful at the same time. There were multiple occasions where the film was too funny to not laugh, but the subject matter was very dark, so I felt bad for doing so, and that to me was the brilliance of this film. The dialogue was the driving force here and that aspect was perfection to me.Martin McDonagh also wrote the screenplay for this film, which really makes me believe he won't ever make a bad movie. He has a knack for writing some of the most clever dialogue out there and his work throughout the years only seems to improve. He can also work exceptionally well with actors, which is why a film like this turns out so well with him behind the wheel. Everything from the camerawork to the subtle score, The Banshees of Inisherin, although dark and funny, is a masterwork of filmmaking, especially when it's such a simple premise. This is also a much darker film than any of his previous work, but that made the final act feel authentic to this story. I really don't have anything to complain about here.",

This is not that movie. Is it a dark comedy? To a point. Then it takes a quick turn into horror, which I realize is all the rage. There are moments of insight, especially with the priest in the confessional, which reinforces the notion that the Church is clueless as to how to help its mentally unstable parishioners. The theme I took: a seriously suicidal older man wreaks havoc on a younger man's live, resulting in both of them being deranged. And the sister would abandon her brother without inviting him along? Impossible. That's when the script failed for me. Granted, the actors are fantastic. The setting gorgeous, but we don't get glimpses of the grinding poverty which was no doubt evident. It's not realistic that the villagers would let an old man walk around with a bloody stump without attempting to bandage it.",

The plot is simple: one taciturn guy in a remote Irish village decides to not accept any contact with his best and oldest friend, with no explanation whatsoever, and the friend can't accept it. It is a deeply sad story, dealing with personal identity, despair, codependence, love - unrequited or otherwise.Like with \"In Bruges\" before, the triangle of Martin McDonagh, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson works perfectly. And it feels kind of similar too: deep scenes about people, but not much story. The movie feels like a landscape painting where you admire the care and detail on it, but you don't really care what it is about. And it is about a village in the middle of nowhere, after all.Bottom line: the best film I've seen in quite a while, but it doesn't cover all bases. Nor should it.

Among other issues, the viewer is asked to think about:. What loyalty do we owe a friend who has since become tiresome?. How is it that seemingly unbreakable bonds become broken?. What does it say about people that we often prefer the company of animals versus other humans to avoid the demands imposed by relationships?. Why do we sometimes deliberately \"cut ourselves off\" to avoid others?. How is it that one's craft/hobby, e.g.- music, art, etc., can provide more companionship than spending time with other people?If these concepts are of interest, you will find them examined and portrayed with magnificent skill in this film. The cinematography takes full advantage of the breathtaking Irish landscape, and it is no accident that the story unfolds on an island off the Ireland mainland; this is consistent with the overall premise that we are all, ultimately, islands unto ourselves, with a gulf between us and the rest of humanity that is often deeply difficult to cross.A final note: while the themes examined here are arguably timeless, the film feels especially relevant today as the current cultural warfare and political environment has resulted in the shattering of many friendships.",

            "content": "I'm going to offer Banshees a backhanded compliment in that they setup a premise and what follows isn't very densely plotted. There are two men on the island of Inisherin in 1923. They were good friends before (or \"seemingly\" good friends) but one day Colm decides he's had enough of Padraic's boorish behaviour and tells him that he doesn't like him anymore and they are no longer friends. Padraic is flummoxed by this and can't accept that his best friend won't socialize with him anymore. The situation devolves from there. If you add in his smart but lonely sister Siobhan and the nice but troublesome Dominic, that's almost the whole story. But while Banshees doesn't lean on its plot, what it does choose to focus on is the bizarre situation and the eccentric characters that populate the island. Padraic and Colm are complex and interesting even though we know so little about them and I thought the movie did a wonderful job of showing how awkward adult friendships are. This focal point just adds to the subtle but effective dark comedy that is peppered throughout the movie. Other than the villainous policeman, almost every character is engaging on some level and it's a credit to McDonagh as a writer/director for getting so much out of so little.Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson have already paired up for McDonagh's In Bruges and they were a stellar duo in that (I didn't love the movie overall but they're undeniably great together). They're both marvelous in this, I have to credit Farrell first. This character is such a departure from his handsome action-hero persona (it's been a good year for him between this and the Batman). He's an amazing character actor when given the right material and there's a lot of depth and subtlety to his portrayal of Padraic. He elicits so much sympathy for his sweet twit of a character who can't understand why his best friend won't talk to him. Brendan Gleeson is also great as Colm, his character is much more in his wheelhouse. Gleeson is one of the best at playing likeable smarmy jerks and while his character is hard to understand, Gleeson's charm keeps you from completely turning on Colm. His quiet anger is palpable and his madness is puzzling but Gleeson helps the movie make you want to see where this goes next. Many reviewers have justifiably pointed out Barry Keoghan's fantastic work as the quietly sarcastic but sympathetic Dominic. His work in Banshees should garner awards consideration but my favourite supporting performance came from Kerry Condon's work as Padraic's savvy and kind sister Siobhan. Her frustration with Padraic's behaviour is completely relatable and so is her continued befuddlement. Her exasperated scolding of her brother helps contextualize how ridiculous Padraic and Colm's rowing is and she seems like the only normal person in the cast of characters.The Banshees of Inisherin would be classified as a dark comedy first and foremost and through most of the movie, I laughed a lot. The jokes are dropped in a very silent and understated manner but they're simply hilarious. The dialogue is tightly written and the actors deliver exquisitely. At the 3/4 point of the movie though, the story and tone shift considerably however. I still liked the direction it went and I got what the movie was trying to say (it's a metaphor for the Irish Civil War) but it just wasn't as affecting for me as it was for other viewers. It punctuated how dark the escalation of the conflict was and who it affected but I preferred the comedy. The ending tries to leave it open ended and that also was a mixed bag. These changes made the movie feel more like an art-house picture and more geared towards a specific audience. This is all well and fine as it was clearly intended but I wasn't as keen on it as critics were. This shift in the narrative took the movie down a notch for me.I haven't even gotten into how beautifully shot and captured the setting is in Banshees and that's worth noting too. This movie is a well captured and well shot slice of life period piece that is better than it has any right to be. The actors are perfectly cast, the movie wrings interesting moments out of the simplest premise and it feels tautly paced even though the story meanders quite a bit. The climax and the ending just didn't quite work for me as well and that's fine. It didn't knock the movie's grade down a ton but it firmly placed it as an 8 instead of a 9 or a 10. I'd still recommend it however and I'm not surprised at the attention it's getting. It isn't going to be accessible to all audiences but if you're in Inisherin's niche I have little doubt you're really going to dig this movie.",

Director Martin McDonagh has turned out a memorable movie and has extracted superlative performances fron Colin Farrel, Brendan Gleeson and Kerry Condon. Its all about two friends, their heartbreak, hurt and loneliness when friendship goes wrong and friends become foes. The movie charms you with a devastating simplicity rarely seen and I don't think it would be right to call it a dark comedy due to sporadic bits of humour. The setting is a less populated idyllic island off Ireland and the period is the 1920s. The friendship of Colin and Brendan is put to a test when Brendan decides to break away as he finds Colin dull, dim and a waste of time\n( aimless chatting he says). What follows is tumultuous for both as they take up a confrontational attitude. Kerry ( who plays Colin's sister) turns peacemaker and tries to pacify Colin without success. The scenes are brought to life not only by the superb acting, dialogue and direction but also the breathtaking cinematography of the island's features. While the beach and the greenery around is mesmerizing, the horse cart trudging along, the grocery shop, the bar etc look very realistic. Both Brendan and Colin have given award worthy performances. Kerry too impresses as the affectionate spinster sister. ( Luckily there are no family complications as both men don't have wives and the sister is unmarried.)",

Well, the entirety of this film was less inventive then such a rushed ending.The actions and counter-actions of the two main protagonists, particularly Colm, were utterly ridiculous to behold. The two (saving) graces were firstly, the acting performances, particularly of Kerry Condon and the stupendous Barry Keoghan, and secondly, the beautifully-shot West of Ireland scenery.

It's 1923, Irish Civil war. Smoke at the horizon, thunder of heavy weapons in the distance. A dark witch-like old woman predicting upcoming deaths. Dark clouds in the sky. Self-destruction as an act of aggression itself is followed by the inevitable irrational spiral of violence, turning into sadness at first and later into madness, not only focusing on the two friends, but spreading out in circles. The irrational demise of this friendship is a clear symbol of what happens to whole nations and their leaders, to their soul and population in times of war, when no-one is able to understand what's going on and why, the so called reasons for this insanity are stupid lies, and hate, violence and man-slaughter continue in unstoppable dynamic escalation.I read in many comments that viewers don't seem to understand what's happening and why. It's War!All around us. Today. We are unable to understand why.

            "content": "It's ironic that, when I was younger and knew nothing, I used to imagine Ireland as this merry land of jolly folk songs and people peacefully getting drunk on ale just to sing and dance to those songs, and maybe to write a few more.It's equally ironic to recall how this naive image was shattered. Not through learning the history of English occupation. Not even through learning about The Great Hunger. It was through observing images of those patchwork fields on the slopes near the shore. With nothing but grass around, not a single tree. And those stone hedges that weren't even meant to demark land owned by different people, but rather to protect this already almost barren stony soil from eroding even further and just leaking and blowing into the ocean. It was the epitome of hopelessness and some kind of quiet realisation, that there's no solution here, and this is how things will remain. With no promise of any happy ending, or happy beginning or being for that matter.Those fields. It was enough to have a single look to feel this anguish. Stuff that makes village people drink themselves to death or find quicker ways of reaching the same bitter end.The Banshees of Inisherin manages to do what I didn't think was possible. It amplifies this feeling, makes it take shape, almost turns it into something palpable, and delivers it right into your core so that you shiver even if you're thousands of miles away from those bare windy shores. And it does all that through another unparalleled trick. The vessel that carries this heavy spirit is not some huge riveting conflict. But rather its polar opposite. The most minuscule thing imaginable. A story of one man becoming boring for another one.We are so used to attaching strong emotions to strong stimulation that at first this film feels deafeningly underwhelming. It is so silently uneventful that you might decide that you just lost your hearing. Yet it's through this eerie quiet that we start hearing things that we didn't even know existed. What once looked dull and bleak now turns into a cacophony so loud that one would literally need to distract themselves with pain to stop hearing it.It's not a problem when your friend is dull if you are surrounded with shiny bright sources of cheap stimulation, like all of us are in this modern ever-connected world. But what if your whole universe contracts to a small patch of land with a small group of people on it, desperate for novelty but so used to that desperation that suppressing it becomes a national character? How do you convince yourself that you're still alive, and, even if you are, that your life has any essence and value at all?With only what the life of a small Irish settlement could provide, Martin McDonagh creates something that's at the same time a Boschian pandemonium and a frozen circle of Dantean hell. Where everything moves and talks and bleats at once, but nothing really happens and nothing really matters. In a way, your only hope at sanity is your own blindness and deafness. But once you un-dull yourself, existence becomes a race against time and things that don't push you forward pull you down instead.All this ambiguous and quite nutty complexity is tough to coherently put into words. But the power quartet of Colin Farell, Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan make this almost religious revelation entirely visceral. Through those quite simplistic facial movements these people let us in on the horrors of being trapped inside the routine, feeling brutally lonely while among people, and just suffocating with the mundane and the transient. You could feel it so close that the shattering experience of watching TBoI isn't even in its gory moments (although those are awfully disturbing), but in the despair of sitting next to a person you hold dear - yet knowing that there's a wall between you that can't be overcome, and just crying helplessly.I'm not sure of the film offers any sensible amount of hope at the end. Can redemption be achieved simply via suffering? Does a symbolic sacrifice of one life breathe in life into someone else, so robotic and predictable that they could just as well be dead? And if it does, is there a single chance for this newly found life to have a semblance of, if not meaning then at least value? There's no way to know that. Because, sated with this ritual suffering, banshees are silent now, they sit back, amused, and observe. And all we can do is follow suit.",

That historic context might have better explained the depths Colm is willing to go to force Padraic to leave him alone. As it stands, the story is triggered by episodes of inchoate male pride that sometimes produce gruesome consequences.

One day, he calls round the home of his friend, Colm (Brendan Gleason), only to get ignored, before Colm bluntly tells him that he no longer wants to be friends with him in the pub. Unable to make sense of his former companion's stance, and with only the socially stunted Dominic (Barry Keoghan) as a substitution, Padraic tries to pick the brains of his sister, Siobhan (Kerry Condon) about what might be going on, but as Colm's actions become increasingly unhinged, a conflict brews that could destroy everything.2008's In Bruges was a crowd pleaser hit, that generated a cult following with cinema goers, with its jazzy storytelling and severely near-the-knuckle jokes, which may not be tolerated as much in the present climate, but which remained ingrained in the collective consciousness of cinematic memory. Now the stars have reunited with writer-director Martin McDonagh for this more restrained but equally curious offering, which gradually reveals itself to be a period piece (confirmed when a calandar is turned revealing April 1923), when it becomes clear there are none of the trappings of modern times revealing themselves anywhere. This remote, secluded area, is the perfect backdrop for what feels like such a simple, childlike story that evolves in to something more.It's driven primarily by the mystery element to the story, behind what actually lies behind Colm's sudden abandonment of Siobhan and what's driving him to disassociate himself from his former friend, especially in such a dull, uneventful place, with so few people around and the presence of a good friend such a blessing. But as it drags on, it becomes increasingly far fetched, and begins to outstay its welcome in the third act, where it descends in to something of a shaggy dog tale, which doesn't leave you with much in the way of a resolution. A shame, since Farrell and Gleason manage the same chemistry and charm they had in In Bruges, if not with the same explosive results, and there is some beautiful cinematography of the Irish landscape.It was always inevitable that everyone behind such a well loved film as In Bruges would try to recreate the magic with a new project, even if we had to wait a while for it. The result is a film that could have been as perfect if it had just stayed on course and not worn the premise out with quite so much wear and tear. ***",

One of them, Colm, prefers silence over chatter, creativity over banality, and playing music over drinking beer. The other one, Padraic, doesn't understand why his friend decides to offend him by making these choices. He prefers kindness over everything else. It's radicalism against pragmatism.If you look at it this way, the film is an allegory for the state of the world in 2023. Radicals are fighting pragmatists everywhere, from the US to Israel, and from Iran to Afghanistan. And the message of the film is clear: radicalism is a short cut to self harm. You'll understand it when you see the film.You can have endless discussions after seeing this film, which is why it's such a good movie. But even better: you don't have to search for a deeper meaning to enjoy it. It's already brilliant as just a crazy story about two people on a remote island off the Irish coast.The great thing about the movie is that it is hilarious at some points, but also very dramatic at other moments. It shares this quality with Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, the other masterpiece by director Martin McDonagh. The dialogue is very funny, but at the same time this is not an outright comedy, not even a black one. The script is a classic drama, with a good narrative arc and perfectly developed characters. There's no good versus bad in this film. Viewers can sympathize with both characters, because there's something to say for each of their arguments.And then there's one other great thing about the movie: the location. The isolated island and its tightly knit community, where the men gossip at the pub and the women at the grocery store, is a crucial element to the story. But it also adds a layer of pure beauty. The landscapes are nothing less than breathtaking.This is film making as it should be: a good story, great actors and strong direction. Just leave it to Martin McDonagh to deliver.",

Two middle aged men, apparently friends for years, are going through a mysterious crisis. One of them suddenly refuses to speak to the other, and Colin Farrell can't figure out why his old friend has turned hostile. It's Ireland, so of course there's a pub, a Catholic Church, a hovel where Farrell lives with his sister - and another where his friend Brendan Geeson lives alone. And there are goats, a dog and donkey. For a while the dialog misleads us with its quaint charm and it seems we're easing our way into comical territory. However, Mr. Geeson's behavior becomes increasingly irrational and darkly troubled. Before long Farrell, too, becomes a bit unhinged. It becomes clear that there are things beneath the surface of their relationship that are determined to break through and see the light of day. Only a few fleeting moments hint at their deep feelings for each other, but it seems a subject neither one has ever articulated. The movie is a masterful study of friendship on the edge of becoming something deeper, though the chances of that ever happening seem remote. A beautifully made, immensely moving film that gives both actors the roles of their careers - and us? We get the best movie of the year.",

I guess if you don't take it too seriously and not complain about the overall dullness of the screenplay and lack of any meaningful plot which creates a barrier for the viewer to fully engage and make any real sense about the cause of the impasse.All in all, 'The Banshees of Inisherin' is not as memorable as 'In Bruges' and it seems this kind of comedy drama plays out within its genre peculiarities and does so somewhat well but its convoluted and often boring and unnecessarily existential like my review.

            "content": "With films such as \"In Bruges\" and \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\" Martin McDonagh has cemented himself as an auteur defined by a perversely clever sense of dark humor. I have liked his other films, but not quite as much as some do. Given that I really like Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, I was looking forward to this film, which is a tragicomic fable about an ending friendship on a remote Irish island in 1923. The film is well-acted and well-made on a number of levels, but it lacks the character development or introspectiveness to make an interpersonal, character-driven film like this truly great.No character-driven film could be strong without engaging performances, and fortunately, \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" has a few noteworthy ones. Colin Farrell's performance is very strong, portraying an emotional range, whip-smart line delivery, and a deep-seated sense of empathy. Brendan Gleeson is impressive as well, but his character and performance are a bit more one-note than Farrell's. Kerry Condon is consistently excellent as Farrell's character's sister, and Barry Keoghan is sharp as well. With gorgeous cinematography of the Irish coast and a beautifully understated, elegant-but-everyman score, \"Banshees\" is very technically well-made for a film of its type and scope. Given that McDonagh is especially noteworthy by critics for his showy dialogue, the film's screenplay serves as its most critical component to this film's distinctiveness. This ends up being both a plus and a minus. McDonagh's writing is laced with the type of razor-sharp, profane, caustically-hilarious one-liners that we expect from him. Yet the film could have used a more structured narrative and a genuine plot. While both P\u00e1draic and Colm are moderately interesting characters in the here and now, more sufficient attention to character development and how their friendship was in the past would have been helpful to provide appropriate narrative context across the screenplay more generally. When the film ends, it does feel like the film could have had more to say or a greater point or meaning, and the impacts of feud between P\u00e1draic and Colm do not necessarily feel fully satisfying from a narrative perspective. For those reasons, \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" ends up being a good but not great dark comedy. 7/10.",

            "content": "So begins his pleading P\u00e1draic S\u00failleabh\u00e1in when his life-long friend Colm Doherty told him he wants to have nothing to do with him from now on. Played by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson respectively, you might think his line is strange. But that is because Colm has no reason to break up his bromance other than the fact that he doesn't like P\u00e1draic no more.Yes, that is the premise of Martin McDonagh's latest movie, \"The Banshees of Inisherin\". His directing, together with the whimsicality of real-life BFFs Farrell and Gleeson are slowly becoming one of the most complementary trios in the history of cinema: think Scorsese-De Niro-DiCaprio. So, let's start with McDonagh who is slowly molding himself into an auteur of his craft, mainly because of his ability to write characters living on the edge between comedy and tragedy. Sure, Tarantino, for instance, is a better director, but he deals in extreme human beings, outlandish spectacle and the absurd. McDonagh's characters are absurd as well, but they are also realistic. It wouldn't be hard to imagine two friends like P\u00e1draic and Colm could've actually existed, living through the bloody Irish Revolution of 1923.As for Farrell and Gleeson, their chemistry rivals that of the great classic comics like Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy or Abbott and Costello. Farrell, in the performance of his career, plays a simple milkman living with his sister and tending for his animals. Because ignorance is bliss, his incidental pragmatism makes him deal with life as it comes, never thinking beyond the things he sees in front of him, nor he would if he could. He doesn't care. Colm, on the other hand, is a musician and fiddle player who feels death is closing in and only now realizing he's wasted most of his life, so he'd now rather focus on creating a lasting piece of art before he will forever fade. I know, talk about midlife crisis. Under McDonagh's directing, though, \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" overwhelms its ridiculous and silly characters and transforms them and the movie itself into a touching, shocking take on existential dread and powerlessness in the face of the inevitable. Still, the human characters save it from being pretentions. It's a beautiful balance between the silly and the profound and, honestly, you have to see it to truly understand it. It definitely left a lasting mark on me.If you're curious about the name, \"Inisherin\" is a fictional island off the coast of Ireland--its denizens isolated from the war happening literally across the pond. Often, explosions are heard, but the inhabitants of Inisherin watch the revolution as outsiders, as if they don't belong. For them, the war is nothing more than an irritating inconvenience. Their lives will go on the same regardless. Which brings me to one of the movie's greatest points: its anti-war stance. McDonagh is all about subtility, so instead of dramatizing the bloodshed caused by war, he imposes upon it the greatest of insults: to be ignored. What would make one angrier other than knowing that he could die in vain, fighting for nothing other than pride? This is the pride carried by Colm, who is so obsessed with his legacy that he doesn't even stop to think whether the victory is worth it. And what would that victory even be? That he might be remembered? It's a noble artistic aspiration but also a hollow one--just like the victory of a bloody war.In all this guy-centric chaos, it is P\u00e1draic's sister, Siobh\u00e1n (Kerry Condon) who displays genuine wisdom. She is our anchor in the movie, and also an anchor into the outside world, but even she becomes overwhelmed by the ongoing conflict between the two friends in which she often plays the mediator: \"you're all stupid\" she yells at one point.But the most drastic of all, is P\u00e1dric's transformation from the simpleton he is into a man traumatized by betrayal and consumed by loneliness. His break-up from Colm is more tragic than most romantic break-ups, his reactions range from bursting into tears to bursting into Colm's house and the emotional weight is relentless getting heavier and heavier as the movie goes on. After watching it, I got up from my seat trying to make sense of everything I've felt. Even now, I am still trying to.",

With help from his sister and a troubled young islander, P\u00e1draic sets out to repair the damaged relationship by any means necessary. However, as Colm's resolve only strengthens, he soon delivers an ultimatum that leads to shocking consequences.Martin McDonagh directs with such care and consideration for the acting performances of the cast, as well as the breathtaking spring setting of Ireland at its most beautiful. The multiple wide focus angles greeted with little meaningful dialogue, allows the audience to appreciate the cinematography and subtle aspects of the film.The back and forth between Gleeson and Farrell is golden entertainment, the former offering a passive, melancholic presence in opposition to the latter, who assumed an eager and determined characterisation of a desperate man epitomising the difficulties of maintaining societal framework on an island as quiet and close-knit as Inisherin.We are reminded of the values of friendship through the disappointment of Padraig, as well as the importance of family, through his whole-hearted sister Shivon too.

Brilliant acting from the leads and the slow pace of life in such a beautiful remote setting made it an easy watch even if a rather dark tale was at the centre of it. You will feel sorry for some of the characters, dislike a few and be baffled by one of the main characters but understand him more as the film progresses towards it's finale.

            "content": "On a small island off the coast of Ireland in the 1920's, dairy farmer Colin Farrell calls on Brendon Gleason every day at 2:00 PM and they go down to the pub together. Only on this day, Gleason does not answer the door. He just sits in a chair smoking in full view of Farrell until he goes away.When they do run into each other at the pub later on, Gleason informs Farrell that he doesn't like him anymore and he is to stay away. When pushed, he explains that a sense of his limited time has started to overwhelm him, and he wants to spend more time writing music (he plays the fiddle) and less time talking to dull men. When pushed farther, he informs Farrell he'll cut off one of his own fingers ever time Farrell bothers him. He is not bluffing.There's a lot going on in this film, and I love that it manages to tackle so much without feeling heavy. It's about male friendship and how bad we are at dealing with emotions. It's about depression and existential dread. It's a black comedy of manners and a pretty serious meditation on the fleeting nature of human existence. It has a really wonderful scene stealing donkey.I really like this film and I suspect I will grow to like it even more on repeat viewing. Farrell and Gleason are as good a pair here as they were in \"In Bruges\", yet they couldn't be more different. Kerry Condon steals the movie out from under them as Farrell's smarter sister (She has some wonderful scenes that really contrast male and female perspectives on life.) Barry Keoghan steals more scenes as a funny little weirdo.",

The seemingly trivial neighborhood spats that they engage in are absurd to the greatest comedic extent, but the film itself never veers into unbelievable territory.McDonagh's screenplay is bursting with wit and with sadness as his townspeople respond to their social hopelessness with actions that only fuel the fire of their desperate isolation. It creates so many thoughts and feelings in a viewer as they ponder on what each unfolding situation could have been.Despite visual direction that is fairly standard and a couple of dangling plot threads that I personally would have liked to see explored more deeply, the film is emotionally engaging and full of verbal personality to spare.",

How many 'hold my beer' moments would happen??). Even though I'm usually pretty good with accents, for this one you definitely need subtitles. The movie start with P\u00e1draic S\u00failleabh\u00e1in, trying to understand why his best friend Colm Doherty stopped talking to him (because he doesn't like him no more). The movie is gorgeous in lots of ways, from the cast (Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon, etc.), to the landscapes, passing by all the feelings you go through. It feels like you are on the island with the characters, that you are living Colm's betrayal yourself, and you truly feel for P\u00e1draic. It could have been a bleak picture of a small island where the only distraction is a pub and alcohol, but you very much have this sense of community, where this friendship crumbling makes everyone wonder what happened.

The populace is found at the pub, and sharing \"news\" (gossip) from each village. What ignites the drama in the plot is one friend rejecting another friend, who is considered a dullard. From here, each step triggers another reaction that escalates to the final acts of the film. Along the way, life in the village adds characters and small dramatic points that add to the absurdity and comedy of the film.But, a underlying theme of the film entails the progression of life, the limits of time, and the reality of mortality. Grief and loss are catalysts for introspection and analysis of the relationships in our lives. From this, we are able to see how some will take what life offers to survive, and others just falter and fail. This is where the film shines and dazzles with the storytelling through a simple story and simple folks.All aspects of this film are excellent. Acting, writing, cinematography, music, and direction are top notch. Let the scenes draw you into the story, and open yourself to a slice of life that strikes deeper than we would care.",

            "content": "Banshees of Inisherin is an interesting one, to say the least. It boils down to a feud between two friends on a small island and how that is escalated. At first impression, I love the settings. Beautiful locations with suitable camerawork. I learned later thatthe movie was filmed in multiple locations across the Irish isles but regardless, they made it pretty seamless. I had slight difficulty understanding the heavy Irish accent - probably capturing maybe 7-80% of the lines, which kind of sucked because the movie was mostly dialogue. Felt very play-like given the legendary playwright Martin McDonagh made this movie. I have never heard of him until now but this was certainly a good introduction to him.The writing was top-notch. Introduces the conflict right away. First half of the movie is rather hilarious though it gets darker toward the end. All the performances were amazing. Every single one of them pushed it pretty far. It was also good to see Kerry Condon, also known as Stacey Ehrmantraut in the Better Call Saul universe. She and Barry Keoghan were some of the standout supporting characters in the movie.The movie's main theme is loneliness and mortality. We see how Padraic, who was the typical nice guy, transform into something much darker as he loses everything around him, including his lifelong friend, Colm (entirely by Colm's choice), his sister Siobhan, his pet donkey and somewhat of a friend, Dominic. Loneliness affects people differently and I thought that this film portrayed very well how Padraic handles this. It was also meaningful in that it discusses how one handles the dreadful question of existential crisis, which Colm goes through. The main conflict of the film is that Colm cuts off Padraic overnight because he was too dull for Colm and wanted to try to carve some meaning out of his remaining life. I loved that it was subtly introduced to the audience as the priest asks Colm about how his despair is during his confession.I related to both of these characters quite heavily. Loneliness does sometimes make you angry to the point of no return. I've also had close friends who was very different from me (dull, if you would say) but the circumstances have kept us close. However, there were times where I wanted to cut those kind of friends out from my life just because I wanted to feel like I'm never wasting my time away. So I understand Colm's decision albeit I would probably take a less drastic approach to handling relationships. The irony is that because he cuts his fingers off for the determination that he would make something of his life, he no longer can play music, which seemed like the purpose of his life. Perhaps he will be remembered for his self-mutilation than his music, and that could be why he took such drastic measures. To feel alive and to be remembered.Many often avoid or push away the grim reality of mortality. We all die one day and there will be a time nobody remembers you most likely. How does that thought affect us? How could you find balance between the small joys of life and its overarching goal?Banshees of Inisherin makes you wonder about these questions. And to them I have no answers.",

            "content": "It's no spoiler. You can understand what will happen in the whole movie by just understanding what \"Banshee\" means. It basically means the woman who doesn't understand man aspect of humanity therefore these women assumes men are similar to woman therefore even though these woman trying to help a man they ironically make things worst because basically some woman are a kid who mistakenly believe they are wise. Just because your name is Sophie doesn't make you wise, honey.So in this movie men have a peaceful life until a man starts to act like a woman. For men being alone is peace. It's not bad nor mental illness. Men don't feel lonely (but they can feel like it would be nice to have family on their own but it's no biggie), but women feel lonely therefore women can care so much about romantic relationships to find themselves a husband who can make them feel loved and to don't feel lonely. But men can easily live on a planet alone and they are okay with it because silence and being with their own thoughts and feelings makes men serene therefore married men tend to literally escape from their wives when their wives are too negative and talk too much especially but not respecting men's need of silence. But women feel fear when things are silent so they talk to feel a sense of security. Women actually finds stuff to do just to don't start to think about negative stuff.Women have no man in themselves therefore women cannot understand how men are but men are half women therefore men can understand women very well but some women believe men cannot understand women. In reality for a man dealing with a woman is very similar to how to deal with a baby. A man always tries to make the woman happy because they don't want to see women cry and be sad all day but women can be like a baby who seeks attention and makes the man make themselves happy all the time. Any parent needs alone time with their baby otherwise they go mad. Also like how babies are, woman can try to convince themselves that they are suprase their own father so they can have insecurities about themselves and a wish to prove their ability to anyone who seems condescending. That's why women can show off their body and intellects while men don't. Men don't show off, they just get the job done. Women show off and act like they make the job done and want to feel like they made a big deal stuff.In this movie we see a man (Colin Farrell -> P\u00e1draic) acting like a woman. P\u00e1draic ignores the wish of an older man (Brendan Gleeson -> Colm want to be alone from time to time therefore P\u00e1draic seek Colm's attention in any way and therefore annoys Colm. Normally everyone gets bored with people temporarily and even when we want to socialize as a man we want to change which kind of people we want to socialize because old people get boring at a certain point therefore every people tend to have lots of different friends so they can have fun. This is how it's in a village and whatnot communities so what happens is normal. Also women don't want to be alone therefore they have lots of friends to go whenever they feel lonely. In that regard a woman can be like emotional vampire.What's not normal is, P\u00e1draic 's character pressing too much on why Colm doesn't want to see him. This is an every day situation so everyone is aware of why someone doesn't want to see them \"right now\" so you don't even have to explain to situation to them. They understand you don't want them so they leave and come back later or you come to them. This is like relationship 101. But for the sake of a bad script humanity 101 ignored too.In the movie, there are women who make things worst because they are women, they don't understand the man aspect in men therefore their advice and what they assume makes things too worst between P\u00e1draic and Colm. These women should realize men are both man and woman so understanding only the woman aspect in men is a big mistake. And when men have a harmony between man and woman aspect in themselves they can be a sane person, when this harmony is disrupted men have an inner battle which turns them into dark side of humanity.So constant bother of P\u00e1draic makes Colm insane therefore Colm does anything to ensure his peace and in the meanwhile the women who caused war between men blame these men and leave them and some women fetchs a popcorn and watch these men hurt themselves in their personal war.What I liked about the movie is they really understood what the bible tries to tell you. Adam didn't do anything wrong until Eve made Adam insane and forced him to eat the apple. In bible the \"apple\" is the knowledge you don't need. Knowledge is power and that kind of unneeded power caused a person to go insane and hurt themselves and each other. So in this movie the unneeded knowledge makes these men have a pointless personal war while women cannot see they started the war. Men are okay with facts and they seek peace while women always seek a problem and to find a problem they write a story in their heads and these stories can disrupts the inner peace of men and therefore men does mistakes so no wonder in so many cultures there were societies that men were living alone and this was kinda the reason for why the army was only for men. No wonder the witch hunt was a thing. Sad but these are historical facts. Weirdly women tend to tell lots of lies comparing to men. Sometimes women lies a men to test them for whatever reason. So the God is probably a woman.What I also liked in the movie is, everyone in the village was peaceful even though they could see explosions of war on another island but their peace is ruined only after women made things worst in the village.But worst aspect of the movie is (the reason why my score for the movie is 1) how unrealistic the main characters are because of how these men also behave like a women and women only behave like a insane woman in a way the movie try to make people think women are evil and men are like a women. So in real life such things are unlikely to happen because this is not the \"man's way\" of living life and not all women are like that. Some women always assume the worst and invent BS stories in their heads and these stories may make people believe they are real. Fear can fuel a great imagination and apophenia as much as love. So in bible \"devil speak to you if you let it\" stuff is actually how fear and/or lust can make a human imagine unrealistic stuff so their brain invents a story (lies). That's why a part of being a man is seeking silence and having immense willpower to don't listen to the \"devil\" inside of them therefore men always have an inner battle with themselves to don't ruin the peace by ensuring the harmony between their man and woman aspects but some women being dynamite, a ruiner of peace just for their own selfish gains. No wonder there were lots of wars that happened just because of women. No wonder there are women who turned a good man into evil and these women usually never understand their fault and die as a cat lady. Fear makes women attack others for no reason, even their own child so in lots of culture women beat even their husband and the husband knows why but they don't even yell at their wife. But in lots of culture men is aware letting women do their own thing will ruin the peace and family so men feel like they should make the women fear from themselves by assuming leadership therefore they being toxic. But the solution is sincere love in right time and right dosage otherwise women go insane and ruin peace so yeah more than needed love makes a woman toxic and that's how I met your mother after being so close \"friends\".",

The film is beautifully shot, the plot is captivating, deep and meaningful, the cast was wonderful. Colin Farrel and Kerry Condon were simply perfect in their roles. It is a really sad story about the end of a long lasting friendship, we get to understand the reasons why Colm wants to interrupt this relationship and things will gradually escalate, until the point of non-return. There are some touching moments, where you really get to see the pain of Padraic for this terrible loss, almost like he was mourning the death of someone. I personally experienced the end of an important friendship, I say that the depiction is believable, as a part of you figuratively dies. The sister Shioban, served as some kind of intermediary between the two men. Her strong personality and determination made this whole movie dynamic and well paced. The images of the rural island on Inisherin are absolutely stunning. The representation of the people living on such small territory is likely, especially in a time without the internet. They are simple people that are not able to formulate complex talks, that must be really bored and overall lonely, seeking excitement in the most futile things. It is always nice to see that big actors partake in more \"philosophical\" productions, bringing in cinemas more people to watch something different than the usual blockbuster.",

The tourist board of Inisherin might be overwhelmed with requests, if only it were not a mythical place....a bit of an Achille's Heel for Achill Island.Still the Emerald Isle is magical nonetheless. Some of the drone shots are exultant as are views looking out at the endless ocean. More often though the action is framed by dark, tight doorways. If this were a big budget film, it would be shown in damp-o-vision with humidifiers keeping you and your seat in the mist.Anyways I am always eager to see a McDonagh movie, more so with Gleeson and Farrell in the mix. Had this on tap as soon as it was set to stream. That said my initial review seems to have tickled the censor-bots as I used the more gentle Irish slang for one of George Carlin's magnificent seven words.Anyways, in short and spoiler-free, I felt the film to be more about the loss of innocence, then about the heartbreak of failed friendship or the need for an artist to silently break away from the daily grind binding them.The shots of the various livestock, pets and otherwise, added to the element of innocence watching helplessly. As did Barry Keough's portrayal of Dom. If you found him eerily captivating here and have not seen Barry in Yorgos Lanthimos' \"Killing of a Sacred Deer\" - please have a gander at that remarkable film.Maybe one word of caution for the film at hand, there are some pretty brutal elements and they tend to muscle out the comedy over time. But there is plenty of both, and tings to tink about too.Ultimately the film left me sad and reflective, kind of like seeing the comments on online videos when my kids were watching when they were seven. I won't expect many to feel that same specific sense of shame in mankind, but maybe the feeling is more akin to forever wars and such. And that is of many topics briefly touched upon in this fine film.Oh one other last minor comment, as a well-lapsed Catholic, I still appreciate any McDonagh film with a confession scene or three in 'em. That and honor among family, very strong here. Got my Irish up to be certain. I've hardly said a word about Kelly Condon as the sister to Farrell's Padraic, but she's more than capable of speaking up for herself.Enough said, I've gone and talked myself up from an 8 to 9 on this and I'm not sure if the director and cast take pride in the double gaussian range of ratings here, but sure and that's a sign of strong, smart and not safe film.Hold such films in the palm of your hand when you can, even if it's a bit precarious to do so.",

            "content": "'The Banshees Of Inisherin (2022)' is a bleak black comedy about, as star Colin Farrell puts it, \"the disintegration of joy\" that occurs when a man's best friend decides he just doesn't like him anymore. The picture's overwhelming domesticity doesn't dilute its absolute devastation, instead making it that much more impactful. It's as funny as it is unsettling, an absurdly desperate attempt to prevent the inevitable end of everything one holds dear and preserve some sort of blissful balance. Though deliberately mundane, there is nothing dull about the picture's quaint period setting. In fact, it makes its narrative all the more compelling, taking the kind of feuds normally reserved for much more obviously genre fare and planting them firmly in the milieu of day-to-day life. Everyone brings their A-game here, from the excellent actors to the writer-director to the donkeys and dogs; it represents quite possibly career-best efforts from Martin McDonagh (whose screenplay refreshingly shows a mature restraint often missing from his work), Kerry Condon, Barry Keoghan, Brendan Gleeson and the aforementioned Colin Farrell. Its ending caught me a little of guard, but not because it isn't the perfect place to finish. Instead, it surprised me because I was so involved in the story I could have happily watched it unfold for another hour. Of course, the ambiguity of the ending is key to its success and any further scenes would likely have overstayed their welcome. From the moment it begins, the piece hooks you and doesn't let you go; it's every bit as compelling as any conventional thriller. It's great.",

            "content": "Back in 2008, Writer/Director Martin McDonagh scored an improbable hit with IN BRUGES, a tale of two hitmen \"laying low\" in...well...Bruges, Belgium while awaiting instructions from their boss. During this down time these two characters muse about the meanings of life and love in a wonderful, Oscar Nominated, character study.15 years later, McDonagh does it again with THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN.Set in the 1920s in the fictional Island of Inisherin (off the coast of Ireland), BANSHEES reunites Writer/Director McDonagh with his two stars of the previous film - Brendan Gleeson (\"Mad Eye\" Mooney in the Harry Potter films) and Colin Farrell (unrecognizable as The Penguin in the recent BATMAN movie) - and the resultant character study is just as interesting and intriguing to watch in a setting just as interesting...and breath-takingly beautifully bleak.McDonagh, more than likely, will be nominated (as he was with IN BRUGES) for his screenplay for this film - it IS Oscar worthy - but for me, he was better as the Director of this character study, pointing his camera with a keen eye and surety in what he wanted to show all the while letting the performers and the countryside tell the story.Both lead performers (and the Supporting Actors) are perfectly cast. Farrell, as Padraic,is the protagonist - a simple man who just wants to be able to go to the pub everyday and have conversation with his best friend, Colm (Gleeson) who, one day, proclaims that he no longer wants to be friends with Padraic. Padraic, then spends the rest of the film trying to understand why this is so, what happened and what he can do to make amends.Farrell will earn an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the simple (but not simple-minded) Padraic who is having a hard time grappling with deeper issues seeping into his simple life. Farrell has really grown into a fine actor and he (at this point in time) has to be considered on of the FrontRunners for the Best Actor Oscar for his work in this film.Just as good is Gleeson as Colm, the recalcitrant, stoic friend who stubbornly wants nothing to do with Padraic. In lesser hands, this character could have come off as \"one-note\" being, simply, an immovable object in the way of Padraic's irresistible force, but in Gleeson's skilled hands, Colm has layers and depth that seep out through the cracks of his stoney facade. I would not be surprised if Gleeson, too, is nominated for an Oscar (probably in the Supporting category).These two are capably assisted by Kerry Condon (Stacey Ehrmantraut in BETTER CAUL SAUL) and Barry Keoghn (DUNKIRK) as Padraic's sister and a friend of both Padraic and Colm (respectively). Both bring their \"A\" games to this film and truly show the meaning of the term \"Supporting\" in \"Supporting Performance\".Special mention needs to be made for the Cinematography of Ben Davis (GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY) who brings beauty to the bleak, stark and harsh Irish countryside. This cinematography is, actually, another character of this piece and brings strong emotional support to the performances.Not the fastest moving film you will ever see, THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN is an interesting, intriguing - and beautifully shot - character study that will stay with you long after the film ends.Letter Grade: A-8 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

That plot is the spontaneous decision to end their friendship in the 1920's on a remote island in Ireland. Brendan Gleason is the composer who decides to end his friendship with Colin Farrell. Farrell does not understand, or accept, Gleeson's decision and this creates the volatile, tragic, and sometimes laughable chronology of events that unfold in this movie.

            "content": "As a huge fan of \"In Bruges\" and \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\", I was excited to see Martin McDonagh's \"The Banshees of Inisherin\". The film exceeded my expectations, not only because it feels more mature and focused in its storytelling than McDonagh's previous works, but also because it is more character driven and strikes the perfect balance between tragedy, human foibles, and acerbic, laugh-out-loud humor. This is quite the dark, cynical story to be sure, but at times I was cracking up at the behavior and motivations of the characters.Two life-long best friends, played by Colin Farrell (in what might be his best performance to date) and Brendan Gleeson, live on the small Irish island of Inisherin and hit up the local pub every day at 2 p.m. Life is rather dull and everyone is privy to everyone else's business - you know, the typical small-town mentality and lack of boundaries. When Colm (Gleeson) decides to abruptly end his friendship with P\u00e1draic (Farrell), the two become slowly disheveled and destructive.The movie explores the deterioration of a friendship, but more so the reasons why people will self-destruct, and is a metaphor for the Irish Civil War. I loved the allegorical undertones in the movie such as the personification of Death in one particular character and all of the death motifs throughout. It's a movie that seems simple at first, but once you peel back all the layers, it's deeply poignant, sad, and packs an emotional wallop.",

            "review_title": "Revels in that trademark Irish self-loathing with both funny and tragic results",
            "content": "\"The Banshees Of Inisherin\" is a black comedy film written and directed by Martin McDonagh (\"In Bruges\", \"Seven Psychopaths\", \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\"). Starring Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon, and Barry Keoghan, it revels in that trademark Irish self-loathing with both funny and tragic results.In 1923 in the small town of Inisherin, Ireland, Padraic (Colin Farrell) notices that his longtime drinking buddy Colm (Brendan Gleeson) has suddenly started ignoring him. Confronting his old friend on the matter, Padraic learns that Colm finds him dull and instead wishes to spend his time composing music for something to be remembered by. Shocked by this unexpected revelation, Padraic urgently enlists the help of his sister Siobhan (Kerry Condon) and local man Dominic (Barry Keoghan) to repair this fractured friendship, ignoring Colm's desperate pleas to simply be left alone.With only three prior feature films under his belt, Martin McDonagh has proven himself to be one of the most unique filmmakers working today. All three of those movies provide a pessimistic yet often amusing look at human nature and how we deal with the unpredictable oddities that life throws our way. How McDonagh achieves this is through a signature brand of dark humour that only the Irish could ever manage to pull off. Five years after delivering the fantastic \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\", McDonagh returns to his Irish roots with \"The Banshees of Inisherin\", a darkly comical tale that contains all the elements of what made his previous work so entertaining in the first place.It is practically common knowledge by now that the Irish have lived through many difficult periods throughout history, ranging from famines to civil wars. Yet, despite all their misfortunes, they have still found ways to find the humorous side to whatever plights they may be experiencing - a true testament to their resilience. What \"Banshees\" does is apply this to the failing friendship of two longtime friends and deconstructs what caused things to go south so arbitrarily. As depressing a concept as this may sound, here it is treated in such a droll, laidback way that you can't help but snicker at some of the snide remarks that the characters are throwing at one another.For instance, we see that Padraic considers himself a nice guy who is well liked by the town and otherwise hasn't a care in the world. However, when his old friend Colm tells him that he no longer wants anything to do with him, Padraic's perfect vision for himself is shattered. Instead of finding a constructive way to move on, Padraic essentially makes the whole situation much worse by constantly harassing poor Colm at every opportunity in a feeble attempt to return things to the good old days. There's an understandable level of pathos to Padraic's actions, in that while you know he isn't doing the right thing, you get why he's doing it. It is never easy to lose a friend, something I can definitely say from personal experience, so it's a natural human response to try to fix things by any means necessary. Because of that, Padraic is portrayed as both sympathetic and pitiful at the same time, which makes him a much more well-rounded character.It's fun to see how Martin McDonagh uses his clever script to play into the stereotypes of a remote Irish town. Most of the film's humorous moments came from the banal routine the people are following in a place so far away from the rest of civilisation. I found myself chuckling at some of the monotonous and redundant conversations the characters were having with one another, usually over something trivial like where somebody left their pint of beer in the pub. What's interesting is that all of the comedy had an organic flow to it, as in whenever something funny was said, it occurred through an ordinary exchange between people and not a random one-liner inserted for the sake of comic relief. For me, this comes across as a more natural way to do comedy, by making the audience feel like they are watching dialogue between real people, as opposed to an unrealistic sitcom structure where the characters pause for a laugh track to be added later on.Colin Farrell feels right at home in the role of Padraic, and I don't mean that merely because he's Irish. As previously mentioned, there's a relatable pathos to Padraic's character, which Farrell is able to pull off perfectly. Even though somebody like Colm views him as \"dull\", the audience can see that in spite of the flaws in Padraic's personality, his heart is always in the right place. It's a tricky process to balance pity with likeability, something that most other actors would end up slipping into either/or, but I was impressed at how Farrell was able to achieve it so well. To explain it here wouldn't do it justice so I suggest viewing his performance for yourself to understand what I mean.I also thought Brendan Gleeson did a great job as Colm, complimenting Farrell's role as the antithesis to Padraic. Here is a man whose questionable mental state is made even worse by a former friend who just refuses to take the hint to stay away. Though it is clear that Colm is the one who is in the wrong for starting this entire ordeal, his key reasoning, which I won't disclose due to spoilers, at least makes sense from a logical standpoint. The film's tragic element comes from the ultimate result of Padraic's repeated harassment of Colm, leading to one of the film's saddest scenes.However, I don't think the film would have worked half as well without both Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan in their respective supporting roles. Condon provides the film's emotional anchor as Siobhan, Padraic's sympathetic sister. I really enjoyed her scenes with her brother, particularly the ones where she tries in vein to help him rekindle things with Colm, often indirectly contributing to worsening a situation. Likewise, Keoghan becomes an unlikely voice of reason as Dominic, a local man who ends up as a stand-in friend for Padraic. These two each held their own alongside Farrell and Gleeson, bringing out the best in both the lead performances in addition to their own.As a black comedy, \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" works simply due to the fact that the Irish are masters of this genre. There's a lot to admire in the way they are able to find humour in even the direst of circumstances, and this film is clear proof of that. Even if you don't find the film funny at all, you can at least appreciate the well-written characters and examination of friendships from an entertainment angle. Just those reasons alone make the film a success in my book.I rate it 8/10.",

I will probably return to it later and watch it again and see if I understand it any better the second time.For the first half of \"The Banshees of Inisherin\", I was thinking that it might be the most Irish movie ever. The way the characters talk and behave, with easy familiarity with Irish slang and turns of phrase, makes it feel genuine and you catch up with it immediately. Irish English is like poetry, especially in conversation with others who speak it.At first, what's strange about the movie is that the plot seems to be about something relatively insignificant: a guy's lifelong friend telling him he doesn't want to be friends anymore. It is later in the movie that it takes a turn so bizarre that it made me think of other recent Colin Farrell flicks, namely \"The Lobster\" and \"Killing of a Sacred Deer\".McDonagh doesn't normally deal with the totally impossible, however. The gruesome acts of self-mutilation that we see are possible, but also disturbing and unlikely, and most of the characters seem unfazed by it, as though it's not totally crazy.The movie looks great. It's photographed amazingly. And it kept me mostly entertained. I was in it for the dialogue. McDonagh might write the best dialogue in film. I just couldn't swallow a lot of the goings-on in this movie. It seemed too bizarre to care about or take seriously.",

In Bruges is one of my favourites. So when I saw this, I was excited. Why? Because, unlike most movies that hit in something primal with their music, spectacle and awe, his movies hit in some different place, a place where most movies don't.First it's a story about peculiar decisions, seemingly broken friendship, some dark humour along with it. But as it goes, movie turns into something else. It turns into stubborn one sided tug of war, dark humour follows still. But then it turns again, this time, there is no humour, there is only darkness.A spark of despair within any man, some succumb to it, most don't. When they do however, it's not grand or a spectacle, most of the time. But it can be disturbing in how men can sometimes do completely demented things, void of any reason or stops. I've rarely seen this in women, very rare. Men will sit, reason with it and decide the most idiotic stubborn course of action, despite the intellect, social standing or circumstance they are in.Disappointmment in friendship as a concept and time invested in people is also a theme, maybe as a base for all this. Sometimes you just realise things are maybe way worse than you thought they were. And then you find that you wasted time, emotions and maybe took it all too nonchalant and now you have nothing. And it's not easy.Maybe I'm completely missing the point, maybe I'll get something completely different when I rewatch it down along the line.

It wasn't funny (except for a handful of lines), deep, coherent, interesting, had no believable motivations, had offered nothing about the human condition. The writer seems to fall back on shock and clich\u00e9s (especially about Ireland--I have family there and have spent time in the rural West) to wake the audience up and be of the moment...child abuse, the gay (as implied) Catholic priest, the bullying cop, the cute farm animal who must suffer, the drinking of booze or beer every single day from early afternoon onward, the frustrated young spinster, the enigmatic musician, the enigmatic crone, the pitiable orphans, the village idiot,\netc., etc.Dull, depressing, boring, and gratuitously violent. After a half-hour or so I couldn't believe how bad it was. The production values were good and the writer gets off a handful of witty lines. But nothing happens except trips to the pub or village store and back home, a lot of whining, a few violent episodes attempting to wake you up.Because this movie is so strange and random and offers nothing uplifting during the current difficult times, it will probably get a bunch of awards. I give it two stars for the scenery, the sets, and several leads' (wasted) acting abilities.",

A story of male friendship set in a 1923 Irish, island off the mainland fictional environment where the simple locals don't often have such experiences. 1923 was a period of civil war in Ireland where once friends became enemies, a forerunner of the plotline?Farrell plays a likeable character P\u00e1draic S\u00failleabh\u00e1in who is bewildered one day when a supposed best friend Colm Doherty (Gleeson) just blanks him and makes it clear he wants their friendship to come to a parting of ways as such.What follows is an hour or so of dark comedy as Colm threatens and goes through with a threat to remove his fingers one by one each time P\u00e1draic attempts any kind of contact.Director Martin McDonagh brings some of his stage writing and production of The Aran Islands Trilogy to craft a film that gives splendid material for the cast rightly earning several Acadamy Award nominations for their performances.The photography of the fictional island of Inisherin reminded me of films like The Wicker Man (1973) and Local Hero (1983) with its photography and production design, the crew upping the ante of the film.Some scenes are simply gross and add to the black comedy providing supporting actors some input into the film. These include island 'dullard' Dominic and his drunken police officer dad who masturbates into the night, yes you read that right.Excellent support is also given by P\u00e1draics sister Siobh\u00e1n played by Kerry Condon. More intellectual than her brother and planning on moving to the mainland.Concl\u00faid is the Irish meaning of conclusion. The film ends with near tragedy and a questionable ending as old wounds are barely healed. Revel in the film, you won't regret the journey.",

Slowly paced at times whilst still entertaining in its calmness, each main character is developed well and justified in their own actions. Sharply turning the theme into a darker context as the film progresses, it may not be a film for the squeamish, but the emotional arcs and connection created with the island's inhabitants keeps the audience engrossed in the conclusions of a bittersweet friendship/rivalry.The acting throughout is superb. Farrell is perfect as the somewhat simple, yet loyal and kind, P\u00e1draic. His emotions shine in such an endearing character as the film follows the highs and lows his friendship with Gleeson brings. Keoghan is also brilliant. No doubt some audiences will need subtitles to follow his dialogue, but his challenging character is another who invokes strong fondness. The whole cast are great, and it's good to see real accents portrayed.Visually the film is stunning. Captured by the mood of the plot, the Irish island can display beauty and despair.

The fight on nothing and it costs both sides a great deal of pain and misery. Additionally, someone totaly innocent gets in the crossfire. This is the same what happens with the fight of two best friends. It doesnt matter, who wins, or not. It is the friendship, honesty, trust, niceness we lost. Sometimes I think it is streched a bit but then so are the wars. So it is a perfect metaphor for that. The dread of not becoming known, successful or someone who will remember you after death. It is real. But to have a frightening thing to guide you to reach the goal. We forget, it is the journey that matters not the destination. The sisters story is having a great arc. Knowing you want better for your life. But to leave the homeland you have to left somethung behind. Even if it is something you love. Highly recommend this to my film mutuals.

            "content": "A film that is funny, moving, sad, shocking and unusual is not your average film and this wonderful film isn't. It's beautifully filmed, written, acted, photographed and scored. We all know the basic plot. A best friend (Brendon Gleeson) of another (Colin Friend) who have lived their entire lives on a small Irish island no longer wants to retain this long friendship. He says he doesn't like him anymore because he's dull and boring, but my take is that is just not true. He does still like him, though he might indeed find him a bit boring, and he certainly cares about him, but the character Gleeson plays is getting old and he wants his life to mean something and he doesn't want to spend the rest of his time on earth doing the exact same thing day in, day out and it's near impossible to change this routine on a remote island in the 1920's. I get it. He might also be going a bit mad. The acting in this film by everyone is perfect, but we have four principles who will just knock your socks off. Colin Farrell gives one of the best performances of his career, if not the best, and he will break your heart a little. Brendan Gleeson, always excellent, plays his role perfectly. Kerry Condon as Farrell's intelligent sister is a kind and wonderful force to behold and very funny at times. And then there is the always interesting and very unusual Barry Keoghan who just about steals every scene he is in. He is a marvel to watch here. I loved In Bruges & enjoyed Three Billboards, but this might be Martin McDonagh's best film. This is an extremely talented man.Is there anything I didn't like? Yes. I would have liked to have known more about one of the principle's deaths. It was barely touched upon and just passed by quickly. I have my own take on this tragedy which is different than the slight one mentioned, though I've no idea if I'm correct, but I will choose to accept it. Make of the ending what you will as it's up for debate, but I loved this film flaws and all.",

Then he makes Seven Psychopaths (which is my personal favorite of his.) which technically wasn't better written or acted but drop dead funny and very clever. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri was the film that put him on lists with the Tarantino's and the PTA's of the world and deservingly so. That film was brilliant but also just a little off. It was realistic of the American south but also surreal and fantastical.You add all these aspects up into his 4th film, The Banshees of Inisherin. Clever writing, wickedly hilarious dialogue & on of the best acting ensembles of the year make up one of the best films of the year. Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson & Kerry Condon are absolutely brilliant and i can't picture any other 3 actors being in these roles. They were absolutely perfect from beginning to end. The story itself, again as with McDonagh is surreal yet grounded. The dialogue maybe his funniest of his career while also being his most serious. Also mostly his best directing work of his career.Now you may be asking why this review is getting a 7 and i can only tell you that by the films end I just didn't feel good about what i watched. This is a depressing film no matter how much it made me laugh. Something was keeping me from loving it. And the ending didn't do it any favors. It mostly fizzles out with the last 10 minutes. It was building the entire time to something amazing. I thought it was going to be a masterpiece until the 3rd act. It just kind of ends with nothing being resolved.This movie is absolutely one of the best of 2022 and i hope it's a big awards winner especially for the actors and Martin McDonagh is now in the top 5 filmmakers working today. I only wish the 3rd act could've wrapped up what was a masterpiece. Please Martin, don't make us wait 5 years for your next film!",

As I mentioned, it was great seeing McDonagh, Farrell and Gleeson teaming up again and I sincerely hope it's not the last we see of them together. Banshees has some definite awards contenders for acting and writing, but as a movie as a whole it didn't wow me as much as I had hoped. I'm sure multiple viewings would help elevate it for me, but it's also not a movie I'm in a particular rush to go back and revisit. I give Banshees a solid 8/10.QyrosMovies.",

            "content": "Martin McDonagh's latest film is a tragicomedy set on a island off the coast of 1920's Ireland, that can be both sharply witty and humourous and also very bleak and depressing. Like his last movie Three Billboards, 'Banshees of Inisherin' doesn't fully explain or resolve certain aspects of the plot or characters, rather leaving it to the audience to think about and derive their own meaning. I believe this to be wholly intentional on the writer's part. So don't go in to this movie expecting to understand everything by the end, or you may leave disappointed.Although this film doesn't reveal everything on a first watch, don't think this is some artsy-fartsy, metaphorical slog to sit through. I found this to be an absolute blast, with well-written and interesting characters, great humour and a plot that always kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat to see what happens next. There are plenty of laughs to be had, but as the narrative continues it takes a rather dark turn, with major consequences for certain characters leading to a few genuinely heartbreaking scenes.The acting in this movie was honestly flawless, I believed every single character in this movie -especially Colin Farrell, who maybe gave his best performance yet. Believe the Oscar buzz. The chemistry between his character and Brendan Gleeson's stony-faced and troubled Colm was brilliant, they both played off each other extremely well and as the stakes rise and become more desperate you can really feel for both of them and understand both their motivations. The script is sharp and quite detailed, as an Irishman myself I think McDonagh nails the banter and dialogue down to a T.I genuinely feel like this is one of the best movies of the year, and although I didn't quite understand it fully by the end, it was still an absolute blast and an emotional rollercoaster and left me with a lot to think about to form my own conclusions. If you go in with ZERO expectations, it's a hell of a ride. Would recommend.",

The humour is understated and an aside to the tribulations of the characters, even though it reflects the very best of why we love the Irish.The drama and tragedy are very real and wholly relatable to those who have, or are experiencing, mid-life existential crises - who am I, what have I achieved, what is my legacy?

Sadly, the despair is what I took away from this, and what I remember now while the black comedy elements and at the time genuinely funny situational jokes have faded into the background noise.I enjoyed it while I was watching it, but it's not a feel good romp, it's not even really a comedy and there's parts of it that still make me a little sad thinking back on it 24 hours later.Would not recommend if you're expecting to be amused.

The latter unilaterally instigates the split as he is fed up with Padraic's banalities and wants to concentrate on composing music. The consequences of his choice comprise most of the film.The actions and behaviour of some of the characters are not realistic. This film makes more sense as an allegory on the fickle nature of human relationships, and the futility and slow collapse of society. Hence the several references to the ongoing war across the water, the most profound of which is by the island's policeman, who is confused as to what the conflict is all about.The cinematography is superb, the film is very well directed and the acting is top-notch from both leads. Kerry Condon is very good as Padraic's much smarter but disenchanted sister, but Barry Keoghan is superb as Dominic, the village idiot who is abused by his policeman father.Where the film falls down a little is in the script. It bounces around from slow, tedious and repetitive at times to moments of inspired observation. There are several attempts at humour thrown in for good measure, but only some succeed. Overall the narrative is inconsistent and has a somewhat childish overall feel about it, which lets down an otherwise beautifully crafted film.",

            "content": "\"The Banshees of Inisherin\" is a fairly new movie that comes close to the two-hour mark and here we have a co-production between Great Britain, the United States and Ireland. If you look at several factors from the production of this film, the Irish impact is really dominant here. This includes the cast, includes where the film is set, includes the man who wrote and directed the film and includes the heavy accents you hear from beginning to end. This is one of the biggest awards players this season. It won over 100 honors, was nominated for over 300 more, so it comes close to a total of 500 nominations and maybe it will even exceed this magical number at some point. It scored nine Oscar nominations and not winning a single Academy Award seems highly unlikely. Especially the screenplay has a good shot and I think the supporting actress category is now maybe a 50-50 thing between Condon and Angela Bassett, but we will see. Whoever wins the SAG Award is surely the frontrunner then. Colin Farrell won a Golden Globe, but he may have a hard time at the Oscars against Butler and Fraser. Keoghan's BAFTA win came a bit out of nowhere really and we will see how it goes at the Oscars then. I still feel like the clear frontrunner so far will not lose to Keoghan or anybody else. If anybody had predicted this film to win said category, I am sure Gleeson would have been the odds-on favorite. I am not super surprised though. I like Gleeson a lot, but he has several better performances, still cool that he got in at the Oscars. McDonagh always has a talent to direct his actors to Oscar nominations, maybe even wins and four people being nominated again this time is surely evidence of that, even if one win would already be a nice achievement. No easy frontrunner here like McDormand and Rockwell, but again he got two males nominated in the supporting category.I like McDonagh, he has a pretty great body of work and I must still say this film here, his newest, is not even remotely close to being my favorite of his. Of course, given all the Irish impact here, it has to be a very personal project and I am glad it got made and I am also glad I saw it today. The one thing he always succeeds with is dark comedy. There were some laugh-out-loud moments here in the first half really from this perspective. Also some in the second half, but there it got a tad more dramatic. I mean one character cutting off all the fingers from his hand is telling enough I would say. Or a really awesome donkey dying. Jenny would definitely have been nominated for an animal Oscar this year. I just wanna hug her. But I am a huge donkey fan anyway. It is a good year for donkey movies for sure as \"EO\" a bit surprisingly to me also found its way to an Oscar nomination in the foreign language feature category or whatever it is called nowadays. In addition to this, it is a good year for Irish films as there is a film from this country in the same category as well, even if it is maybe the least likely from the quintet to win. Still a huge success if we see over which films it got in there, for example a new Asian film by a very renowned director. But back to the Banshees now: I already talked about the comedy here and I feel kinda bad for people who did not find any of this funny, the ones who go down to the basement to have a laugh as we say in Germany. Sad creatures. So I hope you will smile at least while seeing this film, but here and there you actually have to laugh I am sure too. McDonagh is just really great in terms of situational comedy and dialogue writing. Always has been, always will be. I could give you a double-digit number of examples, but I will just stick to one now and that was when Farrell's character enters Gleeson's character's home and says he is not here for lickin' when the latter's dog approaches him and licks his fingers. This scene, however, also results into some of the biggest drama because as a consequence one character cuts off all the fingers from his hand then and one of them is eaten by the aforementioned donkey, well not eaten but he dies from trying to eat it, so tragedy galore there. Of course, the parallel between fingers being licked and being cut off is also a fairly dark one.As for the dog, that one was also really amazing of course. It had its moment when it tried to carry the scissors away from Gleeson's character. That was one tough bloke though. He seems to feel no pain after cutting his fingers off. I did not even know you would not bleed to death then literally, but he seems alright. They also put away the idea that he is dying or that he is depressed, even if there were in a way mentions of the latter when he was talking to the local priest. Overall though, there is no fake melodrama in here and McDonagh made this clear from the very start. It seems as if Gleeson's character really just thinks about his life not being fulfilling and memorable enough and that is why he has to cut ties and focus on creativity, music in his case really. Still, honestly, when he is there towards the end with the other musicians and he has no fingers any more, but still makes wild gestures, you could wonder if he had really lost his mind. In the end then, when Farrell's character takes revenge for his donkey, it is all about the question if Gleeson's character will leave his home or not. Is he ready to die? The solution is that he is not, but that the two are then in a way enemies, even if one is always ready and willing to look after the other's animal. Maybe it was these events that had to happen for Farrell's character to be really ready to let Gleeson's go then. These two actors also starred in \"In Bruges\" together, a movie that got also made by McDonagh and that one I liked more for example, but only because it was quite great and this one here is just good. It did not suck or anything. McDonagh has worked with both actors on other occasions like \"Seven Psychopaths\" or the short film that was his first work almost 20 years ago, a movie with Gleeson in the lead, that won McDonagh a short film Oscar.As for the title of this new film here, I am undecided. Inisherin is a location where the cliffs and the sea are as rough as the people, but with Banshees I just don't know. I thought from how the word is used in a video game that it would describe death fairies and that would fit at least one mysterious character we see on a few occasions, but they just translated it with \"ghosts\" here. Perhaps not so perfect. Anyway, back to the cast: Farrell and Keoghan also worked on a film together, one without McDonagh, that one turned into a success, so even for them it is a reunion. Keoghan looks so young anyway, I would not have thought he is over 30 anyway. His character then towards the end becomes tragic and before that he is referenced mostly as the village idiot and this twist then, fueled by his violent police officer dad, shows us that there was more to the character than we thought. He was disappointed in Farrell's character, he found out that the woman he likes (okay, he likes many) is not romantically interested in him and also he had to constantly face violence at home. There is far more to this young man than comic relief. Nice to see the BAFTAs recognize it. How he went though, I think we can say it was most likely suicide with the story his dad tells us and the nosy store owner earlier. As for Kerry Condon, I liked her character a lot. I thought she was smart and also pretty and it is nice she managed to get away from the island that held her back and had a future on the continent then. Maybe she will meet her brother again, maybe not. I feel like there will be a reunion. I also thought it made sense that he did not write her about the donkey's fate, on the one hand because he was still hurting and on the other hand because he did not want her to worry about him as she knew how much the animal meant to him. He was happy for his sister to have made that big step and did not want her to take it back, even if he was clearly missing her. And surely he was not the smartest fella as we see when he does not know the word \"touch\u00e9\" or when he tells Gleeson's character what he did to his new friend. Definitely not a smart move. One with drastic consequences then.The aforementioned police officer is a very violent man as we see from his actions when he punches the protagonist and hear from his words when he talks about an upcoming execution. One that is politically motivated and he does not even remember who kills whom. But this was surely interesting because if you look at the gunshots being fired in the distance there towards the end, you can absolutely make a connection between the two main characters and the two political groups fighting each other. The comment about how things were easier when they were just fighting the English can be seen as a parallel of struggling with life as a whole, but the more specific mention of the Irish groups can definitely be seen in a way as the fighting between Farrell's and Gleeson's characters. It is also debatable if Gleeson is really supporting. He is on the edge of being a co-lead. Does not have to be a lead as significant as Farrell in here. Another thing that came to my mind is that perhaps McDonagh started enjoying burning down things as fire towards the end already played a big role in his previous movie and also there was a key character in danger of dying in the flames and here it is the same. Still, the one thing that hit maybe closest to home for me was the idea of getting stuff done during your lifetime, the late-life crisis if you wanna call it that, that has so vividly left its mark on Gleeson's character. The elaboration on musicians being remembered centuries later was extremely well-written and also a bit funny again with how he gets the century wrong. That is all then. This film gets a thumbs-up from me, which was never in doubt. I recommend watching \"The Banshees of Inisherin\".",

It wasn't long until I realized this was not going to be about some random guy and his donkey.One thing I really wish I had was a more expensive knowledge with the Irish Civil War. But it really is nice to get this perspective on it.This story takes place during the Civil War and it involves two neighbors that had been getting along just fine until one day one of the guys just decides he is too good for this friendship. Having had no good reason for cutting contact, of course the other neighbor wants to hang on to the friendship that obviously meant so much more to him. Increasingly extreme measures to separate leads to bloodshed and thus a lifelong rivalry is born out of the stubbornness of the two. And the movie ends with the implication that the two can never be friends again.If you come out of this film thinking it is a good idea for these neighbors to continue being enemies then you don't deserve an opinion.One of my favorite metaphors put to film.

Brendan Gleeson provides another example of his impressive versatility. Kerry Condon portrays a balanced view of the long-suffering sister who must choose between her own needs and those of others.Given the time (1923) and the setting (isolated island off the coast of Ireland from which gunshots of the ongoing civil war can be heard) there are many directions the film could have taken: social commentary, black comedy, farce, cute rural adventure, broad Irish stereotypes, etc.Writer/director Martin McDonagh instead focuses on individual characters as opposed to all-out social or political commentary. Gleeson's character one day decides he doesn't want to be friends anymore with Colin Farrell's character. The results of this falling out take a tragic turn that many will find neither entertaining nor appealing (and certainly not funny).Some might call this a \"black comedy\" but that's an overly simplistic label. \"Tragicomedy\" is probably more accurate. I did find myself laughing in a few spots, but these are few.This is a character study that lays bare complex human relationships set against a time and place whose impacts are still rippling today.Were I to compare this film's emotional impact to others I would probably select Paul Schrader's FIRST REFORMED or some of the films of Yasujiro Ozu, but BANSHEES OF INISHERIN stands on its own.",

            "content": "Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson star in this tale of what happens when one friend decides he no longer wants to talk to another. This is a very original story that keeps your interest and has great performances, especially Colin Farrell, who plays the hurt and disappointed friend. He is very confused, lonely and frustrated as to what to do about it. While there was offbeat, matter-of-fact humor and was at times very moving (Brendan driving Colin home after Colin had been beat up), this was also very frustrating for me. Why couldn't Colin get the message? He was being accused of being boring. I don't know, but he did seem to be what you would call a simple man and at times seemed a bit dense to the serious situation. On one hand, I could see simplifying your life and separating from things that don't matter, but not at the expense of hurting others. Why did Brendan have to be so cruel and extreme? Why didn't Colin just leave him alone? Also, it seems like their roles had somehow reversed by the end. You feel for Colin when Brendan won't have anything to do with him. But by the end, after Colin get a little extreme, you sympathize for Brendan. I'm not sure exactly what to make of their last conversation and if they are done with each other or not . Having said all that, looking back on it, it seems like a parable or a fable that a parent would tell their child about what not to do in life and to their friends, making this story/film to be a lesson learned for others. This film was successful on many levels, because it makes you think of your friends, your own life, and what you would do in this situation. This was a very deep, thought-provoking, humorous and rewarding film experience, and I have thought of it almost everyday since I saw it. I recommend this for those who like Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson. Austin Butler as Elvis had better watch out for Colin Farrell, who may give him a run for his money and win his first Oscar.",

            "content": "I haven't seen many films that deal with the break up of a friendship, which can be just as devastating as a romantic one. At least not good ones.This latest film by Martin McDonagh is perhaps his quietest and more brooding film to date, and probably his best. Set in a small Irish island during a civil war, Colin Farrell's character cannot understand and is unable to accept the fact that his best friend, Colm (Brendan Gleeson) refuses to speak to him. \"I just don't like ya no more.\" he says. And because of Padraic's persistence at wanting to speak to him, and Colm's fierce and repeated rejection of him, things basically go from bad to worse for the two of them.The great thing about this film is that you can feel very deeply for these two flawed men, and really sympathise with their predicaments, while at the same time shaking your head in disapproval at the things they do. McDonagh has always had that impressive ability to perfectly balance tragedy with comedy, making laugh out loud one minute and reduce you to tears in the next.Because I've also experienced a terrible friendship breakup when I was younger, as well as being an aspiring musician, I could really relate to Farrell's character, and to another extent Gleeson's. It's also an exploration of one friend wanting you and other things to stay the same, while the other is looking for change in his/her life, and therefore is interested in other things, leaving you behind.It is 100% a tragedy, but is also very common in life.",

Colin Farrell is simply brilliant as is Brendan Gleason, and there's a great supporting turn by Barry Keoghan. McDonagh writing and directing is masterful, and manages not to descend into Irish cliche or too much that's folksy, though it does edge close at times.

The third, however, the Anglo-Irish dramatist considered insufficiently good to see the lights of the printing and the stage, and its finalization was postponed. All the characteristics of the previous works of the playwright and screenwriter Martin McDonagh are here: strong and tense conflict, few and well-defined characters who are pushed into borderline situations, a pessimistic view of the world and society. To these 'The Banshees of Inisherin' adds an Irish theme - both as a profile of the characters and as reflections of a difficult history characterized by conflicts and internal rifts that are difficult to reconcile and overcome. As is the case with many good films, this one can be interpreted and explained on many levels - as a personal story, as a parable with biblical resonance, or as a metaphor for historical conflicts.The story takes place on an (imaginary) island located a few kilometers off the coast of Ireland. Whoever can crosses to the 'mainland', that is, Ireland, another island, much bigger, where the civil war haunts, but where life is more interesting and the opportunities are different. Few remain. The community they live in probably has a few dozen houses and families, a pub, a policeman, a shop where basic goods are bought, where mail is delivered (sometimes after having been read by indiscrete eyes) and where rumors are circulated. Everybody knows everybody. The heroes of the film, P\u00e1draic and Colm, were, until the scene that opens the film, two good friends. Every day at 2 o'clock they met to go to the pub together, until one day when Colm decided he no longer wanted to talk to P\u00e1draic. Colm is a musician, he plays the violin and because he wants to leave something behind he composes a song whose name is also the title of the film. P\u00e1draic is a very good-hearted boy, but a bit boring, and Colm feels that he has no time for him. Siobh\u00e1n, P\u00e1draic's sister, tries in vain to reconcile them. She herself, already past the age of marriage, dreams of leaving the island, perhaps to find a place where she can use her passion for reading. P\u00e1draic's insistence and Colm's stubbornness will gradually escalate the conflict to unpredictable extremes.The film benefits from extremely well written dialogues and an exceptional cast. In this film, Martin McDonagh brings back in the main roles the two actors who 16 years ago ensured the success of his most famous film, 'In Bruges'. It's hard to believe that Colin Farrell, who plays P\u00e1draic, could miss the Academy Award for Best Actor this yeat, but Brendan Gleeson isn't far off either. Outstanding supporting roles are also played by Kerry Condon (Siobh\u00e1n) and Barry Keoghan, who plays Dominic, the son of the island's policeman, a victim of domestic violence, who has become a kind of fool of the island. In less than two hours, McDonagh creates an entire human universe that absorbs viewers. The meanings of the text, however, go beyond the ambitions of a simple domestic drama. Banshees are female embodied spirits that can foretell the future. There is one character who fits this profile who also appears in key scenes, and her omens are grim. Death lurks around every bend in the paths or on the high cliffs. The dialogues include a wealth of allusions to life and death, kindness and loneliness, hope and despair. The most obvious metaphor, however, is that of the island. Inisherin is a small island next to a mainland towards which the dreams and aspirations of the inhabitants are directed. There, however, haunt conflicts, wars, and other evils of large societies. The ratio of forces and sizes recalls Ireland's destiny relative to that of Great Britain or the United States, to which the population of Ireland has been emigrating for centuries. . The misunderstandings and conflicts caused by the very nature of people, however, do not bypass even small communities, and inevitably the accumulated passions will erupt into violence. The outbreak is ugly and hard to understand, like in a horror movie. But what are the ethnic or religious conflicts that we live in so many places of the world but horror episodes? We all live on islands, bigger or smaller, and hate is everywhere. The final scene may indicate hope (the violent outburst is over, not before causing casualties) but also an uneasy coexistence with unresolved tensions in the future.",

Some movies you can re-watch -as you can't even remember how it ends. As a screenplay goes, however I note yes beer was poured only from bottles in 1923 but some dialogue is from the modern idiom. No-one said wank in 1923, or the phrase (Doesn't) time (be) fly (ing)s? When you're having fun and I am not sure whether \"So move on,\" was in current use then, as well. The simplicity of the script and the limited area the characters live in - is brilliantly projected by the cast. Brendan Gleeson, Colin Farrell, Barry Keoghan and the lilting voice of Kerry Condon.So, apart from these complete minor flaws only a linguist would note. And in my opinion little Jenny the dwarf donkey, Minnie the miniature pony; as well as the trap horse especially in the last few scenes not forgetting the brilliant performance of Colin Farrell are all Oscar worthy.

First off, the performances here are some of the best of the year. Colin Farrell is so far my pick for Best Actor this year. His performance here is absolutely amazing and heart wrenching at points as well. He does an amazing job at embodying this character and all his little quirks. Brendan Gleeson did an amazing job as well. He did a great job at being the foil to Colin Farrell's character with his more serious attitude. Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan did a great job as well with Barry Keoghan delivering probably the best performance of his career by a country mile. One scene from him in particular is heartbreaking. I keep mentioning how this film is heartbreaking and heart wrenching but this film is absolutely hilarious as well. Almost every joke here is very well written and incorporated into each scene and they are just funny in a dark way. This definitely falls under the black comedy genre. McDonagh does an amazing job at directing and incorporating the mix of dark comedy and drama tones together in a way that doesn't feel jarring. The film starts out being funny but the end you're definitely feeling emotional and sad as well. The story is really interesting. It's fascinating watching Colin Farrell try to get back under the good graces of Gleeson's character and all the incidents that follow that. The cinematography and music are both breathtaking and easily some of the best of the year. Every shot feels picturesque and the music works incredibly well at bringing up the jokes or bringing out the seriousness of a scene. As much as I love this movie, I would say that McDonagh's previous film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is just slightly better than this. I would highly recommend watching this when you get the chance of you want a slow burn comedy/drama.",

The despair and confusion of this situation escalates over the films nearly 2hr runtime.This really is the modern Brothers Grimm fairytale that will tell the story of the past 100 years in Ireland. The story also focuses a lot on loneliness and despair and the confusion that surrounds this. Which can ultimately leads to anger and pain.The film is shot beautifully from the vistas of the Island to the Animals and its surrounding nature.Everything is well kempt but of its time while also looking rather like a glossy fairytale picture book, a reminder that you are watching a film not a documentary. There is a lot of Irish humour within this tragic tale and at times it may seem like a comedy.I think you can take a lot from this film without comparing it to the last 100 years in Ireland but ultimately it makes a lot more sense and there being too many references to Ireland troubles for it not to be a direct Allegoric story.By the end the bloodiest moments had passed but it seems that some are not willing to let go.9/10.",

            "content": "On the face of it, Banshees of Inisherin is a story of two Irishmen (Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson) competing over who can be more stubborn and prideful (i.e., pigheaded). That's not wrong, but of course there's much more to it than that. The time and place are the end of the Irish Civil War in 1923, on a tiny (fictional) remote island off the coast of Ireland just big enough to have one pub and one general store. It's kind of a statement of their relative importance that the pub is spacious while the store is barely big enough to turn around in.Some other reviewers are calling this film a comedy or at very least a black comedy. Yes, it's got some good, funny dialog built on inimitable Irish personality and turn of phrase, but that's just a side element. At its core this really seems to me to be a tragedy. Not a Shakespearean one in style, but still a tragedy. The conflict between the two long-standing friends comes right off the top and seemingly out of nowhere, and builds from there to a story of how fairly normal human impulses can turn in an astonishingly self-destructive direction. In other words, 'conflict resolution' isn't exactly their strong point. Padraic believes, for a long while, that he can change his friend's mind, while Colm can't see past his own priorities. Even if we understand both of them much more by the end, it's still a head-shaking adventure. And in fact I guess maybe it's a lot more Shakespearean and more universal than I originally suggested -- i.e. Relentless stubborn pride (see above) isn't just the property of giant figures like Lear or MacBeth or Coriolanus.The acting, dialog, and cinematography are uniformly great. Kerry Conron (playing Padraic's sister, ultimately the only character who has the sense and intelligence to take herself out of the whole situation) and Barry Keoghan (playing Dominic, a friendly but odd local youth) are spot-on as well. One of the strengths of \"Banshees\" is that these two side characters have stories that are almost equally fleshed out, done very economically and tellingly. Dominic is living with troubles that are more serious than anything Padraic and Colm are fighting over. That is, an even bigger tragedy is happening on the sidelines that is sadly going unrecognized by everyone until it's too late.There's an intriguing mirror symmetry in the story. In the first half, Colm is resolute and unyielding while Padraic is baffled and contrite, but without knowing why. In the second half, Padraic has hardened into resolution while Colm has become sad and contrite. Sow the wind, reap the whirlwind. They're both to blame, and neither.",

Though I have .... thoughts .... about the ending, generally I enjoyed it.On an Island, not far from the Irish mainland, Padraic Suillebhain (Colin Farrell) is shocked when his closest friend, Colm Doherty (Brendan Gleeson), tells his that he no longer wishes to be friends with him. He struggles to determine what he has done to drive Colm to this decision, which he is adamant about. Padraic's sister Siobhan (Kerry Condon) tries to repair the relationship, but she has distractions of her own and, every so often, the sounds of gunfire come from the mainland.I haven't done much supporting reading for the film, so my assumptions here about what the film is about may not correspond with what McDonagh had in mind. But I saw the film as an allegory for the Civil War that was taking place in Ireland, in 1923 - and perhaps even for wider civil wars. A trivial annoyance is escalated through poor communication and then taken to extreme violent lengths. All the while the participants ignore a bigger problem, that they're aware of, until that reaches catastrophe.I know the \"Black Comedy\" description has proved divisive, but I did find the film regularly funny and thought the performances from the central four (the three mentioned above and Barry Keoghan) were excellent. I couldn't help but feel that the ending was somewhat of an anti-climax though, specifically in the very final scenes, rather than the surprising ones that proceed it. I don't have a better alternative in mind, but it ends with a whimper, rather than a bang.I had my issues with \"Three Billboards\" but for me, this was a big improvement.",

Those who are brought to understand (as I) that he also directed \"Three billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri\" would immediate raise their eyebrows (I did). Best vintage. He gets nominated for both directing and writing. The four acting nominations are Best Actor Colin Ferrell, Supporting Brendan Gleeson (well known), Barry Keoghan (\"The eternals\") and Kerry Condon (\"Three Billboards...\"). Best Picture, plus Editing and Music make 9.The plotline, if you can call it one, is simplicity itself, a scrapbook of ordinary life in a fictional island Inisherin off the shore of Ireland during the civil war of the 1920s. The persona of the main character Padraic is not unlike that of the portrayer Ferrell, but without the sophistication, a cheerful happy-go-lucky cow herder. Loving his donkey and other animals, Padraic does not have many real friends, his sister Siobhan, played by Condon, obviously, being his keeper of sorts, emotionally as well as pragmatically (she cooks). He does have a friend, fiddler Colm (Gleeson). The entire plot rests on this strange friendship. As Colm is taciturn, brooding and quite a bit older, it may not be that easy to explain how the friendship of this odd couple started. It is not explained.The abrupt ending of this friendship is explained, but that does not mean that you can understand it. I cannot, from a pure rational, logical perspective and therefore simply accept it. Colm simply tells Patraic that he is tired of the latter's conversation, which has become a waste of his time, which could be used to do something really useful, such a creating music. Patraic doggedly persists driving Colm to extreme measures. His way of protesting is bizarre and gruesome to the extent that may turn off some in the audience. Colm does nothing to Patraic though. Just to himself. But that indirectly kills Patraic' most beloved donkey. I'll stop here.While this movie is listed as \"comedy\" and does generate dry chuckle and laugh-out-louds it is really in a territory of different viewers may feel different things. Gleeson's role could justifiably get a co-nomination with Farrell as Best Actor. On the other hand, some may feel that Keoghan's role does not quite justify a nomination, albeit as a Support. Condon well deserves her Best Supporting Actress nomination.",

It might have gotten two slight chuckles out of me.The plot is easy to follow, as opposed to other more abstract movies in the genre. There is depth to be found, if need be, but the plot works even without looking behind the surface.The movie is set during the civil war, but historical context really has no bearing on the plot. The fact that I know nothing about the time period didn't subtract much from my viewing experience.Like In Bruges, Banshees of Inisherin gets carried by a few interesting characters and great performances. It's bizarre and tragic plot will make you reflect deeply on something or other, while guessing at what comes next.Negatives:\nParts of the plot are unbelievable, even within it's dark comedy setting. There are too many unnecessary lines. Some have commented on the dialogue not sounding authentic irt the time period. While I can't comment on historical inaccuracies, some dialogue just didn't come off as believable, and I didn't think the movie gained enough from being set in said time period.

I just knew it was winning a lot of awards and I'd better see it soon.This was like watching the War of the Roses between two men friends. Not that extreme, but one of the men wants a divorce and the other doesn't.When Brendan Gleeson tells Collin Farrell, I don't like you anymore. OMG, that hit home because I'm going through an analysis of my friendships. And realize there are some folk I don't like anymore and won't socialize with them. What happens when you tell someone who thought you were friends that it's over? And that person won't let you be.Colin Farrell is probably giving the performance of his life because you can see the sadness and confusion in his face when his so-called best friend doesn't want to be around anymore. And there's nowhere these two can go. They live on a remote little Irish island where everybody knows everybody, sees everybody all day and knows your business. You would have to leave the island entirely.This movie made me laugh, made me think about relationships and understand about loneliness and isolation. It was sad in a lot of ways.Not to spoil anything, but the friend who won't let go goes to extremes with his anger and confusion.I didn't understand some of the Irish brogue and words they spoke. You have to listen very carefully.",

McDonagh's direction is impeccable, building an atmosphere so lived-in and rich with emotion. This undoubtedly starts with the amazing location the picture was shot at, which allowed for such outstanding cinematography. The music throughout doubles down on the continuous sense of dread and, especially, isolation. As this environment is well-crafted, so is each character. Every role feels tightly connected and purposeful to the overall story being told, captivating the audience despite a slower than average pacing. What happens simply feels so real, reflecting on impactful ideas like loneliness and friendship while simultaneously producing a beyond intriguing story. Aiding this is one powerful performance after another from the star-studded cast. These actors and actresses are able to seamlessly blend comedy and drama, delivering great dialogue with sincerity that both fills the audience with laughter and moves their hearts with emotion. Ferrell and Gleeson highlight the film, sharing a chemistry onscreen that leaves the audience at the edge of their seat until their respective characters meet again. Condon and Keoghan are great, as well. Altogether, then, this film is almost flawless. More could have expected from the third act, possibly, and what happens is admittedly not the most exciting story out there, yet the small feel of the movie may just be its charm. The Banshees of Inisherin is ultimately worthwhile for most.",

            "content": "\"The Banshees of Inisherin\", the Last Melody of Colm, is an intimate movie that talks about the ending of a friendship that lasted for many years. The two main characters, Colm and Padraic, are two fragile men with different perspectives on the definition of life.Padraic does want to live his life with his friends and Colm, but the character portrayed by Brendan Gleeson doesn't want to waste his time speaking with a \"boring\" man talking about non-sense. This movie is really heartbreaking, during the almost 2 hours of length of the movie we see how the relationship between the two starts to corroborate itself, with the ultimate act which is very powerful and astonishing. In the background, there is the character of Dominic, an Irish boy who can't escape from that little village in the Highlands and he has to live with his drunk and violent father. The character of Barry Keoghan really delivers its job, portraying a sense of malincony and sadness when we acknowledge what happens to him. In conclusion, this movie is a really particular one, with twists and death all around the corner, but it will surely affect you in an interesting and unexpected way.",

This was entirely Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson show as the director brings out the best chemistry between them as P\u00e0draic and Colm with Kerry Condon playing a strong supporting character Siobh\u00e0n. All of a sudden Colm decides to ignore P\u00e0draic ending their decades long friendship which disturbs P\u00e0draic. Further Colm exaggerates his decision with a threat of cutting off his finger if P\u00e0draic ever tries to speak to him again. The drastic results that comes out of their current predicament while P\u00e0draic's unmarried sister tries hard to play the peacemaker forms rest of the story.The beauty of this story is how well the characters are etched out apart from the commendable performances. Instantly buying these characters aside, even the story is worth getting hooked on. The life that Colm seeks for the remaining years and the life P\u00e0draic is used to living, the change one so harshly seeks while the other is disturbed to the core to latch onto the existing life is beautifully captured on screen. Especially those moments where they both care for each other despite the fallout is sheer brilliance.Strongly recommended.",

            "content": "The Irish really are an island unto themselves, and that may be the point of this movie. Loved and despised in equal doses, \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" nevertheless is rewarding cinema. Set solely on the gloriously green rolling knolls of a cute island (sit down tourists, no such place) where the rain only sprinkles at night, the muffled sounds of revolutionary shots fired are at a safe distance on the mainland, and the locals gather daily at the local pub. All seems idyllic in the charming farming community, until a long-standing friendship is suddenly disrupted. Forget small town, this is a small island, where everyone not only knows everyone, but appear to have no will to escape.The break-up, abrupt, congenial, silent, eats away at a confused Padraic (Colin Farrell and his expressive eyebrows). A simple man, his confusion and childlike determination to mend matters with the stoic and complicated Colm (Brendan Gleeson) is rife with comedic tension, until, well, until things get way out of hand.The battle of wills takes on an unsavoury, physical bent that becomes the knife twist in the film. One which tests an audiences' mettle. An allegory for the warring factions on the horizon, the odd couples' relationship runs the gamut of absurd to horrific. A tragic comedy that delivers more victims than victors.Farrell and Gleeson are superb, bringing plenty of grand ideas to the table - the regiment of life, the role of friendship, reinventing oneself, the cuffs of relationships, unrequited love, vengeance, and mortality. Plus a bunch more. Sunny yet dark. Do a favour with a viewing.hipCRANK.",

This movie captured a relatable, at times funny, and often heart-wrenching series of events that portrayed a fraying friendship that seemed doomed to end. Don't be put off by the odd title, there's more to this dark comedy than meets the eye.The Crew:\nMartin McDonagh wrote and directed a winner.Carter Burwell's musical scoring was amazing.Ben Davis' cinematography was stunning.Mark Tildesley's production design was great.Art direction and set decoration were noteworthy.Editing and sound effects were superb.Hair-makeup and VFX were great.The stunts team did admirable work.Eimer Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh's costume design was quite good.The Cast:\nColin Farrell as P\u00e1draic S\u00failleabh\u00e1in was excellent.Brendan Gleeson as Colm Doherty was captivating.Kerry Condon as Siobh\u00e1n S\u00failleabh\u00e1in was superb.Barry Keoghan as Dominic Kearney was exemplary.Sheila Flitton as Mrs. McCormick was notable.David Pearse as the priest was good.Gary Lydon as Peadar Kearney was great.Plot Summary & Analysis:\nWhat happens when one best-friend ends the relationship while the other tries everything possible to repair it? That was the simple premise that inspired a range of complex and deeply meaningful sequences in \"The Banshees of Inisherin\".The story was set off Ireland's west coast and on an isolated island in that region. P\u00e1draic S\u00failleabh\u00e1in (Colin Farrell) and Colm Doherty (Brendan Gleeson) were the lifelong friends at the heart of the script.Colm is the one who chose to end the bond, which saw P\u00e1draic doing whatever it took - despite Colm's self-mutilation ultimatums - to heal the rift between them. Before long, the gloves came off - or rather, the fingers.The only explanation for the apparent tiff between the men was Colm telling P\u00e1draic, \"I just don't like you no more.\" Plenty of suspense revolved around this line and what it implied. Colm's later explanation about time slipping away from him and his urgent need to do something more useful with his life than waste it indulging in dull conversations with his bestie made a dark sort of sense.Colin was so vulnerable and innocent, it truly made me feel sorry for the man. That side of the actor was great to see, though. As for Brendan, his sincere performance made it a challenge to refute his reasons for leaving Colin's character in such a loop.The scenes between P\u00e1draic and his sister Siobh\u00e1n (Kerry Condon) added to the flow of things in \"The Banshees of Inisherin\". I also loved watching what Barry Keoghan contributed to this movie as Dominic Kearney.Also in focus was the magnificent Irish countryside. The landscape was magical, almost like something out of a fairy tale. I'm sure the cinematographer had a heckuva field day shooting some of the outdoor sequences.Around that time the Irish Civil War was also in full swing, adding to the movie's passive thrill. I liked how they wove elements of that historic moment into the plot, perhaps mainly to balance things out. But they barely gave it any real attention, which was good. The main plotline lay elsewhere.There was also a \"nice\" - those who've seen the move will catch the reference - philosophical leaning to the story.Final Notes:\nRemarkable performances and outstanding timing set high tones in this dark comedy about a friendship gone wrong. The sheer not-knowing-why angle was delightful to watch as it played out.Tender moments were also present, adding to the captivation and warmth of this story, which I'm sure is going to stay in my mind for months to come.The movie aligned perfectly with the spirit of the genre. It took a simple storyline and lent it a world of gravitas that was timeless and relatable. I'd call this movie a work of genius, but many before me have already started appending that honour to it.",

            "content": "I love the films of Martin McDonagh, and \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" is no exception; I'd even go so far to say this might be his best film. It is a richly layered and brilliant film that is both darkly hilarious and tragic at the same time. Frankly it is a masterpiece, and will certainly be one to watch for in the Best Picture race! This is a gut-punch of a comedic drama like only McDonagh can make it - expertly toeing the line between laugh out loud funny and heart-wrenching melancholy. I laughed throughout the film, and yet it struck me so hard emotionally by the end, leaving me with a lot to think about and ponder. The film is a finely-crafted feel-bad treat, and the more I think about it, the more I love it!This is easily one of the most remarkable films this year, and yet it may be one of the more small and subtle premises of any film in 2022. I loved how simple the premise was; it is really refreshing to see a film do so much with such a subtle and human premise. The film essentially follows a \"break-up\" between two friends, as we see how far one is willing to go to fight for their friendship, and conversely how far the other will go to block him out of his life. By the end of the film we really come to understand each character's point of view, and the reasoning behind their occasionally extreme actions. Brendan Gleeson's character, Colm, has motivations that I found quite interesting - especially because we can fully see where he is coming from, but also see the pettiness behind it. Without giving away too much, I loved how it touched on feelings of running out of time in life, and picking exactly how you wish to spend your remaining time, as we all only have a limited amount. The thematic writing in this film was especially strong, McDonagh excellently explores themes of fate, friendship, loneliness, life and death. All these themes are touched on, and what I found most interesting was that in a way each character represented one of these themes in one way or another.This film is very thought provoking, but it doesn't always have the easiest answers. It challenges the viewer to think about the content of the film on deeper levels. And yet... it really cannot be overstated how hilarious this movie is! If one describes the film as only a dark comedy that is concerned with loneliness and existentialism, one would be painting a different portrait of the film, because this movie has big laughs throughout! It is very funny and has such clever, well-crafted jokes. McDonagh is a master of this type of dry humour and wit, and really knows how to play the audience. The editing also really helps, as the editor has a strong understanding of comedic timing, knowing exactly how to cut and time the jokes. Every single joke and funny moment landed perfectly, I was dying laughing at times! While it is quite funny, it does also make you feel sad at times too, as overall it does tell a story about the loss of friendship between two men. The tone is a dramedy, as funny as it is don't expect this to be a slapstick comedy flick, and McDonagh balances the two tones extremely well. One scene you could be bursting with laughter, and the next you are deeply emotional and very resonant to what is going on. It never compromised either tone, instead letting the comedy build on the emotional scenes and the emotional scenes build on the comedy. It was just this perfect balance you rarely see in film; something I love about McDonagh's filmmaking style!One of the most outstanding aspects of this film is the incredible acting on display. The film is a fantastic \"In Bruges\" reunion, reconnecting stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson with McDonagh, as well as adding in some great talent in the form of Kelly Condon and Barry Keoghan. This could easily be Colin Farrell's best performance to date - and he has given us a lot of good performances over the years! This one, however, is pitch perfect. He's hilarious in it, especially as his character is almost never aware of how he is being funny, instead is very hurt and offended at the things we are laughing at. He is a master of comedic timing, nailing every comedic moment his character gets. There's a lot of face comedy in his performance as well which was wonderful, Farrell is very good at acting only with facial expressions - even his stares communicate so much. It is a very subtle and nuanced performance, I could see a best actor nomination coming out of this! I really loved his character, P\u00e1draic, and how his identity was so rooted in how nice he is (even if he is intentionally a bit dull). He has quite the fascinating shift in how he sees himself and his life as the film went on. I really loved this performance and character. Brendan Gleeson was also perfect for his role and so good here. He doesn't have as much to do as Colin does, but it is so great seeing his character's gruff persona bumping up against Colin's nice guy persona. Gleeson really embodied his character, delivering a performance that felt very lived in and natural. Kerry Condon was also fantastic, and had some phenomenal moments that really stand out. I loved Barry Keoghan too, he was hysterical playing the town idiot, and somehow fit the role perfectly!I loved the setting of the island off the coast of Ireland! The location really felt like a character in the film, as the setting informs how the characters make their choices and who they are as people. It actually informed a lot of the comedy too! Plus... the landscapes look stunning! The cinematography is outstanding, not just in the way they gorgeously capture the Irish hillsides (which have some natural beauty), but even the interiors were shot beautifully too. It felt like they were shooting with lanterns and natural light. I loved that they let the setting be filled with darkness, which made it feel more authentic. The use of focus pulling was also quite excellent here too, especially when it came to using this to only show silhouettes in the background. I didn't expect such lush cinematography from a comedy! It found it quite interesting how shots/setups would mirror themselves throughout the film based on the current state of the relationship, for example you would see one shot with Gleeson sitting outside and Farrell inside, and then 45 minutes later the same shot but reversed. McDonagh's visuals have never been better! I also really thought Carter Burwell's score was quite fitting for the film!The standouts here really are the writing, directing and acting, but overall this film is so well-made in every area of production. It may not be my personal favourite of McDonagh's, but it is one of his strongest directorial efforts to date. It's essentially flawless in my mind, there is not much to criticize at all. While it is a very unorthodox film and has a very small scale plot, it is a must see for this year and is a top contender for the Oscars! Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are excellent here, proving that whenever they work with Martin McDonagh the result will be perfection! This is one of my favourites of the year, I loved it! Who doesn't want to laugh about heartbreak?",

            "content": "This was a lovely film about the hardships of growing up outcast from society and struggling with friendship. It centers around the titular islands off of Ireland, during their Civil War. Not many will realize after watching this film that Ireland boasts one of the most thriving modern economies, and that despite the border which enshrouds its legacy there are only 18% of the Irish counties within that district which rebel against the Christian doctrine. My aunt and uncle are members of a local traditional Irish music band and play at bars frequently within the area. Directly from them, I learned about Riverdance and the culture of Gaelic traditions. My uncle plays the Irish flute, and my aunt plays the fiddle. The problems with this movie are major, however. The violence with Gleeson really overshadow the meaningfulness which was intended for the film. They could have done away with some of the violent imagery. As a fan of horror movies, even I was taken aback by the scenes when they had very little payoff and even smaller plot building around them. Other parts of the movie remind me of Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven, but with even more authenticity. Also subtracting from the film were superstar Colin Farrel's spray tan. How could a man on the islands of Ireland use so much spray tan? His performance was on par, but his often-confused facial expressions did little to enhance the script. Barry Keoghan was underutilized, I thought, yet brought a lot more to the movie than Farrel and his overutilized sister. The movie perpetuates myths about Ireland which could have been chiseled away at, I thought. However, it was an enjoyable, lighthearted movie with its hands just on too many deep pockets of emotion to hold together perfectly. Had it been a little simpler with violence, and a little less overacted by Farrel, it could have been golden. Also, I thought there were supposed to be banshees? Where's the banshees?",

I've seen his accent unfairly criticised by some but for me, he gets it more or less right. (Note for the non-Irish reader: Ireland has many, quite distinct accents, and that is not Farrell's real accent, even though he really does have an Irish accent, so what I meant is that he gets the new accent right, for me.) Gleeson's accent was more of his own, and slightly out of place, and Keoghan's accent let him down in an otherwise excellent performance. Kerry Condon was flawless.The story was odd but still believable. The distant backdrop of the civil war rang true. Pat Short played the character he always plays but it worked well here.The only real issue is the dialogue. There were too many instances of characters saying things Irish people (especially Irish people of that era) wouldn't say, and while McDonagh usually gets Ireland right, here, he's betrayed by his London upbringing, I think. It affects the suspension of disbelief, to someone actually genuinely familiar with Ireland.That being said, non-Irish audiences will miss most if not all of that, and the film is great otherwise, so I could see some awards coming. Keoghan and Condon have to be dark horses for supporting actor/actress Oscars. Well worth a watch.",

It is a very rich film that deserves all the applause it receives and it is a pure masterclass of acting.The funny thing is that it seems like Martin McDonagh made kind of a prequel to \"In Bruges\" with Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson portraying similiar characters (yet in different circumstances) and show off the same dynamic. It feels like the film portrays the great-grand parents of those two In Bruges' characters. The environment of course is different and extremly unique in its own way. Colin Farrell surely gives one of his greatest performances and this is the film he will most likely be remembrered forever for. He was brave to show all kind of different emotions that he hesitated to show most of his film career. Brendan Gleeson is simply terrific. Finally he gets the recoginition he is overdue for a long time already. Its such an interesting character and constantly unpredictable. Then you have Barry Keoghan who hits the final straw of becoming one of the respected actors of his career. He really has the most tragic charaxcter of all and he masters it marvelously next to the two more famous actors besides him. Kerry Condon also gives an extremly beautiful performance full of strengths. From that perspective the film is already a winner but then we also have a very well balanced direction by Martin McDonagh and an extremly well drafted screenplay by him. Thi sin addition to a fantasic cinematography and great score makes this film a true masterpiece of the year.

            "content": "As a devotee of McDonagh's previous work, In Bruges and Three Billboards Outside Ebbings Missouri, my expectations were high but still tempered with some trepidation....everyone is due a fall eventually! This was another success.McDonagh again uses a mundane setting to construct a narrative around human relationships wherein a complexity of attitudes, values, behaviours and needs unfold. Dark humour is juxtaposed against profound tragedy; absurd incidents are aligned with banal events to resounding effect. The dialogue is both comedic and poignant.....you are invited to laugh and then subsequently cry, as used to meaningfully in 3 Billboards, but again exercised here with a deft touch.The film is rich and layered, enabling personal interpretation, the ending being a superb example, where actions can be read as metaphors. The Irish setting of the time, with the significant sinister presence of the civil war, is perhaps being played out in microcosm within this isolated community...?? The characters are maybe symbolic and representative of any community and thus depict the tensions that can exist therein.....if we dont talk and listen, bad things can happen! The portrayal of the police officer is a case study in itself.The cinematography adds as a constant backdrop to this enigmatic tragicomedy. The development of Mrs McCormick as a the \"banshee\" heralding death grows with the tonal transition of the film....from cliched old lady to quirky harbinger of doom.The acting, and its direction of, is excellent...kudos to Berry Keoghan especially!A thought provoking piece of art entertainment which should be watched again and again. Thankyou once again, Martin McDonagh.",

This movie somehow seemed to touch on underlying themes of some of my worst memories and some of my worst fears. I love a good dark comedy, but for me I couldn't find this film comical. This film left me with hopelessness and dread in the pit of my stomache.Beyond the content, however; I can acknowledge that the acting, cinematography, dialog, filming location, and many other aspects of the production were top notch.

There is even a banshee-like crone who appears periodically and speaks only of doom and sad tidings. The gloomy atmosphere pervades even the pub, where smiles are absent, and mirthless fiddlers play without emotion.The characters are as follows:\n1. The protagonist, Padraic, a simple but well-meaning \"good\" man, who loses what cheerfulness and happiness he has when his only friend 'unfriends' him to pursue music seriously through his fiddle. With the death of his donkey, he turns bitter and hateful.2. The friend, who mourns a life of idle pursuits, and ends up cutting his own fingers off to spite Padraic.3. The policeman, who sexually abuses and beats his dim-witted son until he commits suicide by drowning.4. The priest that hates his job.5. Padraic's sister, who escapes the island to take a job on the mainland.We never learn anything endearing about these characters and I saw no humor in their dilemmas.",

Such a row!One could imagine such a conversation taking place on the (fictional) Isle of Inisherin today. Back in 1923, the pair, Padraic (Colin Farrell) and Colm (Brendan Gleeson) are drinking buddies. Every afternoon after he's attended to his flock of animals, Padraic comes around Colm's humble home near the coast and they head to the local pub. That is, until one day when Colm decides he's heard enough of his friend's stories and just wants to be left alone with his fiddle, which completely flummoxes his pal. Padraic lives with his spinster sister, Siobhan (Kerry Condon), who unlike her brother, is well read and curious of the outside world. Unable to keep his mouth shut, Padraic only antagonizes Colm further and further until it's a full on feud.Inisherin is just off the Irish coast, so close, that the locals can see and hear the sounds of battle raging during the mainland's civil war. The people of Inisherin enjoy being on an island to themselves, even if that isolation is as much of a burden as a benefit. The local half-wit, Dominic (Barry Keoghan) is abused by his father (Gary Lydon), who happens to also be the only cop around. The local Priest (David Pearse) can be as foul-mouthed as his Parishioners. Lurking around the fringes of the land is a real life Banshee in the form of Mrs. McCormick who is always spreading her gloom and doom about town.Writer-Director Martin McDonagh writes sharp dialogue, often tinged with a caustic humor. As with IN BRUGES and THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING MISSOURI, that wit presages darker turns. The Irish Civil War is clearly used as a metaphor for the feud. Colm searches for more meaning in his life through music, while Padraic is content with leading his simple existence. They are like brothers, but, the friction only grows. It's \"war\".Farrell and Gleeson are very good here. Their real life friendship adds all the more realism to the battle of wills that ensues. Condon is in many ways the conscience of the movie. She loves her brother and Inisherin, but, she too needs more out of life. As fine as all the cast is, McDonagh never quite manages to fully explore his symbolism. The pub is sparsely attended, and most of the other locals only seem to interact when its convenient for the story to do so. One never gets a true sense of community. And, in that vacuum, the Padriac-Colm skirmish comes off as bitter if not outright nasty - it ends up feeling more mean than meaningful. McDonagh is trying to exposie a dark hole in the soul of the Irish people, but can't quite bring it off. Still, it's hard to criticize a movie for ambition, especially one as well-crafted and performed as THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN.",

The locations encourage some of the best cinematography in Ireland, which is more than achieved in this film. The best of all, after the script, are the performances.

While comedic moments are sprinkled throughout the movie, they are quite rare. It deals with a heavy but interesting subject and it's likely sadder than you'd imagined. Colin Farrel explained \"In Bruges\" as a comedy with dark moments and \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" as a drama with comedic moments.Everyone on the small island called Inisherin is miserable. Only a few hundred people live there is not much to do. Every day is like the last one. It's a recipe for madness.Gleeson's character does not want to be friends with Farrell's character no more. Gleeson wants to focus on his music and find peace in his life. He is not very nice to Farrell and when Gleeson is questioned by Farrell, Gleeson makes the point that being nice will not make people remember you. Farrel then says how he remembers how his mother was nice. So what is more important? Being remembered or being nice? It's very thought-provoking and interesting.This is a strong contender for the Oscar. Farrell and Condon both have very good chances of winning. They are the pillars of this movie.

But as the movie progresses, the absurdity of the characters' actions suddenly begin to make sense; we are eventually supposed to realise the symbolic connection between the absurdity of the Irish Civil war and the absurdity of the characters' actions.At the end of the movie, when the two men stand on the beach and talk about the Civil war coming to an end, suddenly so much makes sense.If you think of the two main characters in this movie as a representation of the two sides at war in Ireland in the 1920s, it becomes a deep and meaningful message delivered in a very powerful way: Just like at war, the men fought with each other for what seemed like absurd, unjustifiable reasons, they harmed themselves, and their stubbornness just caused greater destruction. And just like in times of war; the woman left, and the young man died. I think it is especially powerful for the Irish who were affected by the Civil War in recent history.This film was incredibly acted, beautifully pictured, and the subtle meaning behind the confusing and unsettling storyline was all the more powerful because it was so elegantly hidden in front of our eyes the entire movie.",

            "content": "The symbolism in the Banshees of Inisherin (2022), is everywhere. The whole film feels like a commentary on loneliness. First off, the film takes place, exactly 100 years ago, on a tiny island, off of the coast of Ireland. The sparsely, small population, moving about, around this island, either walking, riding a bike or traveling in a horse cart, also have access to the mainland, via boats, at their tiny island port. But, the isolation is felt, all throughout the film. This isolation is the island itself, which enhances the loneliness, but maybe the isolation is a good thing, as the explosions of civil war are heard, just over the hills on the mainland. From here, the loneliness moves further into the story, as we meet our two main characters, Colm (Brendan Gleeson) and P\u00e1draic (Colin Farrell). Colm is a musician, who lives alone with his dog. P\u00e1draic is a boring milk farmer, who lives with his bored, lonely sister, Siobh\u00e1n (Kerry Condon). She definitely needs a change of scenery. The loneliness carries over into the supporting cast, as evidenced by P\u00e1draic's friend, Dominic (Barry Keoghan). Dominic tries to help P\u00e1draic's situation with Colm, while struggling with his own, dead-beat father, the island policeman, Peadar (Gary Lydon). Their tragic, complicated existence takes place, in another lonely house.Whenever the plot takes you into any of their homes, the mood feels lonely and isolated, in every scene. One day, Colm decides he doesn't like P\u00e1draic anymore and ends their long friendship. Of course, this makes no sense to P\u00e1draic and our story turns into a complex character study, as we try to unravel why their friendship is over. In-between funny situations and banter between the characters, the plot gets even more, shockingly interesting, as Colm has to increase his threats, because P\u00e1draic won't stay away from him. The cast in this film does a brilliant job with their performances. It's no wonder this film was nominated for nine Oscars. Four of those were for cast members. Farrell and Gleeson, both deserve the Oscar nod, with their totally believable portrayals, of the two sides of this story. The calm clash between these two forces, is ever so incredibly polite, yet you literally feel things, unraveling even more.This film is a comedy-drama, but it does get serious in places and sometimes does teeter on the edge of fantasy too, especially when we see the image of the island elder, Mrs. McCormick (Sheila Flitton), who resembles any of the classic gypsy-women or witches from Hollywood's past. It's also the ultimatum, Colm gives to P\u00e1draic, that is carried out to its shocking, unbelievable conclusion, which enhances the fantastic angle of the film. This film is well-shot and the island's pale, chilly, isolated loneliness, is still depicted as respectful beauty, because of the excellent cinematography. The mood is represented just right. I totally agree, that the Banshees of Inisherin (2022), deserves its Oscar nods, but what keeps me from giving this film a 9/10, is the lack of a soundtrack, which hampers the pacing of the film, making it slow-down a little, but I did enjoy this film a lot.8.7 (B+ My Grade) = 8 IMDB.",

            "content": "Having recently watched Andrew Haigh's brilliant indie \"45 Years\", what struck me about \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" is how similar the two films are thematically, exploring the tension naturally borne from man's vainglorious obsession with creating a lasting legacy for himself (once he reaches a certain age), which results in an inability to appreciate the relationships he's formed in the past, consequently neglecting them in the present in a self-centred attempt to influence the future. Therefore, although lacking in anything particularly original to say, creator Martin McDonagh brings to this familiar concept a totally different (comedic) tonal approach (which differentiates it from the rest, gifting the piece with a quirky personality), effectively doing justice to the tragedy of the tale (depicting how pathetic it is, in the grand scheme of things) whilst humorously coming at it from a totally unique angle, inventively using the period & isolated location to poetically reflect the fact that although the islanders are separated from the war playing out across the water on the mainland (seemingly spared from the horrors taking place elsewhere), they are equally at odds with their own enemies (within) which manifest themselves physically in lands closer to home - & thus, despite the naive perception of peace surrounding them, equal amounts of destructive conflict are erupting at either side of the ocean between those in one location & the other (juxtapositioning the visual tranquility by holding a true mirror to the character's behaviours, in the sea which divides the two).Plus, the film acts as a social commentary, chronicling the inevitability of bloodshed when communication breaks down amongst those who have a disagreement (regardless of how petty), which is often exacerbated by toxic masculinity & an unwillingness to simply talk about one's feelings with other males. That point is only reaffirmed by the fact that the only individual who actually seems to get through to either side is P\u00e1draic's sister, a woman - residing above the behavioural limitations imposed by their socially incompetent gender.All of this nuance is carefully embedded within a seemingly light hearted flick, enriching the viewing experience all the more further & I feel as though I haven't even scratched the surface of how deep this plunges. That's how good it is.",

The things that made them, the bond that made the pair was the fight for independence. The Anti-Treaty IRA wants to keep on fighting to achieve full freedom. At all cost.

The Banshees of Inisherin is the type of movie that is sorely lacking in today's lineup of offerings, having been overrun by huge, money-generating, bubblegum junk, featuring grown people dressed in ridiculous costumes doing ridiculous things very seriously.Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good superhero movie now and again. But in a healthy and sane world, I wouldn't have to sift through 9,000 of them in order to find a single quality film, more anchored in real life, that doesn't rely on CGI to sell itself.Many of the other reviewers complain that this movie is a waste of their time and it is disgusting and horrible and blah blah blah. You're right. For you, you're right. Go find something different. But I for one am very grateful that movies like this still get made. Yes, there are some really curious decisions and actions made by some of the characters in this film. That's part of the humanity of it that gets your mind asking questions like: Why? What must be going on inside of that person? What are they feeling? What's going on in their heads? Are there any situations where I might find myself thinking and feeling in similar ways?

In either case, the movie, a community isolated in more ways than one across from a civil-war-ridden mainland, is to be taken as a metaphor. Taking it literally would simply raise the question of why not commit Gleeson's character to a mental institution and ultimately would ask whether this experience of just under two hours is the purpose of Cinema? So, I will see the whole thing as metaphor.The performances genuinely showcase the craft of these actors and are worth the viewing just to watch them, especially Barry Keoghan. The photography, the sets and overall look and feel are truly inspired and without a blemish.This movie is truly an experience and if one refrains from asking \"so what?\" or pointing out that in two hours the audience deserves at least one moment of feeling good, and if one simply accepts that life is hard and then you die, then, this is a masterpiece in explaining drifting apart, alienation and the frequent inability to find anything positive to hold on to and overcome one's own demons as well as the inevitable.",

All in all this was a masterclass in emotion and humans being left to their own devices.7/10 so why only 7?

Just breathtaking.The story of this film is basically two grown man on a sparsely populated Irish island who decide to behave like 6 year olds and take it to it's ultimate conclusion. I know while watching we should look for themes like friendship, loss, mortality angst etc,, but ultimately I felt I was watching nothing more than Dumb and Dumber, where one decided he didn't want to be friends no more and the other could not accept it. Does this make it a bad film? No, the story is unusual and original and engaging enough to keep you watching. Also half way through the film takes a dark turn and you are not sure what is going to happen next. The acting was really great, but I would not have expected anything less with this great cast of actors.So is this a great film? No. Whereas in a hundred years time we will still be watching Brendan Gleeson and Pat Shortt in The Guard (2011) and Barry Keoghan in '71 (2014), both truly great films that you can see over and over again, I would be surprised if anyone would watch The Banshees of Inishirin again after seeing it once.",

The acting is 10 out of 10 there is no doubt about that, i can sense some Oscar nominations to be on the way. Same goes for the cinematography, somewhat throughout the movie i felt like i was watching an old film. The story is set in the 1920s so it makes sense to film it that way, cold and gritty. Writer/Director Martin McDonagh does an excellent job on the movies overall tone. Not a tone we tend to see much of nowadays it's all superhero films and big blockbuster action films. It's nice to see original small story classics making it to the screen again.Then said, i'm not sure on what i feel about the story. The main plot is decent enough and captures the real loneliness a person can go through when feeling alienated, and the depression civil wars can have on friendships. I actually got glued into the story for 3/4 of the film. Although certain plot points started to drag on for too long and others made no sense nor were they resolved or even explained. The old lady with the stick made no sense as we didn't get enough detail on her reasons. The end of the movie just has you sat on a fence trying to make sense on what you've just watched, near to the end of the film i started to scratch my head wondering where the plot was aiming to. What was the aim? I get that people go through this type of stuff and Director Martin McDonagh probably wanted to make the movie as real feeling as possible. It ended up being confusing, but i'm not saying the movie was bad, i really enjoyed the acting and overall tone. I just feel like i've missed something?",

You can, but I don't buy that idea so well. Artistically, what attracts me the most is not its beautiful centered direction or the beautiful long open plans, but the performances, all the actors are impeccable, with emphasis on Kerry Condon, Brendan Gleeson and Brendan Gleeson. \"Inisherin's Banshees\" received extremely strong favorable and unfavorable reviews, I don't agree with either side, its melancholy and exaggerated humor attracts me, and combining this with beautiful performances, good direction and an irreproachable authorial touch by the director, they form a set of factors that make me like the film, despite its slow pace.

The score itself is very fitting and quiet, yet really adds a lot to the experience of watching the film. It's extremely mysterious and immersive.The acting is great all around, and the actors have a lot of chemistry with each other which makes their interactions feel very real. Colin Farrell is perfect as P\u00e1draic, he's very likeable and interesting to watch whilst also being strangely relatable. Additionally, Barry Keoghan is brilliant as Dominic and is especially loveable. I was completely heartbroken when he died! These great performances are paired well with the fast and snappy dialogue that carry the film.This movie absolutely nails the tone and pacing.

            "content": "One of the great favorites to win the statuette for best film of the year and, frankly, it has plenty of merits to win this recognition. Director Martin McDonagh once again sets precedents as one of the great British directors of the moment and one of the most interesting directors in the industry. After his stupendous Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri in 2017, the director offers us his fourth feature film that once again positions him as one of the great favorites for the awards season.A little masterpiece.We are in the presence of a surprising film thanks to the cunning of a director who writes and directs a film that takes us through black humor, drama and violence in such a consistent way that all you have to do is enjoy a proposal different from what you we are accustomed that it is simply a pleasure while we watch the screen.Interpreted in a brutal and honest way by its cast in which if justice exists they should go as strong candidates for the awards season, especially a Colin Farrell who gives us the best interpretation of his career. The actor is a naturally gifted, but playing P\u00e1draic S\u00failleabh\u00e1in he has brought everything to perfection. An interpretation that cuts deep due to its intensity and its uniqueness that is totally hypnotic to the eye.As well as Farrell we cannot leave out Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan who are also brutally inspired that they follow the same rope on the way to the nominations.The wonderful landscapes of Ireland are portrayed by a wonderful photograph by Ben Davis that places us in the solitude of a town where the dissatisfaction of his characters is wrapped up as a great contrast on the screen.A film that tells us about something more than enmity.The intelligence of his script is to take us from a simple premise like enmity for no reason to realize the depth of a script that tells us about the passage of time and all its consequences.It is a film that hides in its black humor a strong drama about how we have lived our lives and how we have wasted time falling into a routine from which we often do not realize how we wasted our opportunities to do something different.Loneliness is also present and the dependence on the lives of others, being routine people in our lives.ConclutionDefinitely, we are in the presence of perhaps the best film of the year or the strongest candidate to stay with the greatest recognition in the industry.A visual and interpretive delight that thanks to its wonderful script we face a film of emotions and sensations about the passage of time and loneliness.",

I am an Irish person living in the west and was utterly distracted with how wrong they got some things. The main story, that two men could fall out over such a thing, is totally okay in my opiniom. I really understood Brendan Gleeson's frustration at his life and the desperation of his situation. Very well done indeed. I don't however appreciate how they portrayed the islanders as being ignorant, strange and completely disconnected from Irish politics. Some of the characters don't feel quite real. For example the pub owner seems a bit like a characture rather than a person. There are stupid mistakes in the setting like when they say \"it takes two to tango\", nobody in Ireland would use that phrase in that time period. In fact I think they depicted the time period completely wrong overall. It drags on a small bit, there are way too many quiet scenes (but of course others may see as an emphasis on how quiet their lives are). I was looking for a more satisfying ending aswell, it just sort of ended on nothing. It does have it's moments but they are disjointed and too unbelievable. I feel that nothing actually 'happened' and that I could predict where most situations would end up too easily. I think of the movie more as a poem than as a story. In the end I just didn't get it, which is fine. I would still recommend it because most other people did get it, just not for me.",

He returns to the theme of communities that live on the margins of society. This time on an island, where everyone knows each other and tolerates each other. The key player in this movie is the dialogues, McDonagh is an excellent storyteller but the dialogues here are perfect and in tune, with the right amount of comedy and drama. The movie is about friendship, loneliness, tradition, community, and time. Colin Farrell is spectacular, superb as P\u00e1draic S\u00failleabh\u00e1in, a lonely man who accepts his fate on the island. It feels like the role was written for him, he is solid and embodies his character with such fluidity and lightness.The movie \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" is an amazing movie to watch, both visually with beautiful cinematography and traditional Irish ballads.A must to watch!!!",

            "content": "It had me captivated the whole way, the premise of the film is so simple but the resolution is hard to fathom. What do you do when someone just doesn't want to be friends anymore but they're all you have? I was so curious how they would tie up the ending. It did a lot of unexpected things, Gleeson's character starts off as relatable, he wants to create a legacy in music and he doesn't have time for his friend but then in avoiding the friendship he's being unintentionally nasty. In response Farrell is spiteful in return but this just leaves them both depressed. In the end Gleeson character realises he is depressed with life not his friend and his friend gives him the option to die and he doesn't take it, in essence Farrell cures his depression, he realises all that matters is being nice to others and his friendship inspires him to make a new song. Unfortunately though Farrells character can't let it all go he loses everything and becomes toughened by it all, but he is nice still in the end offering to look after the dog. So my takeaway was that life is more than what you leave the world after you die but being nice to those around you while you live. The subplot of his sister leaving was sad too for Keoghan character dying but I feel that was more reflecting on the themes with the Policeman, he was also self loathing and taking it out on others around him but losing his son who he treated badly made him have the same realisation that you only have the good deeds you do while alive and the people you help. So in a bittersweet ending they all realise they only have themselves to blame for their different versions of despair but living alone to avoid being hurt by anyone isn't an answer, kind of like no one remembers those who only serve themselves.",

The idea of 2 men falling out doesn't exactly scream excitement and thrilling but the excellent storywriting and the characters managed to keep me thoroughly enjoying every minute of it.However it's a tale about much more than two men who have a falling out. It clearly marks the importance of friendship, dealing with loneliness and depression, the impending loom of death and the use of comedy to ease the tougher moments in life. The writer deals with incredibly dark topics like a Father abusing his son, a war that's literally on your doorstep, Suicide, and losing the people you love the most. It deals with these matters eloquently and leaves nothing to the imagination, it clearly shows you a simple man's life and the things that happen each step of the way that cause pain, suffering and confusion.It manages to weave the perfect blend of sadness and comedy into the story that keeps you watching eagerly and always wanting to see which path it takes next. I simply loved each of the characters quirks and behaviour and you can just imagine that a little island somewhere in Ireland still has people just like it to this day.\"It takes two to tango\"\n\"I don't want to tango\"\n\"Well you danced with your dog\"\nA line that is hardly a stand up comedy zinger but I couldn't help but laugh out loud at Colin Farrells perfect delivery of the last line. This sums up The Banshees perfectly. It's subtle humour and thoroughly thought provoking moments leave an impact on anyone who takes the time to sit down and really focus on the film, and it's a excellently written, directed and acted movie that contained every kind of emotion making it one of the best films I've seen all year.\"Yeah maybe there are banshees, I just don't think that they scream to portend death anymore. I think they just sit back, amused and observe\"",

Farrell's donkey, a love, is dead, Gleeson's house, a possession, is burnt down, the two men are left standing, but the conflict is unending.Is it not apt, if not a little disappointing, that Keoghan and Condon (the voice of reason) have won BAFTAs for their roles in this film if nothing else.I don't understand (in particular) the Irish reviewers who have deemed it pointless, boring or having nothing to say (even if they were not to agree with it).Regardless of this specificity, for its applicability to conflict in general, for its musings on the human condition (stubbornness and niceness), and for the performances and cinematography perhaps above all else, I think it would be well worthy of winning the Oscar for Best Film.

The Banshees of Inisherin will not be my favourite film of the year but it has stayed with me, randomly coming into my mind in the days that followed. The film felt like a folktale as I was watching; there was a kind of unrealness to it even though it seemed very grounded in reality with bleak scenary and every-day-life quality to the story telling. There are broad sweeping themes of legacy and seeking meaning from life which are spelled out and the more dramatic events are bold and symbolic, again, adding to the folktale feel. There is a lot of dry humour spliced in with the drama and I did laugh in some places but I found the humour was sometimes used as a pallet cleanser to the tragedy to keep the audience on board with the film, rather than being integral to the story.

Can you handle extreme mental illness, cruelty, beloved pets dying and endless desperation? If that's your idea of intellectual and emotional stimulation, you'll find this fascinating. I guess Zi was looking for a little Irish charm and actual humor. Both of these elements are missing in spades. I just cannot figure out why it got good reviews.",

This film captures the nature and depth beautifully. A dispute with no real cause reflects the confusion of the Irish Civil War going on in the background. The policeman the priest and the old woman each demonstrate their power over the village life, as the bleakness of life in the west unsoftened by the beauty of the scenery. Poverty, boredom and a tiny island population all push people together, compatible or not. The story captures all of this with an understanding of the Irish use of English, the wit and tension of the bar where the drink can result in laughter or a right hook, and the sadness of women who live for the local news and not much more.All round a superb thought provoking film about an Ireland that few not native understand\n.",

It was the goodness (not sure it sums it right) that separates the two. It is actually interesting how a whole another story is emerged through little flick in the main theme of the logline.As always, McDonagh perfectly blends the comedy with dark themes while taking us back in time to Inisherin.Plus, it is always such a great experience to see yourself in characters and their actions which led me thinking if I'm more like.

The look of the film and breathtaking shots of the island off the West coast of Ireland are breathtaking. The film is expertly directed and crafted, with great lead performances and exceptional supporting roles for Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan. The film feels as though it is an allegory or fable akin to the Irish Civil war at the time with Mrs. McCormick (the old lady in black) serving as it's oracle or ultimate observer of events through time. The tone is difficult to adjust to at times, and the humor is very dark, but that is what you can come to expect from a Martin McDonagh film. Some scenes will leave you in absolute awe, like the one with Dominic and Kerry by the lake, but the movie overall lacks a bit in structure and lasting impact.Setting, Conflict, Character, Dialogue, Theme, Plot, and Climax: A-Runtime: 1:54Audience Engagement (do you feel runtime): NoTop Genres: Comedy, Drama (Fiction)Genre(s) rating\nComedy - 8\nDrama - 9Genre Average Score: 8.5\nDirecting: 10\nCinematography/lighting: 10\nStory/Narrative: 8\nStructure: 7\nDialogue: 9\nScore(music): 10\nEditing: 9\nActing: 9\nCharacterization: 9\nMise en Sc\u00e8ne/Visual Design: 10\nVisual Effects: 9\nSound Design: 9\nCostumes/Makeup: 10\nLasting Impact: 8\nOriginality: 8Overall: 8.97.",

That's not to say the cinematography isn't up to snuff, quite the opposite, the cinematography is beautiful and makes the most of its locations.Rather, the movie is so intensely personal, and the actors, all of them so focused and concentrated, that it's easier to believe that the camera was invisible and that the whole thing is completely real.The viewing experience is completely enthralling and takes you on the full gamut of emotions - which means that at times it's hard to watch and will pull at your heart strings.Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell are extraordinary - intense and fully immersed, two quite breathtaking performances - but the entire ensemble deliver at the highest level , portraying a well realised and convincing character, warts and all - and there are plenty of warts. Kerry Condon playing Farrell's sister and Barry Keoghan playing the troubled son of the local policeman also stand out with magnificent and emotionally challenging performances (for the viewer at least).I feel like I've just been snooping on people's lives. Hell, even the animals put on a good show!Martin McDonagh, who wrote and directed this, deserves some serious accolades for his efforts - he has produced a seamless encounter with island life and eccentricity, a life that is both beautiful and terrible.",

            "content": "What on the surface seems to be a tale of two men, whose friendship has ended, slowly descending into hate and violence, is actually a metaphor condemning violence, war, and conflict.Set against the Irish Civil War (1921-1922), when an Ireland recently united in a War of Independence (1919-1921) turned on itself, The Banshees of Inisherin is the story of Colm and P\u00e1draic, part of a tiny community on a small island off the Irish coast, who likewise end a long friendship and turn on each other.Colm wakes up one day feeling that he needs to leave a legacy to the world, but his friendship with P\u00e1draic is getting in the way, so he ends it, offering no real reason why until pushed.P\u00e1draic can't accept this, continuously pestering his former friend who just wants to be left alone to create a musical legacy to leave the world. It's a decision that ultimately leads to madness and violence that both men inflict on themselves, each other, and the community around them.As with war, sectarian violence, and conflict, ultimately it's the community and innocents around the warring parties who suffer the most.Both Gleeson and Farrell offer fantastic performances, their genuine lost friendship is clear in the loss both men suffer, and there is a spectacular supporting cast helping writer director Martin McDonagh bring the film to life. The most compelling performances though (aside from the two stars) come from Barry Keoghan as Dominic, and Kerry Condon as P\u00e1draic's sister Siobhan.It's a fascinating and fantastic film, the parallels to the internal conflicts that have left such visible and lasting scars on Ireland are clear, but it's the wider condemnation of war and violence that lifts this. Combined with a self important Church, and a corrupt Police, both representing Government and social structures that hinder, ignore, and exacerbate the violence through self interest or a refusal to intervene, The Banshees of Inisherin is a film that will leave you thinking for a long time after its finished.",

However, what other reviewers aren't noticing is that it rarely tries to make anyone laugh. It's a rather dark drama that focuses heavily on the falling out of two friends. The characters manage to make themselves feel real while simultaneously engaging in the kind of brash and irrational actions that perfectly symbolize the emotions that come with loosing a friend. As others have mentioned, it also draws an excellent juxtaposition between its friend vs friend plot and the backdrop of 1920s Ireland. For anyone that loves Celtic culture, you will be completely drawn in by the cinematography and bits of everyday life depicted. Yes, it's long and it's not action & comedy packed, but know that if you like mature movies that make you think deeply about the lives, thoughts, and emotions of the characters involved that you will love it. It's fantastically acted, beautifully shot, and very well written. It's without a doubt the best thing to be released on HBO max this whole month and deserves a watch.",

But for now, it's all surface reactions.Most people at some point wonder and feel a deep longing to try a life on a beautiful, lonely Irish island. Especially if your DNA is primarily Irish (or Welsh, Scottish, Celt etc). And we all know that it would mean lots of alone time, lots of quiet, lots of walking, reading, looking at the ocean...every bit making it all the more delicious.What might not be so obvious is how crazy that might make us become.At first, I was positive that Colm was the terrible one. In the end, I wasn't too far away from that idea still. But in the meantime, it also came to light that pretty much all of them have foibles that, good or bad, might twist a person. But it was their interactions that caused so much of it. The poor schmuck Dominic was off because his policeman father regularly beat and \"fiddled\" with him causing him to be drunk 24 hrs a day. The policeman father was a sick pedo so his position of power allowed him to be evil without repurcussion until Padraic said it out loud at the pub.Paidraic was never going to be able to move forward with any kind of REAL life because there aren't any available women there to marry, have kids and a life with. Colm has let his never being a successful artist warp his actions out of frustration to the point of madness. Why else would he be willing to mutilate himself just to punish someone else he suddenly feels he has to control? Honestly, I think he came to hate Padraic because he, Padraic, was content and happy living a truly simple life on Inisherin. It made his own frustrations even harder to bear in the end.The only regular person there was Siobhan and the secondary characters who just went about their day like regular folks or looking for a way to have a fuller life by getting off the island.This wasn't much of a comedy, but it did have some funny moments. There were some truly sad moments that made me want to cry (but not in public). Poor Jenny, just a big sweet donkey that acted like a dog but she died because of what was happening. And Siobhan leaving her brother, knowing he'll never leave but she has to. And Dominic, his drowning after realizing he'll NEVER get a woman of his own. Truly heartbreaking.All in all, glad I saw it, but it definitely wasn't what I expected based on the clips or promos.",

What individuals achieve in life and what they didnt.We see the contrast beetween the young and the old.The \"burden\" of mariage and coupling is also slightly shown with influence on human behavior.The autority sickness that hits all men with some kind of power is personified in a policemen that is also in a closed space or environment.There is a mysterious old woman that \"could\" be explained as \"the life experience\" and somehow is feared becouse every individual after some time thinks it knows everything but when look at her: hum.. maybe not.Extraordinary performance of all actors with special regard to Collin Powell that made the best performance of his career so far.Some actors make performances so big that make some films oscar winners, this is almost one of that performances and the movie is already a winner.Outstanding job.It's oscar winner material.",

So making an actual list was nearly impossible. While I decided on my picks eventually, this film, in particular, could have easily been top 3 or even top 2. It's that good.The setting, characters, and story are all excellent in the film. When a movie can tackle such complex human relationships and individual characteristics you know it's going to be a moving piece of cinema. Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon, and Barry Keoghan could be nominated for their excellent performances. Gleeson deserves his praise, but Ke Huy Quan will win for supporting actor. Farrell, on the other hand, has a good shot at winning his first-ever academy award for one of the top performances of his storied career. It has that feel of a close nit-community that you just don't see anymore in movies. Yet it's the haunting feeling of the story that makes your eyes never want to leave the screen. This is a hard movie to swallow, so if you're not looking for something with tons of emotional weight you might want to skip this.

A number of reasons are speculated but the truth is, no-one really knows.The pair live on an island off the west coast of Ireland. The island life produces the room for eccentric behaviour with its rugged beauty, beaches and hard going roads. Both men live separate to each other. Colin's character, Padraic lives with his sister. Brendan's character, Colm lives with his border collie for company and also his music.The two's separation affects the entire community and it also grows, until the party who instigated it considers quite an extreme act. Once this begins, things go from bad to worse.This is not a film for the faint hearted. It also gives an insight into the Irish/Gaelic culture with its religion and superstition moving beside each other, sometimes at odds. Other brilliant performances come from Kerry Condon who plays Padraic's sister who is looking for a different way of life from the one offered on the island.

In the first part I was enjoying it but the second part, especially from the \"finger affair\" (and not only that), brought me outside of the atmosphere.

All I knew and needed to know was that it was a Martin McDonagh written and directed film. This man always finds a way to enthrall and amaze with his trademark of poetically comedic misery.So at the very least, I had the expectation of walking away from this cinematic experience satisfied and happy to have been there, which I certainly did.The story revolves around small conflicts on a small Irish island in the 1920s, with the Irish civil war rumbling in the background. Indeed it's a tale of how misery only leads to more misery, the value of kindness and being simply nice.By presenting this very small scale story with these larger than life characters The Banshees of Inisherin becomes a greatly relatable (fairy-)tale about the way war and other mindless conflict only hurts everyone involved. No matter who's in the perceived \"right\", in the end everyone suffers and no-one wins.While the subject matter is certainly quite depressing and often bizarre, it makes the contrasting comedic moments all the more potent and truly hilarious. The emotional journey is everything but spelled out, and the film doesn't attempt to cheaply manipulate the audience's experience at all. The balance between the wonderfully organic escalation of events and it's awesome theatrical presentation is spot on.Technically the camera work, the location, the editing and basically every little detail shown on screen is a feast of epic proportions. Martin McDonagh's directing and dialogue is incredibly charming and purposeful.The accompanying performances are utterly superb, especially Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Kerry Condon. Barry Keoghan also manages to pull off a type of character, who could easily feel forced or obnoxious to near perfect endearment.I'm happy to once again having the privilege to see such a different and unique film, by a cast and crew who clearly gave it their all.Thank you! This film is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "On a remote Island off the coast of Ireland a tiny community scratch a living as best they can. Two long time friends suddenly have a falling-out that leads to ever more desperate reactions by the two protagonists... Brendan Gleeson is Colm, who has abruptly made the decision to disassociate himself from his long-time friend P\u00e1draic - Colin Farrell - who is, needless to say, utterly confused as to why this has happened. Despite attempts by P\u00e1draic to mediate the situation, Colm resorts to increasingly drastic measures to keep his old friend away from him, which ultimately leads down some dark paths.Firstly, the cinematography and look of this Film is wonderful - the opening shot of falling out of the clouds to suddenly see the very green fields below us is a superb opener and the locations chosen really do place the viewer firmly in the remote Irish setting.The Acting is on the money by all of the major players - both Gleeson and Farrell, who played so well together in the directors previous In Bruges, again show their acting chops and the supporting Cast, especially Kerry Condon, all bring something to the roles.However, the Film unfolds at a glacial pace and almost all of the characters seem to be suffering from boredom or depression.Colm's reason for ditching P\u00e1draic appears to be because he now feels he is just 'dull', prompting P\u00e1draic to keep asking all and sundry 'Am I dull?'\nHe receives a back-handed compliment that he is a 'nice' person but Colm merely scoffs that nobody remembers 'nice' people..\nP\u00e1draic on the other hand, seems to misjudge his dealings with Colm, even when it is plain that he really needs to stay away. The way the two central characters seem to have no idea what they are doing, or why, is a flaw in the Film.The only character with any spark is Kerry Condon's Siobhan, who recognises the sheer drabness of the place and takes firm steps to get away. It is she who confronts Colm about why he has taken this action against P\u00e1draic, to which he again mumbles something about him being 'dull', to which her exasperated response - Your ALL dull' - kind of sums up the film.For me, the central 'feud' between the two men doesn't ring true and the we never get to know why Colm has acted this way in the first place. The Film really seems to meander looking for a resolution.Banshees is a very well made film - beautifully shot and acted - BUT the dramatic thrust seems to go nowhere. It is a 'nice' award-worthy Film....but it IS dull and nowhere near the masterpiece critics are saying it is.",

I understand there are some films that are meant to be arty or dialogue heavy. But even most of those films hold your attention because of the dialogue. There didn't really seem to be a point to this story. I know it's part of a series of plays but honestly I think it should've stayed there. Idk why critics gave this such a good rating. It didn't entertain. At all. I thought there would be some type of pay off or a deeper reason why Colm didn't want to be friends with Colin's character anymore. But there wasn't. Like I said, I understand Film is an art. However it's meant to entertain and hold your attention as well. Took me three tries to finish this. I just got bored. Performances were great as usual but that wasn't enough to save it. Kind of disappointed to be honest. \"Three Billboards\" and \"Seven Psychopaths\" were phenomenal. Same with \"In Bruges\". Honestly if you're into the whole art of film more than you are to have a great story and excitement then watch it.

In the same vein as Three Billboards, Outside Ebbing, Missouri, Mcdonagh once again weaves a visual, dramatic and emotional tale clothed in a painful beauty. The cinematography, pace and acting in Nomadland had similarities which made it a Best Picture (2020) and other awards. The intricacies of friendship, aging, loneliness affect everyone and one needs a \"quiet\" and introspective beauty to witness it. The continual parade of buddy movies, gun violence, gratuitous sex, and commercial schlock is tiring but movie companies have to pay the bills.",

This is a movie that is all about dialogue and acting and the cast nails it. I cannot find a fault with any of it, every line and scene fits and makes sense.As a very adult movie, it will require you to pay attention and listen to what is being said; cannot skip or fast forward this one.

            "content": "Knowing very well how everyday life and mentality looks like in a remote small village in rough rural area I have to say this movie is spot on and closest to perfection as it can be. To create the atmosphere of the place, to make it alive with the language and the everyday life of Irish rural people a hundred years ago takes really a master work. You could see the slow life, what's important and how everyone details with it. Also the belief system was different and I loved everything about it. The scenery where every second is a postcard, a music score that is truly perfect and then the amazing but simple plot and the story. I can't really see how this movie missed rewards in Cannes and Venice if it was even running there in competition. I can't write a review here and not mention the most amazing movie duo today that should work much more together, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson. It's so good to see them together again and they truly came as a cherry at the top of this masterpiece. Hats down to all actors and lastly the director Martin McDonagh. You can see clearly that he can't miss and is making movies that only rare few are able to do on that level. He's the reason why the movies as an art form are still alive. This may not become a cult movie but for me it's not only the best movie of the year by far, but top 5 in last 10 years or more. Even though I'm not fr Ireland but knowing how this kind rural, tough and raw life looks like and how they made it authentic in the movie on so many levels the rating should be 8.8 or but for me it's a 10.Now a spoiler part of what I see the reason of brilliance of this movie. People don't get why they stopped being friends and why on Earth on of them would go so far and cut his fingers just to make a point that he doesn't want to be friends anymore. So living a slow and routine copy paste days in a island village where nothing happens a hundred years ago simple things can stir up complications. So being seriously depressed to the point you only want to leave something behind that people will remember is not easy at all. Especially if you have that but of an art flick in you. And to leave a memorable thing means you have to go extreme in an environment that knows only boring routine. So to cut ties because you overgrew someone who's only in the way of your only life goal but you meet all the time and can't avoid on a daily basis makes you go desperate in your depression. All that just to make the simplest things respected. In this case that ment cutting you own fingers so your best frend comes to understand that even if you didn't have any disputes you don't want to be friends anymore at all. If your friend disrespects your decision and your efforts that repeatedly drain your anyway low energy, you're walking that line of going completely mad and the only thing keeping you away from it is being alone, which you can't have. On the other hand the good-hearted friend suddenly lost a friend who was his world, because of what he is and he simply can't accept that he's the main reason for being friends and for stopping being friends. It's contradictory for his mindset so he tried to make sense and pursuing the contact hoping it's all a bad dream or a small, passable thing. Brilliant and even though simple in context many people can't get a hang of it why. The Banshee, Irish myth of a lady spirit that comes to someone's home and signals the death that's coming is the old lady in the movie. Did she cause the change of behavior or just a tough and depressing life that craves desperate for a gossip or that only local pub meetings can ease up leaves open doors to conclusions. Brilliant.",

            "content": "The Banshees of Inisherin is an allegorical tale of friendship and feud between two intellectually different individuals. Set in the backdrop of the Irish Civil War, the story, even though told in a simple manner, reflects the underneath tension of the concurrent political imbroglio of Ireland. In his latest offering, director Martin McDonagh continues his predilection for his favorite stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, the first of whom maintains his superb form from the earlier outing of the trio 'In Bruges'. Even though it is being lauded critically across the globe for its metaphorical approach of storytelling, 'The Banshees...' somehow failed to impress me with anything new apart from Farrell's brilliant portrayal as the na\u00efve and unimaginative Padraic and soothing scenery of an imaginary Irish island called Inisherin. However, this is absolutely my personal opinion and many may rate this as a masterpiece. Life is all about personal choices when it comes to art or entertainment, isn't it?The narration is slow paced and follows a definite pattern of the Irish plays. There is simplicity all around. There are lonely people. There are petty talks. There is naivety and there are aspirations to be immortal through one's own creation. One of the friends - Padraic is unambitious, dull , unimaginative yet possesses a good heart whereas his friend turned foe for apparently no solid reason Colm represents the higher, more talented, more ambitious echelon of the society. There is an eerie and obnoxious presence of Mrs. McCormick who foretells about imminent deaths. She represents the banshees of the title. There is Padraic's sister Siobhan who chooses her own independent path amidst the feud and bitterness all around. Everything and everyone portrayed represents one thing or the other of a civil war. Destruction for apparently no reason. Middlemen profiting from the destruction. People suffering and losing their loved ones. And there are people migrating for peace.The cinematography is exceptional and it is one of the strongest points of the movie. The serene landscapes of the imaginary island called Inisherin mesmerize us throughout the duration of the movie. Farrell' acting is topnotch and he is definitely a strong contender along with Brendan Fraser to win the Academy Award for the Best Actor of the Year. Kerry Condon as the caring sister of Padraic is scintillating and her screen presence is one of the factors keep you glued to the screen. However, there is nothing special other than the points I mentioned and the acting of the rest of the cast including Brendan Gleesan seemed prosaic, insipid and lacks vigour. Storyline as I mentioned already is simple and even though it is metaphorical to the civil war, at times it is difficult to digest a thing or the other. Colm's hyperbolic behaviour at times was irritating and monotonous. Even though it has already bagged 9 Oscar nominations and definitely is poised to score big in the Academy Awards, it may not go down the history as something immortal like the tune Colm was creating in the movie. It's a good movie with some very high points but offers nothing new to be a pathbreaker. On any given day, I would rather prefer to watch Martin's previous work 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri 'My rating 7 out of 10.",

The sadness of P\u00e1draic who is unable to comprehend the actions of his best friend. For a low budget movie, this truly deserves to be up there with the greats.

As he tries to rebuild their relationship, P\u00e1draic is faced with shocking consequences for both of them.Having this on my watchlist, Though i don't know what to expect to see going into this movie. But i am pleased after the movie ends. You'll be laughing and shattered at the same time because The Banshees of Inisherin dive into the meaning of life, friendship, the emptiness of solitude, and loneliness of oneself. Colm simply doesn't hate P\u00e1draic, he does what he did just because he feels that his time is running out and chatting with P\u00e1draic is a waste of time. He rather fills his time building a legacy for himself, composing a piece of music. It's not a movie for everyone, some might be bored with the constant slow pacing.Martin McDonagh manages to perfectly blends sadness and comedy in an excellent script.

Sadly, not really the case here. While the acting is solid and the cinematography is lovely, this deeply depressing tale of the end of a friendship misses the mark as a \"black comedy.\". The main characters are tragically sad for very different reasons, and the lengths they go to inflict pain on each other are brutally needless.There are lessons here for sure, but I'm not certain they survive the disturbing plot. Padraig IS dull and needy, but a kindhearted twit who means no harm. Colm is a depressed artiste whose attempts to suddenly and dramatically sever ties with his old friend lead to unnecessary emotional and physical torment for both and for those around them. It becomes just a sad story of aging and loneliness in a beautiful setting with a miserable present and a bleak future. While I appreciate the work that went into this film, the ending was unsatisfying at best, and the entertainment value was minimal. I feel sorry for every miserable character here... except for Siobhan, who was lucky enough to get out before it all ends.",

For two-thirds of it you're chuckling almost like it's Father Ted, then suddenly it takes a dark turn and the last half hour is like a horror show. The civil war makes a good backdrop to a friendship on the rocks but it never directly impinges. A few forgiveable cliches, or maybe they're just tropes (e.g. A sibyl straight out of Macbeth). Fabulous to look at, tours de force from Gleeson and Farrell, as well as a meditation on the meaning of friendship and the purpose of our existence.",

            "content": "Firstly, I am a massive fan of Martin McDonagh's films, as well as the even more Irish films of his brother John. I was very excited about the re-casting of Gleeson and Farrell for this one as their chemistry in In Bruges is undeniable, and plenty of that is still here - there was a genuine sense of these two blokes having spent the larger part of their lives together on this agrarian island. The idea of this lifelong friendship coming to a holt for seemingly no reason at all seemed a bit unjustified but I felt it feasible more in a relationship sense where you all of a sudden realise you can't stand your partner at all...\nAs the resulting stalemate unfolds into self-mutilation, loved ones dying and homes destroyed I was expecting / hoping for things to really spiral out into some wild antics (perhaps like the unhinged relationship in Lighthouse) but instead it sort of just simmered away at a steady pace. I think the commentary on male stubbornness, the lack of enterprise and inspiration in rural settings and the female voice of reason that is forever ignored were decent enough traits for exploration, and perhaps the civil war allegories were lost on me a bit - I watched with my Irish friend who came out of the cinema feeling a 9+. Acting and cinematography are incredible and really carry this piece.",

In Ireland, especially Achill Island, one can still find oneself, entering homes, pubs and environments, such as those portrayed in the film.The performances were so good, you really believed in P\u00e1draic, Colm, Siobh\u00e1n and Dominic and got immersed in their world.It was a combination of funny, whimsical, sad and mystical.P\u00e1draic's confusion, when his best friend, Colm, will not speak to him anymore, is wonderfully played out. Siobh\u00e1n's frustration with the pettiness and grinding loneliness of the island is palpable. Colm's mindset was a bit of a mystery to me, but his actions are the pivotal force in the story.The wonderful portrayal of Dominic by Barry Keoghan was a joy to watch. So subtle and understated. Dominic; dim-witted or savant?.He certainly had some of the best lines and the poignancy of his circumstances filtered out over the course of the film; one simply fell in love with him.A film to be savoured.",

At first I wasn't sure where the story was headed. It's a simple, grounded, and very very human story that doesn't try hard to make you stop and think, although I felt it was quite existential. Everyone played their parts perfectly, with true abysmal Irish cadence and gossip. I didn't expect as much humor in it, but it really made for a very special experience, especially when the movie starts to, how should I say, go in its own direction. I'm definitely going to be thinking about story elements of this movie for a long time. I would like to see Brandon Gleeson winning an Oscar for this. It really is a memorable performance, to say the least. I recommend it if you like a good old fashioned film with lots of undertones.

The pacing and editing I am still not sure about, it was ok. Where it shined was in the individual scenes. The actors were so good. At the end it was hard to decide who carried the movie.

This complexity is put on the screen with vivid cinematography and expressive and eloquent acting in The Banshees of Inisherin by director Martin McdonaughSet against the usual precedent of fast paced films that dominate the modern cinema landscape, The Banshees of Inisherin is laid back and a calming viewing experience. Sit back and enjoy the delightful Irish landscapes and a pastural lifestyle accompanied with a pint and melodious violin. It's a shame that this had a limited theatrical run and only in select theatres cause oh what I would give to be able to experience this on the big screen.Colin Farrell is the star of the show. He shines in every scene he is in and his splendid expressions are the driving force of the storyline. I would be surprised if he didn't win Best Actor because if there was ever a performance you could look at and say \"That deserves an Oscar\", it would be this. Apart from him, everyone does a near perfect job with other amazing performances include those of Barry Keoghan and Kerry Cordon.Another key aspect of this film is the metaphors and parallels that are sprinkled thoroughly throughout this immersive cinematography and photography. The themes revolve around that of Christianity and the Civil War (the period where it's set) After reading through some post film discussions, I'm tempted to see those metaphors for myself. This film is recommended for a second viewing as well.All in all, definite top 5 film of the year. Highly recommended.",

His latest piece, The Banshees of Inisherin, is a complex and layered work of art that makes you think and then makes you laugh. It is one of those pictures you can't stop thinking about long after you've seen them, you just keep liking it more by the day.The movie deals with a plethora of themes. Padraic (Colin Farrell) is a character study, and an excellent one at that. Through Colm (Brendan Gleeson), McDonagh makes us wonder about decisions we take in our lives and the way we choose to spend our time. He also explores relationships between friends and siblings. While coming to grips with Colm's decision, Padraic tries to find the answers with his sister Siobhan (Kerry Condon) who is the heart and soul of this story. And there's also Dominic (Barry Keoghan). I can't remember the last time I saw so many phenomenal performances in the same picture. Both the main and the supporting cast do outstanding jobs, and the writing and direction are spot on as well.The setting for the fictional Inisherin, while picturesque, is perfect for the overall heavy atmosphere as it gives additional credibility to the actions of the actors. It also makes for some beautiful camera shots.The film should speak to anyone who ever felt or feels lost, melancholic, to the ones who dreamt of leaving their small town to escape lethargy and apathy and doing something with their lives. I would recommend it to the people who like dark humor too. If you liked In Bruges, chances are you'll like this one.",

The events that do occur throughout are merely social ones, which is no surprise following the isolated setting adding more weight to characters choices and opinions.The moment in which intrigue begins is when Colm (Brendan Gleeson) ends his friendship with Padraic (Colin Farrell). The film follows Padraic who's core interest is behind wanting to understand this decision. As the film moves forward this becomes partly an open ended choice for the viewer. Whom decides who really was at fault. As you lean in to the themes however, you will discover that there is more to Colm's sudden turn in attitude. The themes explored and their ties to the narrative are very interesting and dealt with immaculately.Sadly, I believe the film misses out on character building prior to Colm's epitome. It is hard to imagine this character any other way than displayed in the film, which is described to be much different compared to his older self. That, as well as the damming tone of the film serve as imperfections. It is not the most enjoyable watch and its comedy is witty at times but lacks control over scenes. This is likely the intention as comes with the design of dark humour but i was expecting a comedy listed film to have brighter moments.

It's hard to be fun and deep separately, but The Banshees of Inisherin manages to be both at the same time under a rhythm that flows like the cleanest river, and that isn't afraid to slow down when's necessary to penetrate sufficiently into certain ideas.I believe that the uncertainty about the correct use of time is a problem that concerns all of humanity; there is no individual who escapes this elemental doubt. Wanting to make sense of our actions and trying to leave something behind; that our name has meant even a small amount, not even progress, but a simple contribution to the species, is something that directly contrasts with the simple fact of living. There are individuals more predisposed to the present, as well as others with more abstract inclinations who set their eyes on the future: P\u00e1draic, unintentionally, interferes with Colm's \"intellectual\" activity, and that dichotomy creates a gap in the friendship at least unilaterally.More than one will be able to recognize and see themselves denounced in this film: I separate certain people for the sake of a greater search, for an end that matters... or maybe I'm just being a petulant f assh*l*. The answer? That's the dilemma.PS: The performances are just outstanding; everyone, from its protagonists to the people with two seconds at the bar.

He believes the rest of his days should be spent playing music, or playing music with others. The conflict here is that Padraic is not able to comprehend the fact that Colm can just leave him like that. They were friends, and suddenly Colm just drops him. Honestly, if someone just dropped me like that I would also go a little bit wacko, you dont drop someone like that, and if you was friends for years????

Let me first of all talk about the setting. Some Irish island and wooow it so beautiful but like cinematography gives it the cream if you know what I mean. The use of wide shots - e.g. In the bar is used carefully in the sense that we can establish comfort when Colm plays for the other people at the bar but we can then see the contrast in Padraic, the despair in his facial expression is encapsulated PERFECTLY. Like, I dont know about you but I felt actual emotions watching this and if you didn't probably seek a therapist or something /s.Secondly, sound mixing SAY WHAT??? Lighting SAY WHAAAAAT?

Delving into the nuances of friendship and the unseen compromises and resentments that exist in most friendships was intriguing and a very difficult task but wrapping up the story in a satisfying manner proved too much for the writers. Barry Keoghan was quite exceptional and along with Farrell (whose sadness at losing his friend and being thought of as being dull was beautifully acted )deserve the accolades. Even with its glaring faults it's certainly worth watching.",

            "content": "A smart, poetic and taxing black tragicomedy from the often brilliant mind of Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), set on a sparsely populated fictional island off the west coast of Ireland in the year of 1923. The premise is a budding conflict between two former pals (Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson), backdropped against the Irish Civil War, which is seen raging on the mainland. McDonagh's usual quirky dialogue and small shifts in tone help create a playful atmosphere despite the material's inherent gloominess. You'll likely find yourself chuckle your way through this slowly wounding downward spiral. McDonagh touches upon timeless, universal aspects of humanity during this dissection of a friendship gone awry, but despite powerful themes and wonderful acting, the film retains an academic quality throughout which keeps everything at a certain distance. It's in its depiction of the bond between the people and their animals that The Banshees of Inishering is at its most poignant. And there is also a magnificent supporting performance by Barry Keoghan as the dim but highly acute village idiot.",

The true test of good acting is when you don't think of someone as acting but as the character they play in the film. This happens to me once in a while. \"Oh wait....he is acting, he is an actor.\" In the scene where Dominic gets rejected by Siobhan. The performance by Barry Keoghan is so good, so heartbreaking, He shows so many emotions with his facial expressions, his movements, those sad, searching eyes, the words, the look back as he walks away is crushing. For that scene alone you should never miss this movie. Also, Colin is spot on with his \"dim\" and \"dull\" character, since Colin is Irish, he has probably known people just like his character.It took me a while to figure who the why of this story. Why would Colm do such a thing, and what was his point? It was for selfish reasons. He wanted to be famous for something after he dies so once he finished his song, he wanted to make sure it became famous by making it his one and only composition and then attaching an unforgettable fact that he cut his fretting fingers off on finishing it.I recognized beautiful Keem Beach on Achill Island in West County Mayo, Ireland as the location of Colm's thatched home. I spent a beautiful sunny afternoon there about 10 years ago. Not many tourists make it out there, but it's worth the trip.",

It's never fun when friendships break up. I think most people actually just move on. This movie gave the friendship duo almost a \"fatal attraction\" vibe but there was nothing sexual about it.I will say that I knew two friends who went their separate ways. One friend owed the other money and refused to pay it back. What he did for the next six months to drive his friend crazy would be a movie on it's own.

An Irish west coast island in 1922 would have been poor and grubby. Some characters - the old crone and the nosey shopkeeper - were straight from central casting. The colour was pumped up to make the film look artificial. I didn't care about any of the characters, except perhaps for Dominic (Barry Keoghan) abused son of the brutal island policeman. I have to wonder about the judgment of professional critics who claimed to find this film 'hilarious' and 'shot through with humour'. Similarly I can't understand the high praise for the cinematography. Very disappointing.",

There he comes to know that Colm doesn't want to be friends with him anymore. Clueless P\u00e1draic didn't understand the reason behind such a massive step and tries to dissolve the situation by apologizing and talking to his dear friend. Contrary to his efforts, the more he tries to talk to Colm, the more the situation worsens, and that further leads to devastating events in both of their lives.The Banshees of Inisherin is an extremely beautiful film, both from a story as well as a scenic perspective. The screenplay is so smooth that one doesn't even realize the passing minutes of the runtime. The cinematography is brilliant. The wide-angle shots of captivating landscapes with cloudy sky and seashore give a soothing experience.McDonagh's direction is top class and he has masterfully created a mesmerizing world around us in this film. On one end, the story's simplicity gives a touch of authenticity to the film; on the other hand, the diligent character development & careful writing, make the characters more real than fictional. Every moment and conversation has been used efficiently to develop the story and take it further. Everything happening on the screen makes sense. Since McDonagh himself has written the film, he embraces the characters with the utmost care, and it's evident too, throughout the film when as a viewer we can relate to the characters and the situations. Even smaller role characters are written with interesting character arcs.When such a talented cast is onboard, you can expect top-notch performances. Colin Farrell once again gives an Oscar-worthy performance with an extremely powerful portrait of his character. You can literally feel his anguish and emotions. Brendan Gleeson is equally outstanding with his marvellous dialogue delivery and character portrayal. Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan are the scene stealers and make their characters memorable even with limited screen time.This comedy-drama, under the carpet, is actually more of a tragic tale. There are metaphors, but one doesn't need to dwell too deeply to understand them. They have been laid out in simpler ways here. There are plenty of scenes that would make you laugh, but at the same time, there are many that would make you sad. The film explores various underlying themes like loneliness, sadness, love, and friendship under the umbrella theme of human relationships.At the end of the day, I see The Banshees of Inisherin as a film that everyone would appreciate in one way or the other. It's smartly written, brilliantly directed, and passionately portrayed. It's a fascinating piece of cinema and every frame in it is simply admirable.Follow me: on Instagram: m_movie_reviews\nRating: 8.3/10.",

            "content": "If it were not a philosophical allegory on the nature of Man, The banshees would probably only have for him his photography and his acting. Fortunately, the film offers a fable, that of the conflict between Man in his natural state embodied by tradition (Padraic) and civilizational Man embodied by music (Colm).Rousseau could have seen his most fundamental reflections there: The amoral goodness and naivety embodied by Padraic the animal lover - who seeks only to reproduce the tradition day after day without worrying about the next day, by going to drink his beer at the pub with his friend - represents the good savage, the pre-civilizational man, the one who does not care to write and mark history. His friendship is shattered one day by this new Man, the Man so decried by Rousseau, the modern Man, the one of civilization, the one who wishes to leave a trace in history through \"the sciences and the arts\", by composing a piece for violin: Colm. For Colm time counts and is counted! No more \"hollow\" conversations with the naive Padraic. He wishes to leave a legacy to civilization unlike the good savage for whom time and history are irrelevant.But Padraic doesn't understand. For him, this desire to leave nature, tradition has no meaning. He wants to understand. But Calm wants to do something with his two hands, the tool that allowed Man to found civilization. By trying to understand this divorce, Padraic will cause Colm to cut off his fingers. And these are the same fingers that will kill Padraic's donkey. What meaning should be given to this scriptwriting choice that is a priori absurd and wacky? The fingers of Man allow him to found civilization and to leave the state of nature. By preventing Colm's will to rejoin civilization, Padraic takes away his tools to achieve it. And the fingers of modern man will end up killing what matters most to Padraic: his donkey, which represents both nature and naivety, simplicity.A bit of ecology in this fascinating fable: Padraic, the Man who embodies nature in all its simplicity will want to take revenge on Colm, the man of civilization, destroyer of the environment.In this confrontation between what Man may have been a long time ago (Man in the state of nature has probably never existed, it's a philosophical concept) and what he has become ( the one Rousseau calls \"Modern Man\"), death lurks in the distance, armed with his hooked stick (the scythe) and seated on Colm's rocking chair. She patiently waits to know which of the man in the state of nature or the man of civilization will prevail to know who she will mow down.",

Colm's abrupt decision to end his friendship with P\u00e1draic starts a series of events and creates upheaval in the otherwise ordinary lives of several of the islanders.

I wonder how many people back when this was set used to regularly house their animals inside the home with them. The music played back then was beautiful. The 5 main characters, the 2 blokes and their beloved animals and the long suffering sister, stole the show as did the \"young lad\" another main character whose life was one of horror too much for him to bare.

The extreme behaviors and events which follow are anything but friendly.If you haven't watched already , 'In Bruges' is another black comedy pairing the 2 gents for the first time and with the same director.

As far as Banshees goes, it is the acting of the 4 leads that really stood out to me, Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan, all 4 were terrific and I could see them pulling out an ensemble SAG win despite it being a smaller cast. I personally think The Fabelmans is still the Best Picture frontrunner, but I could see this picking up some individual wins for screenplay as well as possible supporting acting wins for Gleeson and Condon, maybe even a lead actor win for Farrell. The writing was just so well done in this film and I always found myself intrigued as to what would happen next.

Brendan Gleeson is amazing because of his continually calm demeanor and ability to humanize his character despite his severe decision.The film is brilliantly shot, perfectly reflecting the natural landscape. The excellent costume and set design brilliantly convey the period (1920s Ireland), drawing you into the entire act.Martin McDonagh has created an exceptional film in many respects, beginning with the brilliant theatrical writing and performances by all the main actors.

The acting was phenomenal on all levels. I think this was Farrell's best role to date. He was simply amazing in this film. I would have to say the same for Gleeson. What a duo!

            "content": "It blows my mind how few people know about Irish history, the occupation by the British for 800 years, their cruel oppression of Irish culture, the famine that killed a million people, and the ensuing struggles for self-determination.The Irish Civil War (early 1920s) provides the backdrop for this film, even though the conflict is disconnected from the mythical island Inisherin, off the coast of Galway. The islanders do not really know what the war is about, but they can hear bombs and what could be executions taking place on the distant mainland. I took the Banshees of Inisherin as a painful allegory of the Irish Civil War, when the nation cut its own nose off to spite its face. The story follows a refined man, Colm, who one day decides he does not want to be friends with Padraic, a sweet man who lives with his sister and loves his animals, because the latter is too dull. The film is almost Shakespearean, as it lurches from farce to heartbreak, as Colm's depression manifests as a desperate need to be left alone. The plot's underlying themes portray the boredom and frustration of island life, a man's yearning to leave something important behind, and the sadness of broken dreams. Banshees is quite a beautiful film, but bleak. I did not come out of the cinema feeling uplifted. However, it is McDonagh's most mature work and another of his odes to the Irish people. I feel some people will 'get' this film and other's will not, as evidenced by some of the scathing and inaccurate reviews here, which portray the film as empty, patently untrue. Maybe my knowledge of Irish history gives this film personal meaning. The cast is terrific, I have always thought of Colin Farrell as an astonishing actor who has made dodgy film choices. I hope he follows his gut instinct to be a character actor, and avoids more Hollywood blockbusters.To be honest I cannot see this film garnering a swag of Oscars (I hope I am wrong) because the Academy loves sentimentality too much.",

The ending left me thinking-a feat in itself-for days, possibly longer (it's nearly been a week, wish me luck).This film is masterful in how controlled it is. Like the people, the camera barely moves. This is a quiet, quaint town in 1920s Ireland, and the civil war in the background is just a blown up version of what's happening within the lens.The beautifully mundane setting has so much to do with character motivations.Why does monotony often conjure up animosity?What's the role of kindness in legacy?Watching these two characters work their way through such ideas is compelling fiction, and results in one of the years best films.",

For Padrick as long as Colm is alive the war wont be over but shall we take his word for it, does he not love his friend more than anything else or did he really change as sa person, gone over the ege and no longer can love Colm, even if Colm wants to love him, I doublt Padrick will be able to love him, so its a loss for the both sides JUST like the civil war.

The baseline plot is very basic and very easy to follow. But the little indirections the movie takes makes it so much fun to watch and truly gives you the experience of not knowing what is going to happen next\nPlot:1.75/2It is incredibly challenging to find an MVP in this movie because every acting performance is absolutely superb. Every character from the main character banter between Farrell and Gleason to the cheekiness of Condom and Keoghan; every character feels important and every character gets their chance to shine in the absolute best way possible\nActing:2/2As mentioned previously, the direction this film takes is so much fun even if there is some incredibly dark themes. However, what is so effective is the ability for Mcdonah to take these dark themes and still use the humor so incredibly effectively to convey that. There is never a moment of boring and you truly want to continue to take a ride with these people\nStorytelling:2/2The most creative thing about this film is how the characters do things that you don't expect them to do. You expect them to take a different approach to a situation and when it doesn't it can take you off guard and makes for a much more enjoyable story. It is a rollercoaster that you are riding blind which can be such a fun film to watch\nCreativity:1.75/2This movie is shot so well and it truly makes you feel like you are in a quaint town in Ireland. The casting was perfection and that along with the subtle camera angles and use of the beautiful landscape make for a amazing film for the eyes\nOther Factors:1.75/2Overall, this film was incredible.

McDonagh has established himself to be a master of a world builder. There is something about McDonagh's writing that will make you want to live and experience the world he created. With Banshees of Inisherin, it talks about death, comfort, parallelism, existential despair, and oblivion, and people are yet afraid to talk about these things, but it's inevitable. One day we realize that we don't have much time left and all we wanted is to make sure that we will be remembered, and Martin McDonagh has captured the beauty and sadness of all these things in a hilarious and melancholic way as possible. The film is shocking and poignant but also guaranteed to make you laugh out loud.When people ask why I love to watch movies, aside from escapism, movies will also help me to view the world we are in right now from a different perspective, and this is what 'The Banshees of Inisherin' made me feel. There is a lot of meaning when you dive deep into the movie, but even on the surface, \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" is a crowd-pleasing and underneath all the black comedy is a sense of deep sadness that these people will now have to share the small island without talking to each other and it is painful. It's pure isolation and the anxiety of platonic loss, as nothing is more painful than losing the people you once valued. The film is a reminder that people do change, and want something different. We should not invalidate how they want to live their life just because it's different from how we live ours. One wanted to live the moment and be nice, while one wanted to make his life remembered, and both of these reasons are valid---you just have to respect their choices.Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Kerry Condon combine for a sublime look at isolation and friendship and deliver something special. However, Barry Keoghan was fantastic. He was hilarious and charming, and yet you feel sad for him. The performances are just sincere and feel authentic which made the humor hit the nail without being forced. It was hard to take your eyes off the screen because of their performances which is a testament to their talent and the quality of the script. Just when you thought you knew where the film was going, it went in a very over-the-top, unexpected twist. My only concern with the movie is the ending, I just wished it did not end that way, I was asking for closure.The Banshees of Inisherin is a bleak and melancholy work that also manages to find many ways to emphasize the beauty of the location and individuals, but it's also a story about despair, relationship, and pain. Friend against friend, brother against brother, family against family, love lost, and grudges; all are in this little fable. This film will have a special place in my heart, and I will continue to remember this.",

            "content": "The Banshees of Inisherin wonderfully reunites the trio of McDonagh, Gleeson and Farrell, for a film that's not only deeply funny, deeply sad and disturbing, but most importantly one that knows its audience. By the latter specifically I mean that for those who enjoyed In Bruges (2008) - and I refer to myself in this generalisation - you feel for Farrell's character as you along with him are caught off guard and share in his despair at the loss of his friendship because we've seen the chemistry that both leads have, how - ultimately - they work as friends. It's a cleverly constructed film in that sense (one that I feel I can say wouldn't be effective without Gleeson and Farrell), you laugh when you're supposed to laugh and you feel when you're supposed to feel.The dialogue is beautiful and instantly quotable, the setting is idyllic in how beautifully shot it is, the costuming - especially Gleeson's worn out spaghetti western-esque lawman getup is a delight to watch him strut around in - with each piece suiting each character aptly, the musical score which acts as a bitter sweet death nell that things aren't going to be fine is the cherry on top. And while admittedly the symbolism and foreshadowing isn't always perfect, this is a film that stands on its cast, acting and dialogue and the three easily compensate for the films flaws as they make this picture stand on its own.While Gleeson and Farrell unsurprisingly steal the show, the supporting cast cannot be understated. The quippy barman, the dodgy copper and the busy body old biddies perfectly construct a believable Irish locale - even if the location shooting wasn't a factor - the setting is believable and it really helps with the doom and gloom that essentially every member of the island feels - whether they choose to acknowledge it or not. The best of the supporting cast is by far Barry Keoghan - having only briefly been introduced to this young actor through his agonisingly short portrayal of the Joker in Matt Reeves's The Batman earlier this year I was delighted to finally see him act and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. His character is the most endearing aspect of the film, the hopelessness that all residents feel is exemplified in his character despite his efforts to drown it out with Poit\u00edn and the hopes for love. Dominic is by far the most upbeat character you'll find on Inisherin yet is arguably also the saddest; despite the main plot line I found myself feeling for him the most, the issues he faces are bigger than the petty squabbles of P\u00e1draic and Colm, and significantly, one that has the biggest consequence: a death foreshadowed by the island's lone banshee Mrs. McCormick. There is something to be said for real problems being overlooked selfishly by everyone around you - since your own problems however big or small are always more important to you personally. Everyone on the island is a victim of circumstance but none more so than the film's tragedy case. You just want to reach through the screen and give him a hug, or keep him as a pet. But I'm willing to bet the latter may be just me.The main plot does feel like a joke that goes too far between two very bored friends who can't get past the mundanity of their lives - one more so than the other of course. There is a danger to deviating from the comfort of your life and spicing things up. Who's really in the wrong out of P\u00e1draic and Colm? For me it was hard to tell. Even after lost fingers, dead donkeys, and burnt down houses, when the two part on the beach and Colm thanks P\u00e1draic for looking after his dog, there's the unmistakable hint of a smile on his face and the feeling for the viewer that everything might just go back to normal tomorrow.The kicker is we never find out what the resolution of this sick joke is. In that sense the joke is on us. Would we be surprised if they became friends again after this? I don't think so. Where do you go from here if you remain enemies? Only those two nutters would know. But either option is fun and enticing, but ultimately, the answer is as nihilistically delightful as the film: it doesn't matter. Nothing really does.I enjoyed every second of this film and wish I had been able to come around to it sooner. I feel right now that this'll be the last film released in 2022 that I'll really enjoy and I'm more than okay with that. If this is the last time this trio get together then what a film to go out on. I can happily say in future I'll be making significantly more visits to Inisherin than Bruges.",

It's what you'd expect from an Irish comedy film. Set on the island of Inisherin, it has that British-isle sense of open fields and rocky shores, which are all beautiful on film. You become accustomed to all of around five buildings the film takes place within, giving a sense of closeness with the small cast onscreen. They often had me wondering how bloody cold it must have been to live by the shore in the 1920s.Brendan Gleeson does a great job of flipping from his usual mild-mannered and solemn self, to extremes that are intentionally baffling and jarring. Colin Farrell is his ideal foil and driving point of the movie, and is consistantly asking questions and sparking trouble despite knowing better (or maybe from lack thereof). From each of their interactions you wait in anticipation of what will happen. Farrell is consistently itching for answers, and of Gleeson you wait on every word. The movie is ultimately about them, and about friendship between two weirdos.There are other personalities on the island that stick their noses perhaps where they don't belong, but they are under utilised - or atleast, the human characters are. The farm animals are like silent, sympathetic onlookers, relatable on the island to only the audience.The comedy is there, but it is even-tempered and peculiar - worlds away from the bombastic insanity of McDonagh's Seven Psychopaths. The movie is most akin to In Brughes, mostly for the modest, unique setting and the two main characters, but also the strange, intriguing commentary the storyline puts forward. Should you leave your best friend if they are impeding your life's dreams? Is a man valued at what the future remembers him for, or by the ones who love him in his lifetime?Whilst these questions are prominently asked, average viewers will dislike the lack of conclusion from the story. There are no answers here, only incessant pondering and perplexity. This might not be bothersome to fans of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, but no scene here is anywhere near as tense. There are no action scenes against a loud and tragic soundtrack, although there is atleast one scene of police brutality, which McDonagh seems to be a fan of.Worth the watch and the odd giggle throughout, but ultimately it felt just short of fulfilling. I think I'll rewatch one of McDonagh's others to satsiate my want for more.",

I am in love with Colin Farrell's style in all his roles, and I believe that he will compete strongly through this movie for the Oscar.Something I did not like about the movie is some boredom at the beginning. Also, when watching, you feel that there is something missing in this show. I do not know what it is. You feel as if there are few tools to make a movie. It could be, for example, in the number of characters.But I also think that the small number of characters expresses the loneliness of the gloomy island.",

            "content": "McDonagh is back with his Bruge pals and his unique aesthetic.A movie about the 'break up' of two longtime friends,after a drastic and sudden decision of one. Brendan Gleeson(Colm) is impressive and as always at his best with his great performance and perfect chemsitry with Farrell(P\u00e1draic) as the spark of the movie's fuse ,as impressive are Condon(Siobh\u00e1n), one of the greatest controlled supporting preformances I've seen, as the sister of P\u00e1draic and the big fish in the small pond of the incredibly beautiful fictional Isle of Inisherin and Keoghan(Dominic) delivering a intricate and brilliant performance as the town fool and abused son of the town's guard ,but most of the credit must go to Collin Farell's P\u00e1draic. Farrell's performance and particularly his facial expressions letting us slightly into his exact silent contemplation in those moments regarding his situation is at times mesmerizing. There's a lot of McDonagh's witty, excellently crafted dialogue holding and guiding us through this tale, but the contradiction of the beautifuly shot backround of this picturesque Irish island and it's simple and lonely everyday lifestyle paired with the humourous dialogue balancing each other out is an uncomfortable joy to behold.",

            "review_title": "A small film about how we hurt each other",
            "content": "And probably the greatest movie about depression, real depression, ever made. I don't use the term \"real depression\" to minimise anyone's experiences, rather to point out the fact that depression in movies is so often drinking too much, getting behind the wheel and screaming, fighting with your loved ones and screaming or drunkenly fighting a stranger (and screaming).Depression looks like a dramatic argument between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in these films, in an LA mansion, reaching its climax as J-Law wades into the mansion's swimming pool with a Lana Del Rey song playing, a far-away look in her eye, and still wearing her $20,000 ballgown. These are the tropes we recognise for mental health issues when used to move a plot forward but, on a human level, what does this kind of stuff really communicate to anyone beyond \"sadness is temporary but here comes the happy ending\"? And, be honest with your own experiences here, is any of that even true? Really, if you ask me, it reduces our ability to cope with the real, boring, day-to-day grind of sadness that can hang about like a bad, wet fart. It hurts to be in this place, and more for seeing that, in fact, the glamour and drama of these situations which we thought we'd recognise, we actually don't. The sad places we go alone are completely unfamiliar, unstructured and totally alienating. For us non-movie characters it's just ugly, dirty, unsanitary pain sometimes with no climax, apex or resolution and, if you're incredibly unlucky, no end. When was the last time you were rescued by a wise, benevolent old person of infinite wisdom who delivered in a few punchy sentences the exact re-evaluation you needed to bring your life forward? Not many times, I'd warrant, if ever. Perhaps it's because you're not sexy, or rich enough. Perhaps it's because you're dull.This is what I read into 'The Banshees of Inisherin'. In lieu of this wise old friend who aids you are more people who hurt you and in different ways. And what's more, these same people are people you might hurt, both of you without even realising it most of the time. Sometimes when we really need help it's not unusual at all to realise that we are fighting this fight completely alone, even if we are not alone in our lives. There may be people around you with their own problems who can't afford the time to spend with yours, or people with their own experiences and pains who do not understand yours at all. There may even be people who share your experiences and are hurting just like you, but are in too much pain to avoid hurting you and others around them.This is Martin McDonagh's great tragedy of the human condition with 'Banshees', when there's a world full of people who are spoiling to hurt others on purpose, we all sometimes end up in the same place as them, no matter how good we may try to be. Pain, however, is ubiquitous and unites us all.To quote the film: \"From some things there's no moving on, and I think that's a good thing.\"",

The story is about 2 friends Padraic and Colm. Colm decides one day he doesn't want to be friends with Padraic again. And what follows is funny,sad and just mesmerizing. You are transported back to 1920s Ireland. And you can feel the frustrations of small Island life. Apart from Barry Keoghan,the other scene stealer was Jenny the donkey.

OK so the old man is plain tired of the younger one. But then he cuts off his fingers? It's just strange and somehow stupid. It makes no sense.

All I can say is that its an excellently-shot, well-written and brilliantly-acted film.The dialogue in this film is excellent. The film brilliantly strikes a balance between comedic and serious. Conversations between characters are always insightful and the comedy is used to great effect to make the audience care about the characters. The leading performances by Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell are top-tier. Absolutely excellent. Farrell truly shines in this film, injecting his character with subtle emotion and charisma and he excellently illustrates his character's mental decline. Barry Keoghan was also a standout, mainly serving as a more cheery, upbeat character with a dark background of abuse.This film is quite bleak and depressing. While the film is incredibly colourful and wonderfully shot, the story only gets more depressing as it goes on. This is elevated by the score which really emphasises the importance of less is more. By the end of the film, the viewer is left with nothing which works for and against the film since you're left with a feeling of wasted time. Yet this is the situation the characters find themselves in and it is up to the audience's interpretation about what the film is trying to say.Overall, The Banshees of Inisherin is not going to make you feel good by the end but it is going to give you a lot to think about. The acting, writing, directing and score are all excellent. This film will either profoundly affect you or disappoint you but you cannot deny where it succeeds with flying colours.",

A south Londoner (like the great Martin McDonagh) might use that expression, but in Ireland.....\"He doesn't like you ANYmore\" - now we're talkin'.\"Maybe he's just depressed\". Depression is not something you'd hear much about in the rural Ireland of 2022, let alone 1922!

I make this sound all tragic, but this same bare dialogue made me laugh out loud at their clever comebacks.

It does not move like a bat out of hell ; it is leisurely paced, but it never feels slow.Gleason has a terrific speech about the ways people are remembered years after they're gone, but this is topped by Farrell's simple, beautiful response. Gorgeous writing. Wonderful acting. Simply, put a stellar film.",

The acting was top class from Brendan Colin and Barry but the plot ended leaving a empty void and personally I feel a film should tell a story not 3/4 of a story . But the cinematography was *chefs kiss* and that's probably a factor in many critics ratings.If your looking for a humble civilians rating it's worth a watch for movie lovers but anyone looking for a riveting viewing should look elsewhere.

The loneliness felt by many characters is palpable and the tension between the two protagonists, which starts as confusion and evolves into spite, builds with every passing encounter. In addition, the cinematography is beautifully captured, the writing is excellent, and the supporting cast, (Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan especially) do as well a job as the masterclass leads. And like many friendships, the film begins with a bright rainbow and ends with a dark raincloud; whether that's to show the cycle of nature or the dreary transpiring of events is up to the audience to decide.

This completely unfolds Padraic's small world and he is desperately trying to rebuild the friendship, but fails to understand Colm's reasons.Colm, on the other hand, is intelligent and reserved. He obviously understands that his friend is affected by what happens, but decides to proceed with his (likely futile) ambition to be remembered with works of music. At first he tries to completely ignore Padraic, hoping the latter will simply distance himself too; when that doesn't happen, he resorts to far more drastic measures, which ultimately prove both useless and devastating to his musical aspirations.When things escalate as much as they did within the story, a sensible outcome would have been to have a conclusion - reconciliation, violent/peaceful ending or whatever. Instead, we're left hanging with the assumption that this will continue. But to what end? The characters were excellent and the viewer could sympathise with both; the lack of closure simply ruined the rest of the story for me, leaving their actions up to that point ambiguous, and the story futile.",

But it's so much more than that. Martin McDonagh is one of the best writers of his generation (or any generation); he's able to take what could've been just a silly throwaway story and turn it into something truly magical. His ability to craft language that can be both hilarious and heartbreaking is unparalleled.Combining McDonagh's brilliant writing with two great actors - Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell - is a winning combination, which we've seen before with In Bruges. In Bruges may be slightly funnier, but this is a rich film with depth and character. This movie should win every award.But - I'm not sure I can recommend it. It's brilliant, yes; but it's also truly sad and depressing in a way that very few films are (and for good reason). Someone else put it something like this: McDonagh's previous film had cancer, rape, murder, suicide, police brutality, and racism, and that was a Hallmark movie compared to Banshees.I'd only suggest watching it if you're up for a good laugh and a good cry.

They predict there will be one or two deaths on the island and the movie becomes a waiting game of who will it be? Brendan Gleason's character is struggling with a despair so profound he abandons his best friend (Colin Farrell) and is willing to sacrifice (by way of self-mutilation) the one thing that brings him joy - making music. He has a song inside him, a mournful dirge, that must come out, and he can't afford any distractions. As hard as he tries to find comfort and support from classic Irish institutions: the pub and the church, no one can help him. Even his stubborn, kindly, best friend who just won't take no for an answer, drives him to desperate acts.Then there are 2 supporting characters, one who escapes the tragedy unfolding before them and another who doesn't. Are we surprised by the outcome? Not really. Once the Banshee's prediction comes true the spell is broken.So what works? What doesn't work? We all wanted to see that great chemistry Farrell and Gleason had in \"In Bruges\" but instead we see a friendship dismantled before we believe it exists. Does the director take advantage of the audience's expectation that these two are, in fact, friends, and therefore believe how hurt one would be if that friendship ended? Gleason is so miserable throughout the film it's hard to feel a connection.Farrell's true friends, the animals, are there for him. That we believe. It's a shame it's played for laughs and that when he needs them most he stops communicating with them. The rest of the world is the opposite. When humans let us down we turn to our critters.A real let down: The song causing everyone grief, isn't memorable and not particularly original.The Banshees, dotting the island like pale Mother Theresa's, don't fit. They're not real enough or other-worldly enough to make sense.Lastly, I hate to be picky, but donkeys don't choke on a bit of food in their mouth. It gets stuck way down their esophagus which is separate from their trachea. Would a donkey even be tempted to eat a finger? Even if he bit it off? No, highly unlikely. Wouldn't be an issue if so much wasn't riding on this incident. And even a mini donkey weighs a few hundred pounds and Farrell moves it around like a teddy bear.The film doesn't resolve in a satisfying way and doesn't encourage a rewatch like \"In Bruges\". One viewing is more than enough.",

There's so many societal factors that feature heavily in this, a lot of them we still perpetuate even though they cause us and the ones close to us harm. The heartbreaking and gradual realisation that Farrell's character simply cared more about not being liked or wanted by his long term friend than by what his friend needed to be happy hit home. The care Gleesons character still had for him was evident by defending him against the Garda of the island, but by that point it was too late for Farrell's character to recognise that his friend did care for him, he just didn't want him in his life any longer. The sisters heartbreaking loneliness, desire to be liked and accepted by her community and her tremendously brave decision to leave to carve her own life rather than stay in a familiar place hit very close to home. I'm not the most articulate, and feel so especially in tying to describe what makes this film so special. I can only commiserate for those who view it as a dark comedy and little else.",

To kick it off the scenery is beautiful. It really shows you the beauty of Ireland. Everything is filmed incredibly well and it feels like you're one of the locals in the village.Two friends have an impasse when one decides to end their relationship.That is it. Thats it! But it works so well and Martin Mcdougnah is incredibly skilled to have been able to adapt such a simple sentence into an amazing spectacle. I have to say I enjoyed watching every minute of this film.Colin Farrell plays the sweet Padric who is the nicest guy in the village. Every minute he is on screen your behind him all the way. He is really funny as well even though he is intending not to be. I really do think this is Colins best performance and he really does shine.Brendan Gleeson plays the depressed Colm (maybe a bit psychopathic ) who abrubtly ends his friendship with Colin because he simply doesn't like him. I have to admit they both act like children but it works so well. Brendan is amazing as always and shows perfectly is characters emotion.The story is incredible and deeply moving. It's a large bowl of humor and wit chucked into a pot of emotion and judgement and then served with a glass full of tragedy. I think Colin Farrell deserves every award he gets. Same with Brendan.Directors and writers alike should learn from The Banshees of Insherin that you don't need giant spectacles or big plot twists to make a good film.You just need Colin Farrell:)",

            "content": "There are no banshees in Inisherin, says one of the principal characters. But then as a viewer you do feel there is one metaphorically howling silently in the air of this dark comedy, portending dread and death. If you're looking for another In Bruges or Three Billboards from the talented Martin McDonagh you are in for a darker surprise.The story is set on an idyllic island in Ireland during their civil war time (1920's) but the populace is seemingly unaffected by it except for a sporadic reference in the local pub or when a bomb goes off on the mainland.The story is of two long time friends that sets off when the older of the two, Colm (Brendan Gleeson) abruptly announces to the other Padraic (Colin Farrell) that he longer wishes to speak with him and any attempts to do so by Padraic will be met by some dire, irreparable actions on Colm's part. Padraic being nice and all, doesn't believe his buddy so tries to play the threat down while brooding over why Colm decided to be so. At one point in the narrative he realises it is no longer a bluff but Colm is serious about what he said. In the midst of these bizarre developments we have townspeople who are equally baffled including Padraic's sister Siobhan (Kerry Condon), Dominic (Barry Keoghan) who try their best to adapt to the situation, while dealing with their own personal issues.The explanation when demanded given by Colm to Padraic isn't very plausible so he continues the pursuit of making the relationship work and the emanating actions thereafter become even more darker. The genuine efforts put forward by Padraic to mend the situation are only met with Colm \"truly\" honouring his dire promises to his and everyone's aghastness.The behaviour of the lead characters definitely requires some 21st century psychiatric treatment but this being set in 1920's on a remote island amidst conflict doesn't allow a psych intervention, but one of the lead characters in an exasperated state does call the actions taken by the other qualifies to be called mental. Without giving too much away the story veers onto unexpected (and sometimes inexplicable) roads with some tragic developments. Gleeson and Farrell are brilliant as usual, getting into the skin of their characters and are brilliantly supported by Condon and Keoghan.The climax though, can be unfulfilling if one is expecting a neat tie-off of the events that have unfolded during the course of the narration.",

In a mix of depression and nihilism, we see the desperation of one side wanting at all costs to get away, focusing on marking its name in history, while the other tries to enjoy every minute of its day, in the most banal and everyday way.Reflections of their animals, the Donkey and the Dog, victims and partners of this petty human conflict, full of pride, ego and ignorance, while a small town living on a coastal island, shouts together without ever listening to what their fellow human beings are saying on their side. If only the animal-like silence were used for reflection, it would exist for even a minute...",

            "content": "I was so excited when I began watching this. Tremendous cast. Brendan Gleeson, Colin Farrell. Kerry Condon. And then the setting. A remote island off of the mainland of Ireland. This movie drips with Irishness. And then the story begins. Colm (Gleeson) and P\u00e1draic (Farrell) are longtime friends when suddenly Colm decides he wants no part of his friend. He does not give much reason other than he is old and hopes to make some lasting musical legacy with his remaining years. He feels spending time with the kind but dim witted P\u00e1draic will only slow him. P\u00e1draic of course does not like this at all and refuses to honor his friend's request to stop speaking to him (even though are in the same pub together every day). Eventually Colm ups the stakes and says he will cut off his own fingers if P\u00e1draic won't leave him alone. All in all this makes for a somewhat dreary film. It is taking place during the Irish Civil War of 1923. This Civil War was over the acceptance of the treaty of independence with England. Clearly the relationship between Colm and P\u00e1draic, where they are destroying each other and themselves, serves as an allegory for the Irish Civil War. I would just greatly prefer a story based on some kind of realistic relationships rather than a metaphor. The incredible cast, setting and genuine window into the Irish culture probably still make it worth watching.",

            "content": "The Banshees of Inisherin stars Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan, and is directed by Martin McDonagh\nSet during the Irish Civil War in 1923 on a remote island in Ireland, it's the story of two long time friends, wherein one of them, Colm, played by Brendan Gleeson, decides he's not interested in being friends with the other, Padraic, played by Colin Farrell. On such a remote community, gossip spreads like wildfire, and the island residents all deal with this falling out between two men differently. It affects Padraic's sister, played by Kerry Condon, the town \"fool\", Dominic, played by Barry Keoghan, his abusive cop father, played by Gary Lydon, a mysterious old woman, Mrs McCormick, played by Sheila Flitton, and more throughout the town.This is a movie that upon reviewing it, you want to talk about what happens, and really go into it video essay-style, where you might spoil it, assuming your viewership has already seen the film. But I also want to talk about the themes and feelings it gives you without literalising it, and try and get down to why it's so good, and so heartbreaking, even though all of its central characters are as simple as can be, their lifestyles uneventful, their generation and background vastly different from mine, their environment sleepy and quiet (minus the distant bombing going on as part of the Irish Civil War, which is parallel in a way with what's happening between Colm and Padraic).It's almost like a macabre Irish folk tale, or fairytale even, that could be passed down and shown to different generations to come as an example of the dark side of friendship. The odd thing is however, it came out in 2022, rather than hundreds or even thousands of years ago. Yet it's an entirely original film, not based on a previous text, or classical piece of literature. It also feels modern and relevant, because close friendship is something we can all relate to and understand. Maybe it's McDonagh's background as a playwright, and writing theatre that this film has that classical tale vibe to it.You could almost decipher this movie as an exploration on a cycle of revenge. Once one act of the macabre is committed against another, is it possible to ever go back to the status quo? From that point on, is it an endless cycle of retaliation? Acts of revenge committed against acts of revenge.This film is bitingly hilarious, often due to the chemistry between Farrell and Gleeson, established wonderfully in In Bruges. Overall this could be better reviewed by really spoiling it and going through events, details and character motivations thoroughly, and I've chosen not to do that in this review, as it's one where I think the best way to watch it is to know as absolutely little as possible. Which puts me in a tricky position really. But go see The Banshees of Inisherin, it's a hilarious dark comedy, it's macabre, it tackles themes of loneliness, isolation, even self-mutilation, in an emotionally brutal way. So trigger warning for all of those things. It will rip your heart out, but it's an amazing piece of \"feel bad cinema\".",

            "content": "First off the movie is beautiful to watch, great photography and beautiful settings. The acting is suburb. Story wise its kind of a head scratcher.Two long time friends have a falling out. Evidently one now finds the other dull and simply wants nothing to do with him. I found this a bit strange, and never really explained to any level of satisfaction, but he wants nothing to do with his former friend. So the friend can not accept this and continues to approach him, which evidently inspired the former friend to threaten him with cutting of his own finger every time he comes to him. Once again this is a tad peculiar, but the friend ignores this and keep coming and the other friend starts cutting off fingers to spite him. I think the only place this sort of behavior exists is in a mental hospital, but went along with it in hopes that it would lead to a dramatic and satisfying conclusion. Sadly this movie lumbers along, a few other quirky characters show up and do quirky things, and ultimately the 'nice' friend--the one who refuses to leave the finger chopper alone--learns that his beloved donkey died while eating one of the finger choppers cut off fingers. Just a FYI donkeys are herbavors and don't eat meat so this wouldn't have happened, but again ignoring this also now the nice guy friend is determined to kill his former friend for getting his donkey killed so he tries to burn down finger choppers house. All that this leads to is a house burned down and the now feuding friends to evidently continue their feud. The ending is pretty abrupt, no dramatic conclusion to conflict, just more of a \"no country for old men\" weird ending where nothing is resolved and I realized I just spend some two hours waiting for a conclusion to a movie and finding nothing. Very unsatisfying. So acting is wonderful, Colin Farrell and Brandon Gleeson are great, scenery is beautiful, but actual story wasn't worth their efforts.",

I didn't agree with most of the protagonist's choices, I think that he completely disregarded his friend's wishes even after he cut his own fingers off to show him how serious he is about the matter; the protagonist did not obey and only stopped persuading him after his donkey died after eating one of the friend's fingers (come to think of it, colm wouldn't have cut his fingers off in the first place if the protagonist respected his decision and didn't bother him).

Clearly the civil war looms in the background but it's never clear (at least to me) what meaning we are meant to derive from it, as even the townsfolk don't seem to be bothered too much that it's happening. My husband and I watched this film and we both had plenty of giggles throughout as the main characters plod through the plot with funny little witticisms in their charming Irish lilts, but the overarching story was incredibly unpleasant and the ending was frustrating. Barry Keoghan (Dominic), Kerry Condon, and a miniature donkey named Jenny stole the show.

And the photography, sigh--easy to expect great, sprawling vistas of Achill Island & Inishmore (the West Coast of Ireland, where my grandparents were raised, is awash with rough waves, steep cliffs, treeless plains)- but Ben Davis uses them as background without milking it. It's the interiors, the painterly use of natural light-the soft whites & golds through windows, a la Vermeer, and the splashes of candlelight on faces against dark brown, earthen walls, the chiaroscuro bringing out the isolation and well worn visages of characters looking for meaning in their existence.

            "content": "Watching 'The Beauty Queen of Leenane' being performed on stage in writer Martin McDonagh's home city of London's West End a few decades ago was stirring enough. I and two friends had seats in the second row, just out of range of the occasional splatters of fake blood from the stage, which were reaching those in front of us. A good few walked out of what they must have presumed would be a titillating Oirish play. Instead, they got J. B. Keane crossed with Tarantino. That approach - folky scene employed as Trojan Horse - has been a common enough formula: Flann O'Brien set the precedent, Shane McGowan had a touch of it, the Father Ted series played with same. McDonagh's film The Banshees of Inisherin loses that power, partly as an insightful nephew (and filmmaking undergraduate in Dublin) says, because it still feels like a stage-play. But it isn't a stage play. Thinking out loud, realistic amputated fingers being thrown into the audience could have done the trick, like something from Joe Dante's movie Matinee or to have expected in the famous all-night Scala Cinema, Kings Cross back in the 1980s.What interested me about the film, whether McDonagh intended it or not, were all the allusions to social media. In the 1960s many had misunderstood media theorist Marshall McLuhan's use of the phrase Global Village. In fact, it was meant as stark warning. Whilst village life (of the past) had its charms, and involved mutually supporting networks, normalised sharing, open doors; the reality also meant everyone knowing your business, the imposition of a uniform oppressive morality, collusion and covering-up of horror, and various forms of entrapment. Lars von Trier's Dogville hits the mark in portraying small town niceness masking pure evil. Each platform is different to the next - arguably Twitter was/is too hostile a place and Instagram is sickeningly 'nice' - but the social media landscape which emerged two decades ago has many village characteristics. Long in advance of the internet, that is what McLuhan was hinting at. If it was hard to leave communal village communities, then detaching from social media platforms is as trying. Pubs, bars, shebeens and caf\u00e9s preceded online communities; people are not only addicted to alcohol, caffeine and to social media, but to socialising itself, to conversation and to each other, in ways which can be pleasing but also - overused term alert - toxic. McDonagh's play/film unpacks the question of Likes and Liking in amusing ways, illustrating how things can get out of hand. That is surely a referencing of today's new-media world where adults behave like 'twelve-year olds', bitter disputes unfold, and even the fact, that dexterity with fingers is a vital aspect of smart-screen and device use, appears linked. And a sick joke I heard once seems pertinent. What have online chat rooms and confession got in common? Both involve talking secretly with someone you can't see who is probably a paedophile.McDonagh goes to great trouble to signify that the bucolic historical scene is exaggeration. He throws everything in: the Virgin Mary statue, one of those household Jesus pictures, a Celtic cross, priest, policeman, there's the perfectly twee clothing, an uncanny lack of rain, and highly saturated imagery adds to the effect. The intended irony seemed lost on the cinema audience I was part of (not in Ireland): a lot of people were laughing at perfectly ordinary turns of phrase, but not at other, presumably meant-to-be funny, aspects of the film. The dog licking Colm's wound made perfect sense in my mind because of the purported healing effects of same but amused many there.Though language use is hammed up in McDonagh's signature style, interestingly other terminology slips in: today's fixation on depression is given attention. There is a lot more going on in this McDonagh flick, for example a reactionary message about the inevitably of conflict, including civil war, hinting at a pointlessness in revolutions. Women seem capable of rising above all this, observing, escaping the madness but are idealised. The relationship with animals, the attempt to tease out tensions between cultural drives and the apparent artistic mindset versus everyday pressures, low versus high culture - eating with your mouth closed is associated with being French, use of the word 'yet', English etc. - the significance of the island as metaphor (a platform?), nostalgia for war, belief versus nihilistic attitudes, the concern with stupidity and being a gom versus cultured, interesting, intelligent all deserve attention maybe.The storytelling may be seductive but I'm so tired of these kinds of overall framing. Others must be too. The intended irony is easily lost on many, as stated. Irish directors like Leonard Abrahamson have been doing more interesting things. McDonagh ends up exploiting too much of what artist and filmmaker Mick Holly calls 'the notion of \"Irishness\" as fictitious unity developed for profitable export', and ' the tourist industry's production and management of Irish fantasy'",

They are strange bedfellows and when Colm suddenly ends the friendship the only person surprised by it is Padraic.So begins their descent into enmity (that includes self-mutilation, accidental death, exposed secrets, escape, and tragic realizations) driven first by Colm disparaging Padraic's \"dullness\" and sustained by Padraic's ever-diminishing idealism.Comedy my arse.

            "content": "I've very much anticipated this film since seeing the trailers, I found the basic concept fascinating and was excited to see where the film would go on such a simple premise.Firstly, the acting is fantastic across the board, Colin Ferrell and Brendan Gleeson are excellent in the film, but Barry Keoghan stood out in particular with a great performance as the village screw-up, he adds so much to his character.The concept for this film starts out with the simple premise of a man who decides he no longer wants to be friends with another man, and throughout it escalates, it becomes more intense and even a bit unsettling, that is no doubt in part due to the setting. Living on a very small island (Inisherin) where everyone knows everyone and word travels quickly can make change very awkward for everyone. One small slip, one bad encounter and suddenly the entire village will hear of it. But the build up is very well done and you really feel for Colin Ferrell's character as he comes to grips with his best friend suddenly deciding he no longer wants to be a part of his life and the entire town having their own opinions on the matter. The ending is not quite what I expected, and perhaps not what I was hoping for as far as the resloution goes, but an interesting ending nevertheless, I certainly didn't dislike it.My two gripes with this film would be that there are decisions made by a certain character that feel a bit extreme and even counterintuitive to their supposed goal, so it was a bit odd when they make those decisions, but I won't spoil it.The second is that the film feels too quiet. There's very little ambient sound, meaning the ocean, the wind, animals, people in a crowded pub, it was missing or very faintly there for almost all of the movie. All of the audio is focused on what the main speaking characters were saying and all the rest of the surrounding sound is turned down, which I felt took the realism out of it to a degree. I want to hear what's around the characters, what they would be hearing to be immersed in their environment, and unfortunately that was a bit lost, which is a shame, because the film looks beautiful.Overall I would highly recommend the film, it's a very engaging, wonderfully performed & beautifully shot, well worth watching.",

P\u00e1draic (Colin Farrell), though nice and well liked by everyone on the island of Inisherin, is a little too \"dull\" for his old friend Colm (Brendan Gleeson) who wants to spend the rest of his life composing music and doing things so he may be remembered for generations to come. Colm is resistant to his old friend's attempts to make amends for his unknown offence, so he makes a promise to cut off one of the fingers on his left hand each time P\u00e1draic tries to talk with him. Though P\u00e1draic's sister Siobh\u00e1n (Kerry Condon) and the troubled son of a local policeman (Barry Keoghan) try to defuse the pair's escalating quarrel their attempts prove futile.Both Farrell and Gleeson command attention shen on screen. Farrell's bewilderment turned fury towards his old friend is matched by Gleeson's resolute will to make his life that appears to be slipping away count. The cast is further filled out by a surprisingly tender performance by Barry Keoghan, who's confession of love towards Siobh\u00e1n is a strikingly sincere highlight of the second act. (Sheila Flitton also delivers a tempered performance as Mrs. McCormick, the Bergman-esque figure of death crone that spreads the island's gossip.Achill Island off the western coast of County Mayo in northwestern Ireland plays the fictional Inisherin. The homely setting is a strongpoint of the film, though the excellent art direction leaves something to be desired of the cinematography. Ireland's natural beauty isn't quite enough to save this film from looking flat I'm afraid.The Civil war metaphor also falls flat on it's face because not much happens to support it. Everything feels relatively timeless on the island. Though the far off booms of the guns on the mainland hint at another senseless conflict very little ties P\u00e1draic and Colm's feud to the wider world.The soundtrack was a strongpoint, considering it's importance to the plot. Carter Burwell, Martin McDonagh's frequent collaborator, succeeds in circumventing the expectations of the film's setting lending a subtle yet provocative underscore to the film's plot. It was also nice to see Brendan Gleeson get to play the fiddle (with four fingers no less).Apart from notable performances fro its leads and an intriguing premise I fear Banshees will come and go like so many projects in the post-Covid \"prestige film\" boom. I'd recommend this film to anybody who's interested in watching it because of its setting or its leads. I'm definitely not going to say \"stay away\" due to a few minor gripes. Come for the performance, stay for the setting and enjoy your night out.",

            "content": "This movie is seemingly, on the surface, a delightful weirdly quirky comedy drama about the drama that ensues as a man suddenly stops talking to his friend (Padraic) one day. The setting is on a small, remote, sparsely populated island off the coast of ireland where the accent is thick and everyones pastime seems to be spending time at the one pub, which adds to the quirkiness. The entire movie is about the other man trying to get his friend to talk to him again, and it ends more or less without much of an ending, neither resolution nor tragedy, leaving you a bit wanting for a more satisfying conclusion.But the real joy of this film comes after the fact, or maybe during for some keen viewers. You start to realize that the everything in the movie is a metaphor and that it all surrounds Padraic's relationship with his sister (Siobhan). Their relationships with the other two main characters in the story, Colm and Dominic, represent their inward feelings toward each other and other characters.Padraic is known on the island to be simple, and somewhat dull, spending much of his days drinking at the pub and talking about simple things. His friend Colm decides one day that he wants more out of life and that he must leave Padraic behind, lest he be held back as well. His relationship with Colm is his inward relationship with his sister Siobhan. She , sentimental to Colm, is contemplating leaving the island to work as a librarian on the mainland, having to leave her brother behind on the island to pursue her dreams. (Colm even hints at Siobhan that she must be able to relate to how he feels. The film is filled to the brim with hints and clues like this).The metaphors don't stop there, they abound in this film. The donkey also represents Padraic, just wanting company, much in the same way Padraic wants that of his sister. The cops relationship with his son Dominic represents his relationship with Padraic and Siobahn. He bullies them and pressures them to do things for him, otherwise beating them. (He is also saddened when he finds out Siobhan has finally fled the island and his advances, represented by his sons death soon after). Dominics relationship to Siobhan also represents Padraic's feelings toward his sister, wanting her care and love. When she rejects him, she symbolically rejects her brother, and this is the first death foretold by the banshee (Dominic in the lake).One day when Padraic drunkenly stands up to Colm, alongside claiming he will never forget his sister because she is kind, Siobahn seeming has a bit of a change of heart, and contemplates staying for her brother (Colm also contemplates befriending him again). Padraic, having sent one of Colm's music students back home to the mainland, represented by him reading his sister job offer letter and withholding it from his sister, later confesses to it, which for better or worse, makes Colm once again change his mind (as does his sister).This final resolve, Colm cutting off the rest of his fingers, representing Siobhans final decision to leave the island, results in the second and final death: that of the donkey, representing Padraic's broken heart and his yearning turned toward anger toward Colm and Siobhan. He burns Colm's house, symbolizing wanting to tell his sister she is no longer welcome, and the next day, Colm is unexpectedly wanting to keep the relationship, as his sister's letter also does. But Padraic's heart has now been hurt too much, it has turned sour toward both of them, yet he still has a soft spot for them. He offers to watch Colm's dog for him \"anytime\".",

With only a few dozen folk in a limited space, every relationship and happening gets magnified, so, depending on the isolation, feuds often develop. I've been to Aran only a couple of times, but only detected friendship. The nearest to Inisherin I've found is one of the Shetland Islands, north of Scotland (not saying which, but it is remote!). The islanders there have divided themselves into two bitterly-feuding families, seemingly for decades, and nothing can bring them together. They hide their mutual animosity from most visitors, but after a few visits in company with other folk from Shetland & Orkney (who somehow demonstrate island street-cred) they let the mask slip, and opposing family members walk past each other on the road in silence.Back to the film, I wasn't keen on the way two islands with obviously different geologies were used. So you get a track winding between the limestone walls & tiny fields of Inis Mor, switching suddenly to the open hill-country of Achill. Perhaps good for variety, but there are plenty of possible locations on the two inner Aran Isles, especially the middle one, Inis Maun, where you can still see the odd local woman in traditional costume on Sundays (or you could 20 years ago).If you are thinking of going to Aran, don't hesitate! In May & June the wild flowers are fantastic, though July & August are better for pub music. Inisheer has some wonderful guest-houses. Don't expect to slim while you are there.",

Ultimately Gleeson destroys his musical gift ..his ambitions...his dream..by cutting away his friendship with Farrell and mutilating himself so that he cannot play music anymore.It's a deeply disturbing act that aligns with the Irish Civil war which essentially became a body attacking itself and leaving itself damaged and broken.Farrells character develops from innocent and kind with a deep love for his animals...to the realisation that his friend no longer wants to know him. He strives to understand but when his beloved donkey chokes on Gleeson amputated fingers he is thrown into the depths of bitterness and despair. The kind that seeks retribution. And he does seek it.The film is set in the west of Ireland. Beiatiful scenery that serves to highlight even more poignantly the utter despair that the characters live through. The Valley of the Squinting windows is alive and well.Keoghegan as Dominic is unbelievably brilliant. The scene by the lake is heart stoppingly sad as his simple thought processes realise without any bitterness that his dream will never be realised.This is an extremely nuanced film. To take it at face value as a black comedy is to do it an injustice. Its a Shakespearean tragedy meets Dostoyevskian manipulation.",

It's mind-blowing by itself. Everything was so capturing in every detail, scene, directing stuff, and the acting. Collen was able to reflect every single requirements his rule needed as if he was absorbed with this character. No wonder it was nominated for 9 Oscars and loads of others. How could the friends change? How was Colm (Brendan Gleeson) able to just igonre his (close) friend. Everyone on the island knew their friendship. How could he sleep and be happy with the achievement he claimed he was seeking? A friend endures a lot from his friend. Padraic (Collin Farrell) didn't believe him and tried what he could and a bit more to reconnect what he has lost. It was his soul and life that he missed. At the beginning of the movie the island used to be sunny, unlike it was when the grief started taking place. The weather was gloomy in a way that enforces your feeling to feel himself. \"When it rains, it pours down\". His friend was \"not nice\" as he used to be, or he never used to be. While he was struggling with his friend and thought he could reconnect the friendship rope, he was burdened with his sister leaving.\"She is nice, I'll always remember her \". He doesn't have anyone one now to talk to or wit with except for \"Jenny\", yet he was gone too. Since then, Padraic didn't care anymore about any apology from his ex-friend. Here it comes the change of his personality in the movie. It hit me hard. The last scene where he was leaving him shooting the old lady between them was the toughest thing. He didn't hesitate this time to leave him or look back. He wanted to say a lot when his \"friend\" thanked him, he couldn't say but \"any time\". He couldn't talk to him as he used to do. What a lifeless life the both lived later on. They both lost the essence of life because his friend wanted to stay away from his friend to seek for forever-last-living thing (music) but he obtained neither at the end.",

Ever since I first saw In Bruges, I've held my breath for all of his releases and when I found out he is doing something with Gleeson and Farrell again, I was counting the days.First of all, The Banshees of Inisherin is one of his least inviting films. But in a good way! It will refuse to hold your hand. Martin McDonagh has proven to be pretty straightforward in his stories and his dialogue. Inisherin is no different and it doesn't hold back for a second.There is a conflict at the center of this story that is a simple and an intense one. And the conflict is mostly the result of a certain fear all of us have known throughout our lives - the fear that the good times are a waste. The fear that history only remembers the martyrs and especially the fear that to be happy just might as well mean to be stupid. In my opinion, if you've ever had a true real friend in your life - this movie is either a great consolation or a serious warning for you.Beautiful scenery, great performances, heartbreaking dialogue, great pacing. To all the reviewers in here who said they didn't get it - please give it another chance! I found myself relating to all sides of this conflict and I think it is an incredibly important subject.

Not because I think it should have kept going, but because I wasn't ready to see the last of the characters I had been watching for the last two hours. Farrell and Gleeson both give great performances with some genuine laugh out loud moments in this black comedy. No punches were pulled or fingers...My take on what it was all about:I think Colm had clearly decided he wanted his life to have meaning and to leave a legacy as he wound down his last years of life. This meant he resented Padraic, his dull, simple friend as he was clearly content with their lives doing nothing but being drinking buddies and chatting absolute nonsense all day, everyday. This means Colm ditches his old friend for a chance to focus on his goal of achieving immortality through his music. The only problem is that their friendship had, unbeknownst to him, been giving Padraic's life purpose. This meant that once Padraic realises he can't win him back, much like his friend, he turns to unapologetic, bizarre, specific violence (Colm cutting his own left handed fingers off when Padraic bothers him and Padraic burning Colm's house down at 2 for killing his pony). The civil war in Ireland, like many wars, was fought between two sides who had far more reasons to love each other than hate each other. But as the movie says \"somethings there is no moving on from\". This in my opinion is what the movie is about. The violence both men have done has meant they can no longer go back. The only way forward now is with more hate and violence. Padraic knows he's lost his friend but also knows that he'd rather be his enemy than no one at all. They both end up with nothing even though you can see in their eyes during their last interaction that it is only pride that is keeping them from happiness and friendship once more.",

I keep thinking of Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot.\" Like \"Godot\" it is funny but bleak. Unlike \"Godot\" it has some shocking violence and raw emotion. But again, like \"Godot,\" the overall impact is devastating.I think that Beckett had Laurel and Hardy in mind when he wrote \"Godot.\" And the two main characters in this film are also L&H-esque.

            "content": "This film was not what I was expecting but I loved it. It has beautifully captured the quirkiness of Island life on the West Coast of Ireland but also has much deeper meaning. Having holidayed on Achill Island earlier this year the landscape is wonderfully captured, especially the spectacular Keem Bay.The Banshee in Irish mythology is a spirit that wails at night to warn of the impending death of a loved one and the theme of the film, to me, focuses strongly on mortality and inner turmoil.Gleeson's character who early in the film shuns his old friend Farrell makes initially for dark comedic watching as he no longer wants to waste his time on banal conversation, realising that his time on earth is limited. He claims to want to achieve greater things and create a lasting legacy through art and musical composition.It is sad to watch Farrells reaction (brilliantly portrayed) to this brutal rejection, essentially losing his only friend on the island overnight. Kerry Condon plays a fantastic character in Farrells sister. She is the voice of reason and sense but she too is also impacted heavily by the isolation of island life - her most firey moment being questioned why she never had children (which obviously touched a deep nerve). For me she is the most complex character in the film and I especially enjoyed a scene where she calls out Gleeson on incorrectly naming the century in which Mozart lived - which at that time makes his arrogance on looking down on Farrell as being dull seem very hypocritical indeed.Overall this film had me thinking about it for a few days after, which I imagine is the whole point. It is fine for casual watching but there are fewer laugh out loud moments compared to something like In Bruges. I think the acting and script are on a whole other level in this though and when I get round to watching it again I might take something else away from it altogether. On first watch though I was left feeling sad afterwards and it seems like this emotion successfully washed off from both the island and the characters on to me.",

I enjoyed both \"7 Psycopaths\" and \"Banshees of Inisherin\" - hence the 7 stars..... but these last two films suffered from the same thing..... Colin Farrell.Farrell seems to have the ability to just completely miss the character that's written down on the page. In both films he failed to create the empathy needed with the character to bring the entire concept of each story together.In Banshees I kept being surprised by expositions by minor characters that explain what has just happened, suddenly making sense of the previous scenes. At one of the key moments in the film, Gleeson (playing Colm) tells Farrell that he can't spend the rest of his life listening to conversations like the one where Farrell spent two hours talking about things he'd found in his donkey's poo. ...... THAT was a revelation. For the first time the relationship between the two men made sense. Up until that point nothing suggested that he was one of the most boring men in the world. But the way Farrell plays it you just can't believe it. Farrell spends most of the film just being angry and occasionally shouting like a hard man. Gleason does a great job despite having to play against Farrell who spends most of the film fighting against his dialogue and doing lots of \"stare into the distance\" acting. Farrell creates no empathy for his character. I found myself feeling sorry for Gleeson's character.The biggest tragedy is when Gleeson's character starts cutting off his fingers. It should be the funniest moment of the film, partly because it's so absurd, but it actually kind of makes sense..... how else do you stop the relentless, angry barrage of nonsense coming from Farrell? If Farrell had only played his character as a simpler, less angry man, then Gleeson's actions become crazy. His actions Madness! The bizarre lengths a man will go to to avoid a nice, boring friend.At one point Farrell tells the audience that he's a \"nice\" man, he then reacts with a shout as if he could rip Gleeson's throat out. And that one scream goes to the nub of the problem with Farrell's performance and sadly the film. That scream should be the best try of Padraic NOT to be nice, to be angry.... and it should fail.....it should be just enough for Gleeson's Colm to find it \"the most interesting he's ever been\" (even funnier it ISN'T very interesting) but Farrell actually looks threatening. Menacing. It looks like he's about to take down the entire pub.Look, overall the film is still fun and, as with 7 Psychopaths, I enjoyed the writing/story and Gleeson was fabulous.The one stand out performance was from Barry Keoghan playing the character of Dominic Kearney. An unsubtle character played with as much subtlety to make him the most fascinating character in the film. Some of his moments are heart breaking.I understand why McDonagh brings Farrell back: Global \"star\" credentials. But I can't help wondering how brilliant this film could have been with a different actor playing the character of Padraic.",

His talent as a writer/director speaks for itself, but I'm certain he would be the first to admit his work is elevated by Farrell and Gleeson. Though the years may have etched away at the actors' faces since they last shared top billing, their craft has only improved.In 1923, on the isle of Inisherin - a fictitious location not far off mainland Ireland - life is quiet and simple. The local church is filled every Sunday morning. The pub is frequented by many townsfolk throughout the rest of the week (and Sunday afternoons). Two of the most common visitors to the public house are P\u00e1draic (Farrell) and Colm (Gleeson). They can almost always be found having a couple of pints when the two o'clock bell chimes. Unbeknownst to P\u00e1draic, though, their days of drinking and chatting together are at an end.P\u00e1draic received no warning for the sudden termination of their friendship, so he confronts Colm about it. Colm plainly informs him that he no longer enjoys his company. It's an unsatisfactory answer, so Colm is pushed into admitting that he finds P\u00e1draic dull. That response also brings no sense of comfort to P\u00e1draic. As a result, he continues searching for the deeper meaning behind his friend's evasiveness. At home, he talks with his sister Siobh\u00e1n (Kerry Condon), who has no idea why he's being ignored. Later, P\u00e1draic speaks with a simple-minded local lad named Dominic (Barry Keoghan). He also has no clue why Colm is acting the way he is, though Dominic points out that Colm's behavior resembles that of a schoolboy.After some thought, P\u00e1draic resolves to confront Colm again. It doesn't go well. Colm begs P\u00e1draic never to speak to him again, promising to start cutting off his own fingers one by one if P\u00e1draic refuses to comply. Beyond the obvious horror of self-maiming, this would be damaging to Colm's hopes of crafting a memorable song with his fiddle. P\u00e1draic is shocked by Colm's threat, but he remains determined to restore their friendship. He will just have to find a way to break through Colm's hardened shell without speaking to him. Unfortunately, for a talkative man like P\u00e1draic, it will be a significant challenge.The gloomy narrative of \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" contrasts starkly with the gorgeous surrounding scenery. Whether indoors or out, cinematographer Ben Davis captures what beauty can be found in each moment, even if it's melancholic. The visual imagery of separation he presents is particularly striking. Davis' efforts are accentuated by Carter Burwell's emotional score. His music conjures up a rare set of feelings.It would be a shame to ignore the effort of the performers in this devastating story. Farrell is as remarkable as ever, playing P\u00e1draic to perfection. He brings a unique vulnerability to the character, conveying just how dedicated and polite a man P\u00e1draic is. Gleeson is icy-cold and sometimes cruel as Colm but doesn't open the door to feel apathetic towards him. Kerry Condon is terrific as Siobh\u00e1n, who is the voice of reason whenever present. Barry Keoghan plays his role exceedingly well, putting on a nuanced and impactful display despite having little screen time. Dominic is perhaps the most profound individual in Inisherein despite his lack of intellectualism. The remaining cast members are also superb, but I don't have room to go into detail here. Suffice to say they make Inisherin feel lived in and complete.There were many times I was in total awe of the cinematic craftsmanship of \"The Banshees of Inisherin.\" Black comedy/drama films rarely receive genuine, uninterrupted engagement from an audience. I was amazed that I did not hear a single rustle of movement from anyone around me as I sat before the cinema screen. All eyes were glued, and every ear was tuned in to each moment of the story. That is a definitive marker of powerful cinema.What I personally found most interesting about \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" is how it has a different impact than McDonagh's other films. It's both sobering and funny, which isn't new, but the questions the movie asks are more biting and demand introspection. Not only are the queries daunting, but they are posed in such a way that they cannot be brushed off. McDonagh's ponderings are genuine in a way that few films manage to communicate. Most directors would be laughed off or met with eye-rolls if they tried telling this story. \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" has hung in my mind ever since I left the cinema, and I've faced more introspection than I have in a long time. That's one of the great gifts movies give us if we let them.",

            "content": "The film \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" is set in the 1920s in Ireland and follows the relationship between two friends, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson. After a falling out, Gleeson's character becomes increasingly extreme and unwell, while Farrell's character is revealed to be more selfish in his actions. Kerry Condon, as Farrell's sister, is a standout in the cast and provides a contrast to the male characters. The humor is Martin McDonagh-style dry, dark and subtle. The film is best appreciated by a patient audience who can appreciate its subtleties and dark humor. It is not a light-hearted comedy and has a slow-burn plot that is a commentary on human nature and isolation. The film explores themes of friendship, loneliness, isolation and mortality, and the four main performances are outstanding, with Barry Keoghan particularly impressive.My personal rating for this movie is 6.6/10.",

And also about how boring life was before, especially on the distant islands of Ireland. People had nothing to do, every day they went to the pub and that's how their years flew by. This is confirmed by the character of Kerry Condon, who simply escapes from this life into something new, something interesting for her.You can be friends with your friend for years, tell him a story about a goat for 2 hours, and after a day he doesn't want to see you anymore. This movie answers the question: \"Should you be friends with a friend who drags you down?\" , \"How not to lose your friend?\" , \"What will be the consequences after you stop communicating with him?\", \"How can friendship die?\" And what the end of friendship will cost?The masterful performance of Colin Farrell, Kerry Condon and Brendan Gleeson under the direction of Martin McDonagh, the incredible cinematography of Ben Davis and the gorgeous shots of the coast of Ireland borrowed from his brother Michael McDonagh: All this complements this film.P.s : Sorry for my english:)",

Every time, whenever you think, you will find new meaning, and new aspects.If you even think, about the movie, on the surface level then also it will make you sad. It will show you the ways to connect your thoughts with the characters' thoughts. You will be able to blend yourself with either of the characters. Either you are trying to be friendly with someone or you are trying to avoid someone. You will find these two aspects in two characters separately.But this movie is more enjoyable when you can connect it with the Irish civil war.

Every few years he provides another gem of a movie from In Bruges (2008) to Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri(2017) and now The Banshess of Inisherin(2022). One of the best pieces of writing we have seen the past few years. There is a wonderful balance of humour and pathos, just like in 3 Billboards. The cinematography is amazing while the sets and locations are beautiful which further enhance the majestic and tragic nature of the movie.Moving on with the cast.. what can I even begin to describe about the superb acting happening in this film. Bringing back together Colin Farell and Brendan Gleeson truly showed what a beautiful chemistry these two have. Colin Farell gave us one of his best performances, the actor has unquestionable depth and he portrays the majority of his roles masterfully. The supporting cast was top notch as well, with Barry Keoghan giving as subtle, powerful and tragic performance of his character!!Why satisfyingly unsatisfying you might be wondering by now... The reason behind this is that the movie ends in a way that I feel unsatisfied. We never get the big payoff we are waiting for!! Maybe that was a conscious choice, maybe that's exactly what they wanted to do.. maybe so.. but nonetheless it leaves me with a bitter taste in an otherwise masterful film. Maybe the struggle of the characters is the same as the futile civil war across the pond.",

The scene between the two of them by the lake felt like the climax of the movie- with my heart absolutely shattering for Dominic.

All of the actors and actresses in this were wonderful, and it really touched on how self-destructive male loneliness and the unwillingness to compromise can be. We watch as a man who is known for his niceness turn into a monster because he has little else to sustain himself on outside of this single friendship.Padriac's sister Siobhan was a huge highlight for me. Often playing the mediator between these two men's petty squabbles, she is often the only source of vibrant colour that you can see in the film, and makes for a great contrast with the rest of this dreary Irish island.Throw in a little bit of mysticism, and this movie had me captivated for its entire duration.",

            "content": "This is a great film. To me, this film is about a battle of ideologies. Colm is a realist. Worrying about his legacy, he pushes away his friend to chase immortality through the composition of fiddle tunes. He wants to be like Mozart, remembered not for his personality, but for his accomplishments. He sees life not as a journey, but as a destination.On the other hand, Padraic is a dreamer. Even after Colm demands him to stop speaking to him, claiming that he wastes his time on dull, meaningless conversation, Padraic keeps returning. Not because he thinks he can change his mind, but because he hopes he can change his mind. Although it can be seen as stupidity-I mean, Colm told him that if he kept trying to talk to him, he would cut off the rest of his fingers-he can't stand to lose a friend and hopes he can change him.Padraic isn't really concerned with his legacy, but rather the connections he forms with the people around him. For him, life is about the journey, not the destination. He isn't worried about being immortal or remembered forever, but with being a nice, kind, likable guy.Throughout the film, Colm cuts of his fingers whenever Padraic tries to talk to him as a way to deter him from speaking with him. This is interesting an interesting method, because he essentially relies on Padraic's kindness and his desire to not hurt him. Padraic isn't the one physically cutting them off, but he is inadvertently causing Colm pain.However, once Jenny the donkey chokes on Colm's severed fingers, it switches. Now, Colm has inadvertently caused Padraic pain. As a result, Padraic is forced to see the reality of the situation. Colm is cruel, and his cruelty caused the death of a loved one. We see a switch. The narrative is flipped-now, Padraic doesn't care if Colm gets hurt. He actually wants to hurt him. Now, Padraic is the violent, pessimistic cruel one and Colm feels regret. Thus, Padraic burns his house down, even though Colm was inside.It is important to note that Colm chose to escape. You would think that Colm would be at peace with dying because he cut off his fingers, ending his fiddling career and destroying his chance to create a lasting legacy. However, he chooses to live. This exemplifies the change in him: now, he is no longer obsessed with the destination, but he is willing to live for the journey of life.Don't forget about Dominic's death, which is definitely a suicide. Before his death, Padraic and Siobhan were his only \"friends.\" The town saw him as weird, the odd one out, but Padraic and Siobhan were kind to him. In fact, when he needed to leave home for a bit after his father beat him, he asked Padraic to stay the night. Desperate for a human connection, he even asks Siobhan if she could ever love him. However, after Padraic revealed to Dominic that he made the fiddler go away by telling him that his dad died, Dominic sees the cruel person Padraic is becoming. He no longer wants to be friends with him, and after Siobhan went away, he has no more friends in town. Dominic has an abusive father, no friends, no future, so it's no wonder he killed himself. The fact that the townspeople thought it was an accidental fall shows how no one in town even thought about how he felt, and even in death, the town does not care about Dominic at all.This is a great movie about philosophy, friendship, and the human connections that run our society, and I'd recommend watching it to everyone.",

More serious repercussions follow that ...Kerry Condon gives a strong performance as Colin Farrell's sister and presents a dose of reality among the rest of the characters, each of whom carry their own versions of damage and odd obsessions.Barry Keoghan's performance as Dominic is at once bizarre and wistful and Gary Lydon's as his constable father Paeder gives a strong depiction of suppressed rage and violence that crops up throughout.I would have rated this a 10 as an art-house film but for the less believable aspects.

Colm (Brendan Gleeson) is also suffering... How do we know? He discloses it at the confessionary. And despite the story being driven by the friendship (or lack of it) between Colm and P\u00e1draic (Colin Farrell), it is the small characters, the priest, the sister, the policeman, his son, the post office lady, and the bartender, that fill the gaps deliberately left in the plot and make the script both compelling and solid. Even the ominous presence of Mrs. McCormick offers us a touch of magical realism and it works; \u00c9ire Folklore is full of it.Set in small village in a seemingly parochial islet, off the coast of Ireland, The Banshees of Inisherin deals with ordinary themes such as comradeship, tittle-tattle, farming, daily chores, as well as despair, isolation, hardship, and war. It does it in such a way that makes them universal and relatable to every human being; all of this while we chuckle about the mundane and guiltily giggle, however cruel is what we are witnessing on the screen. But what is dark comedy for anyway, Martin McDonagh the master of it.The breathtaking landscape of the West Coast of Ireland is captured by a crafted camera work. The score by Cart Burwell is eerie and melancholic but used sparsely. The performance by the main actors and supporting roles is prominent. The period costume design blends in smoothly with the landscape and the set decoration. Martin MacDonagh is at his best as scriptwriter and director. The film would be a strong contender in each category at the Oscars but given that Disney-owned Fox gave the film a limited release in most markets and a quick streaming launch The Banshees will probably not get all the recognition it is worth.The film has a baffling end, could it have been any different, do we need to know what happened in the end? Probably not, it would have been too graphic and full of unnecessary exposure. And that is probably what we can take away from the film, it is not the end that matters, but the journey. It is when Colm became all too philosophical about purpose, end and goals that comedy turned into tragedy.This is one of the best films of 2022 the work McDonagh will be ultimately remembered for.",

Lasted 1968-1998.The movie is a reflection of the human condition as is related to the continual violence. I think that's why we hear the gunshots from the mainland and a couple of references to it.The human condition is our failure to empathize with others, including sorrow, show compassion, share in joy or grief, an unwillingness to move on to better our lives. People can get so wrapped up in their own feelings of loneliness and hopelessness, the don't understand others and start a tit-for-tat escalation of events that ultimately \"destroy\" everyone.These lack of emotions basically reflects the troubles in Ireland in the 20th century.Only until humans learn to rise above their own selfishness can fighting stop.Notes- beautiful landscape, music, and cast. Also, so much is symbolic, not literal.",

The tragedy and heartbreak is all too real. Cordon and Keoghan's storylines are immersive and they all come together in the end.The landscape is ravishing, but island life is tough. The isolation. The cabin/island fever. The harshness of life back then was tough enough, but to be on an island just makes it tougher. You need a good spirit to get on in life, and I guess this is why Irish are great linguists and always upbeat. You have to be.One thing to note. I thought it was a contemporary film but it's actually set in the relatively near past.",

The drama is laced with contrary Irish humour and engaging characters. Colin Farrell gives a nuanced performance of a lifetime. He deserves the Academy Award for Best Actor.

The acting is phenomenal and the cast deserve all the nominations for the respective awards. I think the movie has an interesting and intense deeper meaning that some people may not catch. On the face it's just two lifelong friends who suddenly split due to the attitude of one. The movie has great aspects of comedic relief while it tells a heavy and depressing story. The film has incredible cinematography including breathtaking shots of the Irish landscape. It also tells a very different story than most films, including films about this time in Ireland. Films about this time period in Ireland usually focus on the fighting on the mainland while The Banshees of Inisherin focuses on the isolation of a small island that is clearly dying out with lack of people to replenish the dwindling population. Overall it tells an excellent tale and has great cinematography therefore delivering an excellent claim for the best movie of 2022.",

The beauty of the setting both geographically and temporal hit me in a way no others have this year but ultimately the story that can be read as an examination of mortality, relationship between people, animals and their environment, good and evil, the merits of a simple life, the heartbreak of a break up, the joy and love of family, the positivity of community and faith, the love for friends and family (both human and not human) and why being nice is sometimes enough is what made it for me.Many bemoan the ending and the lack of clear closure and on one hand I agree (though I could argue like many others that that's life for you) but on the other hand a strong part of me read into the ending a clear (or at the very least a hopeful) conclusion that pointed to a future resolution between the main characters that didn't need any more than what was said....\"Thanks for looking after my Dog\"\"Anytime\"..",

The Irish are so used to violence (e.g. Ulster's bloody red hand in their flag). For a time we became immune to it. It's worth noting that the number lost during the the recent troubles of Northern Ireland over 30 years was just around twice those lost at sea in the Titanic disaster (a ship built in Belfast).

I appreciate a parallel was being drawn between the private quarrel on the island and the civil war on the mainland. A country which fights a civil war mutilates itself - yes, but the parallel is not very exact. Both sides are mutilated in civil war but only one party was in the island quarrel and the civil war ended pretty soon but the quarrel was set to drag on endlessly.The incredible parts: 1. Someone whose main interest seems to be playing the fiddle would not mutilate themselves so they could not do so. Vincent Van Gogh cut off his ear not the fingers he used to paint with.2. A donkey would not eat a severed finger and even if it did to choke to death it would have to be stuck in its craw, not its mouth where Padraic finds it.3. No priest (apart perhaps from Father Jack) would say \"God does not care for donkeys\" as they would know God cares for all his creation.As I write this the Bafta awards are due tonight and I hope this film wins an award for acting or cinematography which were both superb- but not best film or script.",

He feels abandoned and discarded, and no matter how clear he's been warned about the situation, he's just trying to lure Colm into conversing with him.But, even though there are other folk than Colm, only person who's getting along with Podraic is the village idiot, Dominic. Whom Podraic doesn't particularly like either.And with this ridicilous cause, the two literally destroy each other's lives.

Dominic's (Barry Keoghan) facial expressions and lines are priceless, the Priest (David Pearse) made confessions tempting again! I enjoyed the dynamics between each character.

Poor Jenny's death was stupid and made me fairly lethal with reckless Colm, putting him on my imaginery death row for sure.Cutting those fingers off and still playing music - that was quite manly.

I guess it touches on depression specifically in men. They don't talk or open up as much. It just grows and festers and causes pain.I really loved the film. Also if you're ever around Mayo in the summer time the island is beautiful.",

Colm is hard to like and Padraic is a loveable simple man, they are polar opposites. Films like this don't come along to often. The theatre laughed throughout and clapped at the end.

The dialogue being at times hilarious and hilariously tragic.Barry Keoghns Dominic is eerily reminiscent of John Mills Michael in Ryan's daughter but gets some show stealing jokes despite being the ultimate victim- in the personification of loneliness and desperation of the lives of the islanders which the film conveys almost painfully at times\nA great cast, superior acting and a witty and moving script makes for a thought provoking, funny and poignant watch and I would highly recommend it.",

Impressed as I was by the actors' performances, five minutes into the story, I was thrown instead into an intense experience of relationships tossed by the wind into torrents of dispair. Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan impressed me with their portrayals of people wrangling with emotions and unfulfilled wishes. Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrel had drawn my attention before by remarkable roles wherein they slipped effortlessly it seemed into Regional American dialects, especially Gleeson in \"Cold Mountain.\" Their chracters' actions and motives in \"Banshees\" defied analysis time and time again, though Condon's character brought a note of triumph into the story.I've never been to Ireland and am not familiar with true Irish English speech. What held me transfixed was the dialogue here: unlike anything I had heard before. Even when I lost patience and sympathy with the characters' behavior, my ears remained tuned to sound of it. I'll definitely be watching (and listening) to \"Banshees of Inisherin\" again.",

Banshees is one of those movies where I want to talk with others who have seen it and discuss their points of view.The title of my review captures the feel - It's like a play captured expertly on a rugged and beautiful landscape.This may not be for everyone, but I recommend giving it a try and experiencing it for what it is!",

            "content": "The Banshees of Inisherin is equal parts fascinating, hilarious, and brutally dark. A provocative story acted by the best in the business in one of the most beautiful settings in the world cannot disappoint. The idyllic setting is a stunning contrast to the hellish behavior of the characters. Blue waves crash on the rocky cliffs of the Irish shoreline. The characters walk between rock walls to cozy cottages warmed by fireplaces. If nothing else I would've enjoyed this film for the scenery.Like its setting, the world class cast is 100% Irish. Colin Ferrell and Brendan Gleeson team up again and are joined by Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan in this tragicomedy. While Colin Ferrell is outstanding, Barry Keoghan (playing Dominic) was my favorite performance. The way he constantly sways and moves like an ocean bay perfectly represents the innocence and impulse of a young boy. He couldn't help but wear his feelings on his sleeve like a child answering to a cookie theft accusation. Just watch him move in this scene with Kerry's character, Siobhan. You can tell he's making it all up as he goes. And when he washes up on shore, it's thought he must've slipped in as he was an unloved and abused boy who couldn't avoid the rocks wherever he ventured.My favorite part of the film is the plot. It takes the viewer through the darkest caves of the human psyche. The two main characters, Colm and Padraic, each illustrate fascinating psychology.A feud breaks out between the two inseparable men on a remote island. Largely due to no better option, a simpleton who connects suspiciously well with his farm animals and a thinker and musician who idealizes the great artists of history find friendship and enact a routine of heading to the pub to waste away time. One day, Colm abruptly decides he doesn't want to be friends with Padraic because \"he's too dull\" and \"talks for hours about animal poop.\" Padraic, along with the entire gossipy town, are in disbelief and suspect a jest. But when Colm proves his sincerity by threatening, and then following through with, cutting off his fiddle-playing fingers, the audience joins the characters in sheer bewilderment.Why would an old man suddenly reject his long-time best friend? Colm admits Padraic hadn't done anything and was the same person he'd always been. But while the audience searches for an understandable motive, the answer hides in Colm's existential mentality.Colm describes his desire to publish music that generations to come will remember him by. \"Everyone knows Mozarts name.\" He destroys his closest relationship seeking everlasting connection. In an Irish halcyon, Colm's wandering mind conjures up an existential fear of death and loneliness. \"I just have the tremendous sense that time is slipping away from me Padraic. And I think I need to spend the time I have left thinking and composing.\" Like his existence, his cherished friendship with Padraic would also be coming to an end soon. He decides to dedicate himself to music in a last ditch attempt to be loved after he passes.But why the finger? Perhaps his tendency for the abstract, symbolic, and historic drove him to self-mutilate like Vincent Van Gogh. He did what he wanted to become: a famous artist edging on insanity. The gruesome act also materializes his belief that Padraic is preventing him from pursuing music: by cutting the fingers of his playing hand whenever Padraic talks to him proves his point that he must end the relationship in order to play.Padraic illustrates a more relatable human tendency: revenge. A man revered as \"one of life's good guys'' highlights how easily corruptible people are when subjected to emotional pain. As Colm softly but directly tells Padraic he has other interests and no longer wants to be friends, the pain of abandonment slowly deteriorates Padraic into a deceptive, angry murderer. Hurt people hurt people.",

I also like that it's something different to the usual \"message\" that's pushed out by Hollywood studios these days.I personally love films with a \"message\" if it's one that would be tricky to engage mass audiences. Not to say this isn't inclusive because I really believe that every human on earth can relate to this message. It's new and refreshing to our screens, yet nothing new in reality.I understand this won't be everybody's cup of tea, but if you are going into this expecting major comedy like 'In Bruges', you may be disappointed, although that's not to say it isn't funny. At times, I'm laughing to myself at the subtle humour embedded in conversations, almost like a relief from the seriousness of the subject matter.Even though it's an absurd portrayal of a common friendship, it's very easy to believe this is how things really are in any dynamic between people, especailyl when faced with death and lonliness. These feelings make us do crazy things, and even though it's funny, it's also quite sad.",

            "content": "Prior to watching \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" with my wife I had few preconceptions concerning it. All I knew wass that it had been pretty heavily advertised and that there was some generally positive \"buzz.\"We watched it partly due to having been exposed to the advertising and the actors making the rounds of the talk shows....But even more so, we watched it because when we ran across it on Hulu, it was listed as a \"Comedy.\"So, we settled in for some lighthearted \"Irish Comedy\" entertainment. With \"Banshee\" in the title, I was figuring it would have to do with Irish myths/fables/folklore. I figured it might be a little like \"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\" but perhaps less \"stereotypical\" and more aimed at modern audiences than Darby O'Gill which was made back in 1959.I don't think my wife or I laughed even once. It is possible that a nervous giggle may have escaped our lips, but no genuine laughs.After watching it, I finally read some reviews to see what others had to say. I was dumbfounded when one review actually talked about the movie having several \"laugh out loud moments.\"\nWhat movie were those reviewers watching?They all agreed that \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" was a \"Dark Comedy\" and I'll agree wholeheartedly that it was \"Dark.\" Period.I like a lot of Dark Comedies. \"Dr, Strangelove\" is perhaps my favorite. Nuclear Armageddon is certainly a dark topic, but there were many, many laugh out loud moments in \"Dr. Strangelove.\" In recent years, \"Knives Out\" was certainly funny, though \"dark.\"Then there are movies that really push the envelope, like the South Korean movie \"Parasite.\" It is incredibly funny until it spirals into complete tragedy and bloody mayhem. But the entirety of \"Parasite\" is a social commentary on income inequality and related issues.. Everyone should probably watch it once... and that is likely enough for anyone.So, I really can enjoy a dark comedy, but for me \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" was NOT a dark comedy.To its great credit, \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" is superbly acted, beautifully filmed and highly evocative of its setting on an Irish island during the war for independence in the 1920's. It might have worked as a travelogue of an Ireland now past, but all the action takes place in so few locations that it would've felt like a play if they hadn't occasionally had exterior panoramic shots. Aside from the panoramas, the entirety of the movie takes place in or near 3 houses and a pub, with one of the houses shown only briefly once.But, the houses and the pub are beautifully rendered and filmed!!Unfortunately, all the action at these four locations could've been done in maybe 50 minutes of screen time, leaving over an hour of runtime to brood about how not funny it really is.But the acting is GREAT!!!For those that enjoy the movie, the script would also be a highlight.Intellectually, I can enjoy the film as a character study involving friendship and growing old as well as a commentary on the dynamics of a small village. To some extent the film can be viewed as a metaphor for the Irish \"troubles\", which are marked in the film occasionally by the sounds of distant gunfire on the mainland. But that metaphor is limited and doesn't do justice to the centuries long conflict in Ireland. So, in the end the movie is mainly a character study concerning friendship and growing old.Since the end of the friendship occurs early in the movie, I don't think it is much of a spoiler to mention it here. But it does mean that the \"friendship\" part of the movie is really concerning the tragedy of friendship lost.The part about growing old is mainly about one of the many tragedies of age. Since it would be a spoiler to mention the exact element, I won't explain it here. But, the movie does a fair job of examining it.So, for me the movie was more of a tragedy than any form of comedy, dark or otherwise.Perhaps I find no humor in the film because I am old enough to directly understand and empathize with the specific problems the movie discuss.The fact that so many reviewers talked about it as a \"dark comedy\" makes me think that there has been a substantial change, for the worse, in modern sensibilities.In my view, even a young person should be able to view a movie like this and empathize with the characters and the problems they face. If so, their view of the movie would likely be similar to my own, though perhaps with slightly less pathos due to their distance from old age. But nonetheless, the movie should be dark for anyone with empathy.Being able to laugh at this movie seems to me to be a level of disconnectedness bordering on the sociopathic. But in an era where a Presidential candidate can mock the physical disability of a reporter \"in good clean fun\" for many of his supporters, perhaps I should not be surprised.I can understand laughing to keep from crying: I often look for a hidden comedic element in the tragedies of my own life. But when it is someone else's life, I'm only going to laugh at their affliction if and when they do so.... and only if they seem to want me to do so.So, for me \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" is one of a number of movies I can appreciate intellectually as a incredible work of art, but one I would not care to view again. This CAN be a high accolade. I'd put \"Parasite\" and \"Grave of the Fireflies\" both in this category. I think EVERYONE should watch and discuss those movies, not DESPITE them being absolutely emotionally devastating, but because they are. \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" does not rise to that level. But if you are willing to watch a depressing movie to appreciate fine acting, beautiful cinematography and overall craftsmanship, then have at it.If it provokes belly laughs, or laugh out loud moments... please explain it to me. But, don't expect me to agree.",

The film follows the relationship between two men, Padraig and Colm, as it deteriorates due to their differing personalities and expectations. Padraig is portrayed as a simple-minded individual, while Colm is depicted as a introspective and talented fiddle player.The film delves into the themes of loneliness, repressed emotions, and the difficulty of communication, themes that are also explored in other works such as Kelly Reichardt's \"Old Joy\" and Yorgos Lanthimos' \"The Lobster\". Despite a lack of typical filmic spectacle, such as chase scenes or grand speeches, The Banshees of Inisherin effectively employs a slow and deliberate pace to create a sense of isolation and tension. A particularly striking scene in the film sees Colm taking drastic measures to sever ties with Padraig, even at the cost of his own musical abilities.In conclusion, The Banshees of Inisherin is a thought-provoking examination of the fragility of friendship, offering a unique perspective on the difficulties of adult relationships.",

And while the acting by Martin McDonagh and Colin Farrell is brilliant, the ending feels abrupt and chaotic. Perhaps it is a good sign that I wanted more out of the story!I also did feel that the scenes did have interesting transitions. The transitions were frequently filled with scenery of the Irish landscape with Irish folk music playing. Although the scenery and the music were beautiful, it made the scenes feel somewhat disconnected from each other.Overall, the actors/actresses did a wonderful job with their roles, but I felt that the ending didn't fully satisfy what I had hoped for.",

            "content": "A film with deeper meaning that, on the surface level, serves as a powerful and effective metaphor for the Irish Civil War that provides it's backdrop but also seems to ruminate on the concept of loneliness, identity (of oneself and how we're viewed by others) and the general idea of \"being a (good) man\". The slow-burn plot does come off as a little \"artsy-fartsy\" but a pair of outstanding lead performances by Colin Farrell and Kerry Condon power it towards it's compelling directions in the second hour, with extremely good support from Barry Keoghan and a captivating, if unlikeable, character performance from Brendan Gleeson. The direction is full of lots of little moments that I could analyse for hours (when entering Colm's house Padraic places his face in a mask seemingly symbolising the mask the men have been putting on masking true feelings and deeper sadness at their core). I really came to care for the characters (Padraic & Siobhan in particular) and was very moved in some emotional moments with them that I wouldn't want to spoil. Weirdly despite Siobhan's assertion that men's foibles are boring the movie itself didn't seem that way to me, though it does reinforce her view in other, deeper ways (\"You don't care who's being executed?\"). A thing of visual beauty that hides the oppression of the island (another mask?) whilst being a very interesting, well-acted and thoughtful meditation that's certainly not a feel-good movie but doesn't leave me at least feeling depressed or angry, more appreciative and understanding with a sense of wanting to talk more about what I've seen.",

A knowledge of The Seventh Seal might help, or an appreciation of Carter Burwell's efforts on Coen bros. Films. You don't need to know that in real life Brendan Gleeson is an accomplished traditional musician (fiddle). Perhaps the biggest drawback will be a total ignorance of the existence in history of The Irish Civil War 1922-23.I watched The Banshees Of Inisherin with a friend who was oblivious to most of the above; they enjoyed it.This film is about island life. It's parochial in the extreme and wastes no time in exposing the darkest sides of a compressed, incestuous lifestyle on a remote island, off a remote island on the western fringe of Europe.This film is about rejection by one of two very close friends of the other. It's about the reaction and development of that reaction by the spurned party. It leads to a complete and irreconcilable split and reveals in the final scenes the allegory that has been hinted at throughout. On the little island they are re-enacting what is happening across the water. Friend v friend; brother v brother. The Civil war is entering its last stages in 1923 and The Free State army are rounding up the last of the '' irregulars'' in Galway. The war hasn't touched Inisherin but the RIC man turned Civic Guard is happy to take money to attend a firing squad, no matter who was shooting whom.I've studied this period in history extensively ( my dad took part in both The War of Independence and The Civil War in Cork).In my opinion this movie is a masterpiece. I long ago gave up on the Academy as a trustworthy arbiter of cinematic quality. Their list of poor decisions is extensive. Nevertheless, I would love to see the cast and crew rewarded with global recognition for a project that brought me much enjoyment, food for thought and reflection.",

The camera shots of the landscape of the Irish village, the incredibly good acting performances, especially by Colin Farell and Brendan Gleeson (what else could you expect), but also the supporting roles. Barry Keoghan, who plays the role of Dominic Kearney, an insecure, na\u00efve character broken by his environment, is particularly noteworthy.But all this was to be expected in a film by Martin McDonagh anyway.What makes the film so powerful, however, is the unique story and the messages that are so suptily and creatively delivered. Of course, it's about friendship. And the meaning that friendship and the loss of friendship can do to you. But this is only the surface and serves as the basic structure to drive the story forward. Rather more, the story is about what the isolation from the outside world is doing with the character of a human being. A small village, isolated from the outside world. Each citizen is marked by loneliness and by the lack of human relationships and diversity. What happens to a person when he is \"trapped\" in his wasteland all his life without any prospect of love, variety, events. I do not want to reveal too much. But when the only person in the village who still has the desire and openness to the world in her, leaves the village, everything collapses. The people are broken and this is so subtly and incidentally communicated by Martin McDonagh. Be it through the big emotional importance that animals play ( hints of bestiality, the donkey's name is Jenny,...), incredibly funny dialogues and characters that are on the verge of complete madness (the old woman, is she a clairvoyant, a witch or just gone mad?).The great thing about the film is that it has so many interpretations and makes you think, while, by the way, is incredibly funny. It is a must see for everyone who wants to witness a more than clever and funny movie!",

            "content": "Martin McDonagh's The Banshees of Inisherin is an existential black comedy about male friendship and loneliness, which begins with a seemingly trivial plot and absurd situations, but develops in dark tones, towards a violent end and tragedy. The film opened the Auteur Film Festival in Belgrade, where it came after two awards in Venice and critical acclaim. Nevertheless, it is a step backwards for McDonagh.When compared to his previous film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, McDonagh went back to the themes and atmosphere of his early stage plays, such as The Cripple of Inishmaan and The Lieutenant of Inishmore. The Banshees of Inisherin clearly continues this line, taking place on the undeveloped, fictional island of Inisherin during the Irish Civil War.While cannons thunder on land, Inisherin lives its primitive rural life by the ocean. Simple island lad P\u00e1draic S\u00failleabh\u00e1in (Farrell) can't come to terms with the fact that his best friend Colm (Gleeson) no longer likes him and won't sit with him in the local pub. The violinist Colm realized that his time was running out and that in his old age he wanted to dedicate himself to composing, in order to leave a mark behind him, and not to useless chatting with boring Padraic. Padraic's sister Siobhan, played brilliantly by Kerry Condon, is aware of the backwardness of the island and her education, self-awareness and resolute nature emphasize the problems of rural and male stubbornness that do not allow progress and improvement of life.Besides the masterful way in which Farrell, Gleeson and Condon play silly scenes and utterly impossible and absurd dialogue, the atmosphere of rural Ireland in the 1920s is the best element of the film.Director of photography Ben Davis captured the beauty of the landscape of the Irish island in dynamic totals, tracking and crane shots, while we get a sense that under the greenery and rocks and the apparent calm of the ocean live the dark forces of loneliness, cruelty, restlessness and dark banshee demons that herald death. The music is excellent, but not Carter Burwell's original score, too illustrative and ambient, but diegetic Irish folk music performed by Colm or his music students in a pub. This authentic depiction of the music of the Irish countryside during the Civil War is a burst of kinesthesia and life in an otherwise overconstructed film.That's why for McDonagh, at least in my eyes, Banshees of Inisherin is a film of mannerism: this is his In Bruges in the space of his theater. Those who don't mind that mannerism will certainly enjoy the film more.",

This is a film that goes through every emotion from disbelief and frustration, to anger and despair following Colm's decision not to talk to his former friend Padraic, for seemingly no reason at all. The journey is interlaced with some hilariously comical moments, mostly provided by the island simpleton, Dominic, who has experienced an awful childhood himself.Every character from the bar-keep to the island vicar are beautifully portrayed and totally believable, with a special shout-out to Padraic's miniature donkey, Jenny, a role only the Irish would think of.I'm not a believer in fairytale endings and this film would not benefit from an ending where everyone comes up smelling of roses.

So I'm going to limit my review to a discussion of what I think keeps it from really soaring.A quick survey of critics' reviews after watching the film informed me that I was in the minority with my opinion of the tone. The consensus seems to be that writer and director Martin McDonagh has hit upon the perfect balance between comedy and tragedy, which is just baffling to me. I thought a lot of the jokes were tired and the delivery often sitcom-like; both jarred with the sublime atmospherics and the truly thought-provoking motifs. Not only that, but the comedy often serves to demean P\u00e1draic by reducing him to a buffoonish caricature, and to undermine, as a result, the pathos around the character.Deriving humour from a main character's lack of intelligence by having him act like a 50-year-old child does not really work when the entire plot stems from his abandonment by a longtime friend for being \"dull\", a fact that is played for tragic effect at other points in the film. It takes the dignity out of his situation and renders the more poignant scenes ineffective. I think the film, which so often appears to aim at profundity, calls for a different kind and handling of humour.This is not the best comparison, but consider the show 'Fleabag' (its creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge is McDonagh's partner, which is probably why I thought of it). It also mixes comedy and drama but manages to flow much more seamlessly between the two than 'Banshees'. 'Fleabag' may not make claims to the kind of depth that the film does, but it certainly aims to be moving in an authentic and compelling way. Despite its flaws, the show is able to accomplish this with ease, while also being riotously funny, precisely because its humour never undermines the main character, our sympathy for whom drives the tragedy. Granted, she's supposed to be whip-smart (so nothing like P\u00e1draic) but she has other qualities that make her vulnerable to a similar kind of authorial treatment: she sleeps around, plays the clown to her sister's straight man and is kind of a failure in the conventional sense at the point in her life that we know her. Despite all this, the humour never, never turns her into any kind of caricature. No amount of laughing at Fleabag takes away our sense of her as a full human being worthy of respect. What could've been left at the writer gently ribbing P\u00e1draic for his intellectual deficiencies, is taken to a rather crass and shallow place. The film's moments of low humour undercut the tragedy instead of complementing it, while the tragedy, being so effectively wrought, makes the humour genuinely uncomfortable at times.In its two hours, 'The Banshees of Inisherin' brings up an array of interesting ideas. There's the old-as-time fear of one's own mortality, embodied in Colm, who claims to want to focus on his music to have something to be remembered by. There's the question of whether being kind is 'enough' though it can't bring one the immortality that artistic brilliance can. There's also a strong sense of God's abandonment of man, mainly seen through Colm, who has a longstanding problem with \"despair\". The constant picturing of crucifixes, statues of Mary and portraits of Jesus on an island aching with loneliness heightens this sense throughout the film. Colm's self-mutilation has religious echoes as well; self-mutilation used to be a form of penance, but what is Colm punishing himself for? Apart from this, there is an overarching critique of men's emotional incontinence (for which the Civil War serves as a parallel), and how it is not just self-destructive but harmful to everyone around them as well. The only person who gets something of a happy ending is Siobh\u00e1n, P\u00e1draic's brilliant sister, who refuses to bottle up her misery and sit around letting it fester like the men of the film (although P\u00e1draic is a glaring exception there, because he is as expressive as can be).As you can probably tell, the film's intellectual landscape is rich. But, unfortunately, it comes to nought in the end. I've seen the film twice, but I still couldn't tell you what the film has to say about the many ideas it brings up. The best I could think of was: Despair (and not necessarily the religious kind) causes a kind of spiritual death which is contagious. Colm 'infects' P\u00e1draic slowly through the course of the film, ending in the near-complete loss of his humanity as he attempts to burn his former friend alive. But P\u00e1draic's moral turn is unconvincing; when he shows up cheerily to Colm's home the morning after and is genuinely surprised and disappointed to find him alive, you wonder, did he really come here expecting to find Colm's charred body? It just doesn't ring true at all. The open ending that follows only adds to the thematic fuzziness. So many people understood the final scene as giving hope for Colm and P\u00e1draic's friendship, and if that's really the case, my reading's clearly wrong.When a story's threads fail to come together in a satisfying finish, it ends up feeling less like a story than an experience. This is often acceptable in cinema and literature, but the lack of a distinct message or meaning in this film stands out all the more because of its folktale-like structure and premise.So 'The Banshees of Inisherin', on balance, makes for an incredibly exhilarating but far from flawless experience.",

While I do have some personal issues with this movie (ones I won't say in order to keep this spoiler free), I think this was a great movie regardless and I would definitely recommend it.",

This film explores many different genres; comedy, horror, drama, and many more. The casting is excellent- including BAFTA nominee \u2018Barry Keoghan\u2018 and \u2018Brendan Gleeson' (best known for his performance in the Harry Potter franchise as Mad Eye Moody) The film is a metaphor of the troubles of the Irish throughout the civil war hence the slight references used throughout the film. Overall an amazing film which I highly recommend to anyone over 15 (I wouldn't have wanted to watch it any younger!!)",

There are no banshees, no one dies -no plot, action or meaningful family interactions -nothing to mourn or be sad about -just a cranky old man who is into hurting others and self-harm.

When the normal is pathological, the pathological is normal.\n\nDuring the Civil War murder and violence became so normalised that the pathological became normal, which was one reason the Irish Garda Siochana was created as an unarmed force, to use its moral authority in the first, rather than force of arms, to delegitimise the use of the gun to settle all disputes, and to grab land, as happened wholesale for example in Co. Kerry, where brothers slew brothers and father sons, in an orgy of insane and vicious violence, each side driven to out-do the other in a game of rock paper scissors; where vendetta and revenge was tempered with piety and the innate compassion also of the Irish, that even when committing acts of atrocity there is still space for morality; where cruelty and the innate ability to turn a blind eye to it that characterises Ireland in the 20th and other centuries, was institutionalised and affected every aspect of life right down to the treatment of the most vulnerable.  \n\nThis film encapsulates the madness in its narrative, as two friends take it to the bridge in increasing games and levels of obduracy, bloody-mindedness, hurt, personal offence, and by the end, the sheer hell of it, wrecking not just their own lives but those of others around them. A great and indirect metaphor for the Irish Civil War, which like just about anything inconvenient and likely to 'rock the boat' is traditionally brushed under the carpet in Ireland, in line with what Michael Davitt called one of the twin curses of Ireland, the national Moral Cowardice.  \n\nEverything just works in this film. The light (of course, it's Irish light which is unique in its magical luminescence) and the use of reflection; which is what this film is very subtly all about; the dramatic scenery, the beautiful backdrop to literally centuries of horror, exploitation, starvation, emigration, depopulation, mercilessness, viciousness, and all crammed under a veneer of piety with its roots in a religious ceremony that is meaningless in the incomprehensibility of language and ritual, once so much it had to be partially concealed behind a rood screen as were the crimes of myriad child abusers in clerical garb likewise concealed in plain sight.  As Christy Moore once sang ''Everybody knew/  But nobody said.''  Ireland's problems in a nutshell.  AND of course the acting, which is uniformly excellent.\n\nDrink, religion, sexual frustration and abuse, combined with two-facedness, cruelty, bloody-mindedness, all the usual and well founded tropes, serve to convey a sort of logical descent into madness that echoes the Civil War seizing the country generally, in an Atlantean outpost of eccentricity and conformity, where power is abused by Church and State to maintain the population in a general state of infantilism and idiocy just as it was on the mainland, ''Christ'' ferried across on a Galway Hooker in the form of the prieshteen, fat complacent and resplendent in the power of his dog-collar, embraced by ''Caesar'': the corrupt local Garda sergeant, a former member of ''the national movement'' who was brutalised by the killing he did during the War of Independence and now brutalises in turn his son and those whom incur his displeasure..hand in glove.  \n\nSo it goes, and so it is today as well, so long as the Irish keep telling themselves and everyone who will listen convenient lies to avoid the pain of confronting the truth.  I write this as a former/ex-Irish Citizen, so if my criticism is harsh, it is also just and this film reflects better than any I've ever seen, the problems that beset this country and which only the Irish themselves can ever fix, but that won't be today nor tomorrow.

Themes such as friendship, ambition and loneliness are present in the story, which might feel slow at times, but it is elevated by the incredible cast performances: Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan are just outstanding. Some scenes are plain funny, while others are quite melodramatic, which makes it a nice balance. Also, Carter Burwell's score is hauntingly beautiful!

It wasn't the happiest of movies and my wife and friends who watched it with me, were like, 'this is so weird'!! But we talked about it for two days after, so it had an impact.",

It was a wonderful metaphor for the pointlessness of the Irish war but don't go into it thinking you're going to walk away feeling anything but upset.",

Gunshots are within hearing across the water throughout the movie. As one reviewer sums it up, \"Through their in-fighting, they destroyed themselves.\" We've all seen and maybe even been in relationships like that between people and between peoples. A visitor from another planet at any era in our history might shake its head at our folly with dismay\u2014\"you all make no sense\"\u2014just as we do while watching this movie. \n\nWatching with compassion for the characters\u2014and the excellent acting does invite empathy\u2014I'm left longing for all such stupidity and unnecessary misery to end once and for all. \n\nAny great tragedy has a similar impact. I'm left looking into my own heart. In this case, I might ask, Where do I sabotage myself? Where do I undermine my own chances to experience happiness and contribute to the well-being of others? In what ways have I been blind to being my own worst enemy, and what has the impact been on others?\n\nIf even a few people come away from the movie with that kind of soul-searching, it deserves whatever prizes it may get.",

And they do take over here. Every character in this movie is somewhat of an island (ironic, because they are living on a small, isolated island!), left to search for meaning and belonging on their own, and some fare better than others.\n\nIt's a dark comedy, emphasis on dark, with plenty of tragedy thrown in for balance. Gleeson's and Farrell's characters resolve for the paths they have chosen are well balanced by more hopeful characters placed around them, played by Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan.\n\nThe conflict feels like an eternal human conflict, yet also feels timely and pressing for today, as isolation is so present in our searches for meaning and belonging.\n\nThe fictional isle of Inisherin provides a beautiful, threatening, lonely backdrop for this story, heightening the emotions our characters feel. And the banshees - well, they're not real. But their presence looms large regardless.",

It's certainly McDonagh's perfect screenplay. The master of dark comedy takes it deeper into tragicomedy with this one. The story is profound. One viewing only takes away one layer.  The dissolution of both men comes  to a gut punch at the end. Fans have filled YouTube with debates for weeks now about the layers of meaning here. The metaphors, the foreshadowing, the symbolism. It's wonderful to read all the interpretations.\nIf the tragedy of the story gets you down, you are not seeing the gallows humor peppered throughout. We saw it twice in a theater and the audience \ud83d\ude06 as the hilarious scenes were weaved into the sorrowful ones. This really is a masterpiece. And the 4 performances are absolutely extraordinary. All four nominated by every awards groups. As is McDonagh for directing and screenplay. This is truly a must-see. At least twice. The Irish brogue is much clearer too.\u263a\ufe0f We've streamed it four more times since November and are still chewing on it.  Best film of 2022.",

            "content": "Acclaimed playwright and director Martin McDonagh delivers another masterful ensemble piece to audiences with his latest film \"The Banshees of Inisherin\". The black comedy reunites leads Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson with McDonagh, who directed them both in his 2008 Oscar-nominated film \"In Bruges\". After it's world premiere at this year's Venice International Film Festival, the film went on to receive a rapturous 15-minute standing ovation, five minutes longer than McDonagh's previous film \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\". \n\nThe film takes place in 1920s Ireland, against the backdrop of the Irish Civil War, on the fictional island of Inisherin and tells the story of two friends P\u00e1draic (Farrell) and Colm (Gleeson). One day, Colm decides to abruptly end his long-running friendship with P\u00e1draic, claiming the man is \u2018too dull' for him to spend the rest of his life around. An escalating battle then begins between the two friends, and it soon becomes the talk of the village, with many just as confused as P\u00e1draic with Colm's decision. As the growing tensions between the two grow, it's not long before it boils over and results in devastating consequences for both feuding men. \n\nColin Farrell leads an uber-talented cast comprised of some of Ireland's greatest talents like Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon, and Barry Keoghan, all delivering knockout performances. Farrell's work is almost certain to land him a spot in this year's Best Actor line-up as he plays P\u00e1draic, the harmless easy-going farmer, until he finally snaps and becomes a ruthless man out for revenge, and perhaps that's what makes his performance so fascinating to watch unfold on the big screen. The friendship Farrell shares with his co-star Brendan Gleeson elevates both performances making them feel much more authentic and believable. The pair share a hilarious back and forth that's embellished by McDonagh's screenplay. Gleeson's role as Colm, a man who finds himself in the later years of his life wishing to be more creative, and have more interesting conversations with those around him, is terrific and perfectly compliments Farrell's performance. The film's other standout performance, alongside Farrell's, comes from Kerry Condon. The Irish actress, probably best known for voicing \u2018Friday' in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, gives a marvellous turn as P\u00e1draic's sister, Siobhan. Condon ends up acting as a mediator between the two men, trying to keep them apart to prevent Colm from resorting to drastic action. Condon boosts every scene she's in to a whole other level and she ends up being one of the best parts of the film. \n\nDirector Martin McDonagh pens a screenplay that balances side-splitting hilarity with tear-jerking emotion and reminds you exactly why he has two Oscar-nominations for writing under his belt. It's sharp, witty, and brilliantly tells the story of what happens when a friendship turns sour. McDonagh does a skilful job blending the comedic tones at the start of the film with the tragedy and drama that becomes more dominant towards the end. This balance, combined with McDonagh's sensational directorial effort, makes \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" such a unique and entertaining film. Perhaps what else makes the film so good, and sets it apart from a large majority of this year's awards contenders, is that it isn't an intricate biopic about a famous figure or some overbearing think piece, but is instead a rich, amusing film about friendship. \n\n\"The Banshees of Inisherin\" brings some delightful visuals to the screen alongside the engaging narrative and likeable characters. Cinematographer Ben Davis, who worked with McDonagh on \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\", uses the scenic Irish coastlines to his advantage to effortlessly enhance the natural beauty of the film.",

That is, until that moment. For reasons unknown, Colm wants nothing more to do with Padriac. \"I just don't like you anymore\" Colm offers. The calendar shows \"April 1, 1923\", and Padriac doesn't take this unexplained change of behavior by Colm very well... At this point we are 10 min into the movie.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the highly anticipated reunion of writer-director Martin McDonagh, and lead performers Farrell and Gleeson, 14 years after the now classic \"In Bruges\". I too was eager to see how this reunion would play out, but then something completely unexpected happened: I found the Colin Farrell character to be irritating and off-putting, to the point where it was almost too much to bear or see. Without spoiling anything, I will say that things are somewhat better in the movie's second hour. But I could never get into the proper flow of the movie, let alone rave about it as many others have done. I completely understand that my viewpoint is definitely in the minority. And that this film has been hailed critically (it's currently rated 97% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). The most striking thing about the movie for me was the strong performance of Barry Keoghan (who starred in \"Dunkirk\" a few years back). This is a subjective opinion of course.\n\n\"The Banchees of Inisherin\" premiered at this year's Venice Film Festival to universal acclaim, and opened in theaters in November. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was attended okay (I counted about 15 people). If you are a fan of Martin McDonagh's earlier work of or Colin Farrell or Brendon Gleeson, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",

            "content": "A movie with clear award aspirations. I'd submit it succeeded. \nThe essential ingredients of this movie are excellent. A fantastic and interesting screenplay. Top caliber acting throughout from the leads to smaller side characters. Beautifully shot and wonderfully composed. Atmospheric and engaging. It is difficult to fault any of those classic ingredients. Uniformly of high-quality top to bottom. \nThe second piece is how well do the essential parts come together. Sometimes a movie is less than the sum of its parts, or an Oscar winning performance is all a piece really offers amongst other flaws. I think this movie attains the clich\u00e9 of being more than the sum of its great pieces. The movie has a simple and, in some ways, predictable narrative start and end. The meat of this journey though is built on a deeply strange turn and a bit of a quirky premise. The main characters, we are led to believe, were once good friends, or at least spent much time together.   One day the smarmy tortured genius (Gleeson, born to be that character) decides his time is better spent not hanging around the dim-witted nice fellow (Farrell). He wants to be remembered with his music, not the friendships of people who will die. The genius let's the dullard know as much, and he takes the news not well , with confusion and hurt. Our dull man, you see, just strives to get along. The genius' plan, creative and full of that smarm, is to mutilate himself every time our nice dull person offends his decision to be left alone. It is extreme and seems remarkably odd for our supposed once great friends.\nI do not profess to know enough about the nitty gritty details of the Irish Civil War, which is the period, setting and backdrop of this film. I am not sure you need to know a lot to surmise that a civil war about how to settle a treaty, where the past allies of an independence war turn on one another, has many parallels to this story. I am not sure the point of the movie is that. I think the theme is more universal and emotional. In Irish tradition, I think the point is exploring people surrounded, consumed, and trapped by their grief and loneliness. \nYou never get the full details of the main characters backgrounds, except for Dominic, played with a measured and wonderful performance by Barry Keoghan. We know the sources of Dominic's pain rooted in abuse and torment. The other characters we can guess, but it's clear no one here has a healthy life path. Only one character, Siobhan (a brilliant performance by Kerry Condon), the dull man's sister escapes the trappings of the island. Even that act of escaping, helps bring about the ruin of those still inside. \nThe great trick of the movie, at least in my view, is how the measured actions of the characters lead to their unravelling without them intending it to happen.  There is some element of dessert in the result, but the end here lacks the usual trapping of karma. The end isn't poetic justice of obvious choices leading to that end, but relatable mistakes rooted in grief. In my mind, that is why it is so incredibly fascinating to watch. \nThe things we discover post break up is the flaws of our characters, revealed, or maybe caused by the split. We discover that our genius, as revealed in a bar scene with the dull man's truly brilliant sister, might not be the Mozart in waiting he hopes. Our dull nice man might also not be so nice when pushed by confusion, guilt and isolation. Our dullard lies to a man, with a splash of comedic innocence, as part of a plan to win back his smart friend. The ripple effects of the two sides respective choices become vast, dark and lead to deep lasting scars in the community of Inisherin. The dull man's choices dissolution his vulnerable friend, Dominic and speed about his own consumption by grief. The smart man's disregard for feelings or normal social concern has disastrous results when he, without any overt malice, kills Farrell's last remaining companion, Jenny, the donkey. This is the last straw from the hurt dull man who thereafter escalates the feud past the point of return. Whose fault is all this pain? Hard to say, probably no one and everyone. \nMaybe that is the nature of grief and stubborn isolation. It consumes and destroys everything around it, even if you don't mean it to, maybe even if you mean the opposite. I am not sure the smart man's hope to be left alone was all that sinister. Nor were the dull man's hopes to keep his friend all that wrong. The irony being both characters complemented each other in so many ways.",

            "content": "Wow\n\nI haven't felt so completely absorbed and thought provoked in a cinema, in a very, very long time, perhaps ever. The Banshees of Inisherin delivers a mind blowing analysis on the breaking of a friendship and the war between two personalities, that is a tragic and brilliant metaphor for the war between enemies, in this case specifically the Irish civil war. \nOutstandingly performed by the lead roles, the characters in Banshees are all so complex and powerful, that you completely forget that you have seen the talented actors who play them before, and feel convinced you are looking at authentic people in real life. I did not see Brendan Gleeson for most of the movie, after about 10 seconds of him on screen, I only saw Colm. \nIn praise of subtle performance I was while watching this movie. Pauses between lines and full ranges of emotions expressed in silent facial expressions transform the simplest of conversation topics in the movie, into full blown literary scenes.\nEven side characters like the priest, the cop, and Dominic, are all in there own, such crucial and full people, despite how little time they might share next to the leads Glesson, Farrel, and Condon.\n\nWhat an incredible effect this comedic and dramatic writing had on the audience. While feeling tense and petrified throughout the movie, you also find yourself laughing at moments right through until the end. It is one of the many aspects that makes it feel jarring, and it somehow lightens the load of the story, which makes what is happening feel somewhat normal. The leads, while committing and observing such disturbing acts, stay civil. It brings it back from a horrific violent tragedy, and makes it feel like a simple fight between friends again. It allows us to observe the breakup of this friendship in a more sound way, despite the gruesome undertones and imagery.\n\nI hope I am making sense, but the movie, in doing this, becomes a perfect metaphor for war. For example, in a war, one hundred people could die in a battle, and then the war can end the next day, and suddenly everything would be alright between the two parties. The armies captains could shake hands and go their separate ways, as if no-one was killed, all sense of morality is lost. The result of the war, being a destruction of each party, because neither would stop.\nThat is what is mainly represented by The Banshees of Inisherin, the complete loss of morality, with the disregard of destroying ones self. Colms character has no remorse about ending the friendship and cutting off his fingers as a message, just as Padraic has no remorse over carrying on talking to Colm, despite Colms self harm.\nBoth parties, just like in war, will end up destroying themselves. Colm loses his ability to play music, the only reason he started this dark journey, and Padraic loses his sister. Again a synonym for what he was trying to preserve by carrying on - a loving connection. Padraic also loses his \u2018niceness', another aspect of life that was important to him, which brings me to the cause of the battle, and the question asked by it.\n\nWhat is more important, niceness and everyday deeds that those around you can appreciate, or leaving a mark on the world, whatever the cost, that people will appreciate for centuries? That is the question The Banshees of Inisherin asks us. What is interesting however is that we never see the desired result for either of the characters efforts, we never hear Colms song played in full, representing that it did not have an everlasting affect that Colm intended to, instead the movie focused on his grotesque self mutilation, leaving an everlasting sense of damage of himself and their friendship. That is what Colm achieved. Padraic never achieved exhibiting niceness as he intended to, instead we focus on his drive to harm, first emotionally, then physically, and the lasting theme is his angry nature.\n\nIn the end The Banshees of Inisherin is an incredible metaphor for war and battle, and it is a culmination of themes that when put together, will leave you dazed, and in awe of the human nature.",

Loved and despised in equal doses, \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" nevertheless is rewarding cinema. Set solely on the gloriously green rolling knolls of a cute island (sit down tourists, no such place) where the rain only sprinkles at night, the muffled sounds of revolutionary shots fired are at a safe distance on the mainland, and the locals gather daily at the local pub. All seems idyllic in the charming farming community, until a long-standing friendship is suddenly disrupted. Forget small town, this is a small island, where everyone not only knows everyone, but appear to have no will to escape. \n\nThe break-up, abrupt, congenial, silent, eats away at a confused Padraic (Colin Farrell and his expressive eyebrows). A simple man, his confusion and childlike determination to mend matters with the stoic and complicated Colm (Brendan Gleeson) is rife with comedic tension, until, well, until things get way out of hand.\n\nThe battle of wills takes on an unsavoury, physical bent that becomes the knife twist in the film. One which tests an audiences' mettle. An allegory for the warring factions on the horizon, the odd couples' relationship runs the gamut of absurd to horrific. A tragic comedy that delivers more victims than victors. \n\nFarrell and Gleeson are superb, bringing plenty of grand ideas to the table - the regiment of life, the role of friendship, reinventing oneself, the cuffs of relationships, unrequited love, vengeance, and mortality. Plus a bunch more. Sunny yet dark. Do a favour with a viewing.\n\n-\thipCRANK",

It centers around the titular islands off of Ireland, during their Civil War. Not many will realize after watching this film that Ireland boasts one of the most thriving modern economies, and that despite the border which enshrouds its legacy there are only 18% of the Irish counties within that district which rebel against the Christian doctrine. My aunt and uncle are members of a local traditional Irish music band and play at bars frequently within the area. Directly from them, I learned about Riverdance and the culture of Gaelic traditions. My uncle plays the Irish flute, and my aunt plays the fiddle. The problems with this movie are major, however. The violence with Gleeson really overshadow the meaningfulness which was intended for the film. They could have done away with some of the violent imagery. As a fan of horror movies, even I was taken aback by the scenes when they had very little payoff and even smaller plot building around them. Other parts of the movie remind me of Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven, but with even more authenticity. Also subtracting from the film were superstar Colin Farrel's spray tan. How could a man on the islands of Ireland use so much spray tan? His performance was on par, but his often-confused facial expressions did little to enhance the script. Barry Keoghan was underutilized, I thought, yet brought a lot more to the movie than Farrel and his overutilized sister. The movie perpetuates myths about Ireland which could have been chiseled away at, I thought. However, it was an enjoyable, lighthearted movie with its hands just on too many deep pockets of emotion to hold together perfectly. Had it been a little simpler with violence, and a little less overacted by Farrel, it could have been golden. Also, I thought there were supposed to be banshees? Where's the banshees?",

As a movie it's a quite interesting insight into Irish countryfolks' mentality and if you have a knack for Black British humor, there are quite some giggles and even the occasional good laughs, but the macabre aspect of the whole script is generally perturbing making it a movie which in the end leaves you with quite a sour/bitter taste in your mouth unless you enjoy the extremely morbid. It's quite enjoyable in parts while being extremely upsetting in others. If you watch it you don't win much, and if you don't there is really nothing lost. It's surely not a flick that deserves an Oscar though Colin Farrell might actually do. 5/10",

The story was incredibly slow, and although I liked it more towards the end, just didn't do much for me. The humor in the movie is good though, as there were definitely moments that elicited a chuckle. And again, I liked all the performances in the movie and got upset towards the end when Jenny died. But this movie just didn't do it for me. It was too slow paced for my liking.

You had incredible acting by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson.  These two can make even bad writing interesting their acting was A+ these two are the rare actor who can play a tough guy, a nice guy, a funny guy most actors are pigeonholed to one kind of character. I don't think there is any role these two could not only take on the role but succeed at the highest level with it. To watch two of this generation's greatest actors I would recommend this film. Again the writing won't win you over but you will believe these two are the characters they are playing and that in itself is worth watching.",

I think this is a setting where things are very likely to go wrong, and where people could slowly enter a state of lunacy.

One suddenly decided he no longer wished the other spoke to him, but when the other friend continued, he threatened to mutilate his own fingers each time his friend gets in touch with him. His friend thinks that was a bluff but soon finds 5 severed fingers at his door step. One finger ends up choking up his donkey and killing it. Enraged at his dead donkey, he burns up the house of his friend who mutilated his own fingers hoping he would die there. Friend with self mutilated fingers doesn't die but suddenly seem to appreciate the guy who burnt down his house and stars talking to him again. Well that's all folks, that is the story. Something that everyone will appreciate is that Colin Ferrell is best suited for his character due to his naturally dumb looks",

The removing of a finger, and then all fingers of Colm's hand signified to me how in the war, Ireland was administering harsh and unthinkable punishments on it's own people. The way Padraic went from being the nicest, friendliest (but a little dull) to being a mean and dangerous person (but still loved animals) spoke to me on how the conflict turned some good, everyday people bad, making them do horrible things themselves. I think the fact everyone still loved animals proved they were good people, but just lost and confused by circumstances. The dreadful police office - said a lot about authority.  The publican - everyone's friend. The snoopy general store owner, the sister - smarter than the lot of them, plus comradery v's the loneliness & sadness, the need for human connection and of cause the scenery - spectacular.

Farrell sometimes oversimplifies, like when pronouncing Beethoven so wrong that it loos ridiculous, but it doesn't happen that often and it certainly doesn't kill the story. Too obvious, theatric scenes could have also been reduced in intensity, but overall I believe the film to be of exceptional quality in its ideas, and the way they are presented, which is concise, but open enough to let the viewer add their own interpretation. \nThis is a film to watch with full attention. I often found myself rewinding to check a transition, or to re-appreciate and reaffirm the quality of the soundtrack, which is masterfully conceived as a feeling enhancer.\nNature, the mind of an animal, god, death, human existence, music, art, truth and justice, love and magic, are all elements present in this film. I recommend watching it.\n\nEdit: I read some of the reviews after writing this, and certainly didn't took this film as a comedy. It does have some really good, satisfying moments that would belong to the sort of ideal world typically depicted in comedy: the moments where the policeman gets what he deserves, for instance.

            "content": "\"I don't like ya anymore.\" This simple gut punch is the spark that accelerates the chain of events that lead to self-mutilation, arson, and a dead donkey. The setting is the verdant fictional Irish island of Inisherin during the 1923 Irish Civil War \u2014 though none of that violence makes its way to the island, it's close enough that explosions can be heard from its shores. The day-to-day is almost fantastically Gaelic-bucolic \u2014 leading animals to pasture, writing elegiac songs for the violin, downing the same dark beer in the same dark pub. P\u00e1draic (Colin Farrell) goes to heard his (supposed) friend, Colm (Brendan Gleeson) to the pub for their 2:00pm ritual. It's only back at the pub \u2014 and only after Colm treats P\u00e1draic like a ghost \u2014 that Colm informs P\u00e1draic that he no longer wants to speak to him. Not even a little. The Banshees of Inisherin is ripe with wholesome one-liners that are simple, yet witty. Both characters are gems \u2014 and somehow, the two most stubborn men in all of Ireland ended up on the same little island. Colm wants to \"leave something behind\" in the form of a song and finds P\u00e1draic to be an aimless distraction keeping Colm from cementing his legacy. P\u00e1draic just enjoys \"good, normal chattin\" \u2014 you can tell that his little home with his sister, his animals (especially, his beloved donkey named \"Jenny\"), and his chats at the pub with friends is satisfying life enough. You can understand both characters and if either just gave an inch (a hint, perhaps), they could both get what they wanted from each other. There are so, so many fantastic moments in this movie, but I keep finding myself returning to P\u00e1draic's defense of \"niceness\". Barry Keoghan plays Dominic, a young lad who is beaten by his abusive father (Gary Lydon), seemingly the only police officer on the island. Keoghan possesses the ability to act using solely the bottom half of his face \u2014 it's something about the jaw. I first noticed it in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and it's even more pronounced here. I'm not sure I've ever seen anything like it before. **SPOILER ALERT** If there's one screenshot that captures the film, it's Colm conducting his troupe with a fingerless left hand, blood spattering across the sheet music on the pub table, with a dejected P\u00e1draic standing over his shoulder in the background, having just entered the establishment. I have some catching up to do with 2022 movies, but as I write this, The Banshees of Inisherin is my favorite of the year and Best Film choice for the Oscars.",

Was a good example of the attention to detail when it came to making the speaking parts as authentic as possible.\n\nThe most noteworthy part about this movie, for me, is Colin Farrells unexpectedly brilliant performance. Not unexpected because I don't expect brilliance from him, but he was outstanding in this role and as someone who wasn't too hot on 'In Bruges', that came as a surprise. \n\nGleeson is equally great and menacing with his own peculiar intent. The whole mix gives you an idea of small island life in the time of the Irish civil war, although it doesn't play much of a part in the film.\n\nI give this movie 91%, I'd say 95-96%, but I think I'd have gone with a slightly different ending which could have perfected it for me.",

To say the movie is dark and depressing is an understatement. These are about a group of Irish living on there small island off the coast of Ireland, where there's not much to do except go to church, hit the pub, usually at 2 p.m. every afternoon, and talk about the same things over and over again. Or talk about trivial things over and over again . . . so much so that one character simply ends a friendship because he no longer can listen to the man's palaver. In fact, he's willing to cut off a finger at a time to convince his ex-friend (Colin Farrell) that he no longer can stand his company. These are people who are stuck in their loneliness and do not have the \"inner resources\" to deal with their isolation from one another as well as themselves. Even some of the farm animals, particularly a miniature donkey, get  caught up in the darkness that seems to be everywhere. (Also of note, at least in terms of the way the film uses a Bergmann-like symbol in the dress and speech of an old woman they call the Ghoul; a Fellini-like symbol comes in the occasional explosion of cannon fire to the east of a \"war\" or rebellion that is due to cease any day now.) I did like this move, though honestly I doubt I'll ever sit through it again. Just about every aspect, great or small, about this movie rings true in most of our lives. Loneliness, the inarticulation of isolation that leads to rage--or the quiet moment where you either go mad and harm yourself . . . or take it out on anything you can get your hands on in the moment.",

But other than Siobahn, almost everyone in the story seems to be on Colm's side---even though he's clearly out of his mind and is a man who goes out of his way to be cruel.\n\nThe movie could have gone broader with the humor, or been a more serious examination of the issues above.

Which perhaps also deserves a star, perhaps that's what it's supposed to do.\n\nThe scenery is gorgeous, long quiet shots, perfect for a grey Sunday afternoon in January. The score is elegant and unassuming, not at all pushy into your ears, but comes in assertively at exactly the right moments, ranging from traditional Irish folk music to opera and 1920s jazz. You're eyes or ears won't feel full, too full, visuals and sounds are just right, tactful.\n\nThe dialogue is as sparse, but as just right. People say the things need saying, although as a 21st century person with a couple of years of therapy under your belt you want to prescribe everyone a few months of group therapy to just learn how to talk to each other. But that's not the point of the film of course. There's charm in dysfunction to (if we don't have to experience it).\n\nThe acting is amazing, doesn't feel like acting at all, and Farell's hurt face that shows the pained bafflement of his character who just doesn't get what's going on, why his world is falling apart -- it's deeply moving. There's also some gentle comedy of manners with the worldly priest, evil policeman, gossipy shop owner, witchy old woman. All this is fun and deserves the label of comedy. But mostly this is *not* a comedy.\n\nApart from the allegory/allusions to the Irish Civil War  -- which I didn't entirely get as a non-Irishperson with limited knowledge about the post-1916 Ireland(s) -- the film shows how depression leaks into life poisoning those around you. If you don't do anything about it. That said from someone with medium depressive symptoms. The character of Colm projects his fears of death and despair at a meaningless life onto his former best friend, punishing Padraic for his own inability or unwillingness to engage with his issues. Padraic feels like a rug has been snatched from under his feet and refuses to accept his best friend's rejection. It's like a sudden unexpected break-up and it's insanely painful to watch Padraic's world unravel, and him lose his core kindness. \n\nPadraic gives a lovely speech on the value of kindness before everything, and this was touching and precious. People are also extremly bonded with their animals, which also offers some saving graces to this bleak and depressing film - yet enjoyable! If you know it's going to be emotionally tough, slowly unfolding, and leaving you feeling miserable and glad that it's over, you can actually enjoy it, and allow yourself space to experience difficult uncomfortable emotions.\n\nWe came out discussing the film, both feeling it was very good and very terrible at the same time. We still keep talking about it, and I've never been on rotten tomatoes but came here to talk about the film. So. It's a good film. In the manner of old, of greek Tragedy. It's work. Entertainment and work. As it should be",

Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson work so well together which is ironic because it's a movie about them not working well together. I mean what a great way to tell a story of depression and mental illness. This movie is a lot funnier than I was expecting until it takes a dark turn and then continues to take dark turns as you go on. The levels of escalation to the friendship issue are absurd. Kerry Condon is just as good as the boys if not better, really making a large part for herself in this story. Barry Keoghan really knows how to just melt into a role! His character is so different from any role of his I've seen before and a great role it is. Gary Lydon and Jon Kenny are wonderful supporting actors who give so much life to this island where it would be otherwise \"dull\". Sheila Flitton plays such an interesting character that adds a great level of mystery to the story. I loved seeing that the animals got an acting credit in this, the animals of the movie are fantastic and interact with the actors and the environment so well. And they're just so darn precious. I get why I've only heard good things about this movie and I'm really excited to see what Oscar nominations this will have and what it can win, this is going to be a very tough year because it's been such a great year. The Banshees of Inisherin is definitely going to be the top of a lot of lists for very good reason. From the acting and score to the excellent directing and the execution of that direction. This film is a beautiful story of mental illness set to the background of the Irish Civil War that just works on every level. I would definitely recommend giving this 10/10 of a movie a watch, I currently have it ranked at 6 for the year but we'll see what happens. Hop onto HBO Max and decide for yourself though. -Tyler.",

Martin McDonagh makes films of greatness and this one might be his best yet. Set in 1923 on a remote island off the coast of Ireland it follows 4 people essentially. Padraic, a farmer, and his sister Siobhan. Colm, a musician and the younger Dominic, a dim lad from a troubled home. One day Colm tells Padraic that their friendship is over, instructing him to not speak to him again. Padraic is naturally bewildered. Even more so when Colm threatens to start cutting his fingers off if he is spoken to. It transpires that Colm is bored by life and Padraic's conversation. He wants more, he needs more. Set against the backdrop of the Irish Civil War, this film is about internal civil wars. It's about depression and loneliness and the tenuous bonds of friendship. Like McDonagh's other films, and plays, it is wickedly funny but also incredibly moving and at times desperately sad. Not a frame is wasted and even though it can be bleak at times it looks truly magnificent, showing off the beauty of the island setting. The score aids this beautifully too and the performances are just superb. Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell are in career best form, whilst Kerry Condon is special as the sister who also desires more. And Barry Keoghan steals every scene he appears in. A film that rewards in every way possible.",

            "content": "As a huge fan of \"In Bruges\" and \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\", I was excited to see Martin McDonagh's \"The Banshees of Inisherin\". The film exceeded my expectations, not only because it feels more mature and focused in its storytelling than McDonagh's previous works, but also because it is more character driven and strikes the perfect balance between tragedy, human foibles, and acerbic, laugh-out-loud humor. This is quite the dark, cynical story to be sure, but at times I was cracking up at the behavior and motivations of the characters.\n\nTwo life-long best friends, played by Colin Farrell (in what might be his best performance to date) and Brendan Gleeson, live on the small Irish island of Inisherin and hit up the local pub every day at 2 p.m. Life is rather dull and everyone is privy to everyone else's business - you know, the typical small-town mentality and lack of boundaries. When Colm (Gleeson) decides to abruptly end his friendship with P\u00e1draic (Farrell), the two become slowly disheveled and destructive.\n\nThe movie explores the deterioration of a friendship, but more so the reasons why people will self-destruct, and is a metaphor for the Irish Civil War. I loved the allegorical undertones in the movie such as the personification of Death in one particular character and all of the death motifs throughout. It's a movie that seems simple at first, but once you peel back all the layers, it's deeply poignant, sad, and packs an emotional wallop.",

But in this movie, it just seems abusive to the viewer.\n\nI loved the first 2/3 of the same writer's \"In Bruges.\" Then it was ruined by another needlessly cruel and traumatizing plot development, the graphic murder of a young boy.\n\nLife's too short, people.",

This is such an interesting project when it comes to tone, a tragicomedy in a pastoral setting that deals with one man's sense of purpose and accomplishment clashing with another's contentment with simplicity; neither of them are necessarily wrong or unreasonable in their desires by principle alone, but their beliefs are now fundamentally irreconcilable, leading to conflict. The acting from both Gleeson and Farrell is so sincere, it really conveys what we don't see (the supposed years of sincere friendship, and the resolution of Gleeson's Colm) through the reactions that each deliver to the slightly absurdist premise - there are moments of great humor as Farrell's P\u00e1draic tries to mimic what he thinks Colm wants to see, some emotional authenticity or sophistication that he has never had any use for, only to be faced with metaphorical doors being slammed harder and harder in his face. The dog dragging the shears out of Colm's house is brilliant, a moment of almost slapstick levity in a scene that has a guillotine hanging above it in terms of potential self-harm and P\u00e1draic's inevitable desolation. One of the most character-driven films to come out in 2022. \n\nIt's a bit funny seeing Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell back together again, because In Bruges also had the pair opposite one another with one threatening himself with bodily harm to deter the other. Instead of a gun, this time it's sheep shears. (4.5/5)",

The jilted friend pushes back and wants to resume their relationship, but the older guy cuts off his own finger as a symbol of how serious he is about never speaking with his old friend again. It goes downhill fast from there and devolves into a mess of stupid scenes and idiotic dialogue, culminating in an incomprehensibly moronic ending.

I would not recommend this movie to anyone as it seems pointless. It is well constructed, well acted, but the metaphor/allegoric vessel is just so ugly and unnecessary.\nSummary: Tedious and depressing, makes one simple point and takes 90 mins longer than necessary making it.",

            "content": "Spoilers: It happens on an unreal island, so that tips the hand. And it devolves into a black comedy, with self-mutilation, suicide, farm animals inside the house, arson, police brutality, and people with no apparent means of support, like jobs. At first, we think it is a better place, this island off the Irish west coast, a hundred years ago during the Irish civil war, enough so that they can see the mainland and hear explosions and even see smoke, so the war is raging. But the irony is that these off the beaten path people find ways to get into mischief and trouble maybe more than the more warlike, just a short haul across the lake. The key seems to be a raft of adults who feel the ennui, boredom of this insular place, to the extent that show-stealer, feisty but wounded Siobhan, Kerry Condon, finds a way out, more in a search for love than a new mainland job she is going to even with war raging nearby. The centerpiece is her brother, Farrell, Padraic, which the Irish pronounce like there is no \"d,\" and Gleeson, Colm, who are longtime friends who stop drinking together starting at 2 p.m. daily, because Colm, a fiddling songwriter wants to stop dealing with him because he doesn't like him anymore because he's boring, as he wants to focus on writing songs that live on. When Padraic starts bugging him about changing his mind, Colm says he will cut off his own fingers if Padraic won't leave him alone, an old Irish trick, if you don't do what I want or don't stop doing what I don't want, I will harm myself. Soon, the fingers start flying. When Padraic's prized miniature goat tries to eat one and chokes to death, they don't call them the fighting Irish for nothing. Padraic says he will burn down Colm's cottage tomorrow at 2, and if he is in it, well that's OK. And thus burns the home, but Colm lives. It is Barry Keoghan, a great young actor playing Dominic, the slow son of a drunken cop who beats him, and who had fallen for Siobhan, who is older than him, who tells her \"there goes my dream\" after she gently rejects him, whose remains are fished out of the lake.  Another key is that the priest asks Colm in confession how his despair is going, and Colm says he's pretty well lately, praise be. Siobhan had said all along that Colm is \"depressed\" and that all the men on the island are \"boring,\" which is more why she left than for a library job, a library symbolizing culture, learning, art, not superstition and tribalism. Banshees are spirits of Irish folklore who predict when someone is going to die, often in loud wails. An old lady on the island plays this role, accurately predicting a death. The point is that some Irish people had trouble adapting to change, losing friends, dealing with rejection, or just finding love and contentment, in this remote, rural place. Seems Colm really was in despair, depressed, though don't expect any Irish people of Inisherin to admit it. May the wind be at their back. Great acting, good production values, many funny lines, a dark look at life of some Irish or just people, and that black comedy is just a bit over the top, and it drags a tad. Kerry's Siobhan is impatient with not just foolishness but dark ages mores mostly of the men, and is very good. An Irish-American, my father, bless his soul, used to quip, \"You don't have to be dumb to be Irish, but it helps.\"",

Dominic, for example, is an incredibly moving and memorable portrayal of a nobody, with finesse and sensitivity. Even the animals become characters, without taking over. More than that, in a time when islands like Rathlin still preserve their own distinctiveness in relation to The Island, McDonagh nails the island life where 'word gets around' and news is ranked from 'news' to 'shite news' to 'no news at all'. \nThe only issue is that in a film set up for redemption, none ever quite achieve it. It does have an extraordinary beauty in seeking and finding the parity that can rescue a relationship's balance. However, as it does so we realize there is nothing redemptive in both descending to the same base level. Perhaps that is the one of the film's messages -- that by burning down your friend's house in revenge, one can rebuild nothing; in cutting off one's nose to spite one's face, there is no new path to lasting peace to be discovered. \nThe film's core tenet, meanwhile, that people are worth loving for their own genial banality, and that the appreciation of beauty is an indication that the same beauty resides within us, is one that pierces to the heart of all arts and debates and makes this movie soar. Two scenes in particular stand out (** spoilers***). One presents this point via the most simple yet scathing critique of the human construction of Catholicism, when a confessional priest asks Colm whether he thinks God gives a flying feck about little dead donkeys, and Colm answers that he fears He does not and that that is where it all went wrong. The other, after a long build up of the fear that Colm's music will be lost with his fingers, comes near the end, when Padraig encounters him in the pub jiving along as usual to the music circle, proving that limitations are often a product of the imagination and that all along, the music was actually within his soul.\nHere's to village elegies and to filmmakers who make a donkey's sudden decease cut far deeper than a human's inevitable culmination of suffering -- may we next have a comedy, please?!",

I did not hear a hint of laughter in the cinema or find a moment funny myself. I only saw those whose minds so stultified by the absolute bleak existence that when they find a moment of humour it just seemed all the more tragic. Perhaps dealing with the catholic church will always be a worthy source of ridicule until they face their embarrassment but it did not count as humour to me.\n\nNeither in the story's trajectory could I find meaning, just a vague desperate grab at some deeper mythology and a stab in the dark to find a point. I did not leave confused just sad so much effort and real honest emotion went into something that never found a way to matter",

Farrell does not understand, or accept, Gleeson's decision and this creates the volatile, tragic, and sometimes laughable chronology of events that unfold in this movie.

My biggest issue with his work prior has been the tendency to generally view humanity as largely apathetic and cynical, our problems and despairs hopeless for true resolve. He weaves stories of that brand much better than most I'd usually call out for that sort of thing, however, I think Banshees of Inisherin is his best film on account that it uses that apathy and cynicism for a much more admirable cause of examining the ways in which those things manifesting in people can set off chain reactions of destructive and self destructive behavior. It's a film that greatly speaks to our inherent need for connection, friendship, and community and the things we're capable of doing to ourselves and others without it. Very witty, Irish as they get, subtle and tender in its depiction of depression and isolation, but even at its most tragic still manages to squeeze in a few good laughs.

Maybe even some poetic revelations on the relationships, the joys and the struggles of the Irish in the 1920s. That expectation was slowly and steadily dismissed as the story progressed.\n\nThe actors all performed their roles effectively, where the sister, Kerry Condon, was by far the most nuanced of the other, fairly monotonous characters. Barry Keoghan also added some personality to the story. The setting delivered with its sedate beauty throughout the film. But the culprit was the writing, or lack thereof. It may have just been that they wanted a vehicle for the ambience of the Irish country side. But that would have been better served by excluding what grew into progressively inane dialog and then some sadly deranged plot turns. I'm not sure what spark of inspiration prompted the film. It had an auspicious start, but it seems that about 1/3 of the way into it, the writer lost his way and just said feck it.",

There he comes to know that Colm doesn't want to be friends with him anymore. Clueless P\u00e1draic didn't understand the reason behind such a massive step and tries to dissolve the situation by apologizing and talking to his dear friend. Contrary to his efforts, the more he tries to talk to Colm, the more the situation worsens, and that further leads to devastating events in both of their lives.\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin is an extremely beautiful film, both from a story as well as a scenic perspective. The screenplay is so smooth that one doesn't even realize the passing minutes of the runtime. The cinematography is brilliant. The wide-angle shots of captivating landscapes with cloudy sky and seashore give a soothing experience.\n\nMcDonagh's direction is top class and he has masterfully created a mesmerizing world around us in this film.\nOn one end, the story's simplicity gives a touch of authenticity to the film; on the other hand, the diligent character development & careful writing, make the characters more real than fictional.\nEvery moment and conversation has been used efficiently to develop the story and take it further. Everything happening on the screen makes sense. Since McDonagh himself has written the film, he embraces the characters with the utmost care, and it's evident, too, throughout the film when as a viewer we can relate to the characters and the situations. Even smaller role characters are written with interesting character arcs.\n\nWhen such a talented cast is onboard, you can expect top-notch performances. Colin Farrell once again gives an Oscar-worthy performance with an extremely powerful portrait of his character. You can literally feel his anguish and emotions. Brendan Gleeson is equally outstanding with his marvellous dialogue delivery and character portrayal. Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan are the scene stealers and make their characters memorable even with limited screen time.\n\nThis comedy-drama, under the carpet, is actually more of a tragic tale. There are metaphors, but one doesn't need to dwell too deeply to understand them. They have been laid out in simpler ways here. There are plenty of scenes that would make you laugh, but at the same time, there are many that would make you sad. The film explores various underlying themes like loneliness, sadness, love, and friendship under the umbrella theme of human relationships.\n\nAt the end of the day, I see The Banshees of Inisherin as a film that everyone would appreciate in one way or the other. It's smartly written, brilliantly directed, and passionately portrayed. It's a fascinating piece of cinema and every frame in it is simply admirable.\n\nFollow me on Instagram/Letterboxd: m_movie_reviews\nRating: 8.3/10",

I think he probably should do that for every acting role he has and he will continue to win awards. He has such a tragic face.

He takes a simple yet rich setting and turns it into a grand social experiment. The entire production is award worthing from costume design to cinematography. McDonagh's direction is purposeful yet subtle. The dialogue is so brilliant and watching the actors tackle it is like watching a boxing match of powerful, endless punches with neither side yielding.

The laughs stem mostly from tragedy and cruelty but the Irish are best at making fun of the Irish so it really lands accurately.  If you want a feel good \"Quiet Man\" experience this wont do it but its certainly worth a look into island life in mid 1920's.  Not much different than living in Wisconsin, Nevis, or New Orleans on a Monday.  Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride because this isn't to be taken too seriously.  As for Condon, she is a gem and a sweetheart and she kinda saves the film from its slow burn gloom.  The witch is also an interesting character and her ability to see the future is indicative of her intelligence and observational skill.

However, \"The Secret of Roan Inish\" it definitely ain't.  It's not for everyone, and there are some really gruesome moments, and if you're looking for an upbeat happy ending look somewhere else, but I enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nBy the way, I play fiddle myself, and up until this movie I don't believe I'd ever seen a violin played on-screen where the player was actually playing what was on the soundtrack.  Brendan Gleeson, however, absolutely was.  It wasn't necessarily him playing; it could have been another fiddler bow-syncing to what he played, or him bow-syncing to a previously made recording, or something like that, but there's no doubt at all that he plays fiddle well enough to play those tunes, some of which were pretty up-tempo.

I really like Brendan Gleeson (ever since he played Mad Eye Moody in the Goblet of Fire, for which he should have at least been nominated for an Academy Award! Really, go take a look at that character - he's playing a VERY quirky character who was ACTUALLY someone else!). The chemistry between him and Colin Farrell is sublime and the whole story, village, characters is extremely well protrayed and presented! The ending was mildly, very mildly disappointing. But that is just the typical shallow me wanting it all tied up in a bow. There are just so many things going on that are subtle yet not that it really makes for a very compelling, well done, nearly great, film!! Highly recommend it....",

The only two I have higher are The Batman and Everything Everywhere All At Once.

One man struggles with his own depression and feelings of time coming to a close and attempts to cut himself off from another. The other identifies him as his only friend and cannot come to accept  this new order in his own non existence of a life and the situation spirals into violence and loss. A well crafted film but bleak . A few laughs along the way , but also issues of child abuse, loneliness, depression and isolation to counter those odd lighter moments.\nAnother great pairing of the Gleason and Farrell, with a strong supporting cast.

Colm says he wants to spend his remaining time on earth building a legacy by writing music, not engaging in trivial conversation with his friend.  He's so serious about it that he tells Padraic he will cut off one of his own fingers with a set of shears the next time Padraic intrudes.

He can still play the fiddle with four fingers, I bet you.\"  And because this is a McDonagh film, violence is always simmering just beneath the surface.  Friendship isn't the only thing that eventually gets brutally severed.\n\nI attended this screening with high expectations, having deeply admired \"In Bruges\" as well as McDonagh's other films \"Seven Psychopaths\" and \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\"  I've seen each of them more than once.  \"Banshees\" tones down the violence of McDonagh's previous films, settling for tossing verbal rather than literal grenades.  But while it examines Colm and Padraic from every possible angle, these central characters are too profoundly depressed (Colm) or too lacking in self-awareness (Padraic) to be deeply interesting or to represent some larger point.  There's a lot of morose moping in search of a purpose.  Some critics have pronounced in authoritative tones that the relationship between Colm and Padraic is a metaphor for the Free Staters versus the IRA during the Irish Civil War.  If that's the case, McDonagh needs to sell the idea with more than occasional gunfire in the background.  Turns out, this historical context (\"1920s Irish History for $200, please, Alex\") is not a strong point for some moviegoers.\n\nThere are a few bright spots.  The lingering aerial shots of the Irish countryside are spectacular.  McDonagh's masterful writing skills are on full display.  The dialogue is densely clever, when it's not being cleverly dense.  And there is a small ray of hope: one character, Padraic's sister Siobhan (a scene-stealing Kerry Condon \u2013 \"Better Call Saul,\" \"Three Billboards,\" \"Ray Donovan\"), has the good sense to pack her bags and leave for the mainland and a chance at sanity.  She writes back to Padraic reflecting amazement that her new locale includes townspeople who smile on occasion.\n \nBut for the most part, the characters in \"Banshees\" seem intent on manifesting every possible sign of clinical depression (although, in fairness, some characters shift to a generalized sense of despair, just for a change of pace).  \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" is not a sojourn to an idyllic isle.  Ultimately, this is Brigadoon with minimal singing, no dancing and no Cyd Charice.",

            "content": "Review: Banshees of Inisherin (BoI)\n\nMaybe it's just me but this movie enthralled me. Something very rare. I'll try to make an argument that you might feel the same way. \nIn a nutshell this BoI is the deepest of dives into the heart of friendship, with more than a little Heart of Darkness. It aims at and hits an unerring bullseye at small town life on an island just off the coast of Ireland. Never having visited the emerald isle myself the seascapes and breathtaking vistas matched all my expectations of what an Irish isle I thought would look like. In fact, I would posit the location set in 1923 used throughout the film is a character as much as any of the actor portrayals. It's a rough, isolated place to live.\n\nAt its essence this is the story of the sudden, seemingly inexplicable breakup of a friendship. And while it is filled with heartbreak, it's a heartbreak we can all relate to. Everyone of us, if you dig down in your memory lane there undoubtably has had some rocky roads in friendships. In fact, many have had to make the decision on whether to continue with a dubious friendship. It's that decision around which this film turns. But don't be misled this is merely a dour and depressing film, far from it. I haven't laughed out loud in a movie, along with the rest of the audience in a long, long time. It is a complex mixture of highs and lows that draws upon countless emotions buried within and on our surface.\n\nAmid all the world-saving, super hero, special effect laden mega-blockbusters that seem to be the only movie fare available, this is an intimate picture. In fact, it seems almost like a play. There are only two main characters with the rest of the town's folk in small but crucial roles serving as something not unlike a Greek chorus ushering along the storyline. The dictionary defines banshee as a \"female spirit in Gaelic folklore whose appearance or wailing warns a family that one of them will soon die.\" There's one of these too.\n\nNow onto the perfect cast. In a completely surprising, unexpected wonderful turn is Colin Farrell (Padraic). Primarily a leading \"modern actor\" Farrell fits comfortably into this small-town vulnerable good guy role. His life is fulfilled with low expectations. He's buddies with a lifelong best friend. Visiting the local pub and downing pints of Guinness with his pal is a life well lived. Though the jury is out on whether he's dim or dumb \u2026 he is satisfied. He lacks an imagination to dream of better things. Still, it's hard to find fault with a satisfied person in this world. I for one was a little envious of that minimalist approach. But all that comes to an end when their friendship hits a stone wall.\n\nThat metaphorical wall is Padriac's friend Colm (Brendon Gleeson). What a face. Gleeson is one of those gifted actors whose expressions convey many things, sometimes more than one at the same time. Colm is a complex man caged by a simple life \u2026 and he wants out. You feel his angst but not the extreme expression of it. Be prepared.\n\nI went with a lifelong buddy. Afterward I asked if he like it. He confessed he wasn't sure he understood it. He admitted he primarily goes to movies for entertainment and this was a bit of a challenge. That challenge is what I crave and for me is missing from many movies. However, I don't feel the two viewpoints have to be mutually exclusive. But to our friendships credit we had a great dinner talking over the interpretations of the film which was a feast for me and I think he enjoyed our talk too.\n  \nTwo warnings you'll be glad I mentioned. Pay attention. The characters talk with an Irish brogue. Have faith that your ear will attune to it quickly. In fact, the screenplay author had enough sense to allow characters to repeat certain phrases as an aural footnote to help you get the point or joke. I'll even help. In the beginning is the phrase, \"Did you have a row.\" The pronunciation of row is like nothing I've ever heard but you quickly get it as it's repeated by nearly everyone in the pub. The second warning is of a scene of self-harm. I won't go beyond that. Go see the film if you want to get my reference or, read some other reviewer who has no compunction about including spoilers in their reviews. That shall not pass here.",

            "content": "It's not a comedy in the American sense though there are funny bits throughout if you enjoy dry humor (I do). Rather, it is largely a drama filled with dark/taboo humor. Banshees has a gifted cast with an absolute standout performance by Barry Keoghan as Dominic, the only character I was able to truly have empathy for. Kerry Condon as Siobhan (sister to protagonist Colon Farrell's Padraic) delivers an excellent performance and approaches being an empathetic character except the story is not about her. It could be. Retelling the story of an isolated life on an Irish island from Siobhan's POV with the dark antics or Padraic and antagonist Colm (Brendan Gleeson) would have been a more compelling story and still allowed the filmmaker to explore the themes of mortality, friendship, and contentment. As it is, though, the film is dark, not breathtaking in its cinematography, and slower than it needs to be to convey the mood or setting. The moments of comedic relief are genuinely funny for those who enjoy dry humor as I mentioned. But the story meanders along and gives too much attention to certain set details that add no value to the story itself. It's not a majestic piece of cinematography that will stun you though the setting is beautiful. It's not a dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of being uncomfortable yet still delivers morose humor. It isn't entirely a drama because the story and a particular disturbing plot element border on the ridiculous (I left early after one gruesome and inexplicably weird moment). And while the characters have the potential for depth and whose performances are the only thing that kept me in my seat as long as I did, their arcs are never fully realized and they don't become dimensional or empathetic characters save Dominic. Ultimately, I don't feel the elements came together.",

All of the performances are stellar and the actors give so much personality to them, making the fictional island of Inisherin feel populated and alive. The cinematography and production design does a lot to capture the life and beauty of the town, with a nice focus on natural lighting from candles, fire and leaking sunbeams. Carter Burwell's score is playful and communicates the conflicting tone of comedy and despair that permeates the film.

All the way back to Braveheart and later in Calvary, In Bruges, and The Guard. All the actors are terrific, and every main character is interesting in their own way. Sometimes bleak and sad, but always interesting. This movie is about profound loneliness and isolation. Friendship and the fragility of friendships. Pettiness and the tragic results of pettiness escalated in a very narrow world. Self-introspection and the transference of disappointment onto others. One character in the movie actually comes up with the courage to leave and find her happiness off the island in the bigger world. A very intelligent film.

Perhaps it tries to convey a useful message about meaningfulness in life--but it fails. The entire core of the movie is more like the empty heart and soul of a senselessly abusive person: cruelty and heartlessness result in more cruelty and heartlessness. Those of us who experience depictions of abuse (shunning, neglect, severe child beating, and horrific self-mutilation) as triggering should avoid this film. I started crying before 20 minutes, and had to step outside for air after about an hour. I had been looking forward to visiting Ireland someday; now I'm  going to have to try to de-associate the images of beautiful scenery with emotional agony. From what I've read, Ireland experienced decades of pain, betrayal, and an endless variety of injuries both psychic and physical, all inflicted by brother on brother. Perhaps this film is the perfect expression of those scars, but I'm not convinced it needed to be so traumatic.

It was listed as a comedy so I was expecting something along the line of my beloved \"Waking Ned Devine\" and in spite of this Banshees movie's nod to that classic, it was no Ned Devine.  Yes, the acting was great, but it was way too dark with no redemptive qualities. When it was over, we were like, \"WTF!\"  If you like leaving a movie feeling depressed, hopeless, and angry, by all means, go see it.  I guess it was a true depiction of human beings, but man, it was heartless.",

More than anything in this film, I admired the performances and the gorgeous scenery throughout. I think those two things alone make the movie worth checking out. However, I just couldn't really get into the story. I don't know what it was, the premise was engaging at first, but it really started to drag for me. These two characters both do things that kept me interested in what was next but sometimes they felt a bit frustrating, which also may have been intentional. Overall, this is a very well-acted and well-shot film that is extremely slow-paced, at times also somewhat boring and for me might be one of the more overhyped films of the year, despite many technical merits.",

Similar in many ways to McDonagh's In Bruges from fourteen years earlier, The Banshees of Inisherin is filled with memorable dialogue, original ideas, strong performances throughout, lovely landscapes and stunning cinematography.

            "content": "Sometimes the simplest of films can become one of the best of its consecutive year, or even an already great filmmaker's finest work. Martin McDonagh is one of my favourite working directors today. Whether you're talking about his excellent and hilarious debut with In Bruges back in 2008, or his award-worthy Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri in 2017, he is a filmmaker that hasn't made a single film that wasn't at least very, very good, at least to me. The Banshees of Inisherin marks his latest directorial effort and arguably his best. It's been a while since I went to the theatre and felt the filmmaking just leaping off the screen, but this one did that for me.\u00a0\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin follows P\u00e1draic (Colin Farrell) as he lives a straightforward life on a small island in Ireland called Inisherin. Drinking at the local pub on a daily basis and only having one lifelong friend in Colm (Brendan Gleeson), he quickly learns that Colm no longer wishes to be his friend. Colm has his reasons, but they really don't make any logical sense, thus sparking P\u00e1draic's confusion and curiosity. Colm's one request is that P\u00e1draic just stop talking to him altogether, otherwise he is threatening to harm himself. That's it, that's the only story to this film, other than the very incredible dialogue that makes it all worth it.\n\nThis film is a masterwork in how well a movie can work if you have great characters. P\u00e1draic and Colm are both very well written and Farrell and Gleeson both give arguably their best performances here. They both had me laughing hysterically and feeling awful at the same time. There were multiple occasions where the film was too funny to not laugh, but the subject matter was very dark, so I felt bad for doing so, and that to me was the brilliance of this film. The dialogue was the driving force here and that aspect was perfection to me.\u00a0\n\nMartin McDonagh also wrote the screenplay for this film, which really makes me believe he won't ever make a bad movie. He has a knack for writing some of the most clever dialogue out there and his work throughout the years only seems to improve. He can also work exceptionally well with actors, which is why a film like this turns out so well with him behind the wheel. Everything from the camerawork to the subtle score, The Banshees of Inisherin, although dark and funny, is a masterwork of filmmaking, especially when it's such a simple premise. This is also a much darker film than any of his previous work, but that made the final act feel authentic to this story. I really don't have anything to complain about here.",

You probably would have to have been born in or before the 1970's to appreciate it otherwise it would seem like utter fiction!! But rural Ireland back then was so insular and incestious people really did live such small and sad lives and ultimately went mad! I saw a comment saying, there was no real ending\u2026. The ending was the madness probably continued to a tragic end that still lives on through generations in Ireland",

            "content": "I love me some Martin McDonagh. He does dark storytelling and black humor with great skill, balancing intensity and delicacy. The Banshees of Inisherin finds two long-time best friends of sort no longer mates as one, Brendan Gleeson's Colm, has had his fill of Colin Farrell's P\u00e1draic. Seems P\u00e1draic is one boring fella when it comes to the chatting, and Colm now wants to make more of his time and sitting with this dull bloke at the pub or wherever they're conversing. Namely, he wants to work on composing more on his fiddle. \nThe two begin to have a sort of clash, which is analogous with the civil war currently occurring on the mainland of Ireland. As with wars, things begin with small skirmishes and build up to full-on assaults. Colm threatens to hack off a digit if P\u00e1draic doesn't cease and desist with all his talking to him. He does so briefly before launching into an angry rant at Colm, which then leads the latter to indeed follow through with his amputation.\nAs dark and miserable as this all sounds, it's a Martin McDonagh film, so the humor's gonna be there, but you have to sense it at times, cuz this is not stuff that hits you over the head. Dark/black humor is more subtle, and indeed works best if you have a good bit of it already in your reserve along with a lot of experience in using and appreciating it. \nThe supporting cast is excellent. Kerry Condon as P\u00e1draic's suffering sister who is told 'no one likes (her). Shortt's bartender, Pearse as the priest, along with Kenny and Lydon flesh out key parts so well. And then there's Sheila Fitton as the ominous, seer type Mrs. McCormick and Barry Keoghan as another oddball outcast. Both are very effective in their specific characters. Fitton brings s cold, callous sense to Mrs. McCormick, who annoys as much as puts off her fellow islanders. Keoghan nearly steals whole scenes at times with his combination of convincing dullard and all his nervous fidgeting facial expressions. \nAnd the island itself is something of a character, with its blanket of lush green fields and yards, the small rural homes, JJ. Devine's pub, and the verging sea. \nGreat stuff by McDonagh, cast, and crew. 3.8 stars",

The acting is poignant, with just the right blend of funny, tortured and cynical - especially from Farrell. \n\nAnd, lastly, there's the many underlying meanings left after you peel all that away. The despair of meaninglessness, the rage in trying to escape it, and the passion with which people find ridiculous things to fill the time and cling to. \n\nCannot recommend enough. Watched it twice.

Martin Mcdonagh is still outstanding as a scriptwriter but this is definitely his best work as a director. With each film, he becomes more decisive with each frame of the work, and the banshees absolutely show that. From the tiny detail that in the background that symbolizes the dialogue, to how the terrain displays the character's way of life, he really has mastered it. The score is great as it effectively captures the sound of the mystery of the events and the island of inisherin. The cinematography is also excellent at exhibiting the beauty of Ireland. I did find it to be a slower film than Mcdonagh's previous works, but in this case, it is needed, this isn't a story of just any old friendship, this is the story of two best friends splitting. Colin Farrell perfectly encapsulates Padric, using everything in his acting arsenal to get down to very intricate details. Brendan Gleeson rises as Colm, portraying a man trying to look more sophisticated than he actually is. Everyone is perfectly cast in this and does everything in their power to contribute to this great movie. This was truly a great film for Mcdonagh and just makes me more excited for what he has next, which we will probably see in 5 years.",

After it's world premiere at this year's Venice International Film Festival, the film went on to receive a rapturous 15-minute standing ovation, five minutes longer than McDonagh's previous film \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\". \n\nThe film takes place in 1920s Ireland, against the backdrop of the Irish Civil War, on the fictional island of Inisherin and tells the story of two friends P\u00e1draic (Farrell) and Colm (Gleeson). One day, Colm decides to abruptly end his long-running friendship with P\u00e1draic, claiming the man is \u2018too dull' for him to spend the rest of his life around. An escalating battle then begins between the two friends, and it soon becomes the talk of the village, with many just as confused as P\u00e1draic with Colm's decision. As the growing tensions between the two grow, it's not long before it boils over and results in devastating consequences for both feuding men. \n\nColin Farrell leads an uber-talented cast comprised of some of Ireland's greatest talents like Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon, and Barry Keoghan, all delivering knockout performances. Farrell's work is almost certain to land him a spot in this year's Best Actor line-up as he plays P\u00e1draic, the harmless easy-going farmer, until he finally snaps and becomes a ruthless man out for revenge, and perhaps that's what makes his performance so fascinating to watch unfold on the big screen. The friendship Farrell shares with his co-star Brendan Gleeson elevates both performances making them feel much more authentic and believable. The pair share a hilarious back and forth that's embellished by McDonagh's screenplay. Gleeson's role as Colm, a man who finds himself in the later years of his life wishing to be more creative, and have more interesting conversations with those around him, is terrific and perfectly compliments Farrell's performance. The film's other standout performance, alongside Farrell's, comes from Kerry Condon. The Irish actress, probably best known for voicing \u2018Friday' in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, gives a marvellous turn as P\u00e1draic's sister, Siobhan. Condon ends up acting as a mediator between the two men, trying to keep them apart to prevent Colm from resorting to drastic action. Condon boosts every scene she's in to a whole other level and she ends up being one of the best parts of the film. \n\nDirector Martin McDonagh pens a screenplay that balances side-splitting hilarity with tear-jerking emotion and reminds you exactly why he has two Oscar-nominations for writing under his belt. It's sharp, witty, and brilliantly tells the story of what happens when a friendship turns sour. McDonagh does a skilful job blending the comedic tones at the start of the film with the tragedy and drama that becomes more dominant towards the end. This balance, combined with McDonagh's sensational directorial effort, makes \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" such a unique and entertaining film. Perhaps what else makes the film so good, and sets it apart from a large majority of this year's awards contenders, is that it isn't an intricate biopic about a famous figure or some overbearing think piece, but is instead a rich, amusing film about friendship. \n\n\"The Banshees of Inisherin\" brings some delightful visuals to the screen alongside the engaging narrative and likeable characters. Cinematographer Ben Davis, who worked with McDonagh on \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\", uses the scenic Irish coastlines to his advantage to effortlessly enhance the natural beauty of the film.\n\n\"The Banshees of Inisherin\" easily sets itself up to be one of 2022's best and most entertaining films. With shining performances from the cast, and a simple plot with changing tones, the film is a solid original dark comedy from acclaimed director Martin McDonagh. A simple, yet distinctive depiction of the end of a friendship, \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" is beautifully tied together, while also being incredibly charming and amusing, and a brilliant follow up to \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\".",

In the film, in which no idea is glorified or criticized, the effect of knowledge on people is examined. The movie, in which the centuries-old fight between people who read and people who don't read is reenacted on a small island, shows us that we need to make radical decisions, even if it sometimes upsets some people or frightens us. When Einstein said that people are divided into two, the good and the bad, he didn't say that the good should be boring. The main priority in this life is ourselves, and to make ourselves happy, we should be in places where we will be satisfied and do things that make us happy. While Siobhan sees the benefits of his radical decision, Colm, unfortunately, has to struggle with Padraic's obsessions and manages to reach the happiness he seeks, even if a few fingers are missing.",

II expected to both laugh and cry more, but the emotional wrenches of the movie were deeper than to just produce laughter or tears and stayed with you after the movie ended.

McDonagh for Best Director. They deserve the Oscar sweep last seen by Silence of the Lambs. Continuing, Kerry Condon is brilliant, she brings the magic that keeps the movie going in a fantastic place. Barry Keoghan is phenomenal... he's clearly autistic but with the wiseness that people don't understand. The open ending makes me know that Colm (Gleeson) needed a place to stay after the fiery ending. What a magnificent ending it would've been if Colm asked for a place to stay and he slept in Siobh\u00e1n's now-empty bed. Highly recommend! The cinematography is next level Oscar winning stuff. The scene where P\u00e1draic buries a certain furry someone was beautifully shot. What a magnificent display of Irish Life in 1923.

            "content": "Irish writer-director Martin McDonagh returns to his homeland after his Oscars success with his last film 5 years ago and it's a triumphant return, with a profound and exceptionally crafted screenplay that works on multiple levels, whether it's simply a story about the dramatic fallout after a life-long friendship breaks up out of the blue, or a deep dive into a character's battle with despair and mortality, or even as a metaphor for Ireland and their troubles since the Civil War, which coincidentally plays in the background of this film as an ominous reminder that constantly haunts its characters. Reuniting Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson from McDonagh's own In Bruges, they're the two central contrasting characters living on a remote island village off the Western coast of Ireland in 1923, whose friendship is unilaterally terminated by Gleeson's Colm to the horrors and bafflement of Farrell's Padraic. Easing us in with lively interactions sprinkled with laugh-out-loud Irish humour and stereotypes, and Ben Davis' calming and sumptuous cinematography that makes the best out of the picturesque landscape available, it builds on its engaging and straightforward premise organically, evolving incrementally in a dramatic and increasingly serious manner, before reaching a vicious yet melancholic conclusion. Basically, it begins as Father Ted but ends in Sunday Bloody Sunday and every laugh feels infused with pathos and the funniest characters wind up inhabiting the most tragic arc. Conveying complex emotions brilliantly, Farrell and Gleeson are on top form here, while Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan's scene-stealing support will not go unnoticed. Accompanied by an exquisite score by Carter Burwell that goes beyond Irish diddly music, this is an elegant and graceful film that one can enjoy and appreciate on so many different levels, it literally is the definition of thought-provoking.",

In this fable-like Irish folk tale about twoWriter-director Martin McDonagh\u2019s dark comedy-drama is one of those films that leaves me (and probably many other viewers) scratching my head, making me sincerely wonder what all the fuss is about. In this fable-like Irish folk tale about two longtime friends (Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson) whose relationship suddenly reaches an impasse, they struggle to come to terms of where things go from there in the aftermath of this scenario. There\u2019s just one problem here: the picture\u2019s razor-thin premise with its virtually nonexistent back story doesn\u2019t provide enough basis for why the dissolution of this friendship occurs and then escalates to a tale of inexplicable desperation and truly bewildering retributive self-abuse. Indeed, we seem to know more about the setting of the story \u2013 a small island off the western Irish seacoast during the waning days of the new republic\u2019s 1922-23 civil war \u2013 than we do about its characters, their relationship and their motivations. To compound matters, the narrative stretches out far too long, taking a seeming eternity to unfold with no particularly satisfying payoff, punctuated by lame attempts at humor that mostly fail to land. To its credit, this offering features fine performances by its two principals, as well as superb portrayals by Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan in supporting roles, all of whom have garnered Golden Globe Award nominations in the acting categories. There\u2019s also much to be said for its gorgeous cinematography and atmospheric Carter Burwell original score. However, it\u2019s truly mind-boggling to understand how this film has earned eight total Globe nods and four National Board of Review awards, among numerous other inflated and questionable accolades. This tediously dull, slow-paced effort falls woefully short of the fine work the filmmaker achieved in previous films like \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d (2017) and \u201cIn Bruges\u201d (2008) (not to mention its lack of the snappy on-screen chemistry that Farrell and Gleeson achieved in that off-beat comedy), accomplishments that make this release come across as a great disappointment by comparison. In fact, at the risk of overstatement, \u201cBanshees\u201d could have been edited down to a short, and it still likely would have been a letdown. Catch this one at your peril; at the very least, it\u2019s now available for online streaming, so you shouldn\u2019t have to venture out if you really want to watch it.",

You keep waiting for something that never comes. It's just \"what it is.\" Maybe that's the point. And maybe I'm missing something else, though the reviews don't give me much to go on.

The Banshees of Inisherin is a delightful trip to a less notable emerald isle and features a story straight out of a theater production put to film (it seems). A black tragicomedy by definition, I found the film quite enjoyable. Colin Farrel and Brendan Gleeson, frequent McDonough collaborators, bring believable performances to their characters, though standout among the cadre is Kerry Condon, whom I want to see more of in the future. The narrative is quite simple, concise, smartly written, and delightfully macabre. Cinematography delights in showing us the landscapes of Inishmoor and Achill Island near Irelands coast thanks to the eyes of DP Ben Davis. Though not my personal favorite of McDonough's films (In Bruge will always take that cake), Banshees is an enjoyable film from beginning to end.",

The two main characters suffer from dullness for 90% of the Film, which is no fault of the actor's Colin Ferrell and Brendan Gleeson. And though the dullness may have been intended, it makes for dull viewing. The Film seems to be so proud of its symbolic elements that it's perfectly content not to work out the actual story in a meaningful way. Highlights acting wise goes to Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan, who add some much-needed life to this tale. There are things to enjoy, such as beautiful cinematography and soaring landscapes, enough to make one wish to head to Ireland immediately! There are moments of humour and seriousness that make you think that the story may lead somewhere and move forward in a way you won't expect, but it somehow ends up being repetitive and not very satisfying. For film buffs and lovers of slow burn, there are metaphors and gems to uncover, but for casual viewing, this is frustrating and overly long at best and seems to lack an extra kick or spice to make it feel worth my time. With heightened expectations and promise of mastery, I found the Film lacking and found the comparison to Shakespeare laughable and saw nothing but a plastic shell of what the movie could have been.4.4 out of 10",

And how the fighting, the vast majority of which took place in and around Dublin, could be heard from a small island off the West Coast of Ireland, is one of the many inconsistencies that the audience is required to ignore.My biggest criticism is that the audience is required to do too much work to help plug the leaking holes in the plot.

Director and writer Martin McDonagh has created another masterpiece.Set on the Island of Inisherin, lifelong friendsI dare any Irish person to watch The Banshees of Inisherin and not recognise themselves or someone they know in this story. Director and writer Martin McDonagh has created another masterpiece.Set on the Island of Inisherin, lifelong friends P\u00e1draic (Colm Farrell) and Colm (Brendan Gleeson) find themselves in the centre of a dilemma when Colm abruptly ends the friendship, much to the shock of the entire Island. P\u00e1draic refuses to accept that Colm could suddenly just decide not to be friends anymore and is determined to put an end to this childish feud. With the help of his sister Siobhan (Kerry Condon) and friend Dominic (Barry Keoghan) they try and repair the relationship. Yet the more P\u00e1draic tries with Colm the worse it gets until Colm is pushed to give a rather dramatic ultimatum with shocking consequences. That\u2019s more than enough on the plot, if you haven\u2019t seen the trailer then keep it that way and just get to a cinema to see it for yourself.For all the Martin McDonagh fans you need to know that The Banshees of Inisherin is definitely more on the bleak side. Although classed as a black comedy, it\u2019s far more dark and melancholic than comedy. Don\u2019t expect the same amount of laughs compared to some of his other movies such as In Bruges and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri. As to be expected the story is balancing between humour and serious topics, in this case depression, despair and mental illness. You\u2019ll be laughing one minute and disturbed the next. It\u2019s not afraid to pull at the heart strings and will provoke a strong reaction from the audience. It\u2019s definitely a unique story that will stay with you long after the credits has ended.The cast is small but makes an impact, each playing their part brilliantly. Colin Farrell particularly stands out and reminds us just how good of an actor he really is. Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan are also giving hugely memorable performances so it\u2019s no surprise the entire film has received so much awards buzz already. It\u2019s honestly a relief to watch an Irish film that actually got Irish actors and not a bunch of actors sounding like leprechauns. It\u2019s authentic for the time, especially the dialogue and doesn\u2019t play too much into the stereotypes.McDonagh is the perfect choice for writing stories that tackle dark issues and inserting comedy among quite depressing topics. The Banshees of Inisherin is a brilliant film, hilarious and bleak. It\u2019s one of a kind and definitely one of the best this year. Highly recommended for everyone.",

The duo of Collin Ferrell and Brendan Gleeson each provide standout performances, as well as the rest of the small cast of this film, while the plot is tightly told with none of the unnecessary pretension one usually finds out of an artsier film. McDonagh blends witty black comedy with a simple yet powerful story of the abrupt ending of a lifelong friendship that will leave you laughing at one moment and saddened in the next. Its themes regarding loneliness (specifically repressed loneliness amongst men), the nature of inter-social relationships, and greater meanings in life are truly phenomenal and expressed in a simple, melancholic way that will leave one thinking about where they are and who is in their life. The only flaw I can truly mention regarding this film is the fact the film is quite bleak, which makes it not much of a rewatch. However, for a one time viewing, The Banshees of Inisherin is 100% worth a watch and will certainly make you think, laugh, and cry.",

One about a man who wants to be alone and another who can't tolerate being alone.And it's not an otherworldly and complicated story by any stretch of the imagination, but even for our times and in the era in which the events of this film take place it's clear that men don't talk about their feelings.McDonagh certainly doesn't choose a simplistic path and tackles a violence that at first may seem like a joke because you wouldn't think Gleeson's character would do it, but when it happens is when the story makes it clear to you that this tragicomedy is intended to be genuinely devastating, and it really is.You're not supposed to leave here with a smile on your face, but I assure you, you won't leave here without something to think about either.",

Beautiful, yet ugly. Hilarious, yet horrific. If there's any work in this filmmaker's oeuvre that I think is the perfect, most simple distillation of his voice/tonal DNA, it has to be this.

Martin McDonagh is back with an intimate yet powerful tale about friendship, solitude and the irrationality that led to a civil war and a conflict still felt today.As a metaphor for the long Irish conflict, the film manages to show the absurdity of both sides. P\u00e1draic and Colm represent the arbitrariness that led to it and the violent results. This is a Martin McDonagh film, so expect characters presented with a darkly comedic touch that makes them as funny as bleak. The star of the show, of course, is Colin Farrell. Just look at the man's eyebrows; they show you his mood and emotions every damn time. This very well could be his best performance yet. But that's not it, because Barry Keoghan, Kerry Condon, and Brendan Gleeson are astounding in their roles, and even the smaller ones are great, giving you laughs, somber moments, and great lines equally.'Banshees...' is funny and sad; McDonagh's brilliant screenplay gives insight into the sentiment of a nation struggling and how that affected its society.

The characters are all extremely honest with each other at the surface level, which is refreshing, and yet there is a pervasive melancholy to the whole affair.  Why the bitterness, why the sadness in this idyllic seaside village?  I think everyone will find something in the film they can relate to in both a positive or negative way.  It's a real work of art.  The lighting, which seems mostly natural, is exquisite.  Many scenes have a painterly quality to them.  The claustrophobia in someone's small home, contrasted against the sweeping endless vistas of the coast create the impression of a world waiting to be explored...just out of reach.  An attempt has been made with this story to lift up an unusual rock and see what's underneath.  It's brave, assured storytelling by a filmmaker in command of the craft and the actors are up to the task.  The lead performances are masterful.  It's an exceptional film though highly unusual, so I can imagine it won't be everyone's cup of tea.  But I say see it for the amazing offbeat humor, fine performances, beautiful scenery, and you may walk away as I did with some rather profound questions about human nature.  Score: 9.25",

Written and directed by Martin McDonough (Two longtime friends (Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson) find themselves at odds with each other when one of them abruptly ends their friendship and begins ignoring and avoiding them at all costs. Written and directed by Martin McDonough ( who famously first collaborated with Farrell and Gleeson in the 2008 dark comedy/crime film 'In Bruges') reunites here with the two stars to bring us this equally absurdist and darkly humorous tale set in early 1920s Ireland. The film is a dark, bold, and often somber yet sometimes funny look at changing times and the lengths some will go to fight for a friendship, as well as the lengths some will go to shun others. McDonough, who is known for his dark yet witty humor and dialogue in his stage plays, as well as in previous films such as the aforementioned 'In Bruges', 'Seven Psychopaths' and 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' brings that signature style of his here as well with darkly fascinating results. As for the cast, Farrell and Gleeson are once again in top form alongside each other, and even Kerry Condon, who plays the sister to Farrell's character gives an often riotous, scene-stealing supporting turn. Whenever the film wasn't making me laugh, it would often hit me in the feels unexpectedly and throw me for a loop whenever I least expected it. Overall, this brilliantly acted film that's equal parts dark/dreary and oddly humorous is a true standout for me and one of the better films of this year.",

The track record is not great - from Benny and Joon to Napoleon Dynamite, movies that rely on charm and warmth instead of plot and impactful dialogue is an approach I simply dislike. Banshees has no such warmth, as it's much closer to a lamentation on stoicism. Like In Bruges and Three Billboards, there's an air of hard cynicism permeating throughout the film. It's much less fleshed out than those films, and the dialogue is rather minimalist. It's not about that though, as it really is more a philosophical exploration on an array of oft uncomfortable subjects people tend to avoid. Isolation, friendship, death, time, interpersonal illusions, facile gossip, abuse, stoicism - it really goes on... Which is remarkable given how seemingly little there is on the surface, at times.Which can make the film a little slow. But the performances are all great (honestly, Colin Farrell has turned from kind of a joke to a legitimately decent actor), it's compelling, and the cinematography is also really good. Lastly, this film has an underspoken and underappreciated quality - the linger effect. Chances are you'll think about this film long after it's over. It's unique and thought provoking, and in this saturated and compromised artistic time we live in, it's refreshing.",

Martin McDonagh absolutely knocked it out of the park again. Martin McDonagh absolutely knocked it out of the park again. Colin Farrell is so far my pick for Best Actor this year. His performance here is absolutely amazing and heart wrenching at points as well. He does an amazing job at embodying this character and all his little quirks. Brendan Gleeson did an amazing job as well. He did a great job at being the foil to Colin Farrell\u2019s character with his more serious attitude. Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan did a great job as well with Barry Keoghan delivering probably the best performance of his career by a country mile. One scene from him in particular is heartbreaking. I keep mentioning how this film is heartbreaking and heart wrenching but this film is absolutely hilarious as well. Almost every joke here is very well written and incorporated into each scene and they are just funny in a dark way. This definitely falls under the black comedy genre. McDonagh does an amazing job at directing and incorporating the mix of dark comedy and drama tones together in a way that doesn\u2019t feel jarring. The film starts out being funny but the end you\u2019re definitely feeling emotional and sad as well. The story is really interesting. It\u2019s fascinating watching Colin Farrell try to get back under the good graces of Gleeson\u2019s character and all the incidents that follow that.

Featuring two remarkable performances by Colin FarrellMartin McDonagh's latest movie, The Banshees of Inisherin, is an excellent exploration of friendship, anger, depression, rage, and sadness, all while maintaining a dark sense of humour. Featuring two remarkable performances by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, the film follows a one-time best friends, Colm (Gleeson) and P\u00e1draic (Farrell), as Colm's dislike for his friend leads them both down a dark path. Set against the backdrop of 1920s Ireland during the civil war, the rural island of Inisherin provides a stunning visual for the narrative. Along with the powerful performances, McDonagh's script and Kerry Condon's portrayal of P\u00e1draic's sister, Siobhan, create a moving and poignant story of alienation and mortality. With strong performances, high emotion, and stunning visuals, The Banshees of Inisherin is one of the best films of the year.__________________La \u00faltima pel\u00edcula de Martin McDonagh, The Banshees of Inisherin, es una excelente exploraci\u00f3n de la amistad, la ira, la depresi\u00f3n, la ira y la tristeza, todo ello manteniendo un oscuro sentido del humor.

Nietzsche's anthropology is dualistic by contrasting the active nihilists to the passive ones: while the former accept the status quo for \"amor fati\", the latter fail to adapt to it as they do not possess a disposition that allows them to accept survivalism with its degenerative process until the extinction. Alternative dichotomies such as floats vs. drowned, integrated vs. apocalyptics, settled vs. marginalized, conformists vs. eccentrics are more imprecise. So far, humanity has shown that it falls within such a binary category, idem the entire planetary culture. Twentieth-century existentialism was a mass phenomenon that disappeared in the second half of the period. Earlier we find the Greek epic poems from Homer to Hesiod, the pre-Socratic philosophy, the Athenian tragedy that reached the point of no return with Sophocles' \"Oedipus at Colonus\" in 401. In the Jewish sphere, the further root of Western thought, we find the defeatism of Qoh\u00e8let. The problem lies in the fact that they have only ever known how to complain or protest, never suggesting anything constructive. The active nihilists are instead Epicureans, Horatians, Juvenalesques, cantors of the \"carpe diem\". Even art and therefore cinema can be traced back to the two Nietzschean typologies, and individual authors or single works can even oscillate unsteadily between one pole and another. \"Tertium datur\"? In effect, yes. In 524, the year before he was killed, Boethius exposes in the \"De consolatione philosophiae\" a dilemma that will find a more rigorous formula with Leibniz in the \"Essais de Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e\", written in 1705 and published in 1710: \"Si Deus est, unde malum? Si non est, unde bonum?\". For atheists, materialists and immanentists the opportunity opened up to analyze the second horn of the dilemma. How many took advantage of it? How many finally began to provide a proposal? To my knowledge, only one thinker: Ernst Bloch, starting with his main book released in '59. That is, our debut attempt beyond active and passive nihilisms dates back to only a few decades ago. Shocking and devastating. With this, even McDonagh cannot but refer to the \"despair of Kierkegaard\" (Federico Pontiggia), to the \"funereal twilight of Beckett\" (Enrico Azzano), \"not for nothing Samuel Beckett is Dubliner and certainly one of the strongest referents, [...] very skilled weaver of plots and dialogues mixed in the absurd\" (Emanuela Martini), \"it looks like a comedy of the absurd in costume written by Beckett\" (Carlo Valeri). And why not even 1938 Sartre's \"La Naus\u00e9e\"? Stop with this rearguard, after decades and millennia I demand from culture something that at least [re]starts from Bloch.",
