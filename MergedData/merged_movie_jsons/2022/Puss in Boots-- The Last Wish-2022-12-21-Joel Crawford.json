            "content": "I did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off Dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. But here we are.After an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.The screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.What I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.I adored this film. I think it's Dreamworks' best film since Megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year.",

            "content": "\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the \"Shrek\" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. He's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. \"The Last Wish\" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original \"Puss in Boots.\" Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado's film. The film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. From the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of Puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, \"The Last Wish\" offers a variety of eye-popping details. And it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. But the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. And the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you.",

            "content": "SCORE: 9.5/10Puss in Boots has returned! I absolutely love movies that stick to what they are good at and don't try to overextend story lines that aren't very good. Every part of the story had its place and I didn't feel like they spent too much time on one specific part, with the exception of the main story of all the characters chasing after the Last Wish. Doug still holds the place for cutest animated dog in a movie, but Perrito was definitely giving him a run for his money. He was so pure and cute, and his dialogue was always perfectly timed. The scene with the bleeps when he gets kidnapped by Goldi and the Three Bears was hilarious and him putting his head on Puss' chest, acting as his therapy dog, was one of the cutest things I've ever seen.Death was one of the coolest animated villains I've seen. The animation style was perfect for the action scenes and his appearances were always epic. The Ethical Bug bit was also very funny and the humor in general was great. The ending was awesome, with the rest of the crew teaming up to take down Jack Horner and realizing they already all they could ever wish for. Goldi had her family and Puss had his one life worth living. Gotta love the Gingy and Pinocchio cameos, as well as them sailing off to Far Far Away to \"catch up with some friends\". This movie was a lot better than I was expecting. It was such a fun adventure and I really liked all the characters that were introduced along the way! It was just right.",

            "content": "Puss and Boots the last wish is a fantastic sequel and inarguably better than the charming first outing. The animation is brilliant, characters are charming, pacing is tight, very funny and the action is excellent. Not to mention there is a ton of heart. If I were to nitpick I think one of the antagonists trumps the other. One is played for more comedic purposes while the other is an Intimidating physical presence for boots to contend with. The Last Wish has something for everyone and it's probably one of the better animated movies I've seen in sometime. I really don't want to get into the story to avoid spoilers because the movie was a lot of fun, and it's best to go into it fresh. If anyone is considering taking their family to see the Last Wish like I did then The Last Wish is an easy recommendation. 100% worth the money. Two thumbs up for team friendship.",

            "content": "The last \"Puss In Boots\" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the \"Shrek\" franchise, so surely they couldn't make something really great again, right? The story is pretty standard, as Puss In Boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. It seriously has some of the best action I've seen in a long time. I don't even think this film qualifies as a comedy. It really is more like a straightforward action flick. Even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from Frame 1 to Frame...whatever.This film does not take place before the Shrek films. We get to see some brief flashbacks with Shrek himself, albeit only for a few seconds. The villains are Big Jack Horner, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and a wolf. I believe a poster called this character the Big Bad Wolf, but he isn't that, even if he's technically based on him (he's actually DEATH). Every one of these villains are unique with their own motivations. Every minute makes me eager to find out what happens next.So...who does get the wish in the end? Nobody! Everyone (except Big Jack Horner) realizes they had what they wanted after awhile. It even begins with another sequel hook with Puss In Boots going back to Far Far Away Land. Another Shrek/Puss In Boots movie? If it has such amazing cel shading animation with the best CGI of all, it deserves as many films as possible! ****",

            "content": "Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. After his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. When he woke up, Puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. At first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking Wolf (Wagner Moura) made Puss decide to retire from adventures.While living the life of a spoiled lazy lap cat, Puss learned about a Wishing Star from the family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo) who were looking for it. Puss decided to search for the Star himself in order to wish for his nine lives back. Along with Puss on his quest were his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Selma Hayek) and a nameless little orphan therapy dog (Harvey Guillen).This sequel to the first \"Puss in Boots\" solo spin-off movie came out 11 years after the original. There is a very evident difference that can be noted in the style of its animation. On top of the 3D computer-generated images of the characters, there is now an additional 2D artistic style as if they were hand-painted (first seen in \"The Bad Guys\"), especially noted most prominently in the character of the Wolf, and even in Puss during their showdown fight scenes.The voice work of the actors really captured the personalities of the characters. Antonio Banderas's voice had the bravado, arrogance and charisma of Puss, whom we've known and loved since he made his first appearance in \"Shrek 2\" (2004). Selma Hayek lends her sexy sassiness to the voice of the skillful thief Kitty Softpaws, who held a grudge against Puss. Florence Pugh's characteristic raspiness was easily recognizable in Goldilocks's voice.Like before, the characters Puss encounters were all fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. The choice for main antagonist was Jack Horner, the boy who sat in the corner eating his pies, but he was not little here anymore. He was not as famous as others, so some kids may need a review of his rhyme to refamiliarize. There were a trove of Disney character references you'll have fun identifying, from Mary Poppins, Alice in Wonderland and Jiminy Cricket.Very notable in this latest Dreamworks release is the darkness of the plot, which was also reflected in the artwork styles and situations depicted. Only in trickles, but this must be the first time blood was seen in a Dreamworks animated film. The language and humor used was also more mature, even with some assumed expletives bleeped out. As the topic of death played a major part in the story, scenes with the Wolf can be very scary for little kids. 8/10.PS: The new DreamWorks Animation opening logo precedes this film. It was quite nostalgic to see the DreamWorks boy seeing famous DreamWorks characters old an new -- like Toothless, Po, Boss Baby, a Troll, the Bad Guys and of course, Shrek with Fiona and Donkey -- as his crescent moon flew him around in space before settling in its place.",

            "content": "I did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, I've seen the main Shrek movies but noon of the other Puss in Boot's spin-offs. I was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!The story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. Between the melanchonic Puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.The two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. First of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first Shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. While the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.Secondly, while Disney/Pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished CGI style, Puss in boots goes full Into the Spiderverse once a fight breaks out. Glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. Especially Puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.While not entirely original, the Puss in Boots: The Last Wish combines the edgy humor of Shrek with the visual wonders of Into the Spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to Logan than any other animation I can think off. Oh and just in case (not that I personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception.",

I can't think of a good one that I've seen since How To Train Your Dragon 2.But then I read all of the brilliant reviews and decided to give this one a go. And to my surprise, it was definitely a welcome change.Puss gets an existential crises when Death (AKA the Big Bad Wolf) comes for his last life after Puss has frivolously wasted his 8 other ones. It's interesting how dark it gets in these scenes, with Puss, who has never been afraid of death, gets scared and has a wakeup call. And learns to value life and the lives of others a bit more.Although it doesn't go as far as I thought it would when it came to heavy themes and character development, it certainly reminded me of the good old days of DreamWorks animation. So I absolutely consider this film a step in the right direction for this studio.",

            "content": "This is genuinely one of my favorite films of the year. I hope it gets real recognition and people don't dismiss it as \"just an animated film\".I've always liked DreamWorks films, with my favorite being How to Train Your Dragon 2, but after rewatching the first Puss in Boots movie, I wasn't expecting much for this sequel, eleven years after. I like the first installment for sure but it's certainly a lot simpler in story than I'd prefer. This one however, has such a rich emotional aspect to it that I truly felt something during it.There were also certain scenes involving a wolf character that were quite creepy. I think kids will have a lot of fun with this movie, but at the core this is a story about family and understanding the value of things and/or people who are in front of you already. And that's a message that every person of any age can get something out of. The voice acting is top-notch and the animation is such a ridiculous step-up from the last time. This is such a cool direction to take this sequel into and I dug it all the way through.There's really not much negative to say other than the ending feels like it should have been slightly more concise, but that's it. I loved it and I'll rewatch it as soon as it releases on VOD.",

            "content": "Seems that these days all the animated kids movies are more or less the same, with very few exceptions in recent years and it's grown tiresome. It's always potty humor and/or a weak storyline that either has adults rolling their eyes or falling asleep. This is one of the exceptions.With pitch perfect voice acting from all parts of the cast, to the way it makes old story concepts feel relatively fresh and funny again, this one is a winner. Best of all was the film doesn't rely on low brow, toilet humor to sell it's laughs. My favorite of which came from a certain play on Jiminy Cricket that I'm sure will have you in stitches.The animation had me a bit underwhelmed which is why I deduct a star, but that is subjective, so I leave that bit up to the viewer to decide for themselves. For me, when the action gets going, it felt glitchy and incomplete, but some people might enjoy that style.Overall, I highly recommend this one when it releases later this month. It's definitely a film that both kids and parents will find entertaining and enjoyable. I know I enjoyed it.4.5 retired heros out of 5.",

I'm beyond thrilled that Dreamworks decided to ditch the hyper-realistic animation style, and just went for a style that would perfectly represent the emotions and craziness that this movie needed.The characters, EVERY SINGLE ONE, was so fleshed out, and they all felt like they had a purpose being there. We didn't get the usual Shrek style, Grimm fairytale cameos for no reason, on the contrary, they all played an important role in the story, and in the overall message.This movie also had me so emotional, no spoilers, but it's the way the creators handle their characters, with such sincerity and heart.Finally, the action, and the plot itself, it was go go go from the get go, i haven't seen a more well paced film all year, i think that is my favourite part of the dilm (Avatar 2 could take some notes)Overall, it was truly such a blast, so fun, heartfelt, FUNNY, genuine, with a great message at its core.",

But, I think the kids still understood it enjoyed the deeper parts.Personally, the movie was very fitting. Like Puss, I'm also trying to find out who I am and who I want to be in life. This was our journey.The stories have great connections romantically, between rivals and newcomers. The stories are about bringing all of us together despite what happened in the past. The stories come together about building a better future for ALL OF US. Let go of selfish wants and desires, focus on OTHERS and let's work together for a better future!",

Donde est\u00e1 la Leche?The first 30 minutes of the movie are filled with your typical Puss as he sings, dances, and fights with his ever-so-charismatic yet cocky personality. He is quickly humbled when he finds out he needs to be more careful with his life, and this is where I was instantly hooked.Then enters the big bad wolf, from the wolf's menacing character design, skin trembling voice to the life-threatening fighting style. Wolf was one of the fantastic antagonists. I questioned whether this would be too much for the younger audience because the wolf's scenes struck fear in our beloved Puss. Although, as a viewer, we know nothing serious will happen, I felt this was a strong enough case for the plot.It didn't end there; we are introduced to various fairytale Characters. I am not going to spoil too much.Overall, the movie is fast-paced, has adult humor, and represents a love story, greed, and the beauty of friendship.Verdict: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fun time for the family; I would suggest watching it if you have younger ones. Even if you don't have younger ones and are a fan of the Shrek universe, it's worth the watch. Shoutout to Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek for there wonderful performances!",

Why on earth are you giving this one a 10?!?\"Because this movie...is DIFFERENT than the others. Different in that it strives to be a funnier, deeper, prettier, bolder, edgier, (surprisingly) scarier and overall more complete experience than the original Puss in Boots film over 11 years ago, and unlike that movie holds a distinct accomplishment in simply being a darn fine animated film that stands on its own, one as good as any I've seen in the past few years.The Shrekiverse is officially back, and judging by what DreamWorks managed to pull off here the world probably isn't ready for whatever comes next. Seriously, this gives the first two films in the franchise alone a run for their money.Looks like The House That Shrek Built is finally back on top again.PS: That cricket with the spot-on Jimmy Stewart voice is one of the funniest things I've seen this year, whoever came up with him deserves a pay raise and a medal and free coffee and recognition from the United Nations.",

He own the Horner character and brought some of the best lines.-Wagner Moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the Big-Bad Wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-Though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-Pugh is okay, not my favorite role as Goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. Note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-Guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy Is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. It does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-Hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-Banderas takes Boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the Spanish stereotype. And yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.The References/Jokes\n-The stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of Shrek.-It's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-The fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-It feels like the first two Shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. Again, refreshing that they were able to step back.The Designs Changes To An Extent\n-Creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-Like Into the Spiderverse? Good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that Puss does.-Not overused, which is very good for me.The Action At Times\n-Shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-This movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-The ending fight shows the potential of what DreamWorks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes I've seen this year.The Heart\n-Lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-The movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-There are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. That's hard to do in many things.-I love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-Have not felt this way since Shrek 2.DISLIKES:The Darkness\n-It's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-Caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-Might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.Predictable\n-The lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-The movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-Kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.Too Many Antagonists\n-One of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all\n-They do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-Need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-Several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.The Comedy Is Still Tapered\n-It's starting to go back to Shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-Still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-Where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made Shrek, Shrek.-They took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.The Animation Changes At Times\n-The animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-The comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the Spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-Just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.The Action Still Not Complete\n--Shrek and Shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-This movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-The stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-They sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-Often was shorter than I wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. Chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.The VERDICT\nI must say, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish was a much better film than when I walked in. Perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the Shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. Animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. It evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. And it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. This film is indeed a solid return to the world and I had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. However, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. Balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance I was looking for. The movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with Puss In Boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. And the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the Shrek that we saw in the first two movies. Still, I do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things.",

It has some very dark scenes and a surprising amount of violence, which is complimented by a ton of great dark humor (mostly brought on by John Mulaney's character). The characters are all very well developed and fleshed out (everyone has backstories for example), many of them get satisfying archs. On the technical side, this film is incredibly animated and every frame looks gorgeous. It has a unique style on the animation that really makes this movie its own, and it doesn't feel like a rip-off of spider verse to me at all. There's a ton of detail and symbolism to analyze with this film as well, especially in the battle scenes between Puss and the Wolf, which have a ton of interesting details and moves (as far as a cat vs a wolf goes).I always complain about finales in animated movies being underwhelming, but this movie had an amazing finale that is not too short or too long, has some amazing battles, character archs, and satisfying moments (also the setpiece they use is AWESOME)This movie is great for kids and adults. It's just that good.",

He never sounds like he's phoning it in once and still has all the charisma and energy of the character after all these years.Salma Hayek also has just as much energy and charm this time around and has a very natural chemistry with Banderas. Harvey Guillen could've easily become annoying with his endless optimism but that never happens and he's just so lovable and pure.Wagner Moura is note perfect with an all time great animated villain whose threatening voice acting matches his characters visual look so well and is able to bring new life to a film that's already so alive whenever he's on screen.Joel Crawford's direction is amazing, the action sequences are so inventive and fun to watch and the lower frame rate makes them even better. The animation itself is absolutely gorgeous, so much better than what came before with a vibrancy that stuns from beginning to end as an oil painting come to life.",

The dog was a delight, and the bear family's arc was genuinely touching with several emotional moments.They also landed the ending, and the final shot not only gave me major Pirates Of The Carribbean vibes, it also gave me so much hope for what's to come.

Such a fun time, and so worth seeing in the theaters, though we'll definitely be picking up a copy once it's out on DVD!Without giving too much away, there are several different antagonists in this movie that scratch all the bad-guy itches, covering the spectrum from totally hateable to horrifying to relatable and sympathetic. A great cast! Also, the magical world they came up with for this movie was awesome, with some really cool/unique features!At first, we were a little worried about the dog character, neither of us being big fans of daffy sidekicks, but we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves rooting for him! He's hilarious, and that's coming from a cat-lover!Several callbacks to the first Puss in Boots movie made this one feel less like a spin-off than a worthy standalone franchise, and the movie was PACKED with magical references that all ages will be able to recognize and enjoy.Do yourself a favor and free a few hours for this one!! A rare 10 from me!!",

It works on so many levels: as a high-speed comedy, all the jokes land, but as a story about mortality and the meaning of life, this film is oddly compelling and mature. The plot literally involves Puss running from the personification of death, hoping to cling to his life.

            "content": "After losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, Puss in Boots is down to his last life. An encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. After escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name Puss in Boots and begins life as an adopted cat. He learns about the Dark Forest where someone can make a wish on the Wishing Star. With this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.A little late to review this movie, but I still caught it in theaters. I knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. At first, I was wondering why DreamWorks is creating another Puss in Boots movie. It feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. As someone who has not watched the original Puss in Boots, I do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe Puss' relationship with Kitty Softpaws. With that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is everything I love about animated films. First of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. The movie has probably the best animation from a CGI film I have ever seen. Not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. There are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of Puss staring in the eyes of Death. These shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. Every shot in this movie looks awesome. The animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. This movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. The set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. The opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, I knew I was in for a ride. The soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for Puss in Boots.Fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. This movie pushes its PG rating. There is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. The story is about how Puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. If he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. This is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. With that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. This movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the Wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. It never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. I love the snarky dialogue, Perrito gets one scene with Goldilocks and the Three Bears that steals the show comedy wise. This movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.In addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. Puss is at his best. He is the same awesome and adorable character from Shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. He starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that Death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. His friends Kitty Softpaws and especially Perrito are great characters too. Perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. He is also surprisingly aware of emotions. There is one scene with him and Puss that warmed my heart.As for the antagonists, the Wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. He has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out Puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. He is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. Kids might have nightmares because of him. Goldilocks and the Three Bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. Then there is the gluttonous scumbag Jack Horner. This is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. They make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and I love it. We need more outright terrible people in new animated films. He is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.Every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. It helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with Antonio Banderas as Puss, Salma Hayek as Kitty, Harvey Gull\u00e9n as Perrito, John Mulaney as Jack Horner and especially Wagner Moura as the Wolf. Moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation I have seen in a while. Each person brings their character to life in this movie. I can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. That is how you know that you have a great cast.There is not a dull moment in this movie. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is everything I love about animation and more. I did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when I saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, I knew this movie was going to be a ride. I did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. I really hope it wins best animated feature at the Academy Awards this year. DreamWorks deserves this one. Check it out as soon as you can.",

            "content": "In an age when movie and TV franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (I'm looking at you, Disney), I don't think anyone was expecting much from Puss In Boots: The Last Wish - certainly not I.After the first 5 minutes, I knew this was something special.Firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from Arkane and Enter The Spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. The 2D elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.The music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).The dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. Not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling I think I've ever seen. In a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. The cast do a great job of selling them too. Goldi and the bears come out with brilliant British-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.And then there's the wolf. This character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. His style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, I'm serious).At a time when Disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - Dreamworks have taken on the mantle.It made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on rewatching. Partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people new right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. You might think I'm overselling it, but Hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.There are those that say that Hollywood is done - I know I did. But Dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way.",

            "content": "It may seem like Puss in Boots: The Last Wish pointless ridiculous film on the surface ..... but there is a lot to like about this animated DreamWorks film; the movie delivers on several levels making it worth your time seeking out . I am praising the overall aesthetic. The animation is more advanced, the movie looked like it was a fairy tale painting. Takes advantage of modern CG technologies lovingly paired with more traditional 2D techniques. In the opening, the film uses more hand-drawn techniques like your yesteryear cartoons . And as it progresses the technique harnessed new advancements in CG technology to reintroduce this fairy tale world in new and refreshing way.....It is quite the spectacle to witness and in 3D to boot !!! Not the Same Old CG. In the animation, they actually took off motion blur so that it frames stutters . I have actually never seen animation technique like this before ! Really made this fantastical hybrid.Puss in Boots: The Last Wish Mashed up a Spaghetti Western with a fairy tale, so you get those beautiful Western compositions and staging opportunities, but then you get these fantastical locations born out of your imagination.Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll: he has burnt through eight of his nine lives. Puss sets out on an epic journey to find the mythical Last Wish and restore his nine lives.And the movie is all brought to life with a cast full of Oscar nominated and winner actors; It makes all the sense in the world when you've got an entire universe populated by iconic fairy tale characters like Goldilocks (Florence Pugh), the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo), the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), Little Jack Horner (John Mulaney), and even Puss himself (Antonio Banderas).This is a \"must-see\" for all. There are so many takeaways. This movie kept me wanting more. It was great to see all the fairy tale characters in play wanting something they already possessed, needing to appreciate the moment--learning to be mindful of what we already have around us everyday. It's equal parts exciting and hilarious as well as earnest. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish mixes stunning animation with a poignant, surprisingly mature story . 8/10.",

            "review_title": "A Strange Comparison(with Breaking Bad) and Then Some",
            "content": "In the Shrek movies, Puss in Boots was a very likable character. I think it is safe to assume that most of the people who love Shrek (specifically Shrek 2) also enjoy seeing Puss in Boots. It is enjoyable to watch him, doesn't interfere much with the themes of movies but has funny scenes and great action. As I was thinking of these things, I realized something. He is just like Saul Goodman from Breaking Bad. Saul Goodman is a great character in Breaking Bad. He is great in scenes he is in and is so fun to watch but he isn't much of a character. Then Better Call Saul came and Saul Goodman (Jimmy Mcgill) became as complex as (if not more) Walter. First Puss in Boots movie wasn't like that for Puss. It was more of the same in Shrek movies. This movie delivers the character Puss in Boots desperately needed and then some. His arc in this movie is amazing and in a perfect world, the script of this movie would get an Adapted Screenplay nomination at the Oscars this year (considering the fact that the competition in the Adapted Screenplay category is nonexistent).Death is an amazing villain. Having shorter screen time than most characters makes him an even better character. Again another comparison to Better Call Saul, Death is like Lalo Salamanca. Lalo also doesn't have a big screen time in the six seasons of the show, but he is easily one of the most memorable characters. Death is always there, back in the audience's mind, and just when you forget that he exists, he returns. His whistle, his charisma... Brilliant!Puss and Kitty's storyline and conflict are very complex when you remember that this is an animated movie mostly targeted at kids. The themes of legacy, the meaning of life, and the fear of attachment are very refreshing to see in an animated movie again. The addition of Perrito creates a great contrast between him and Puss and I would even go further to say that it can even spark some philosophical discussions about which way to live is better for you. Legacy or living a life where you are comfortable with your family.I loved the additions of the three bears and Goldilocks. Their storyline was also fairly interesting to see progress but its pacing could have been better, which makes them the weakest links of the film which is a d**n good weak link if you ask me. The character of Jack Horner. He has very funny moments and is very interesting to see a villain who is truly deeply villainous with no point of return in an animated movie. The conscience bug thing was also interesting to see unfold.The animation and action scenes are superb. Especially the ones with Death. Death is so good that I can't believe it. There are many jokes that land, songs that are fun and most importantly the movie structurally works. It just works. With this many characters, with this many plotlines, with this many detours, you might think that it is impossible to tie this in a great package. But they do. When this movie is at its worst, it is decent but when it is at its best it is one of the best-animated movies, ever.Where did this movie come from? I would have wanted to be a kid when I first watched this movie. I would have been scared but I would have loved it. Then I would have watched it again, sometime. And then again. It would have created nostalgia and at my age today when I would have looked back I would have said, \"it is not the best-animated movie ever, but it is my favorite animated movie ever.\" because it would have been. What more can I say?",

            "content": "I have seen good movies in the year of 2022, but Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022) is by far the best animated movie of 2022 and is my favorite movie from that year. Also, it is the best movie in the Shrek franchise.The voice cast is great; Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots was great, Salma Hayek was great, and Harvey Guill\u00e9n as Perrito was great because they are good characters, and they are funny. Florence Pugh as Goldilocks, Olivia Colman as Mama Bear, Ray Winstone as Papa Bear, and Samson Kayo as Baby Bear were funny, and they were also good characters.There is this wolf villain in the movie that is legit creepy, was such a cool character. He does certain things that makes him a great villain for Puss in Boots to go against, and he is voiced by Wagner Moura who has a great voice for this character.The animation is beautiful in this movie; it has amazing action scenes, pretty scenery, and imaginable locations that look great in this animation style. The movie is also creative in how it uses fairytale locations and items from those stories, which is what makes another villain character voiced by John Mulaney funny to watch.The movie has a simple plot but does it in a creative way with great characters, and some little references to Shrek. What I especially loved was how Puss in Boots starts laughing in the face of danger, but because he is on his last life, he starts getting scared and starts thinking about what he has done with his earlier lives and how spent them.I had a fun time with Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022); it has fantastic animation, it was funny, it has great characters, it has great emotional moments, and there are great action scenes. I highly recommend checking this movie out because you will have gun with it, and I am excited to see this movie again when I get the chance.",

Speaking for myself, I knew nothing about Puss because I had never seen a single movie in the 'Shrek' lineup, which sparked my curiosity even more.To prep for this allegedly wonderful sequel, I had to finish the first film first, which I did. I saw the first Puss in Boots movie this morning, but to my utter disappointment, it did not meet my expectations, and uncertainty worked its way in. I was worried about whether the sequel would live up to the hype.And I am pleased to report that it did. 'The Last Wish' may not be among the best films I have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'Perrito' and 'Death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting.",

            "content": "\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" is a fun adventure in the \"Shrek\" universe! I gotta admit I have not seen the original film, and don't cherish the \"Shrek\" films as much as many do... so I went into this with mild expectations. And honestly, I had a good time; it was cute! Do I think it was as good as many other reviewers have suggested? No. But it was enjoyable, lighthearted fun that is perfect for families with kids! The voice cast was awesome, especially John Mulaney and Florence Pugh as the villains, Jack Horner and Goldilocks respectively. And of course Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots is iconic as ever!The animation here was gorgeous too, honestly it was one of my favourite parts. I love that major studio animated movies are finally starting to take more risks with their animation style, moving away from the typical 3D CGI realism. You gotta respect \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" for starting this trend and showing that different styles can work! I loved that this had a more watercolor, storybook illustration look to it, it really worked for the story and was employed in such creative ways! I would love to see the \"Shrek\" movies take this on, but alas they seem to have established their own look. This movie just looked so cool, so distinct in its own style, it really felt like I was watching a story in a fairy tale world.Now, of course I have to admit I didn't love this movie. Something about it felt off to me, I couldn't seem to see where the acclaim was coming from. Sure, it was fun, it was cute, and I enjoyed myself while watching, but I never felt like I truly connected with the film. The opening scene felt a little jumbled to me, rapidly going from a musical sequence, to comedy for kids, to an action scene and I wished it would've let me settle into the story a bit first. I get this is a movie primarily for kids, but with most animation they tend to make parts enjoyable for the parents and older audiences as well. I don't really feel that here - they tried with the themes and the deeper storyline - but it never actually worked in my eyes. Everything felt very kid-focused, which isn't a bad thing, it just meant I wasn't the core audience and so it makes sense why I wouldn't enjoy it as much. I have to say, the kids in my theatre seemed to be having a blast! I'm sure this is a great movie for families with children, it just wasn't as good as I was told it would be.I think the movie tried to do a bit of what Pixar is known for, the whole \"trying to be deep\" thing. The movie involves Puss in Boots coming to terms with death, and it seemed to be somewhat shallow, it never truly dove into this aspect of the story. Instead, the storyline is very linear and somewhat dull where it is just about the characters traveling to their destination and the villains sometimes catching up and then combat ensuing. And the physical goal literally being the spiritual goal just makes the inevitable plot point of \"maybe I don't need the thing I wanted all long and it's the friends I made along the way that count\" seem all the more predictable. Even Puss' relationship with the side characters is unchallenging. Although he is deeply flawed, his companions never seem to care about that and forgive him all the time. The chemistry of the characters was just nowhere as endearing as in \"Shrek\". Still the adventure was quite fun, I just didn't think the themes clicked as it felt like they were trying to be deep in a way that is not as organic and surprising as a film like Pixar's \"Up\", \"Finding Nemo\" or even DreamWorks' \"How to Train Your Dragon\".Perhaps I am being too harsh, I feel like this review is sounding more negative than anything. I really did have fun with it, and overall would give it a thumbs up, it's an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. The animation was really cool, the voice cast was great, and man I loved the little nods to the \"Shrek\" movies even if I was never a huge fan of those. If nothing else, this movie did make me really hopeful for another \"Shrek\" film. I do enjoy this fairy tale world and the creative animation they used to tell the story!",

Seeing the studio go all in on a sequel that nobody asked for was a ballsy move, but fortunately they absolutely got it right.Puss in Boots The Last Wish is an unexpectedly fantastic film that not only tells a great story, but it takes risks by diving into topics of death and mortality, something that you wouldn't expect from an animated kids' film. Not only that, but much of the humor was very risky, with the cursing jokes being the ones that made my eyes open widest. It wasn't a bad thing to me, it just really caught me off-guard. I always like it when animated films take risks without making it seem like they're trying to hard to be edgy. This film doesn't do the unnecessary.

There are also 2 other factions of villains who are extremely funny to watch and also have a really satisfying and relatively well told character arc.

Other than the characters (and something in the end), there's nothing here that comes close to Shrek or the first Puss in Boots movie. What there are are layers and layers of colorful landscapes, anime movements, well-grounded humor, absurd humor, children's humor and even for each character there is a lesson behind it, don't forget that after all, this is a fairy tale.The really great thing about this film is that it's a multi-layered work, which makes it suitable for all audiences. However, the most salvageable is the lesson that remains for the film industry itself: It doesn't matter to wait more than ten years to make a sequel, as long as it's well done.

He will need to rely on some old friends and a new one if he hopes to succeed.This movie is directed by Joel Crawford (The Croods: A New Age) and contains the voices of Antonio Banderas (The Mask of Zorro), Salma Hayek (Desperado), Florence Pugh (The Falling), John Mulaney (Big Mouth) and Olivia Colman (Hot Fuzz).The storyline for this picture is very smart with more depth than you may anticipate. The animation is tremendous and the action and fight scenes are fun. The opening sequence with the troll, the battle with the wolf in the bar and the final fight were excellent. The map scene was cool too. The voices are perfectly selected and it was great seeing Hayek's return. The dialogue is very well written and contains more depth, emotion, comedy and lessons than I anticipated going in. The little dog was an awesome new character and Harvey Guill\u00e9n (The Internship) was a perfect choice as its voice. The ending was a perfect way to close each storyline and sub plot.Overall, this is a very well done movie that is fun for the entire family. I would score this a 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.",

The movie has incredible voice acting, hilarious moments, tremendous action sequences and beautiful animation. If you're a fan of the unique art style of \"Into the Spider-verse\", you'll truly appreciate the style that this film throws out at times.It also has so much heart. This movie pulls on the heart-strings as much as any animated film could possibly do.Also, Wagner Moura's character is done so well that you'll leave the film with a lasting impression of him.If you're on the fence about seeing this movie, please watch it. For me, this film came completely out of nowhere and it honestly shocked me how well it was done.Great stuff!",

            "content": "This funny, charming and adorable, yet often quite dark, gloomy and intense Puss in Boots adventure isn't your typical cash-grabbing kids' movie. It's been over a decade since the first Puss in Boots movie, which was a spin-off in the Shrek franchise featuring the loveable ginger cat in tiny boots wielding a mini sword. But this is unashamedly the best they've done since the first and second Shrek movies.When Puss in Boots learns that he's already burnt through eight of his nine lives, he embarks on an epic quest to find the mythical wishing star to restore his lives. Get it? Because cats have nine lives? Anyway, it's a pretty simple storyline that doesn't sound, and isn't really too complicated. However, this movie isn't getting all the praise for its animation techniques, vocal performances and all of that, although it definitely deserves major credit for the cast's brilliant work and the gorgeous 3D animation style that likes to pick some moments to do in a clever, witty 2D.Forgivably, you can never expect a family comedy in theatres that isn't guaranteed to have its extended moments of silly humour, but these very occasional scenes don't overtake the heavy themes this movie wants to consider, which is actually life and death. There are three parties of antagonists, some who are more villainy than the others, but there's fairy tale characters Goldilocks, the three bears and Jack Horner, and similar to the party this movie features as the protagonists, they all have meaning, struggles and thoughtful backstories to them. But it's the main villain who appears as a whistling wolf who provides the sense of dread. And when you take into consideration villain construction, appearances and overall sense of menace, he's one of the best antagonists of the year.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

            "review_title": "Nuanced narrative and characterizations of side characters and especially the protagonist and antagonist. Entertaining, well choreographed, and fantastic cinematography",
            "content": "I really love Puss' characterization and development in this movie. He is a fearless and brave individual and he found identity in that. But in most ways, he took it for granted. He lived a life where his 9 lives were disposable, where there was no true value in them, until his final one.So, when the doctor confronted him on the reality of the situation, he hated it. Mocked it even. He's the fearless Puss in boots after all. What would his life be if he wasn't living in danger? But only when confronted by a bounty hunter coming after his life, and being completely overwhelmed in battle, where he truly realizes the reality and value of his 1 singular life.And this part of the movie gave me literal chills. The animation and visual team did an amazing job showing Puss' despair, with his hair standing up as it slowly reaches to his face, and how he was willing to go through a toilet to save himself. The lengths he was willing to take to live is so reflective of what humans would do to live, sometimes even doing morally evil things too.He wasn't fearless, he was full of fear. He wasn't Puss in Boots, he was a scaredy cat.Puss has a traumatic experience from that throughout the entire movie, with the wolf's signature whistle being a huge trigger for him, and it's such a menacing way of introducing him into the scene too.Speaking of the wolf, he's such a menacing and terrifying antagonist. His presence and character design are great, but what makes him so scary is his visual portrayal mixed with the voice acting. The movie wasn't afraid to not cater to kids and to not be limited by that. Which is a problem I have with some films, where mature themes aren't done to the fullest potential due to limitations. The way he effortlessly dodges Puss' attacks and instills fear into him is so memorable and impactful.Puss being haunted by the fear of death is something we need to take into consideration too in our lives. People love to live in the present, but also don't see the biggest problem of death right in front of us. We rather not think about it because it's such a scary reality. So, when life hits us, we're like Puss facing the reality of death for the first time. We're vulnerable and afraid. And not everyone tells people about how they're feeling. Some people keep it to themselves, which is what Puss did throughout the movie till he shows vulnerability and expresses his fears to Perro the dog.Even the most powerful people will still succumb to the fear of death when reality hits them.Goldilocks and the 3 bears were also amazing characters, where she was seeking for the wishing star because she doesn't have an ordinary family. By \"just right\", she wanted and craved for a human family. She used her foster family as steppingstones to reach her goal of replacing them, which is so tragic because she faces an issue of envy. When a person is clouded with envy, they aren't grateful for what they have, and would do what they can to obtain what they don't have.I also love the build up to the eventual reveal of her wish. Her appreciating the simpler times with the bears in their house was so heart-warming. It's the small things that often go unappreciated, like how she would hold this fairy tale book as a child wherever she would go, sleeping on comfy bed, drinking soup with her foster family, and so on. Sometimes, you just have to stop and take a look around you. You have a house to live that house's memories. You have food and water. You have transport to go to different places. You have photos with your families and friends that you can reminisce. You can even go beyond that and just admire the complexities of the world. How trees give you shade when it's a sunny day, or how the sky has a pleasing and calming colour, and even animals and how unique they all are.There are a lot more aspects that I really love about this movie but I'll stop right here. I definitely recommend watching it. Not only is it narratively nuanced, but the pacing of the movie is also good. Cinematography and choreography of the fights are so well done too, which is one benefit of the movie being 2.5D.",

I suspect it was to make the movie feel more \"full\", otherwise it would've felt a little empty with just Jack Horner versus Puss.Puss's side characters were great. I thought the dog was going to be an annoying ADHD character but he's got depth.90% of the jokes land. The pacing is brisk. Didn't realize it was almost 2 hours because it was so engaging.

Besides some small critiques of the animation style and some crude humor, the film was near perfect.The storytelling was unique to the franchise and seemed genuinely inspired. The script reflects this. Without giving too much away, Puss learns valuable lessons, and the film itself contains a good overall moral message.The film can seem a bit dark at times with lots of comedic but somewhat frightening deaths, however some jokes are spread throughout to lighten the tone.Personally, I felt the antagonistim was one of the most well written of all time. Very reminiscent of the Oscar winning character of Anton Chigurh from No Country for Old Men.The animation was intentionally low frame rate in action scenes, however I found it worked much better in the final scenes where the frame rate was the full 24 (not 12). Some might find the film anticlimactic in a few ways, but overall, most would find the movie well worth their time and money.9/10 stars!",

And I have to say that it has mostly met my expectations. This is a damn good movie.This movie reminds me of an old fashioned animated adventure. With different characters competing to complete a quest, almost like a treasure hunt. And it's really really entertaining. The soundtrack is so good. The animation is gorgeous. It was something similar to hand drawn animation during the action sequences and that surprisingly made it really cool. The direction is also really cool, especially how they portrayed Puss's character and the Villain's.I won't deny that the story, and the messages are pretty much predictable. But this is one of those movies that even if you know, what's going to happen, it's still very exciting when it happens. My theatre had such an unenthusiastic crowd this time because trust me, there are some crowd-cheering sequences towards the end.Now let's talk about the characters, which I think is the core of this movie. Puss is a likeable character, if you've seen the 1st movie you'd already know that. But this time we see some different sides of him and actually saw his vulnerable version. That made him a great protagonist worth rooting for. The side characters and the side-villains are really entertaining as well, and I loved the direction they took with some of them. They don't overdo a certain type of humour and spread out all these different types of characters throughout the movie, which was clever.And now THE VILLAIN. Easily one of the coolest villains I've seen in a while. Whenever, he even made an appearance, I got goosebumps. And the animation and direction is just amazing with his scenes.I also really liked how deep they took Puss's character arc, looking back at how he has lived up till now and what it actually means to be brave. And the villain actually played an integral part in that.In the end, this is a great movie, and I'd recommend watching this in theatre, and with an open mind.(You don't really need to watch the first part. They introduce the previous characters well and the first part isn't really that good either)",

He ends up in the home of a cat lady while searching for a map to guide him to a fallen star, which will grant him a wish (to get his lives back). Also looking for the map are Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Big Jack Horner, a small dog disguised as a cat, and Puss' old love Kitty Softpaws.This was enormously entertaining. The story was fairy story familiar, but with enough wrinkles to keep you interested, and the fun reversal of seeing Puss very far from his confident self. The sight gags are non-stop and the voice talent is great. And there is a huge amount of heart here, and the payoff is nicely delivered.This well worth a watch.",

This movie was surprisingly good considering the first was ok and released about a decade ago but they somehow naturally built upon that movie and made this.The way Puss tackles his mortality was was really, especially with the death character (my absolute favorite character in the movie, along with Jiminy cricket). The way they portrayed death was just excellent from the voice, to the design, to his fight scenes with those sickles. With the intro fight it really does set the tone for the rest of the movie with him having Puss on the run.Along with Puss the other characters are also great. Every character has a well defined insecurity (idk if that's the right word) minus the dog but he's seems to be happy to care so whatever. Then the other main villain is just so fun with all his fairy tale weapons everything is just creative and well written.",

            "content": "Besides the presence of Kitty, I could've been convinced that there was no Puss in Boots 1. The sequel is closer to standalone than direct. And more than just being different story-wise, Puss in Boots is not even close to the same movie as the first one. For starters, the animation is really creative. It takes a page out of Spider-Verse to look intentionally choppy at times by messing with the frame rate to give it a comic-like feel. To aid this, the art in this movie is incredible. Some things are more abstract than realistic, there are beautiful colors that contrast, and there's tons of creative scenery. It almost feels like the creative team made beautiful paintings and tried to build a movie out of it rather than make a movie and then fill in the scenery, which works really well here. Next, the movie is way darker. It's plenty funny like all DreamWorks movies, but whereas the original was entirely fun, this one was very dark. The wolf villain, in particular, was one of the scariest villains of the year. The dark aesthetic, the voice acting, the uncanny whistle and soundtrack, and the camerawork all created fear perfectly. He was probably my favorite part. Also like all DreamWorks movies, it's sweet and heartwarming. The only downside of this movie is that, besides the animation, nothing blows me away. It's not as funny as The Bad Guys, as heartwarming as How to Train Your Dragon, or as action-packed as Kung Fu Panda. Everything about it is good but not great. But the brilliant animation gets an otherwise decent movie to become nearly perfect.",

I wasn't expecting much, until I started listening to the reviews and opinions about this one, I definitely wasn't expecting this level.The script is zany, witty and full of heart as it deals with important topics like trusting those close to you, finding purpose, fear of death, loneliness and even mental health. And it tackles these topics in ways that are always understandable for all ages, but never insultingly simplified.What I also didn't expect were the action sequences, they are very well choreographed and beautifully animated, I also appreciate that the film was at times scary and violent, while still being a film for all ages, it makes for a more complex story with real weight on the characters.Puss in Boots 2 takes the resources and adapts them to a mature story in the midst of the crazy world of Shrek, resulting in a gorgeous film of the kind I haven't seen in a while, it really is one to watch at the cinema.I think this film shows a growth in DreamWorks both visually, it left me sincerely surprised, as in maturity of the plot, a dark story, for the whole family with an intelligent humor, at the level of their classic gems, I hope this is the new direction for DreamWorks.",

            "content": "Today I watched a shrek sequel and it was very goodYeah, this movie was a complete shocker to me as I really didn't expect anything from it going in. But uh yeah this movie really does have everything going for it, it's funny, it has a lot of really intense action, there's actual stakes which doesn't feel like the case in most kids movies, and it has a really charming unique personality to it.If there's anything that I didn't like from the movie, it would really have to be the mixing in the opening of the movie. It felt like Pickles wasn't properly mixed into the scene, and I really could not hear half of the words he was saying, thankfully this only really went on through the first maybe 10-15 minutes of the film, basically when the opening stops. Besides that you can make an argument that there are clich\u00e9 and predictable elements to this film. There was one instance when i noticed Pickles literally change sizes between scenes and then it never happened again, it was during a fight scene near the beginning where he got tossed around.However, though its story structure is predictable, this is reductive a bit. It's a three act structure with a typical ending you'd see in 1000 movies till this point, but the way that the movie goes to reach this point feels like it's own unique true journey. Every character reaches their logical end in such a satisfying fashion, it's easy to overlook that. The story basically perfectly led to the ending and didn't really leave me feeling like I could ask for more in that regard from a modern day shrek sequel.This film genuinely feels like characters are in real danger. It feels like every character, no matter how small or big, has a distinct personality and look to them, and they can absolutely die. That feels really good in a movie to feel like there's a real challenge to overcome, something this movie does excellently. The villains feel like real villains and are actually pretty menacing, showing a real threat within the story to the main characters. Also I cannot tell you how nice it is to have a comic relief character be pivotal to the story and not annoying. Seriously it's so common and annoying(I'll never forgive you treasure planet \ud83d\ude22)The film looks absolutely gorgeous. It's like a pastel paradise of colors. The animation is smooth when it needs to be and stylistically choppy during intense pivotal points. All of the characters look fantastic and stylistically distinct from the other cgi art styles I've seen in the past. Each character is immediately recognizable as their own. I want to pet the dog.The action scenes are so dang well executed. It doesn't feel to abnormally fluid and I feel this to be assisted by the intentionally choppy animation style during these scenes. They also use comic book style action lines to emphasize certain movements and to drag your eyes to what they want you to focus on. The bad guys did something LIKE this basically but I feel that this movie really improves upon that style.Overall, I could spend a long time talking about how awesome and surprising this movie was for me. It was genuinely great, and probably my favorite shrek movie. Isn't that a funny thing to say, your favorite shrek movie is a puss n boots sequel. Please watch this movie it's very good. It's tremendously funny too btw.High 8/10.",

It's produced by the Dreamworks Animation studios and it's the first of their releases that uses their new logo; it contains characters from other Dreamworks movies. Antonio is still voicing Puss in Boots, who has used up 8 of his 9 lives and is going on a mission to find a magical wish to restore them. Salma voices Kitty, a previous acquaintance of Antonio's that is also in search of the magical wish for her own reasons. Florence voices a bounty hunter called Goldilocks-and yes, she has 3 bears as partners-that is also on the hunt for the wish. During the search for the wish, Wagner plays Death-disguised as the big bad wolf-in pursuit of Antonio to get his last life. The film has subtle hints of the famous Italian classic film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly with different people-or animals in this case-searching for a treasure and they all meet at the end to fight it out. The animation is a little different from what you normally see from Dreamworks but it was enjoyable.It's rated PG for action, violence, rude humor and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.I liked it and think it would be a good one for older kids-some of the younger ones might be scared in parts-and would be a good one to stream.",

            "content": "Puss in Boots proved itself to be the most impressionable installment in the Shrek film series. After what I've seen in the 2011 spin-off prequel, its follow-up The Last Wish really runs deep in to a more complex story with mature themes thrown into the mix. Like it still has its humor, charm, and lighthearted moments as before, but one thing that sets it off differently is the themes of mortality playing an integral part in Puss' life and the story.Well over a decade later after his last adventure (and shortly after the events of Shrek Forever After), Puss always proved to be the charmer, showboater, and all-around feline with his fancy boots, hat, and sword who thinks he can do no wrong even scoffing at the face of danger and death with all of his skills. However, upon learning that he is mortal after losing eight of his nine lives in the past and up until recently, Puss begins to question if he is truly worthy as the legend and he will need the fabled Wishing Star to set him straight.Antonio Banderas reprises his role with yet another great performance as well as the return of Salma Hayek as Kitty Softpaws. Marking their sixth movie together, they balance each other out well with both wittiness and passion. Their latest companion Perrito (played by What We Do in the Shadow's star Harvey Guillen) is good for wisecracks and his enthusiastic sense of humor. Much different from Zach Galifinakis' Humpty Dumpty in the 2011 film. The animation style is rather unique and was implemented here as it was with Academy Award-winning film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse. It's different from the photorealistic themes used before, but how it's used in the fight sequences gives off a storybook, painting-like feel and I admire that design.Now what had me thinking really carefully was the white wolf stalking Puss. For him to be revealed as Death itself and the thought about mortality being so prominent in Puss' life, it became rather meaningful during the duel between them. And that dagger he wielded to outsmart Death is a form of symbolism. Puss knew he can't escape death, but with all these fears and uncertainties plaguing his one life left, he overcame it with the one thing that never came to mind: Love.I actually heard a few audience members in my local auditorium quietly weeping over Puss' predicament and melancholy demeanor. I now see why awards season acknowledges this DreamWorks animated film. Left me intrigued and fascinated over what lies ahead next for him and his companions.",

            "content": "\"Puss in Boots: the Last Wish\" definitely didn't have the right to be this good. This is, by far, my favourite animated film of 2022! I like the first film. It's completely independent from the Shrek movies, Antonio Banderas is a charismatic protagonist and Humpty Dumpty is a great anti-anti-hero. That film wasn't perfect, it had some issues, and these issues are fixed here, and the positive stuff are almost squared.This is the true epic that our little Gato deserved. The first film has too little expedition and action, it was a lot more focused on universe and character building, so, despite disagreeing, I can understand some people's disappointment. But now, we are in a sequel, and being a sequel for an origin story, there is a lot more creative freedom. The amazing animation style says it all!The adventure is bigger, more brutal, more romantic, and taken more seriously, though more comically. The only forced moment here was made to be forced. From the previous film, Puss (Antonio Banderas) and Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) are the only reminiscent ones, and they're even better than they were in 2011. The new supporting cast is more numerous and does an extraordinary job.Perrito (Harvey Guill\u00e9n) is one of the best comic DreamWorks has ever made, Florence Pugh's voice fitted Goldilocks perfectly, she and the three bears make a dangerous quartet, and Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney) represents well the unstoppable hunger for power, and there's a famous character interacting with him that's hilarious.But the real showman here is my fellow countryman, Wagner Moura. The Big Bad Wolf is S tier villain. His presence is threatening, his whistle is chilling, and he has the best villain introduction I saw in a movie since \"Inglorious Basterds\". The best camera placing of 2022 is not in a live action. Curiously, the two best DreamWorks characters of the last year were wolves. Wagner and Sam Rockwell rocked!The story is original, but far from being unpredictable. However, like a lot of universally acclaimed Pixar movies (which some of them are deservelly acclaimed), it's not what story is being told, but how it's being told. Basic but complex, small but huge, ordinary but legendary! Esta es una aventura digna para el Gato con Botas.",

Holy cow it is superb and just beautiful to look at. The animation also accompanies the fantastic action to make it all the better. I watched it in Spanish so it didn't have the all of the same voice actors, besides Banderas and probably Salma Hayek, but everyone did an excellent job, especially from the main two I just mentioned. The fact that Puss in Boots only has one life left gives the story a lot more emotion than I was anticipating. This also gives way for themes about death, enjoying life while it lasts, making the most of it, and accepting your fate. The wolf is shown to be a frightening and threatening presence that for once makes Puss afraid, he not only gave Puss chills but gave me chills every single time he was on screen. The moments where we see Puss fearing death are arguably the most effective and emotional.

Practically, that is the plot of Shrek as well as of this film's.But I really, really enjoyed watching it. I did not get bored, I was hooked.

There's no extra noise or agendas to explain to an eleven year old. Just good wholesome entertainment for any type of family or any individual. I had forgotten about this series and was so happy to see it back to life and even happier there is more to come. Puss n boots final wish is the epitome of what family entertainment is supposed to be. Good story, great message, fun characters and excellent casting. My hope is other studios take note of the success of this movie and follow suit.",

            "content": "The cover art or movie poster of the animated movie lured me into watching. I know by heart the story of Puss In Boots because as a child I was fortunate to have an illustrated book of that immortal tale by Charles Perrault. Indeed I should credit the great man for making my childhood a colorful one with his classic fairy tales.Back to this horrendous C. G. I. Adaptation. Yes it is horrendously bad. It is so bad that people who have read the fairy tale, gasp. I understand the necessity to create something new to ensnare people into watching but to ruin what someone has created and taking the life out of it doesn't appeal to me.Verdict: Antonio Banderas(Assassins, The 13th Warrior) voice acts Puss in Boots. His co-star Salma Hayek(Desperado, Everly) plays Kitty Softpaws. The plot concern's Puss being killed by bell shortly after\nsubduing an earthen giant. Waking up, he is informed by a doctor that he only has one life after burning through his past eight and suggests he immediately retire from adventuring. Well Puss doesn't and the rest of the movie concerns comical events as he goes on a journey to find the mystical Last Wish for the Wishing Star so that he can restore the eight of his nine lives that he lost while escaping new enemies.I've seen too many good animated flicks to go deep into analyzing this one. In short seasoned movie fans won't find this one amusing. I enjoyed Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank more than this one.",

            "review_title": "The Best DreamWorks has been since the first How To Train Your Dragon",
            "content": "The obvious first standout offcourse is the gorgeous art design and direction taking the footsteps of the likes of Spiderverse and Arcane, accompanied with jaw dropping scenery, vibrant colours and hand drawn aesthetics that embrace the wacky and over exaggerated nature of the fairy-tale world perfectly presenting it like we've never seen it before, and I love how both the plot and action take advantage of them remarkably to create both some truly haunting and beautiful imagery, especially THE ACTION which as soon as you see frames dropping, you know some serious stuff is about to come down, as they completely soar with outstanding direction, unbelievable angle positions, phenomenal choreography, snapy and fluid shots, impeccable pacing and a ton of up lifting energy that whether it is a giant Shadow of the Colossus looking set piece or a simple confrontation between two characters, there was never a moment where something new wasn't being brought up to the table in terms of visuals, humour and details, bringing even some of the best action films to shame with its amount of creativity, charm and substance. Not to mention a well written script that understands perfectly what made the first two films so special, full of quotable lines, layered and surprising jokes that rarely miss and satisfying payoffs for almost every single character, plot line or event it introduces, that greatly balances the mockumentary aspects with more emotional and dramatic beats never feeling like one overestimating the welcome of the other, and both of these haven't been this greatly utilised since Shrek 2, from antagonising good characters to providing a genuine look at how a panic attack plays out and how to deal with it correctly (which brought me to such tears, like damn what a scene ). It is also wonderful to see the film continue the franchise tradition and deliver with banger musical numbers like Fearless Hero and Por qe te vas (which quickly became one of my go to songs to cry to) accompanied by a great western like score helping separate it from the rest of the franchise.Although, the most surprising aspect for me personally is definitely how great the story and narrative turned out to be executed, as well as how they weren't afraid to go harder and deeper into both their themes and characters that completely left me speechless. I never would have thought Puss in Boots out of all of Shrek's characters was going to have the most unique and complex character development cycle, as his self centered and arrogant behaviour has left him with only one life left, throughout the ups and downs of the wonders of the Black Forest, he will come with terms how fragile his former lives really were and how to make the most of the life he has left, as well as overcome his fear of mortality and accept the inevitability of death, caused by a special someone I'll talk about later, bringing such a unique contrast to it's previous appearances, as well as a new emotional layer to his character making him even more likeable and relatable than before, which is also elevated by Antonio Banderas's best vocal work to date as he brings even more charm, quip and nuance to the role better than he ever did before. Kitty Softpaws and Perrito also took my by suprise with their development and arcs as well, with Kitty actually having a proper strong personality and arc of learning how to open up to people and earn their trust, compared to her quite one noted appearance in the first film, as well as Salma Hayek doing a much better voice job matching Antonio's energy phenomenally, and Perrito who managed to avoid the annoying comedy relief sidekick treatment by having a very distinct and loving personality who's curious and wonderful attitude and outlook on the world around him have such a wholesome impact both on the narrative moving forward and helping Puss, Kitty and even Goldilocks soften up to other people in their lives.It is also incredibly impressive to see the films story juggle between three different antagonists simultaneously without feeling overstuffed and unfocused, with each of them having proper characterization and impeccable on screen presence each in their own right. I love how Goldilocks and the three bears are represented both as an obstacle for our main trio yet are still given proper emotional story beats about acceptance and family inclusion implying that they are not really evil, but the desire for the wish let them come out as such, and it definitely helps that their chemistry and banter with one another is very charming and entertaining to watch throughout, that is even further improved by Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman and Ray Winston giving out great and sweet performances enhancing the family dynamic. And on the complete opposite side of the spectrum, I really enjoyed Jack Horner being presented as an irredeemable bastard with zero qualities and how self aware of that fact he is, who's main purpose to further embrace the mockumentary aspect brought up some genuinely funny dialogue every time he appeared, especially his conversations with Jiminy Cricket, and was by far the most hilarious part of the film.But truly the absolute standout and one of the main reasons why this film was as good as it was is the character of Wolf, also referred to as Death, and I don't mean it metaphorically or rhetorically or poetically or theoretically or any other fancy way. He is Death straight up!, and OH MY I am so much in awe with how outstanding of an antagonist he is! From the phenomenal design, incredible flighting style, the menacing dialogue that makes even comedic lines scary, the bone chilling Twisted Nerve like whistle every time he appears, to his unsettling yet charming voice fantastically done by Pablo Escobar himself Wagner Moura, every single aspect about him added up to such a mesmerising and intimidating stage presence that completely tonal shifted the film in the best way possible with his every appearance, bringing up Heath Ledger's Joker levels of terror, insanity and composure I haven't felt from an animated villain other than Coraline's Other Mother. And just like with Goldi, I also adore the fact that Death is treated more like an antagonist rather than a full blown villian, as he's pretty much just doing his job, and due to Puss's irrational behaviour that disrespects the meaning of life as well as the fact that he is annoyed by the idea of nine lives as a way of escaping him, it would make perfect sense why he went to hunt and take his last life seeing him as unworthy and selfish, only to realise he had played with his food long enough for Puss to grow and take in the fact that he isn't truly untouchable, leading to a PHENOMENAL CLIMAX that is up there with Nope when it comes to best final acts of the year with how satisfying, moving and creatively it concluded. Easily one of my favourite antagonists not just in animation, but film in general!I feel like I can be here for days spitting everything I loved about The Last Wish, from significant character moments, to choreography details or talking about Death for another four paragraphs, but I don't think any kind of writing can translate how much pure joy this film provided me with, as well as not wanting to spoil the film as I encourage everyone to give it the love and support it rightfully deserves. 10/10.",

From the characters, especially Perrito and the Wolf, each and every character is so fleshed out. It set itself up like The Amazing Spider-man 2 but it did so well on the villain execution, which most would think is impossible. There were also emotional elements of this movie, such as fear and anxiety, that are so well portrayed by this movie which has not graced the big screen in a while!

Coming out of nowhere, seemingly as a much delayed afterthought, the latest Puss in Boots is anything but. Boasting gorgeous animation reminiscent of Into the Spider-Verse but never feeling like a visual rip-off, The Last Wish constantly fires on all cylinders for young audiences and adults alike. The movie's imaginative style that is bound to become a new dazzling showcase for high-end TV screens meshes well with its kinetic set pieces, the funny scenes are actually hilarious and rarely miss a beat, and the recurrent themes of mortality, friendship and identity are as astute as any big, \"mature\" movie you will have seen this year. Couple that with a memorable cast of both returning and new characters and an actually terrifying villain for a change, and you have a genre entry that is shockingly great given its questionable pedigree. Puss in Boots might be down to his last life here, but the franchise is definitely not on its last paws.",

Shrek Forever After was fine and even though I enjoyed the first Puss in Boots for what it was, my enthusiasm for the franchise has started to fade over the years. For this reason alone, I was very unsure about a Puss in Boots sequel. It's been so long since the first one and I didn't even love that film. Well, colour me incredibly surprised. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is now playing in theatres and available on-demand and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.Following Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) many years after the events of the rest of the franchise, his love of action and adventure has caught up with him. He has used eight of his nine lives and is visited by death. He is told that the next time he dies will be the end. This has him taking a second look at his life. Learning that there may be a chance of restoring his lives by venturing into the Dark Forest, he sets out on a quest to do so. Accompanied by Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and Perrito (Harvey Guill\u00e9n), this is both a hilarious/fun adventure and an emotional tale that really worked for me.They have updated the animation here as well and I thought it looked very unique. I don't think this style would've worked for a Shrek film, but Puss in Boots: The Last Wish was impressively stylistic. As always, Antonio Banderas was great as the titular hero's voice and it was great to see Salma Hayek return as well. I'm not very familiar with Harvey Guill\u00e9n's work, but his voice work for the character of Perrito had me laughing quite often, so kudos to him for that. The look of this film, the sound design, the story, and every voice actor were all standouts to me. I got a kick out of this film.To wrap this up, I guess my big complaint (even though I really don't want to complain about anything in this film) would be that it's almost too frenetic at times. It has a pace that never lets up, which is great because that never hurts the story, but I would've liked a few more beats to enjoy the dramatic moments. They took the time in the screenplay to write some moving dialogue, especially for a kid's film, but it never felt explored quite enough. I would've also complained about some side characters and what was a seemingly pointless storyline, but I enjoyed how that all played out by the end too. I can't say I loved this film, but it's a great watch at least once. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish gets a recommendation from me.",

            "content": "\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" is an American animated movie from 2022, so really new and fresh and this really just came out a few days ago here in Germany, right before Christmas. It says on imdb that the languages are Ukrainian, English and Spanish and English is indeed the one that is used in here most frequently. Spanish also happens here and there, but it is stuff that everybody will understand or just really short inclusions, like the protagonist is called \"gato\" or \"gatito\", which means \"cat\" or \"little cat\" of course. The most memorable mention and also a slightly longer play on words was the famous and friendly \"mi casa es tu casa\" and as a response the not so famous and not so friendly, but witty \"tu casa es mi casa\". It also says there is Ukrainian in here, but it must have been only a sentence or two if this is true. I don't remember. Not sure why though if it is just a politically correct thing nowadays as some kind of statement. These films should not be about politics, not even in a hidden manner, but it's okay now and let's look at the basics. The directors Crawford and Mercado are not new to the industry by any means, but in terms of directing still relatively new. For the former, it is his second full feature film after a Croods movie and for the latter it is even his first full feature film altogether. Nothing unusual though. You see it also with Pixar for example that directors of new movies are people who have deemed themselves worthy on television or short films before that. Same with Dreamworks here. The intro also included some of Dreamworks' animated heroes from the last years, decades even.As for the writers, there is definitely an interesting inclusion: Tommy Swerdlow was an actor on \"Howard the Duck\", \"Spaceballs\" and \"Child's Play\" and a writer for \"Cool Runnings\" in the 90s, but his move to writing animation is not completely new. He also worked on the screenplay for the new Grinch movie not too long ago, so it is only fitting he is also a key writer with this one here that came out right before the holidays, even if it is not Christmas-themed. Another writer is Tom Wheeler and he has more of a history with animation, was also already a factor on the first \"Puss in Boots\" film over a decade ago. And Paul Fisher, like Wheeler, worked on a Lego movie and also on the aforementioned Croods movie and also on a \"Puss in Boots\" television series that came out after the film back then, so there are definite connections within this writing trio here. No surprise their effort here turned out nicely overall. The film runs for 100 minutes approximately and that includes the closing credits already, so it is not a particularly long or short film, somewhere in the middle. I watched the German dub because the original was only shown without subtitles and I don't like that too much. Still not that much to say about the German dub, a few familiar names, but the biggest was maybe Oliver Kalkofe voicing the character that came closest to being the villain in here. The original has of course Oscar nominees Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek. Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman and Ray Winstone can also be mentioned and they are probably the most known names. Really decent cast. There are others that surely have no difficulties in finding a job in the industry these days.I already mentioned there was a \"Puss in Boots\" film more than ten years ago, so took quite some time for this sequel to come out, but then again that movie was also \"only\" a spin-off that includes a character from the \"Shrek\" franchise. One who is deemed worthy of his own movie(s). I kinda agree after seeing this one here a few nights ago. Animation is still on such a high level, even when it comes to original supporting characters getting a sequel to a spin-off. With \"original\" I mean of course that they were at first just supporting characters. Of course, Puss in Boots is not a fully new character, there is this old tale obviously that the character is based on, but this is not a factor at all in this film here, even if the guy with the extravagant hair you see in here could have such a background and stem from this tale. Anyway, I am pretty sure that in here you will find a few faces and characters that have appeared in previous Dreamworks movies already. I cannot say for sure who though. Said emperor fella seems likely and this is definitely also the case with Kitty Softpaws, but her history with the protagonist could also be misleading there. Goldilocks seems familiar too and also the big fat evil guy who seems to have no conscience altogether. It was funny how he did have a conscience in this film, like literally a conscience that was a living creature, but that one had a gigantic challenge there and eventually just moves on. Shrek you do not see here. One character that is really new here is the dog that disguises itself as a cat at the start, so the old lady will also take care of him. This was a bit of a retirement home for old felines you could say and this is where Puss in Boots ends up as well as he had lost eight of his nine lives already and prefers to be on the safe side. Or is rather forced to be more careful. The consequence are a long beard that did not last for long though and resulted in some funny talk with Kitty Softpaws and also a funeral scene in which Puss in Boots buries his adventurous self. This scene they also kept lightly though with how he keeps showing up and talking to make sure that the character (i.e. Himself) gets the speech he deserves because of how much of a hero he had always been.This grave also ends up tricking the semi-bad guys into thinking Puss in Boots was really dead when of course he was not. They even held him in their hands and did not know. I am talking about Goldilocks here of course and her three bears. Those seemed like villains early on too, especially when one bear makes a very aggressive statement to threaten another character, the old cat lady it was I think. First I thought that the bears were really just animals, but then it is shown that they also talk like humans and even get their somewhat emotional story towards the end when they try to convince Goldilocks that they are the family she has always been looking for and that she does not need to make a wish anymore to find a family. In contrast to that, there is no such twist for Jack Horner, the really gross, really big and disgusting bad guy. He only wants the wish to make sure he becomes the mightiest magician on the planet and surely he would not use these powers for anything good. Catastrophe would ensue. Of course, there is no such unhappy ending. But the happy ending is really that everybody realizes they already have what they wish for, which is perhaps not too realistic and a bit too gooey but I take it. This also includes the two cat protagonists then. Puss in Boots wanted his eight lives back for example. The only one who never really cared about the wish was the dog. I mean he had the wish to be allowed to stay with his new family or maybe you can even call them owners if you really see Puss in Boots as a bit of a human character in here, but he only wanted the wish to come true if they like him too and decide to keep him. Very likable and charming character. I would watch another spin-off there that shows us what happened to the dog before this film. Anyway, cats and dogs do get along well here apparently. Calling the protagonist human here may be true with some of his fighting skills and talking etc. But from other perspectives, he is a full-on feline. I think almost all other characters do not understand his talking and exact words and sometimes we are reminded of that when we hear cat sounds coming from him. Cuteness triumphs there for sure.Then there is the element of the cute eyes. We see this on both feline protagonists in this movie. During one occasion. That was enough. It still made for a nice running gag when we realize in the end that cuteness has prevailed and the dog is able to do the same. Good for him as before that he was probably not seen as the cutest animal. But kind and friendly he was from the very start. Aside from that, I also liked some of the music. Heitor Pereira did a great job with the soundtrack here. \"Fearless Hero\" is such a catchy tune and I liked the German version I heard as well, maybe even more than the original. Both will go on my MP3 player for sure. Again no big surprise that there are people with Hispanic names in charge of key components here like Pereira or the aforementioned Januel Mercado. Interesting name. I only knew \"Juan Manuel\" so far. I mean the cat is Hispanic too. Anyway, it would be really cool if Pereira could get an Oscar nomination for his work here too, especially the song I mentioned. I don't think it is too likely though. I think for this Oscar season the film came out too late and probably not too many will remember it in late 2023 or early 2024 then. But we will see, would be a cool surprise. The ending then in a way seemed like it had a touch of closure, but also that new adventures may be ahead. The film's title sounds more like closure, but time-wise I am not sure if this maybe took place before some other movie from the production studio? It is not too important though. I just hope that if there will be a third Puss in Boots film or even another Shrek movie at some point, that it will not be another decade until then. This one here I surely give a positive recommendation and I quite enjoyed the watch. Good animation (should not be taken for granted, not even in 2022), nice attention to detail (like with how the maps looked different in terms of who held them), good comedy, interesting characters... All the way it should be, even if I would still say that it was not a film that totally blew me away or so. But the thumbs-up from my side here was never in doubt. This film is a good watch for young, middle-aged and old people. Give it a chance!",

            "content": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fantastic return to the Shrek franchise. The film's animation is undeniably excellent in both style and character design, every shot proving accentuated with such immense detail and color. This particularly applies to the well-edited, thrilling action. Beyond this, there is a good utilization of sound and a catchy soundtrack. What truly makes this sequel special, however, is its screenplay and how the cast brings such to life. The titular role's story naturally progresses from past films and by this picture's end, he experiences a genuine, satisfactory arc. Banderas again voices the character with such wonderful charisma, to which the rest of the cast is extremely complimentary. This especially aids in the humor's success, highlighted by the voices of Mulaney and Guill\u00e9n. Hayek and Pugh are also great in their roles. All considered, however, the screenplay excels as a result of its dedication to these and other supporting characters. There is near perfect writing for every role, leaving the audience emotionally fulfilled on all fronts. So many themes are thereafter brilliantly developed. As for flaws, the picture's first act slows down to introduce characters after a fast-paced introductory sequence, before again picking up the pace it maintains for the rest of its runtime. A couple of these roles take adjusting to, as well, although turn out to be gems of the movie by its close. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is undoubtedly a fantastic film, even to the extent where a fifth Shrek sounds exciting to the most skeptical of fans.",

I started watching my watch to see when the movie would stop around the 45min mark, and only Perrito made me want to stay. His one liners, while discovering a world that he never actually saw, is kind of cute and sometimes hilarious.

When I was done watching this movie I had tears streaming down my cheeks, not only that but I also farted. I never thought I would ever cry because of what a fictional orange cat with a cape is going through. The ending especially got me. Not only was this an emotional rollercoaster but the comedy in this movie is amazing during the start, but later on it fades in to be more serious, but in the most perfect way possible. I don't think I have ever seen a movie this perfect in my entire life. This is definitely my favorite movie I have ever watched. I would definitely recommend.

There were some very well executed villain choices that push the limits of what you would find in a traditional kids movie.

I wish Hollywood would make villains (and movies) like this more often.Did not see this coming... I strongly advise that everyone go and watch this movie.

            "content": "We live in an era in which movies and tv/streaming series constantly bombard us with fake morals, emotional blackmail and empty content that insult both the intelligence and integrity of the viewer.This movie is not one of those. For the first time in years you can sit back and relax watching a fun family movie that doesn't try to force an obvious political agenda on you. And I say obvious, because if this Puss in Boots movie has any political intentions, at least it is oblivious instead of being bad tasteful, without sacrificing the artistic legitimacy of the creators and the entertainment of the spectators like certain films.Instead, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a charming, funny and captivating family movie in every word. From the fantastic and stylish animation (which in moments of action reminds me of anime series) to the numerous healthy jokes that will make children and adults laugh to tears. I reiterate the animation, the film dares to use innovative techniques that at least I have not seen in western animated films, giving the film an exotic, wacky and cool style that fits perfectly with the personality of Puss in Boots.Moreover, something that I really liked is the representation of the cultures that inspired the film. Besides the mandatory fairy tales refferences, the film is itself a fantastic pastiche of Hispanicity, from flamenco pieces to graceful Latino accents and coloquial language, all done with impeccable taste and detail.Finally I will say that the message of the film is beautiful. It could be said that it manages to break certain stereotypes in a convincible way and at the same time promote conservative (and universal) values, something with which everyone can identify.Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is one of the best animated movies I've seen in many years, a must see for all fans of animation and good comedy. I hope that the success of this film will inspire other producers to make more movies with heart like this, movies that do not seek to victimize or blame anyone.

When Goldilocks and the Three Bears Crime Family (Florence Pugh, Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo) come snuffling along for the location of the fallen star with the power to grant any wish, Puss and the chihuahua go in search of it, running into Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayak) and Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney) also on the search.As the .... pause to count 'em .... fifth or so entry in the Shrek series, there are signs of tired, if not quite exhaustion. There are fewer outright fairy-tale jokes -- although the way Kevin McCann voices the 'ethical big' made me laugh -- and a lot more high-speed action sequences, and three sets of morals at the end to set any child who watches this on the path to being a good little boy. Eh. It's entertaining enough in its hyperkinetic visual fashion, but it's clearly past the point where the franchise is breaking new ground or telling new jokes, and has begun to trade on the good will of the earlier entries.",

Due to a technical error at my AMC, my original desired showtime was no longer an option, so stuck with Puss In Boots. I need to be clear, I had very low expectations. I just feel, with Animation of late you get disappointed more than in awe.There was not a second of film where I lost focus or was thinking what I want to eat or do latter. Puss is told he has one life left and needs to stop being so wild. There is a odd (?) b story with the three bears and Little Jack, played by the talented Mulhaney. Puss is told to go to a cat day care, we meet a dog who talks, and this dog is essentially our \" Donkey.\" We escape the day care, and try to follow our last wish.The supporting characters are pretty hit or miss. The bear storyline really added nothing to me. What was great about this film, this felt like early 2000's Dream Works Animation. Simply superb animation. Now, not having seen Puss one, and gave up with the Shrek franchise on number 3, how does Puss become who he is? How did Puss and Shrek meet? I guess I need to watch Shrek 3, 4 and Puss one then.All in all, I was hooked for the whole story. Great voices and outstanding animation.A+",

Throughout the movie death comes for Puss in Boots, specifically in times where he himself is close to dying, Death gives Puss in Boots genuine fear that encourages him to seek more out of life. Puss in Boots realised that life is fleeting and that he'll have to make the most of what he has, he learns real life lessons that the majority of adults have trouble with and these difficult topics are met with just the right tone and seriousness while keeping it kid-friendly.This is a movie I would happily recommend to anyone regardless of age because it is genuinely a great film in and of itself.",

The film merges two animation styles, which are both gorgeous and cutting edge. There are moments of traditional DreamWorks animation and others that are similar to \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\".The characters introduced in this film are reminiscent of those in the first two \"Shrek\" movies. Each character is carefully thought out, and evokes an emotional response, whether that be hope, fascination, or fear. From the confused Goldilocks to the adorable Perrito to the fearsome Lobo, everyone brings something new to the table.There is honestly not a lot to criticize about \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\". The film hit darker notes than previous \"Shrek\" films and there were moments in the theater when kids shrieked. Some of the scenes are a little drawn out, but the story itself is strong.For those with small children, be aware that there is a strong use of \"hell\" and some cleverly censored words throughout the movie. Otherwise, the film is perfectly appropriate (more than some other \"Shrek\" movies) for kids.\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" is the best animated film of 2022 and the best \"Shrek\" film since \"Shrek 2\" (not that the competition is very stiff). The animation is stunning, the voice-acting crisp, and the story is interesting for both children and adults. Even if you haven't seen the first \"Puss in Boots\", go and see this movie. You will not be disappointed.Also, the new DreamWorks opening is excellent.Best Character: Perrito\nBest Scene: Reading the map\nBest Quote: \"Maybe one life is enough\" - Perrito.",

But as he is on his last life, suddenly Puss feels fear like he never has before. He then finds a chance to restore his lives from a wishing star.Puss in Boots 2 is better than the first \"Puss in Boots\" (2011) film. It isn't necessary to watch the first film, TV show or any of the Shrek films to enjoy this film. This film has great action, music, animation, characters and humor.One of the things this film does better than most modern animated films is how they use their villains. Puss and company must contend with a few antagonists through the journey. All parties are competent and various levels of funny. One is a sympathetic group, another deliciously over the top, and the final just straight up scary. Through this the film is able to keep up a good pace, always be exciting and entertaining. Like the villains, the hero group is also well done. They have terrific comedic chemistry, between the two jaded adventurers and the naive overly optimistic companion, I could see myself enjoying 3 more films with this crew.As far as negatives go, some of the lessons our heroes learn are a bit predictable, even for little kids, I'm sure they've heard these messages before. And I personally have never been a fan of the \"wish\" as a McGuffin. I always think of 10 better wishes the people could use. There is also one part where I think the film's pacing drags.Where \"Shrek 2\" I walk away talking about all the great jokes. In this film I walk away talking about the great action sequences. The film is funny throughout, but the adventure is the best part. The \"Shrek\" films always seemed to make their stories with a self-aware wink to the camera. \"Puss in Boots 2\" is far more sincere in its story telling and emotional beats. The humor never gets in the way of its more serious moments. It is the type of film where I could see kids laughing and crying when they watch.This is DreamWorks at its very finest. This Last Wish is the stuff Dreams are made of.",

All of the best elements of these movies (except Shrek the Third) are all combined into a spin-off that has no right being *this* fantastic; But is. And that movie is Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, one of the best movies I've ever experienced in a long time.When I was a kid, Puss in Boots was my favorite character in the Shrek series. I loved his design, his Spanish accent, and of course, his voice actor, Antonio Banderas. And while I grew older, Puss kinda got thrown into the background and got overshadowed by more complex characters. But the Last Wish rekindled that child-like wonder and revived my love for the character. Not only that, the Last Wish weaves a surprisingly mature and emotional arc around confronting mortality and self-embetterment.The Last Wish goes even further by creating the perfect cast of characters. Perrito, I thought, was going to be an unbearable comedic companion; yet in the end, he became an adorable bastion of emotional support and empathy. Kitty Softpaws, a character carried over from the previous movie, is just as an excellent foil and love interest to Puss, being just as, if not more, a cynical isolationist like Puss. But what steals the show are the factional antagonists. From the sympathetic and surprisingly wholesome Goldilocks and the Three Bears to the hilarious, morbidly immoral Jack Horner who revels in his evil, to the mysterious, dark, and genuinely scary wolf known as \"Lobo,\" all of them are excellent and well-balanced in the story (especially with Lobo, who has a brilliant reveal that I won't spoil).Speaking of which, the story is great. It feels perfectly balanced and well-paced. But I'm honestly shocked by how dark this movie can be, thematically and humor-wise. This film explores the fear of death, insecurity, anxiety, companionship, and it does not hold back against any of these themes. Which for an animated film with a talking cat and supposedly aimed at younger audiences, that is bold.Finally there's the animation. The animation takes a page out of Spiderverse and runs with it to make its own style. The result is a gorgeous, almost painterly experience that feels like it was ripped out of a watercolor fairy tale illustration mixed in with stylized transitions that are pleasing to the eyes and create interesting visual juxtapositions. All the settings have unique color palettes, and areas like the Dark forest is so creative in its presentation.All in all, when it comes to being a cinematic experience The last Wish is a genius experience. If there's anything that I would call this movie: is that it's just right. Not too dark, not too light, just. Right.",

            "content": "This latest animated instalment of the legendary Puss in Boots of the much-loved DreamWorks fairytale franchise is a winning concept with so-so execution. It successfully provides viewers with a heartwarming insight into Puss' inner life, with a valuable lesson on mortality to boot.The film's continuity with the Shrek universe feels thin in places, albeit more pronounced in other areas. The presence of *that* unmistakable, signature DreamWorks fairytale theme was largely inconsistent, and often felt as if things were partly stuck in the design phase; undecided on whether the film should present itself as a stop-motion painted comic book, a faithful Shrek-style animated fairytale escapade spinoff, or an ironic case of cat and mouse. Ultimately, what we got was a slightly muddled end product unsure of its exact identity as a film; surefooted, or better, sure-pawed, I'd think not.For example, Shrek's fairytale-scape and storyboard simply felt more deliberate and thought-out by comparison.Where \"The Last Wish\" really starts to fall apart is in its latter stages; Puss and pals traverse a shifting almost-arbitrary landscape which is, on the whole, a bit aimless and wearing especially thin on plotline by this point. It's a lot of filler and not so much killer.The antagonist \"Big\" Jack Horner was brilliant. A nursery rhyme character with an inferiority complex based on being a mere nursery rhyme character. He was assigned almost all of the funny lines, though. Much of which concerned his questionable conscience and his accidental ethics advisor. However, Horner needed more development, with only a fraction of the runtime dedicated to his backstory.Goldilocks and her grizzly bear trio are gratingly shown as a cockney gang, sans the charming guile and slapstick humour of actual cockneys, Goldilocks would surely present more as spoiled brat than streetwise cockney, but each to their own.Whether *two* sets (three if you count the big bad wolf) of villains were necessary is up for debate, but it meant that more screen time had to be funneled into explanatory backstories and character development that could've been better spent elsewhere. Again, almost like a concept stage indecision about which villain makes the cut and instead just settling on juggling both.The lure of a franchise is that it's easier to market a known commodity. Whether this DreamWorks franchise has run the course of its own nine lives is yet to be seen.7.2/10.",

Shrek, Dragons, Madagascar, and recently my kids have been enjoying the Puss In Boots series. Even at its darkest, it maintains that feeling of brightness.Yet here, they seem to have missed a beat with the wolf. The anxiety levels of my youngest went up the first time he saw him and got worse through out.The three bears and Goldi were probably better antagonists in this tale of finding what is your one wish, even if I was expecting Daddy Bear to start quoting me odds on reaching the end of the quest.Burrito stole the show, particularly with his potty mouth and heart wrenching back story.It's a much darker Shrek - blink and you'll miss him - story, with some good humour moments, some tear inducing moments and plenty of action scenes.Just glad Puss's beard doesn't last.",

His entrance would give me cold vibes.The humor was very lightened & will make the whole audience laugh, there are some jokes that a lot of kids won't understand due to censored cursing.The animation & action is a lot better on the big screen, so it's definitely recommended to watch it ASAP.This movie deserves an epic 10/10 & I can't wait to see what dreamwork holds for us in the future.",

            "content": "The concept for this film is simple, puss has run out of his nine lives and can only get them back with the means of a wishing star which is in pretty high demand among the bad guys of the shrek cinematic universe. The competition is Goldilocks and the Three Bears and Little Jack Horner who is not so little anymore along with a certain someone who is behind puss for a very specific reason.The execution of this concept is what makes this film such a treat. The screenplay is straightforward and fast-paced, drags somewhat in the second act but manages itself by the end. The music is perfect for the aesthetic (chef's kiss to be more accurate). The voice acting is muy buena (very good). Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Florence Pugh, Harvey Guill\u00e9n, John Mulaney, Wagner Moura they're all just fantastic. I was genuinely invested in the characters and not solely on nostalgia. Not that this film does a few callbacks but those aren't some cheap fan-services but something that add a little substance to the greater story.Now, the animation and the cinematography. Ughhhh, it's so freaking beautiful !!! Spiderverse swung in style so puss in boots could land purrfectly on it's feet. There is clearly inspiration for the animation here but instead of some cheap rip-off, it really feels like an artistic choice and comes off as an artist's fairytale come to life here. The movie literally starts with the words \"this is a fairytale...\" and lives up to it! The cinematography too is something to look out for. This film haz better shots than I can spot in a big budget Hollywood blockbuster these days. DreamWorks atleast never fails in that department and always manages to exceed expectations!To be honest, I wasn't really expecting anything from this film because the shrek cinematic universe has been near-dead for so long, but this film gives me hope. This film gives me something to put my faith in. You'd think that years of development hell would usually mean bad for a film but not for PUSS!... IN BOOTS!Just go and have a good time with this. And if you haven't yet seen the trailer for the film, don't do it. Just go into the film blindly like I did. It will surely give you a few surprises! In my opinion, this is the best film in the Shrek Cinematic Universe since Shrek 2, which isn't saying a lot, but it should since Shrek: Forever After was the only good film after Shrek 2.P. S.: the new DreamWorks intro is so good. I just love it!",

This movie wasn't pandering to an audience, it wasn't fan service, and it definitely wasn't a cash grab. It was a celebration of film making in general and it used the animated medium to take it to its fullest potential.It had everything in place.Characters were king. The cast of this movie was varied, compelling and handled phenomenally. There were no throw away characters, no unmotivated storylines, and no one that you didn't care about.Next they had a solid plot. It was relatively simple at base level. However, this basic premise when looked at through the lens of 6 different characters with their storylines intertwined makes for a very interesting film.The style was AMAZING. They took the technical advancements Sony made in Into the Spider-verse and spun them into a beautifully rendered painterly fairy tale world. The colours were bold, the textures were tangible, and it was beautiful.They also switched up frame rate, incorporated anime style freeze frames, had fascinating fight scenes, and interesting character designs.Finally, the message was REAL. Puss in Boots, the small hubris orange cat warrior, felt SO REAL. His fears were relatable, you understood his motives, you felt his emotions, and you saw him change. It was simply good writing. A prime example of character done right.ALSO, there was one of the greatest villains of all time in this movie. But I'll let you discover him for yourself.In conclusion go watch this movie. Please.",

And that they get to see it in a way that is creative, original, and often times surprising.Puss in Boots and The Last Wish is such a refreshing movie that I think anyone, regardless of age, can enjoy.",

This film is incredible, dreamworks have done it again and it's a film that for me really defines why they are my favourite animation studio. The animation is slick switching between styles which during the fight scenes at first can be jarring but I quickly found myself adjusting to them and by the final fight I appreciated it all the more. On his journey Puss encounters an old friend and new foes all of which have a part to play in the films final act. The thing that perhaps stood out most to me is the films main theme that it's okay to be scared of the future however when we put our trust in the people around us and appreciate them it makes life easier.

And it was quite enjoyable.The storyline, as written by Paul Fisher, Tommy Swerdlow and Tom Wheeler, was quite well-written, and it had many great elements and included different elements from various well-known rhymes, fables, fairytales, etc. So there was a lot of nice things to see on the screen.The voice cast in \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" was great, and there were some very good talents on the cast list.Visually then \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" was impressive.

            "content": "The character first charmed audiences in Shrek 2, then he got his own spin-off movie, then came this sequel, the sixth in the Shrek franchise, which was getting positive reviews and accolades, I was up for it. Basically, renowned hero and outlaw Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is hosting a party in the town of Del Mar at the governor's home. During the evening, after the Governor (Bernardo De Paula) returns and a fight breaks out, the nearby Sleeping Giant of Del Mar is accidentally awakened. Puss successfully defeats the giant and saves the town but is fatally crushed by a church bell. Puss wakes up in a hospital, where a Doctor (Anthony Mendez) informs him that he has used eight of his nine lives. Puss reflects on how he lost all his previous lives, the Doctor suggests he should retire from adventuring, but he refuses. Later, in a local pub, Puss meets a mysterious, black-hooded bounty hunter Wolf (The Big Bad Wolf) (Wagner Moura), who disarms him and gashes his forehead in a duel. For the first time in his life, Puss is fearful for his life and flees. After evading the Wolf, uncertain of his fate and wanting to escape the threat, he decides to give up his dangerous escapades. After finding the house of a cat lady named Mama Luna (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), he ceremoniously buries his attire in her garden, and is welcomed into the home as one of the many cats cared for. Puss struggles to come to terms with his new lifestyle as a house cat, growing a beard, but a stray chihuahua dog, dressed as a cat, called Perrito (Harvey Guill\u00e9n) offers his friendship, but Puss says he needs no friends. Meanwhile, the crime family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears: Mama Bear (Olivia Colman), Papa Bear (Ray Winstone), and Baby Bear (Samson Kayo), are searching for Puss in Boots. They assume, seeing the \"grave\" he buried his clothes, that Puss is dead. Puss overhears them talking about the legendary magical Wishing Star that can grant a single wish to someone bearing its map. \"Big\" Jack Horner, formerly \"Little\" (John Mulaney), is a corrupt pastry chef and collector of magical artifacts, he is scheduled to receive the map that night. Puss unearths his clothes and breaks into Horner's bakery to steal the map, intending to follow it to use the star and make a wish to restore his nine lives. Expectedly, he reunites with his resentful ex-fianc\u00e9e, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault), who also seeks the map. After a brief battle with Goldi, the bears, and Horner, Puss, Kitty, and Perrito, who followed Puss, escape with the map. Puss notices the hooded wolf again during their escape. Goldi, the bears, Horner, and his henchmen pursue them. Kitty is moody towards Puss due to his past actions, she shaves his beard, but is only accompanying him to use the map for her own wish. The map leads the trio to the Dark Forest, a pocket dimension that changes its terrain depending on who is holding the map. Puss and Kitty both receive dark, frightening landscapes, while Perrito's is a colourful and seemingly tranquil forest. During another fight against the forces of Horner and Goldi, during which Horner gets a conscience, Ethical Bug (Kevin McCann), on his shoulder, Puss spots the hooded wolf again and flees, distracting Kitty and enabling Goldi to grab the map. After Perrito calms him down from a panic attack, Puss confesses that he left Kitty at the altar on their wedding day. Kitty overhears them, she later reveals she never attended the wedding either, feeling that Puss loved himself more than her. Puss and Kitty reclaim the map from Goldi when the bears are distracted by a manifestation of their woodland cottage. As the landscape morphs, Perrito is captured by the bears, while Puss is trapped in a crystalline cave. While Kitty retrieves Perrito alone, Puss encounters crystal reflections of his past lives in the cave, who mock him for changing his arrogant attitude. The hooded wolf appears once again, with Puss realising he is not a hunter, but a manifestation of Death. The wolf reveals that he wants to kill him for squandering through his past eight lives. Puss panics and flees with the map, Kitty and Perrito witness him from a distance. Meanwhile, Goldi confesses to Baby Bear that her wish is to reunite with her biological family. The bears are devastated but agree to help her. Puss reaches the Wishing Star, but Kitty berates him for his selfishness; her wish is to find someone she can trust. Goldi, the bears, and Horner arrive, with another fight ensuing. Goldi forfeits the wish she could make to save Baby Bear's life and Horner gets trapped inside his magical bottomless bag. Death arrives, surrounding himself and Puss with a ring of fire, challenging Puss to a duel. Instead of wishing for more lives, Puss fights and disarms Death. Puss is no longer afraid of him and states he would rather fight for his final life, even though he knows he cannot win. Seeing that Puss is no longer arrogant, Death begrudgingly spares him, although he and Puss agree they will eventually meet again. After Death leaves, Horner re-emerges from his bag after eating a magic growth cookie as a giant, he seizes the map from Puss and Kitty. As he attempts to make his wish to control all magic, Perrito distracts him long enough for Puss, Kitty, and Goldi to rip the map to shreds. Horner tries to piece it back together, but the conscience bug burns it down, causing the Wishing Star to collapse on itself, trapping and consuming Horner. In the aftermath, Goldi accepts the bears as her family and leaves with them to take over Horner's bakery business, while Puss rekindles his romance with Kitty. Sometime later, Puss, Kitty, and Perrito steal the governor of Del Mar's ship. They decide to keep the name 'Perrito' for the dog and set sail to visit \"some old friends\", heading towards Far Far Away. Also starring Betsy Sodaro as Jo Serpent, Artemis Pebdani as Jan Serpent, Conrad Vernon as Gingy, and Cody Cameron as Pinocchio. Banderas as always is terrific as voice of the swashbuckling feline who has a vulnerable side, Hayek Pinault is good as his companion, the British cast of Pugh, Winstone, Colman and Kayo as the coarser Goldilocks and the Three Bears are fun, and the supporting cast all do well. The animation is vibrant, with some clever anime style sequences, it is a story full of action and heart, it is funny and thrilling, and spotting the references to famous fairy tales, nursery rhymes, fantasy stories and movies (e.g. The Big Bad Wolf, Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) is fun, there is something for everyone, an enjoyable and entertaining computer-animated comedy adventure. It is nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. Very good!",

I decided to go see this purely because I heard good things, considering I wasn't the biggest fan of the original as a kid despite loving Shrek. However, not only was this one of if not my favorite theater experiences of the last year, it was so good I already want to see it again.This film is very separate despite being considered a sequel. It stands on its own as one of the most clever and creative animated films of the last few years. Puss is a great protagonist. The lessons he learns throughout the movie are predictable and easy to grasp for kids while also being portrayed in such heartwarming, complex, and interesting ways that make the moments entertaining for an older audience as well. There are also plenty of subtle dark jokes and other crazy moments that adults will love.However, it's not just Puss, this entire cast is amazing. This franchise is great at thinking of new fairy tale characters to add to every film, and the ones chosen here are some of the best. Their classic stories are implemented in a way that makes this plot surprisingly unique and well put together. Kitty Softpaws was a welcome return from the first film and the antagonists are all amazing.I loved the family dynamic of Goldilocks and the bears! Their flashback scene really got me to care for their relationship. Jack Horner was a great vehicle to push the heroes forward and his back and forth with Jiminy Cricket was hysterical. Death was also a great looming threat, being a literal representation of Puss' fears.I also have to specifically shout out Perro. Harvey Guillen does a fantastic job at bringing to life a cute, comedic relief character that is not annoying. His comedic timing is always on point and occasional dark humor that is blended with his adorably oblivious personality worked very well.I would love to see him continue to appear in future Shrek and Puss movies. The movie does not overstay its welcome at all. It's relatively short but incredibly well-paced. At a glance, it may seem overstuffed, but the rapid-fire action format of its very intentional and there's still room left for good character moments.The action is fantastic, being very reminiscent of Spider-Verse in all the right ways. Some of the fight scenes feel pulled out of a Shonen anime. They're all fun and visually impressive.While not relying on them at all, this movie is also filled with great cameos and nods that will make any Shrek fan happy. I can safely say if this new animation style and writing have some influence on Shrek 5, it could become the best Shrek movie.Simply put, this movie is incredibly fun. It is a project where you can feel the passion put into it by the writers, animators, and voice actors. This is truly Dreamworks' answer to Into the Spider-Verse. It is a needed unique twist on an existing big franchise and I don't think I could've been more pleasantly surprised by it. Go watch this movie!",

            "content": "Having enjoyed 'Puss in Boots' as much as I did, and being a fan of the 'Shrek' franchise, I was looking forward to this sequel.Cats supposedly have nine lives. Puss is down to his last life, and ordered by a doctor to retire. He is sent to Mama Luna to become a \"lap cat\". He befriends a dog named Perrito, who is disguised as a cat in order to get food - or rather, Perrito befriends Puss. Puss is being pursued by a mysterious wolf - a truly creepy character that might even give young kids nightmares. This is one of the most haunting animated characters I've seen. He was in my opinion also the best part about the movie - although, I must admit, everything about this movie was great!Goldilocks and the Three Bears have a new look, and they're not entirely the friendly beings we've come to know and love. They, too, are after Puss - in search of a map that could lead them to the Wishing Star. They want Puss to steal the map from antagonist Jack Horner, so they in turn can steal it from him. Kitty Softpaws from 'Puss in Boots' is back, and she, too, wants the map. And so, Puss, Kitty and Perrito go on a fun-filled, action-packed, thrilling adventure - with Goldilocks, the Three Bears, Jack Horner and the Wolf on their heals!'Puss in Boots: The Last Wish' is an imaginative film with many underlying themes, and also a very dark undertone: Death. I absolutely adored Perrito, who was blissful by simply having friends. The animation is bright and colourful. The film ends with the door wide open for another sequel, and quite honestly I can't wait. Fairy tales unite!",

At first, when i saw the trailer i thought it was yet another cash grab like so many others, trying to use a popular character to milk the fans' wallets with minimum effort in storytelling. But i was wrong! The movie had amazing action, great visuals, fun and likeable characters and an adorable merchandise opportunity! Despite a few unnecessary scenes, the movie was enjoyable and it even had some very serious moments that we don't see lately in animated movies. The villain was menacing and helped in the development of the protagonist's character development which ended up being actually really good! Overall, an amazing experience from start to finish with so much potential for an even better movie in the future! Whoever missed this one has to check it out!

            "content": "I'll get this out of the way first. This movie is fantastic. Plain and simple. It's great. It's creative, it's funny, it's touching, it's scary, it's mature, it's intelligent, it's entertaining for both kids AND adults, it's... A goddamn Puss in Boots The Last Wish. I think we can all agree that this is the last title anyone here can associate with top notch quality. I mean it's a sequel to a spin-off movie from over 10 years ago. A rather mediocre one at that. And yet this movie goes far and beyond ANY expectations and makes itself into probably THE best animated movie of 2022. But then again. This is coming from a studio that made Kung Fu Panda series be known as one of the finest animation series as well.But let's get to the details. First being the animation. It's gorgeous. It's amazing how well this movie looks with it's Spiderverse like animation and further proves how chasing after realizm in animated movies is at this point a fool's errand that kind of misses the point of animated movies. But it's not just a rip-off Spiderverse in looks. Oh no. When that movie looked like a comic book that came to life, this one feels like a Illustrated Fairy Tale book. The paint brush aesthetic looks great, it's colorful and feels alive. It's animated in a fantastic way and I think it's best described in saying that the fight with the Giant from the trailers is NOT the best part of this movie. Oh no. It only gets better from there. 10/10 on visuals.Now to the characters. I love pretty much all of them. Puss in Boots of course takes center stage here and his character is at it's best here in terms of depth and humor. He is cocky bastard at first, but as he loses his next to last life he quickly gets humbled and reminded of his now very apparent mortality and his character goes through great amount of growth. It's very nice to see his character evolve like it does in this movie. Another stand out I say is the Wolf who I can already tell will give several children nightmares. People that made this DO NOT hold back with how scary they make this character. He is by far the best thing in the movie from his fights, the change in mood whenever he appears and the music that accompanies him. He is definitely one of the best villains I saw in an animated movie (but I could argue if it's okay to call him one, but that would mean getting into spoilers). Other characters such as Kitty Softpaws, Goldielocks, Three Bears, Jack Horner and Perrito are all VERY fun as well. Goldie and her family are a very sweet family that go through their own journey in this and could be said they are deutragonists of this movie, I really enjoyed them, their chemistry and their sweet development. Jack Horner though... I say this. He is by far the funniest part in this movie. He is a bastard, plain and simple and he is hilarious because of it and a certain character that is alongside him for a good chunk of the movie. As for Kitty, it's very nice to see her back and her story tied with Puss is very interesting and I like how they do not linger too long on her drama with Puss and resolve it in a more real way that doesn't derail the movie in any way. And then there is Perrito who many probably thought was going to be an annoyance, but he is by far the Heart of this movie and he is involved in probably the most touching scene in the movie. You will know when you see it. All in all characters another 10. It's incredible how there are so many of them and all of them are fun and likeable in their own way.The story itself is very simple. It's a race to get the Last Wish from a fallen star. It's as Fairy Tale-ish as you can get. But the way it's executed, the way each character changes (well most of them at least) on this journey and how imaginative and creative the setups and environments are make it feel fresh and it really leaves an impact on you. Don't be fooled by the marketing. This movie deals with VERY heavy subjects such as death, mortality and appreciating one's life and acceptance of Death. It's a heavy movie in terms of themes, but it's so great to see that with it, it still is a very entertaining movie. With many clever jokes, great pacing, fantastic music (oh my God the music is GREAT in it as well. Heitor Pereira did a A+ job here) and colorful world and characters. It is a movie that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and that is something that is so good to see today. And this movie VERY well utilizes it's PG rating. Kids NEED Parental guidance in this movie, it is not a movie you put on to shut them up. You put it on because you want to show them something great, something they can have fun with, be scared of and learn from. And I think a lot of adults can sympathize with struggles characters face in this movie and laugh at the more adult jokes as well. Overall from story standpoint it's also 10/10. It's not a new story or message, but it is told in a way that makes it FEEL new and fresh and it tackles it in a mature way.As for flaws... Ehhhh... Hard for me to find really. To me it's as perfect as animated flick can get. Again PUSS IN BOOTS THE LAST WISH. God is this a weird thing to say. Maybe there are some pacing issues with Goldie's story and her family conflict being resolved quickly during climax and one character is pretty damn 1-dimensional, but I would argue it's to add to the comedy and charm of said character since that one is not meant to be seen as anything more serious. It is not one the same level of greatness as Prince of Egypt obviously, but as far as Shrek movies go or most Dreamworks movies go... or hell, most animated movies go overall it's pretty damn close to the top to me. In Shrek franchise it's on the same level as Shrek 2 to me and it's a high, HIGH praise.I have to say. I always preferred Dreamworks over Pixar. Yes, they do have FAR lower lows than the animation juggernaut, but to me they had higher highs with movies such as Prince of Egypt or Kung Fu Panda movies (and the fact that I can say Kung fu Panda series is one of the best pieces of animation is hilarious) and I found their good movies to be far more rewatchable than Pixar ones. But since then they kind of went down with quality sadly, but recently with The Bad Guys and now this movie I think it's safe to say that they are officially back and maybe better than ever. This movie I think proves how great movies from Dreamworks can be today and I think if they keep on going in this direction we may get more VERY special movies from this studio. And I wish them the best of luck on this road and for this movie to become greater and greater success, maybe even winning an Academy Award (as meaningless as that became as of late).What can I say anymore it's about 9.5 to 10/10 to me. I love it. And I think many people will love it as well. Probably not to the same degree as me, but I think this will make your day and the new year that much better. It's worth your money, it's worth your time, it's worth your attention and by all means it's worth watching more than once.",

            "content": "Puss In Boots: The Last Wish (2022) Review -Puss In Boots: The Last Wish serves as a sequel to Chris Miller's spin-off Puss In Boots, which was born out of Shrek's Pandora Box. I haven't been a huge fan of the Shrek franchise except for the first film, and moreover, Miller's spin-off didn't suit me either. But now, after watching Joel Crawford's sequel, I might want to join the fan club of Puss In Boots. Sometimes a sequel exceeds expectations and sets a benchmark, and Puss in Boots 2 has done exactly that. Unlike many other animated sequels, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish comes with the promise of cinematic expansion in many aspects, be it characters, storyline, or visuals.Puss in Boots: The Last Wish follows Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), who has finally started to fear something, and it's none other than 'death' (a wolf). He starts living a boring and eventless life in a cathouse. As the last hope, he goes on a journey to find the mystical Last Wish for the Wishing Star. Puss teams up with his old friend (girlfriend) Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and the little dog from the cathouse, Perrito (Harvey Guill\u00e9n), to restore the eight of his nine lives that he lost while escaping fellow outlaws Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who are also trying to reach the star.Tommy Swerdlow and Tom Wheeler's story has both brains and heart, while Paul Fisher, as a co-screenwriter, puts a soul into it. Practically, a film is supposed to be imaginative, especially if it's an animated feature flick. Isn't Puss in Boots 2 a perfect example of imagination with a perfect blending of life lessons? Yes, it is. You know, some netizens say that DreamWorks is cracking the Pixar formula in their own style. I guess it's true. An adventure drama with emotions and a beautiful message indicates so. I should give credit to the writers and screenwriters for enhancing the viewing experience with their skills. They say half the battle is won on paper; here is the reason why they say it. There is something for everyone of all age groups, which doesn't happen with every animation film you know.The big voice cast of Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek Pinault, Harvey Guill\u00e9n, Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo, John Mulaney, Wagner Moura, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and Anthony Mendez is sweet with outcomes and different dialects. That's one of the easiest jobs in the world of animation, but it has to be done carefully. Some characters are too sweet here, which is unacceptable, but of course, how can someone hate the positivity? Even if it's too difficult to believe. Nevertheless, there is a message behind it, and it's not that intricate to understand. You are gonna enjoy that process and the results that follow.DreamWorks almost hit a hundred dollar budget for the sequel that was late for its generation of audience, leaving everyone worried about the profits. Well, I must say, they spent where it was due. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is one of the most stunning visual spectacles ever produced by DreamWorks Animation for under $100 million. The action sequences are breathtaking, and the 3D effects are marvelous. Animation doesn't really require 3D viewing unless you have something special to show. Here, you have that something special coming in the first 10 minutes only. Also, the middle and climax portions of the film are visually gorgeous.I wished for a better use of the background score, which remained average. The editing is misjudged in the first half but pretty smooth in the latter half of the film. Joel Crawford is just 5 years old as a director with 3 films in his kitty, and Puss in Boots 2 suddenly takes him to the next level. This is, by far, his best work till date, and I am excited to see how \"far far away\" he goes in the future. As a whole, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a perfect family film for the holiday period; however, Indians have to see it almost a month later. Does it really matter as long as you are spending the money on something that is worth it?RATING - 7/10*",

            "content": "Honestly, it really does feel like it has been an awfully long time between drinks with regards to the Shrek universe, even taking into account the Puss in Boots spinoff movie. Then again a part of me suspects that actors have all gone on to do other things, and in the case of Mike Meyers, has pretty much entered into semi-retirement (though he still comes back from time to time). While I would suggest that this latest edition to the franchise holds out hope for the future, sometimes I feel that maybe it is time to put some franchises to rest.Anyway, the story opens with mention of the Wishing Star, a shooting star that crashed and pretty much transformed an entire forest. It is said that whoever finds the star will be granted a wish, which sort of suggests that wishes are no doubt very, very rare in this world. However, that aside, Puss suddenly learns that he has lost all but one of his lives, and decides to go into retirement, namely at a cattery that is being run by and old lady. However, Goldilocks and the three bears rock up looking for Puss, believing that he is the only person who can steal the map to the Wishing Star, and as such he decides to leave retirement because it sees it as a way of getting his lives back.I guess the idea behind the film is that the quest for a wish may actually be futile because that which we desire we no doubt already have. Honestly, sometimes I do wonder if this is because the world of the films, and the world that they seem to be sending their messages to, is pretty much an idealistic world because honestly, there are a lot of people out there that a wish to transform their lives would be a godsend.Yet I guess in some cases there are those of us that actually don't really realise what we actually have until it is all gone. We do pursue these goals and go on these quests that really only result in wasted time because, well, as it turns out everything that we could have wanted is actually right there in front of us. Actually, I guess it is the idea of contentment, and is being content with what we have. That is pretty much exemplified by the dog because, well, throughout the film he says that he doesn't want a wish because everything he could wish for he already has - warm clothing and friends. The ironic thing is that despite people trying to say that they are not his friends, he still pretty much views them as his friends.Yeah, look, I have to say that it wasn't bad. In many ways it simply seems to be continuing along the theme of the original Shrek films, but is also introducing new actors since the many of the original ones are getting pretty old. However, being an animated film it does help because the characters don't age in the way that the voice actors age. Anything, yeah, it's not bad entertainment, though it still very much follows the road set out in the original Shrek film.",

I came into the movie expecting some comedic and slightly cringe kids movie that I would enjoy by criticizing it with my mates. I was wrong. Very wrong.Probably a common phrase but I'll say it anyway. It was never meant to hit this hard.With the re-introduction of Puss in this movie, you can already notice the change in animation style. It's almost as if a scene from The Spiderverse was painted in watercolor and pasted into this. Personally, this definitely made action sequences better.Oh and the characters. This movie managed to flesh out 7 different characters (the bear family combined to 1), each with their own individual arcs, and in a way so that you end up rooting for every single character in this movie (arguably excluding the big man). I mainly love Puss's character arc, as we see him from the lowest point in his life and how he overcomes his fears.The concept of death in a kids movie was shocking. It ended up becoming the strongest concept this movie is built upon, and I applaud them for presenting this concept to kids.What are you waiting for??

The designs and the animation make the movie a real pleasure for the eyes. The colors are vibrants, the texture looks like a painting it's just so beautiful.Secondly, the story.. it's basically a quest, and is pretty simple in a way, which leave more places for the characters to be developed and have their own journeys, both externally and internally. The movie isn't afraid of mature themes, such as the fear of death, the inability of trusting someone or even animal abuse.Thirdly, the characters. They're all are so deep and well-written. Having only one life left, Puss isn't as reckless as he used to be and become less a legend, and more of a real character. Perrito could've been annoying, but he's just adorable. Kitty soft paws is like in the 1st movie, but better. And her relationship with Puss is much better too, coming from resentment to acceptation and maybe even more.Goldilocks and the three bears are basically another groups of heroes, even if in this movie they're antagonists because what they want go against what the hero wants. But they're in no way villains. Just a great, funny and moving family (seriously i cried at some point during one of their scenes).Jack Horner is the perfect incarnation of a villain we love to hate. He's absolutely awful, in a great villainous way. The movie doesn't shy away from his cruelty, it's not trying to give him excuses or a sad back story. Quite the opposite actually. Jack Horner was a spoiled brat who turned into an entitled man with no regards for anyone's life whatsoever.And the Wolf is just so terrifying and charismatic. Although not exactly a villain, he is the biggest threat to Puss in Boots specifically towards the whole movie.I could say much more about what makes this movie so great but I really don't wanna spoiled it. I only have one advice for you, go to your local cinema and WATCH IT.",

Until, that is, he has a run-in with a church bell that brings him face to face with his mortality. He has only one of his nine lives left, and death is poised to come claim him! Shattered, he seeks refuge in a home for cats where he encounters \"Perrito\" - a small, naive and lost little dog who is determined to befriend him. Meantime, the not so little \"Jack Horner\" and \"Goldilocks\" and her three bears are looking for a map that will guide them to a wishing star that, well, it does what it says on the tin. The bears decide to track down our eponymous hero to help them procure it, but he and his feline rival \"Kitty\" (and their new doggy pal) decide to join forces and must face a series of tortuous escapades in the race to succeed in their quest. It must be 45 years since I last read the \"Goldilocks\" story and try as I might, I just couldn't remember it as it gradually evolves as one of the threads of this enjoyably crafted montage of fable and charisma. It's pretty action packed with Banderas proving his singing hasn't really improved much since \"Evita\" (1996). It's a family movie for sure with messages of loyalty, affection, determination etc.; but there is still enough in the dialogue for those older folks in the auditorium to raise a smile and keep it interesting for 100 minutes. The animation is super and this character driven adventure is well worth seeing on a big screen if you can. Maybe not one for tiny kids - but for us bigger ones, this is fun.",

What could they have done with this franchise to make so many people suddenly like it again?And then I watched it. Oh boy.It's so far from the previous three movies that it might as well be from an alternate universe.There are so many aspects of the film I could talk about, but for me the main ones are the animation and the story.The animation is top notch. It's clearly inspired by Spiderverse, but it's far form a straight ripoff. It feels vibrant and full of life and it lends itself extremely well to the fast-paced adventure style of the story.Speaking of which, it's amazing how good the story is. At its core it's very simplistic, like all Shrek movies. There's a wishing star somewhere and several different parties are interested in getting to it. That's it.But seeing the motivations of the characters for getting the wish is so fun and interesting.The main one, obviously, is Puss in Boots himself. He's down to the last of his nine lives, so now he wants to use the wish to get his lives back, so he can continue being a reckless, adventurous, fearless hero.His relationship with death, both literally, and metaphorically, makes this one of the most earnest movies in the Dreamworks catalogue.The other characters don't get nearly as much focus, which is the right call. Side-characters in animated movies tend to be annoying, but this one doesn't fall into that trap. All characters feel perfectly balanced, which is a massive feat in a movie that has so many of them.The acting is also amazing. Every character that has screentime in this movie is fun and entertaining to watch, and the main characters are emotionally investing and relatable.Overall, a refreshing restart to Dreamworks' oldest franchise. It single-handedly shattered my expectations and made me feel genuinely excited to see what they do next.",

But somehow Puss in Boots: The Last Wish delivers one of the finest animated adventures in years.The reasons for this are endless really, but top of the list is the animation style. It just looks amazing. Every frame is popping with vibrant colours and rich detail. The action sequences are directed to perfection. The environments are absorbing and the character design brilliant. Just an all round visual spectacle.Another key reason is that the story is very entertaining and engaging. It blends (very funny) humour with heart effortlessly and throws you from energetic actions sequences to great character moments seamlessly. It zips along at a tidy pace and is just a treat from start to finish.Antonio Banderas is insanely good voicing the eponymous Puss as you'd expect. Salma Hayek Pinault and Florence Pugh are terrific as well, as are the whole cast.I didn't believe the hype myself and what a fool I was. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish really is as good as they say!",

Myself, my wife and my teenage daughter actually had the good luck to see this a month ago, right after Thanksgiving, but I forgot to review it. The story is complex, both structurally and philosophically. It brings in some surprising darkness into the Puss in Boots/Shrek film world while keeping it grounded in its imaginative, kid-friendly exploration of fairy tale legends. It never feels redundant to the previous films or a rehash of what the characters did before. It explores real character growth. At the end, I was really excited by the idea of a 5th Shrek film and what this kind of complexity could do for one. I was going to rate this 9 out of 10, but I realized I couldn't think of any way it could be improved upon, so there's no reason why it shouldn't be 10/10. I hope it makes enough money to encourage a new Shrek film.",

And the advantage is in the adult plot where very unusual elements appear in animated films such as death, redemption, love and payment for karma and the advantage of being naive at some moments in life. The characters that appear do not have much previous history and that ultimately helps the dynamism but also leaves holes in the story. There are characters that are not very appropriate for children, but the children of today are different from those of our time. It is a great animated film, recommended.",

The story came full circle near the end with Puss, Kitty, and Perrito off to see an \"old friend\".\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" re-imagined several popular characters like Jack Horner - the boy from the \"Little Jack Horner\" nursery rhyme who put his thumb in a Christmas pie and pulled out a plum - and Goldilocks and the Three Bears. These re-characterizations were elegant and flawless.The idea of Puss marrying Kitty held immense merit, especially when see in the context of \"The Last Wish\". On a related note, every interaction with the wolf that symbolized Death was a lesson in enriched storytelling.The musical scoring and animation teams did brilliant work in \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\". They made the movie feel profound and great for both adults and kids alike. Nothing less than excellence came from their respective departments.Writing and direction were a 'make or break' factor in this movie. They certainly made it. As for the voice cast, they delivered on every count.This tale saw Puss coming to terms with the fact that he was getting older and may not live forever. In keeping with the spirit of his character, he was down to his last life (the ninth). This plot-element added great tension in \"The Last Wish\" and made the motivations of every character in it seem relevant and credible.Final Notes:The idea behind the \"star light, star bright\" wish was amazing. I couldn't guess how things would pan out with Puss in relation to the titular last wish.I admired how the team kept things simple and relatable. They focused more on emotion rather than just high-octane action, which received its fair share of attention in the movie anyway.\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" set the stage for a major continuation of the \"Shrek\" franchise. It also delivered a high standard in animation-movie storytelling.",

Aaaand if you want to leave it at that, feel free, because below is going to get into the nit picks.Alright, now we're set up for some criticism, the opening sequence isn't great, it's not bad, but it let's the rest of the movie down and lulls you into a \"oh no it's gonna be one of THESE dreamworks movies\" kinda moods. Thankfully that's kicked into touch within 5 mins or so and the story begins proper.Without spoiling, the wolf design is superb, equal parts menacing and beautiful, modelled and animated with a passion that doesn't come across in too many other characters.Speaking of the animation.... it's... well, not to my taste. Substantially deviates from the original style and leans more into modern anime for the \"exciting\" scenes (fights and what not), which while interesting to watch, does lead to an odd deformed cell shaded look perhaps more often than i'd like. Certainly not up to the standard Dreamworks put on show in the 1st film.And now the 1st films been mentioned, yes, some time has passed but the 2 main returning cast both sound like they've been smoking 40 a day since then, which is unfortunate if you watch these back to back as it's a little jarring.Oh and you might have to look up who the hell Tom Thumb is, because that isn't prevalent in the UK amongst my generation.In any case, minor niggles aside, it's excellent and fully deserving of all the praise heaped on it.

But the animation, oh my amigo, The animation in this film is intoxicating, it is immaculate and AWESOME, I don't mind saying that in many moments of the film I let go of the experience and just thought of myself contemplating the beautiful animation,It is visible that with each film DreamWorks improves its animation style even more. The Sonography of the film, well it exists, is far from being impressive and incredible but it works, And the songs in general only serve to have a little noise playing in the background of the scenes, except for one, I don't want to spoil it here, but when you watch it or if you've already watched it, you know it well What am I talking about, that hiss is just terrifying. The script Paul Fisher & Tommy Swerdlow It's good, he manages to read and hold and is very effective in the emotional moments, The mcguffin of the film, he is interesting and causes very memorable scenes with the protagonist and the antagonist wanting to catch him, the film also has a greater maturity of our protagonist and it's quite rewarding to see him change throughout the film in an organic way, but in particular one of the best scenes in the film is the combat at the end, which is without a joke one of the best action scenes that I've already seen it, it's incredible and our villain, the big bad wolf without wanting to give away the gold at the end, is one of the best animation villains in a good 5 years.

The Last Wish is just amazing all around and I'm really happy now that more stylized animation is being used by other studios in a really cool way. This movie was one of the last movies that I thought was going to be really good but I'm very happy that it went above and beyond what I thought it was going to be. The story is pretty cliche and generic yes but it's everything around the story that makes this film so good. The animation is incredibly. The Spider-Verse style works very well for this film and it still stands out from Spider-Verse in its own unique way. The characters and their own respective arcs are great. There really isn't one weak character here. Puss himself gets some excellent development and his journey of grabbing with the concept of death is very emotional and well written. Kitty Softpaws also has a really good arc and chemistry with Puss and Perrito has some really great moments. All of the villains here are great. Goldilocks and the 3 bears all have a good arc and Jack Horner is one of the funniest characters ever included in an animated film and works amazingly well as the irredeemable villain but the real standout here is Death. Death is probably one of if not the best Dreamworks villain. To have Death be personified and built up the way it is in the film is just something else. His interactions with Puss were always amazing. The humor was great as well. Pretty much every joke from Jack landed and all the other jokes were really great as well. Everyone involved with this film felt like they really cared about the characters and the story and that's what makes the film so great.

It really feels like everything fell into place creating him, haven't enjoyed a proper \"villain\" in a long time and he really filled all the boxes.Had to get used to the animated style on the first minutes but greatly enjoyed it afterwards. Catchy music and side characters with heart and purpose.Great movie and props to the entire team. A breath of fresh air. It can stand pround next to the other highrunners you have created over the years. Keep it up!",

            "content": "Puss in Boots tells a story that you don't need to be a thirty-two-year-old like me and have seen all of Shrek to understand. This animation is an independent film and tells its own story.The story intended for the new adventure of Puss in Boots is not a clich\u00e9 story and introduces us to new characters, the flagship of which is the character of the wolf.The wolf enters the story just as we have seen a long sequence of Puss in Boots' bravery and skilful battle with a gigantic giant minutes before its imposing and terrifying appearance. The hero's fear of this newly arrived negative character and the soundtrack that is played during the entrance of the wolf have joined hands to introduce this completely new character to us in a twenty-something-year-old franchise. He is a character that the hero is afraid of and is actually a personification of death.Dealing with the category of \"death\" in an animation is a difficult task, and we can safely say that a studio like Pixar has been able to enter this issue with great skill. Works like Coco and Soul beautifully displayed the phenomenon of death and scrutinized it. In Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, however, the issue comes back to the \"fear of death\". Puss in Boots is now afraid of death and no longer jumps into the water.The rhythm and tempo of the Puss in Boots 2 animation goes so that we can see an additional scene in the least moment. The makers took advantage of the second-by-second visuals they provided, and many of their jokes and comedies are hidden in the background of the sequences. In this case, it can be claimed that in many action scenes, the audience should pay attention to the image and understand several things at the same time, and this issue makes the audience have a good sense of the animation.\"But the best feature of Puss in Boots 2 animation, in my opinion, I can boldly say that it is one of those works that was able to appear better than its first version. This improvement is clearly visible both in terms of the story and screenplay, and in terms of character development. And the characters we meet during the animation.",

The way they illustrated the fear of death in Puss whenever Lobo showed up was masterfully done. Everyone's characters and outlooks on life seamlessly connected to each other whether it was softpaws cynicism to Perro's optimism or Jack Horners sociopathy to Goldilocks empathy it sends an an positive message to children without being preachy or cringe. The concept of puss losing 8 lives because of the myth that cats have 9 lives was interesting and creative premise. The ending was a bit sappy and some of the comedy was a little heavy handed but this is a good short watch.",

Yes there were the odd few instances it didn't need to be as long in a scene but there are so few !!The character development of SO many and none of them felt rushed at all, the animation was so good and dropping the frame rate for the fights was such a good idea because it worked so well.I think of course puss had the best story, needing to change from a self centred show off to an open and more humble character is such a great journey.Perrito was great, the voice of reason and the voice of appreciation. Possibly one of the most heartbreaking backstories created such a lovable character and in sheer comparison our villain who had a perfect upbringing and yet turned into a disgusting pig man.I could highlight each character and their strengths but Wolf the bounty hunter oh my god, I can't get over such a well written character, the movie used him in all the right moments and sparingly, it worked, it worked really well, his theme song gave me chills, his lines were so well written, BravoI really really loved this movie, Dreamwork did a fantastic job !!!!",

I enjoyed the first one but it was no instant classic so my expectations was not huge to say at least for a sequel but I ended up watching it anyways and boy did it hit just right.The villains are great, from Big Jack Horner to Goldie Locks with Bears and the Wolf, they are in each their own little story adding to the whole.While Big Jack Horner is great as a main villain with a GREAT disregard for anyones life, Goldie and her bear-family have a great dynamic and their own goals.The Wolf does not appear much but he leaves such a huge impression that his fe appearances are nothing less than legendary. He's probably one of the best villains depicted I've ever seen when it comes to the animated/cartoon type of villains, his presence is just fantastic.The main cast of Puss, Kitty and Perrito also have an excellent chemistry and it just works perfectly.Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek is an excellent cast for the main kitties while Harvey Guillen makes the overly positive Perrito work when it could so quickly have become something like Jxr-Jxr Bxnks.And lets not forget the rest of the cast that are allowed to shine and really delivers at all times.The animation is inspired by Spider-Man: Into the spider-verse and it's fantastic, the attention to detail, the colors and the anime-like action makes this movie a joy to watch.I recommend this movie to absolutely everyone.",

            "content": "Puss in boots: the last wish has no right to be this level of good. I entered the theater with low expectations. And I came out and was completely overwhelmed by this masterpiece.And honestly, I thought they would ruin him but no absolutely not I was so wrong. We still have the good old jokes and even the animation+style isn't bad at all, I like the new style. Plus seeing Shrek, Donkey, and all the other members back, it's awesome to see that again. If we talk about villains I can only say they all made a great performance on screen. My absolute favorite easily and I just wish he was just the only main villain, the Big Bad Wolf this character with his voice and his whistling gives chills on a different level and makes him one of the best characters and villains. His personality is extremely cold and also treacherous for little kids, maybe a bit too much. But I am so happy they made him a terrifying villain, I mean Dreamworks just knows how to make good villains. The story was also amazing it shows that even the fearless hero has his fears which is in this case the big bad wolf (he's a bit more than that but I don't wanna spoil too much) Even with all the angst this movie gives us some life lessons, for example, Puss likes himself he praises being a hero and cares less about others which can be quite problematic as we noticed. We saw many great moments such as a bit of action and course many jokes and a big adventure. This film truly is the definition of worth the wait, and I can't help but admire the direction these animated studios are heading (especially Sony animation picture and DreamWorks) to be more creator-oriented like Ghibli films and show the touch of the artist in Spiderverse 2018 and Arcane. I was extremely surprised and ended up with a new favorite movie in 2022. I can recommend this movie to everyone it may don't look like much at first but it's greater than you think. Also Perrito, I need a perrito in my life, I reallly do. 8/10.",

With the help of Kitty Softpaws (voiced by Salma Hayek) and Perrito (voiced by Harvey Guillen), can Puss reach the star and make his wish before his last life is over?Firstly, the script and voice acting is amazing! The film feels much like the Puss in Boots (2011) and the series, The Adventures of Puss in Boots (2015-18), in that there is more action and wise cracking jokes. The animation, however, looks more like the series rather than the Shrek (2001) franchise; more comic book 'Miles Morales' style over fluid animation.Secondly, due to the number of antagonists in the film, it does feel a bit convoluted. Each of the bad guys is explained, but could easily have been featured in their own films. That being said, the movie was enjoyable and comes to a logical conclusion in the end.Worth a watch!",

He is one of the most ice cold and memorable animation villains I have ever seen, and his impact on the story is nothing short of awe-inspiring. His presence in this film is so imposing even though he doesn't have that much screen time he feels like he's there all the time.Also his whistle is crazy and genuinely terrifying and his dialogue is also superbly written intimidating lines which add to the tension and drama of the film. Just wonderful wonderful writing for him.All in All, the movie was just that good. A cinematic art and must watch, especially for animation fans.

The perrito dog was cute but not that great of a voice actor or cute of animation. Jack Horner was like a pie loving Wilson Fisk. Maybe it's that a 4 & 6 yr old were too young?

I had heard a lot of good things about this movie, and it lives up to the expectations. It\u00b4s a fun, well animated adventure movie that really blurs the line between kids and adult animation. This twist took me by surprise, but it worked so well for the movie and gave it it\u00b4s own identity. Overall, I was entertained from start to finish and that\u00b4s all you can ask for.After dying once again, it dawns on Puss in Boots his down to his last life out of his 9. After learning an assassin is after him, Puss goes into retirement, but is also forced out of that. He learns about a map to a wising star, where he\u00b4ll wish back his 9 lives.The blend of adult and kid humor and adult topics and kid script. Surprised me positively but it also was a bit too much towards the end. The script can be over explaining and full of clich\u00e9 lines and tropes, but it didn't bother me too much. I was more surprised when I saw blood in this movie, when characters swore and it was bleeped, when a heavy topic like death is brought up with no metaphor or anything. The movie blurred the line between adult and kids' animation and it did it masterfully to really subvert the tropes and expectations you go into a movie like this with.The animation at display is incredible. The animation is so fluent, colorful, and vibrant. It\u00b4s a beautiful display of artistry and the different shifting set pieces shows immense control and creativity. The action with missing in-between frames has been compared to Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse (2018) and I see why. It has this choppy feeling to it that looks cool and reminds you of old school action cartoons where impact lands so well. The action in general is incredible really highlighted by the animation styles, the clash of styles and the phenomenal camera work.This is a great cast of characters, and everyone seemed to have a fun purpose. From heroes to villains, every character seemed to have their own character and felt so distinct and belonging in their own way. The voice cast is also great, and everyone is doing such a good job. I really liked John Mulaneys performance as he brought so much humor to his role. I thought Puss was a bit annoying and repetitive in the beginning, but you quickly forget that as the movie goes on. I also had a few issues with Perrito. I think he was supposed to come off rendering but ended up being a bit too clueless for me. He did, luckily, not hit minion levels of annoyingness, and his addition to the story worked for me.In general, the villain lineup is phenomenal. There are 3 villain entities and they all fee distinct and add their own flair. Goldilocks and the bears are a fun crime family, and their dynamic is so endearing. Jack Horner is the one with the least meat, but the one with the best humor and the most creative arsenal of magical items from all the fairy tales. And best of all, the wolf. Having a villain that is borderline horror is incredible to see, and the character feels so omnipresent and intimidating. It\u00b4s an incredible character and the action scenes involving him is incredible.The display of creativity here is incredible and is what makes the movie stand out. The weapons, the action choreography, the wishing star land that shifts with the holder. It\u00b4s all so well thought out yet leaves so many surprises.I mentioned the phenomenal action at display and it\u00b4s also frequent. The last action scene is of course the culmination in many ways, but earlier fights also feel like they stand on their own.It\u00b4s been a while since I saw a simple adventure movie. It\u00b4s one of those movies where the universe, action, and characters carry everything and while not a high art movie it\u00b4s one of those just pure adrenaline entertainment movies that are just fun and impactful from start to finish.What really makes the movie stick out is that it dared. It dared to have adult humor, it dared to talk about death and the fear of it, it dared to show blood, all this really subverted everything and as I\u00b4ve talked about before, animation that dares to challenge kids is on the rise. It\u00b4s a tough thing to see characters really get hurt, to hear they might die, but it\u00b4s important to talk about and using a movie that both adults and kids can understand, enjoy and talk from can be so important.Puss in Boots: The last wish is so good and that\u00b4s so weird, it coming from a now memed to death franchise. Seeing what came from this universe is insane and it might be one of the strongest dreamworks movies I have seen. It has heart, it has action, it has incredible animation and most importantly it dared to really tell an impactful story. This is an adventure movie I will return to no doubt.Oscar predictions: This movie is up against heavy hitters this year. It\u00b4s my personal favorite of the 4 out of 5 nominated I have seen, but I think it\u00b4s up against to stiff of a competition to win. From a pure animation quality standpoint, I see this as the potential candidate for winning. The academy has snubbed stop motion before. But Del Toros is an Academy darling, and the other heavy hitter is a Pixar movie that is a company with many wins associated with it. If it wins I would be happy, and I think it has a shot as it is in the top 3 no doubt, but I don\u00b4t think it\u00b4s the academies number 1.",

            "content": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a shockingly good movie. The expectation for me going into this was high as i had heard so many positives form people i trust and thus was excited to view it. However i am still shocked at just how good the movie was.First lets talk about the characters if this movie. Death is by far and away my favourite villain in any of the Shrek related movies and probably in all of animation. For \"kids\" movie this villain was simply so much more than you would expect. He is by far the best character in this movie (including the main three). He is the glue that holds the movie together as something excellent. Every-time he is on screen i am utterly transfixed on all that's happening. He is an easy 11/10 for me and one of my favorite characters in any movie EVER. Saving my blushes however, i really must say that i enjoyed Puss so much in this movie. He was so interesting when in his own thoughts. I must say as someone personally who has trouble with daily panic, the way that his fear is shown in this movie is second to none. Most (if not all) live action movies cannot get this right. So for a movie i expected to be more childish to get this sense of fear and dread in relation to Puss and his fear of Death is utterly marvelous. Although i must say hearing the heart of Puss in Boots in those intense situations made me feel a scared myself. Besides from his fear and panic, Puss in this movie has a well made relationship with both Perro and particularly Kitty Softpaws that i really enjoyed. Both Kitty and Perro where great characters. I preferred Kitty a lot more it has to be said but Perro was special in his own little way. I will cut these characters short as i don't want to be writing for hours. However Goldilocks and the three Bears i didn't mind and Jack was my least favourite character (which is great as he isn't all that bad either).The story of this movie i spoke about briefly before. However this story n my eyes is the best in the whole Shrek universe. Death was an amazing antagonist, Puss's struggles where absolutely amazing and the duo of Kitty and Perro where really enjoyable. I think that the dilemmas that this movie presents are just great to be a spectator of.The animation of this movie was great. This animation was far better than most animated movies and or shows i have ever seen. To anyone who believes 2D Animation is always better than 3D animation i implore you to watch this film. The fight sin this movie where great. The is only single fight i didn't like in the entire runtime of the movie and it was the last fight with Jack Horner. The reasons for this are that i believe personally that Death should have been the final fight/boss of the movie and the simple fact i believed Jack Horner getting sucked into the bag was enough to end his character. But the fact it's my first major negative (or negative at all) is spectacular.The ending scene that revealed Far Far Away as the destination that Puss and friends are going to is a great tease. Will there be another Shrek movie or Puss in Boots film set in the lands of Far Far Away? I must say that i hope in the later movies of this franchise Death shows up as an easter egg at some point. I'm not sure if i want him to appear in full again anytime soon as there is always a fear of ruining a character. But imagine if in the next movie in this universe you hear at some point in the movie the whistle of Death as a little nod to him in this movie. That would be amazing. Or maybe you see his eyes in the background of a shot i n a movie. Whatever the case may be, i really want some references in future.I have not even mentioned how i think the voiced actors is this movie are perfect.Characters - 10/10Story 9/10Animation 10/10Cast/Voice Actors - 10/10Fights - 9/10This movie is one of which i highly recommend, 9/10.",

It had a plethora of funny Disney and nursery rhyme mentions and the movie never got boring to me. There was however some cursing like Hell and crap that I wasn't expecting so heads up on that for the kids and there's a wolf character I thought was a tad scary for little kids too but I felt despite those things they were trying to reach out to both kids and adults for this film and in the end I felt was quite successful. The graphics have an Into the Spiderverse feel during fight scenes which is different yet fun and the message about friendship and family was great for kids but also had a deeper meaning for adults about reflections on your time on earth and what you would've done differently and what would you do if you had the chance to change it. Great film go see it!",

The story and characters were fine, but there was a noticeable drop in quality of the animation and cinematography. Firstly the animations style had added clear Manga influence. Especially in the fight scenes which often had that flying background, stuttered amazon that Manga uses. The second issue I had was that the final rendering had obviously had a paint effect applied. As if each frame had been hand painted rather than 3D rendered. The result dropping a lot of the quality and detail that the original film had. If it hadn't been for both of these issues I would have given this film a much higher rating, but together it felt like a cheaper, less finished film than the original.",

Remarkably, this film offers a story comprehensible and entertaining for children while also offering adults a rich viewing experience.

DreamWorks decided to change the style of the cartoon for the better and they succeeded. The comic book style of \"Spider-Man: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" and a bit of anime animation wink at the cat. The cartoon has enough morals. So you will have a lot to think about after watching it. And the main antagonist is one of the best antagonists in cartoons in general. His movements, look, and charisma make you scared. The sequel does not depend on the events of the first part and the series of Shrek cartoons. It tells a new story on its own, about a well-known fairy-tale character who, having spent his 8 lives, is afraid to lose his last one, running away from death itself. Visually, the cartoon is bright and fabulous. It was very unexpected that the director of the failed projects Trolls and The Croods: A New Era\" Joel Crawford, was able to make this masterpiece and wipe Disney's nose. So I recommend it to everyone.",

            "content": "Dreamworks really know how to nail their sequels. With Shrek 2 and How To Train Your Dragon 2 being better then the first. They really know how to see the room for improvement that is left behind by previous movies and expanding on them in very interesting and inventive ways. With Puss in Boots making his first apperance in Shrek 2 almost 20 years ago now, he has been a very popular support character in the Shrek franchise with a memorable voice performance by Antonio Banderas, he was bound to get his own standalone movie sooner or later. Eventually in 2011, one year after the supposedly final Shrek movie was released, the self titled Puss in Boots was released to mediocre reception. In my opinion it was a bit to weak and not very memorable when it came to Dreamworks productions at that stage and lost some of the charm that the Shrek movie were known for. It wasn't a terrible or even really that bad of a film. But it felt pretty throwaway that left a lot to be desired.The thing that makes Puss in Boots: The Last Wish so much better than the first, is that this felt purley like a passion project than a character cash in which is what the first one felt like. It is obvious that an insane amount of passion went into this movies direction, animation, writing and voice acting to make the movie as entertaining as possible aswell as giving us a few things that we haven't seen before.First off, the animation in this film is gorgeous. This type of cel shaded and traditional 3D hybrid style really fits this film and leaves me wondering if this is the type of style that Dreamworks Animation will stick with from now on, or they will do something different again with their next production. It is also incredibly vibrant and detailed in certain shots. I also like how many of the fighting and action scenes put the characters in this lower frame rate choppy but kinetic style of movement which worked very well when it was used.Antonio Banderas has never sounded better as Puss and every supporting actor knocked it out of the park aswell. Kitty makes a return aswell and she is utilized much better here than in the previous movie but the biggest surprise of this movie was the new character called Burrito. Whoever voiced him did a fantastic job and is the best new Dreamworks character in a very long time! You would think his infectious niceness would get old really fast, but they use it very well and he is actually pretty multi layered and gets a lot of laughs. I think he is in the realm of superniceness which is a term from reading a Richard Dawkins book a few years back where he said that being overloaded with the perk of niceness and kindness is a perversion of darwinism from a scientific standpoint. Though he also said that these kind of people don't bother him and wishes there were more types of people in this world. Burrito as a character symbolizes this type of person in my opinion.The humor in this movie is actually really good aswell and a bit edgy with a lot of bleeped swearing which lets your mind fill in the blanks without it breaking it's family rating which I thought was really smart. And there were quite a few good visual gags aswell.I do have to talk about the villans in this movie because there is more than one, and they all play off eachother basically perfectly and it really shows how smart Dreamworks have become at crafting origional villans. The character of 'Death' is the scariest and most menacing family film villan I have seen in a long time and I was surprised at how hard they pushed him as a character, because he's not really a typical villan but the embodiment of a dark concept, a force of nature.Overall I thought it was a brilliant animated sequel which took more risks than what I've seen in a very long while in the Western animation industry. Absolutley fantastic!",

I was not expecting much from this film but I had heard much praise for it and so I went and watched it to see what the hype was.Puss in boots was fun, exciting, and fresh. It was much better than I expected. For a sequel to a movie over a decade old, it has so much heart and sincerity. This is one of the most gorgeously animated film that has ever been produced by Dreamworks. I thought that nothing could top the feel and look of How To Train Your Dragon. This blows that out of the water. I also never thought I would enjoy a Dreamworks movie more than Shrek 2. In my heart, Shrek 2 is still a masterpiece, but this is head and shoulders above anything Dreamworks has ever done. In most instances, I would have named this the best-animated movie of the year. Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio was just such a masterpiece that Puss in Boots becomes my second favorite animated film of the year.

I also loved all the cheeky Disney film Easter eggs that were just specific enough to make you realize they're referencing those films without explicitly violating copyright laws (bravo, DreamWorks). To top it all off, the writers actually managed to find a balance between kid and adult humor. I, a 24-year old grad student, genuinely laughed out loud at a children's film and I'm not ashamed to admit it, because DreamWorks didn't go the \"let's pander to all the kids without any consideration for the adults in the room\" route.

Mesmerizing views and story!The animations first of all is just so amazing (modern styled)-it really got me to the edge of my seat looking at the flashes and the bright colours. And there were the antagonists which were AMAZING especially Big Bad Wolf. I mean haven't seen any other movie where the villain makes a cool-spooky entrance (it literally gave me chills). The comedy and jokes were also pretty fun to watch and listen to it.And thats why if you're a big fan of comedy/drama/fantasy/adventure/magic check this movie out and see it for yourself.Always been a Shreks Franchaise Fan.

Goldilocks and the Three Bears on one hand on Jack Horner on the other.Whilst the premise is simple, the film is elevated because of the motivations within and between each group as well as interesting situation that they find themselves in. That's not even to mention the villain of the film... Death, which takes the form of a frightening big bad bounty hunter Wolf.Whilst I'm still not a huge fan of Puss in Boots itself. The characters and themes of the film made it a enjoyable watch and another satisfying entry in the Shrek universe.",

Puss and the Gang, the Three Bears Family, Death, and even Jack Horner are so captivating and interesting that you just want to see more of them. Especially Death with how strong of an impression he left despite how little he was in the film. So on the character side it's perfect, and so is the narrative and animation side. Especially since the story and pacing is so quick yet strong, simple yet elegant in its presentation. And the art and animation took so much inspiration from Spider-Verse with its style that makes it all the better in its fantastical setting and makes the more action-packed portions even more exciting. An amazing film that was just right every step of the way.",

Puss is experiencing an identity crisis, he realizes that his ego is his greatest enemy, he fears death and this changes his entire persona. The characters are amazing from the frog, the dog, the wolf, and let's not forget about the Bears. When I watch this movie, I think of how far DreamWorks came and how they've been able to differentiate themselves from Disney and create riveting films that really strike an emotion. If you were looking for a film to enjoy with family, friends, or even yourself I definitely recommend Puss in boots. As clich\u00e9 as this plot may be, you can really take away real life applications from this movie. Great film.",

Characters were phenomenal, the story is fantastic and the overall experience was just so refreshing. This is better than the usual generic animated movies we are getting nowadays, and it mainly has something to do with Dreamworks willingness to push the movie to have bizzare and dark characters such as the wolf (I wont name him - he is one of the best things about this movie) and Jack Horner which are villains who are equally great but gives off different vibes.It has been a long time since I've smiled almost throughout a movie, not because of quips or jokes every 5 minutes that tend to get old very fast, I smiled through the movie because of its high quality delivery of a great plot that never feels too congested and I think that all characters actually had great development within a movie that is less than 2 hours total.I hope this would be the standard of animated movies going forward as other studios such as Pixar has become quite stale and generic lately.",

Overall I think it added depth to Dreamwork's' filmography, and was a great follow up to the first Puss in boots movie which was such a fantastic film.The movie was also fairly funny, but I do have to say that Harvey Guillen's character Perrito was annoying to me. The character felt forced and was just overly \"cute\" which felt tiring after a while, but it is a kids film so its not too big a deal.So with that said this is still the type of movie that someday when I have kids I won't actually mind showing them despite it being being made in the era of dead art and overly greedy Hollywood execs.

I felt it laboured the 'legend' point way too much, and yes I get that it's a kids movie and needs to be somewhat obvious, but I LOVE Dreamworks and Pixar - this is usually my sweet spot, but it was still over cooked.Full disclosure, it would've helped if there weren't parents talking non-stop near me, (please, please, please don't behave as though the cinema's your living room, even if you have kids - who were actually quiet).The part I loved the most was the depiction of mental health and coping mechanisms.

The billions of dollars they bring in should mean that there's at least some heart in the mass production. In a world where animation has literally peaked with graphics and realism you have two options to stay in the game: 1:Great storytelling and originality, and 2: Stylize the crap out of your movies. While Disney has definitely brought in some stylization primarily with Luca and then turning red, the story writing is still lacking. Dreamworks looked at those two options and said \"why not both\". Bad guys is another great example of this. Studios need to realize that the animation community isn't just for kids, and when they produce films like Spiderverse where all the animation nerds make YouTube videos on the freaking frame rate, there is a business in styling your movies. Also I noticed how recently there hasn't been a token \"cute character thst sells well\" in the recent dreamworks movies. They fully focused into making unique character designs, even if it meant not getting the toy sells. Puss in boots has great writing, excellent character arcs, hell my parents laughed, my young cousins laughed, and my teenage siblings laughed. EVERYONE laughed. The textures are amazing, the world building is incredible, character design is immaculate, it feels very alive. It wasn't an over saturation of color like most mass productions are, which real atmosphere being created. Voice acting was incredible. The soundtrack was incredible and yes, the fight scenes were incredible. Honestly if you love animation, or even if you don't, see this movie. If we want to see studios do more of this (like spiderverse and bad guys) we need to show interest. Well done Dreamworks.",

This is most obvious in the script with its wide plundering of nursery rhyme characters from far and wide. At the same time the animation is brighter and shows vivid anime influences in the action sequences.Add on excellent voice acting and some quite sophisticated dramatic tension and you have a film that appeals to both young and old.

To me, the movie was like a really long and entertaining youtube video, or the first time you play some story line oriented game. You kind of know what gag is coming next...Yes, I think the smarmy and gratuitous appeal to cat fetishists is annoying.

Donkey was at least voiced by a comedian and while I love Harvey Guillen, this wasn't the role for him (or probably anyone honestly).The villain is pretty cool, though he has one standout scene and is then reduced to a background chatter showing up every 20 minutes to remind you he exists. They muddy the water with 2 other groups of villains, one of which is just evil for the sake of being evil.All in all, it's fine. It's no Shrek 2, but perhaps those standards are too high to hold this up to.",

The film has many good points, but the main one is its premise of putting family first and also the change of the main character, dropping his selfishness as the plot evolves, which makes the film split into acts, for example: fear of the unknown villain, development of the villains, family and more, not to mention the animation that, in my point of view, was simply perfect, this film is definitely one of the best animated films I've ever seen.",

It's fine to dislike a movie, but there's no need to brush off those who didn't like that.The characters are great, even though there are quite a few! They're all given a reason to exist in the movie and I never felt like there was one just there for filler material. Not to mention each had a nice character arc that fulfilled unexpectedly at the end. The secondary antagonist is a pretty average one that you probably won't be surprised by, however, he adds more action scenes to the movie, which is surely welcome to people who need that.The primary antagonist in this movie may be one of my favourites of all time. It's nice to see an antagonist that isn't driven by greed, power, revenge or love, for once. Something different is always welcomeThe animation and the art style are also great. I can see why some find the more anime-style sequences grating, but I personally feel they add character to the fight scenes. The environments are beautifully realised here (the environment changes too.. very, very often)The writing was stellar. Some pretty good jokes and a lot of \"heh, that was clever\" moments. I ended up being quite invested in each character in the end, especially due to the writing. The appearance of different fairytale characters here and there is fun too. One of my favourite lines was \"you promised us our our weight in gold\".Also props to Dreamworks for making possibly the least annoying sidekick in one of their movies of all time!Would recommend to watch. It wasn't too hot. It wasn't too cold. It was just right.",

            "review_title": "Best Animated Movie of the Year!",
            "content": "It has been over a decade since the last \"Shrek\" franchise movie released with the spin-off \"Puss in Boots.\" When \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" was announced, I had no excitement for this film and almost decided to skip seeing it in theaters. I am so glad I didn't, as this is my favorite animated movie of the year. The original \"Puss in Boots\" was decent but didn't justify a sequel, and the vast gap between these films made me assume DreamWorks was simply trying to cash in on a popular IP. Instead, we got arguably the best film in the entire \"Shrek\" franchise. So what makes this movie such a thrilling watch?Puss in Boots, charismatically voiced by Antonio Banderas, has always been a daring adventurer, a borderline outlaw, a heartthrob with the female kitties, and a bigger-than-life legend known by all. This movie takes the Zack Snyder route of deconstructing our hero, but it perfectly works in \"The Last Wish.\"The story opens up in a lively bar where Puss performs the catchiest original earworms of the franchise in \"Fearless Hero,\" setting up his larger-than-life presence. The mood is quickly dampened for our partying pussy cat when confronted by The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura). The wolf, who effectively acts as The Grim Reaper and reveals himself as Death, shows Puss that he is down to the final of his nine lives in a hilarious montage. That comedic tone contrasts the wolf himself, who is easily the most excellent, intimidating, and scariest villain in any of these Shrek movies and one of the best villains in an animated film I've seen. With his creepy whistling, massive scythes that scrape against the ground, glowing red eyes, and compelling voice performance by Wagner Moura, Death steals every scene he is in, and we sense the fear that Puss feels.Puss goes on the run, fakes his death, and seeks refuge at the amusing crazy cat lady, Mama Luna's house. Puss struggles with retirement in this new sheltered lifestyle and finds it demanding to settle down from his adventurous ways. When he thought things were going awry, he met an annoying Chihauha disguised as a cat. This stranded dog, later named Perrito (Harvey Guillen), would become an unlikely ally for Puss on his journey as Puss develops quite a soft spot for him. Perrito is one of the highlights of this movie, and his naive innocence is played with such enthusiasm and humor that you can't help but smile when he is on screen. He's infectious and funny as a character, but his backstory provides some of the film's darker and more emotional moments.Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), Puss's former fiance and rival, confronts Puss and Perrito, and the trio sets off with a magic map to find the Wishing Star. Puss wants to use the wish to restore his nine lives, but Kitty wants to wish for someone to trust, as she's never known anyone trustworthy. That includes Puss, who we learn stood her up at the altar on their wedding day. Perrito, on the other hand, does not want to wish for anything as he is happy with his two new friends and content with what he has. You can see where the whole \"moral of the story\" comes in.The magical map changes the path in interesting ways depending on who is holding it and is utilized cleverly to deliver exposition and learn more about our characters. Of course, dangerous and magical obstacles get in their way on their journey, but this would not be a \"Shrek\" movie without some fun fairy tale characters characterized in a comical and witty way. This movie becomes a MacGuffin film when Goldilocks and the Three Bears (Florence Pugh, Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo) chase after our heroes for the map. The incredibly talented voice cast plays all these characters with charisma, and the exaggerated Cockney-voiced characterizations make this group a lot of fun. On top of that, the big baddie \"Big\" Jack Horner wants to use the Wishing Star to acquire all the magic in the world. He has always been jealous of fairy tale characters and their magic since he was \"just a nursery rhyme.\" He is played delightfully evil without an ounce of remorse, making it clear he is the main villain and making his demise much more satisfying.\"The Last Wish\" understandably has the best animation of any of the \"Shrek\" movies since it came out 11 years after the most recent installment. Still, this movie takes animation to another level. The visuals are elaborate, detailed, and popping with color, and it is DreamWorks' best-animated film, which says something for an animation studio with the resume of DreamWorks. It hops between more traditional DreamWorks animation and lower-framerate \"Into the Spiderverse\"-style animation. While the movie becomes predictable in the middle act as they go on their traditional quest, the character moments, deep emotions, dazzling animation, break-neck pace, stellar voice performances, and engaging humor make this my favorite animated film of the year. 9/10.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed this movie! That being said, it is in no way perfect and still has only a couple things it could have done better. Such as having John Mulaney as the voice of \"Big\" Jack Horner; it didn't work for me - I just couldn't take that voice seriously...and I found it to be a little annoying. A better voice might have been...someone like Kevin James. I while I did love the Wolf, I wish they would have used someone else as the physical embodiment of Death. Because I don't see Death, I see just another version of The Big Bad Wolf. They could have used someone like Xibalba (the Mayan god of death), that to me would have been better - and they could have taken design inspirations from Tzekel-Kan and his acolyte (from \"The Road to El Dorado\"). I also was not a fun of the animation, because we've seen Puss and his companions in traditional 3D animation, so to suddenly see them in a different style...it just didn't work for me. The worst for me was Perrito because comic-reliefs are almost done wrong. I mean, Perrito looked, talked, and acted like a moron. There is nothing wrong with someone being friendly, happy and positive...but that doesn't mean they also have to be naive and idiotic. Why didn't they just make Perrito happy-go-lucky because whenever he was stayed positive something good things always happened to him? The only times where he actually comforted Puss was when he was good, and I wish he was better at it because he even admitted that he wanted to be a therapy dog. I even wished there was just a little more time to rebuild the chemistry between Puss and Kitty - and I wish they actually kissed, much like they did in the first film. I did like the twist they did with Goldilocks and the Three Bears, but the whole reference to their story got old real quickly; also the bears could of had just a bit more brains. And while it is small...I didn't like the new mask they gave Kitty, and should have stuck with the black one. Finally the whole name \"Team Friendship\" was just stupid.That being said I loved how much darker and more mature this movie was than all its predecessors. My favorite parts were always when the Wolf was on screen. I was also shocked to hear so many beeping/swears in the movie, as well as the \"body count\". I hope other kid movies start taking notes from this. And while I did find Jack Horner to be a spoiled brat, I did find him to be a believable villain because of how heartless and egotistical he was. The same goes with Death - I really wish he was given a bigger role. The action was pretty fun to watch, and I like the message they were trying to get across: \"live your life to the fullest, and be happy with what you have.\" And I guess the animation worked every now and than, and most of the voice acting was done very well. I really did enjoy watching this movie, and so the good stuff outweigh the annoying stuff. It seemed to me that there was more to be told, which is why I wish it was a little longer. I also wish that Puss and Kitty prepared to redo their wedding, and planned on having a littler (and what they would name them). I would gladly love see another movie with Puss and Kitty going on another adventure together.",

            "content": "I had no idea that this sequel to a decade old movie was being released until I kept seeing people saying this movie was great. Of course, being English, I had to wait until February to see it. Avoiding spoilers was hard enough from the Americans, so I made sure I saw this movie as soon as I could once it released in the UK, and I was surprised that even though this movie was sold to me as amazing, it still exceeded my expectations!The story was a \"reach the goal first\" type between the team of Puss in Boots, Kitty Softpaws, and Perrito the Dog, the team of Goldilocks and the Three Bears crime family, and then Big Jack Horner and his Baker's Dozen. Each has a reason to get to the Wishing Star first, and so the stakes and motives are set up very well. Additionally, Puss in Boots, at his last life, is being haunted by Death (in the form of a big bad Wolf), which gives the movie a chance to explore anxiety quite well.This movie contains various types of villains and serves each quite well. Goldilocks and the Three Bears serve as the redeemable villains, as Goldi's wish is to find a new family, but she soon realises that all she needed was the Three Bears. Next, the irredeemable villain of Jack Horner. I'd never heard of Jack Horner before, but they explained his story pretty well, gave him a story as to why he was evil, and the back and forth between Jack and the Ethical Bug shows just how bad he is, but also serves for fun comedy. And then there's Death, who follows a sort of horror villain blueprint of relentlessly chasing down the protagonist until they reach an inevitable final confrontation.My main complaint about the movie was that some aspects felt a bit predictable. It became clear that Goldilocks was after a real family so you knew she would inevitably give that up to stay with the bears. Jack Horner obviously couldn't get the wish, as that would've been this movie's equivalent of the Thanos snap. The fact that no one got the wish in the end was a surprise though. And seeing Jack get so close just to be stopped by the Ethical Bug was honestly perfect. However, back onto the predictability, as soon as Death mentioned that Puss lived carelessly, throwing lives away, it was quite obvious that Puss would learn to use his life well and that would result in Death conceding in battle. Death obviously couldn't be killed, as he's, well, death! And killing Puss, as shocking as that would have been, would never have happened in a movie with the primary target audience being children.It must be mentioned though that this movie's animation was amazing, the comedy was on point in the right places, the themes of this movie were executed well, and somehow, this movie has exceeded most of what Disney's been producing in recent times. Would love to see more animated movie with this level of storytelling!A solid 8/10 from this reviewer.",

New director Crawford borrows a page from 2018's Oscar-winning \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" and DreamWorks' own \"The Bad Guys\" from earlier this year to give a stylized, dynamic approach to \"The Last Wish\" that imbues the proceedings with a whole new energy.There are several digressions - occasionally uplifting and oftentimes uproarious - as each group attempts to claim the Wishing Star, all with very different plans if they get it. Goldilocks, for example, wants everything to be just right, which might be positively endearing were it not for the fact that she sounds like a cockney gangster out of a Guy Ritchie movie.Of course, the most important part of the mix is the man whose dulcet tones carry us along on this fractured fairy tale. Banderas is in fine form as his animated alter ego, clearly having lost none of his affinity for the role in the intervening decade and change. Quick, someone convince Banderas to reprise his other iconic sword-slashing hero as well!How things culminate in \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" isn't exactly surprising. But in true storybook fashion, the script by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow offers enough swerves to make the journey worthy of the destination. It's a perfect package of whimsy, sass and sweetness. Based on where this one ends, the filmmakers are no doubt already at work puzzling out Puss' next cinematic offering, and here's hoping it's not another 11 years before we see it.",

Then the film got delayed which made me loose more confidence in the film. Then I saw it and it was amazing. First off, it revived the shriek franchise and we now know we will be getting Shrek 5. Second, it's the best of the Shrek 1 and 2. Thirdly, the animation in this film is probably some of the best animation I've ever seen in my lifetime on this planet. Also, the villain of the film, Death is hands down the best villain in a cartoon movie ever. The guy was creepy, suspenseful and so badass. Heck, he even made puss in boots bleed! This movie was ten times better than my expectation. Best Dreamworks film of all time!",

Those specific latino style songs that always accompanied puss in boots. The movie will manage to pull on your emotional strings without feeling cheesy. You will care about all the main characters, and the conflict brings them all into a great clash.My one nitpick is with the animation. I don't like those few instances where the animation gets choppy / feels like it's 20 fps. I don't want to accept that as an \"artistic choice\". It feels more like laziness. Thankfully, the really important fight scenes are not choppy at all. Those feel great. Again, in the few scenes the animation gets weird, I can't find any rationale behind it. It just happens and then goes back to nornal. Doesn't make the movie less great, but it's certainly something that would gatekeep it for me from being number 1 on any list. I just hope it's not something movie studios are dipping their toes in to see if they can get away with it.",

The characters are awesome, the settings are vibrant, and the animation is gorgeous. Although, one character who is a wolf could be scary for very young children so I would be mindful of that. But I do have to say this is a major comeback for the franchise and nobody should over look it at all. The humor has the same bite to it as the original movies and the drama is awesome. Please go see this movie though. The theaters are very empty and we need more people to support so that a Shrek 5 may be more likely.9/10, exceeds expectations.",

            "content": "After years since anything new from the Shrek franchise graced the movie screen, DreamWorks jumps us back to the fairytale setting we know and love. While we end up following Puss in Boots instead of our favorite green ogre and his noble steed, Puss manages to take us on a fun adventure with references and fables we know with a twist on them.Puss is living life as a great legend, but after a fight he finds his confidence shattered. Upon hearing of the Wishing Star, he goes off with Kitty Softpaws from the first Puss in Boots and a new side character to find it before his enemies do. Meanwhile, another character lurks in the shadows, who manages to strike fear into the fearless hero's heart. It's a race to see who can get the Wish, and who will betray who to get it.Despite his appearance in other media, viewers don't have to have any reference to understand the plot and characters of this movie. There's a few cameos and easter eggs fans will pick up on, but the story itself is well contained.Puss in Boots remains a lovable rouge who fights with immense style. Watching him fight and interact with all the characters is great to see, and is held up by the pace and style of the animation. There's tons of details animation buffs will enjoy and is quite unique and smooth even to the non-trained eye.The story takes a little bit to get started, but it's a well paced film once it gets going. I found myself unable to look away from the screen even for a second, as did most of the audience I was watching with. Even pretty young kids in my viewing were glued to the screen and there was not any fidgets or whines coming from them. Everyone wanted to see what would happen next.The movie is rated PG, though are some scenes and dialogue that danced the line as smooth as Puss's tap dancing. There's a group of characters created with a British flare, so don't be surprised if you hear them pushing it a bit. There's also a few themes dealing with mortality and fear, so parents or guardians taking their kids should definitely sit down with them afterwards and go over the movie with them. It may scare some kids, but I think a lot more will appreciate the message.Overall, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fun, fast paced adventure featuring the best of Puss and a whole cast of new characters. There's a lot of heart, growth, and beautiful animation that can appeal to anyone, young or old. It's definitely a movie you want to see at least once on the big screen and definitely add to the Shrek collection.If this is a glimpse of what Shrek 5 will be like, then Puss definitely sold me on it!",

I (25y/o) and all my mid-twenty year old friends have all thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I do think the animation is a little strange for the action scenes given that it's different than the animation in the rest of the movie, but once I let myself accept it as a stylistic choice, I actually thought it was pretty cool. Also, the character designs are perfect (Death might be a little scary for younger kids but I didn't hear any whines in the audience the two times I saw it in theaters). The movie was hilarious too if you're a big kid like me or even just enjoyed any of the other Shrek movies. I saw it thrice in about a week and a half and loved it more than the last each time.

The story felt as if it was constantly moving forward, as it never lingered one one plot point for too long, and so succeeded in keeping my interest throughout.Also Fearless Hero is stuck in my head.Overall, 10/10 film, please go watch it.",

As it went on, more characters were introduced who added so much to an already strong main cast and were beautifully and subtly developed throughout the runtime. The animation is sublime, the voice acting is so much better than the first movie which was still pretty good.The story is extremely well paced and the character development is brilliantly portrayed, meshing perfectly with said development.This gets a strong recommendation because of the strong characters and a beautiful story!",

Loved the new characters, loved the animation style and loved the simplicity of the story. Magical elements were so funny. Surprisingly violent and foul which only made it more compelling. Gotta say that my expectations were high but it did not disappoint. Easily one of the best animations nay best movies I seen lately. It is hard to deliver such a strong sequel story. Puss in boots himself had a strong character development and the villain made him even sweeter. And yes, even though the villain has to be the best animated villain I've seen for the past decade. For a animated sequel movie, it delivered! Big time!",

Sometimes the best movies or shows are ones that can grab the attention of anyone. Puss in Boots accomplishes this and more. It still has those lighthearted scenes a kids movie needs, however it is also funny and has themes that are not common in a kids movie. Themes such as the fear of death and panic attacks. They incorporated it in a way that actually works very well and is impressive. They were also able to create a main antagonist that is actually scary. With subtle things such as puss's hair raising, the whistling, and even the voice actor all builds on his character. Puss undergoes real character development and you can clearly see this change in the way he perceives himself and the world around him. A great watch whether its with your family or just by yourself give it a try.",

With budget of 90 million, this is gonna be a bombastic and full of new things.this studio also has produce bad guys, kungfu Panda and how to train your dragon. Without further rido, here is my opinion about this movie:the graphic is pretty good from the other sequel and the animation is rendered perfectly but the monster scene is a bit canny and kinda laggy.The comedy in this movie is timed perfectly and suitable for kids\nit shows that how to cherish our life's and aware that we live once. This movie also a bit emotional.The plot is scripted perfectly and the action is in point not forget about the angle in this movie is magnificentcinemotography is kinda good and I always laugh in the cinema\nwell if you need to understand the movie more you need to watch the first sequelits also have many Easter egg about the previous movie collection and that make this movie really fantastic\nthe graphic is been fusion using a comic tone and sketches make the movie nostalgicthe ending has biggest plot twist ever and this is totally recommended for all people and agesRating:\nPlot:6/10\nGraphic:9/10\nImpression:8/10.",

I am a fan of the lavish hand drawn animation of the '50s, and far more appreciate the slow pace and the dark, serious tones they present, as well as their hidden cleverness and the superb attention to detail in them.But this? Hell yeah, I can really get behind something like this too! It oozes with style and detail and, for the first time in forever, it's not a movie plagued by lifeless and tasteless \"modern audience\" material that has poisoned the industry for far too many years now.I loved almost everything about this movie. The dark tones scattered around were a delight, and the cuteness inserted wasn't really bad at all. I wish Perrito wasn't so... exaggerated, though. I understand the meaning behind him; that he's the embodiment of loyalty because he's a doggo, but still. And I'd have loved more of that stylized animation style! It wasn't enough! It really helped set it apart!The villains were also great, each with their own motivations. But god-damn, whoever designed Death, must really love Dark Souls/Sekiro, because that's the kind of character design I'd expect in those type games. It was my favorite thing from the movie. It was just right!Can't forget the references to Pinocchio, the bears, \"you only had one job!\", and the telegraphed attack of Horner. Good stuff!9/10 - should've been longer (I feel the bond between Softpaws and Puss didn't receive enough attention, felt a little rushed), Perrito could've been toned down a just a little bit, and the stylized 2.5D animation should have received more screen time.Verdict: Absolutely solid movie.

            "content": "MOVIE REVIEW -PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH\nTotal score: 9/10I don't even know how to begin writing this review. I'm still feeling the trace this movie left on me.**ANIMATION AND VISUALS**\nAbsolutely stunning and on point. The animation style matched the feeling of the frame but at the same felt so well bound together. Like for example in the scenes where the main emotion was downright bone chilling, you could stand feel your hairs standing up as the one's of Puss in boots'. The low frame rate at times made the movie feel like the fairytale experience that the story was actually telling. The way the fur was made was astonishingly simple yet believable for the movie's perspective, the flow and the movement was clean despite the frame count. The colour palettes and the whole colour theory in general was very well put together in the whole piece, even when they transitioned from one to another completely contradictory to each other. The details were as many as to you could clearly see what's happening in the character's eye reflection when there were close-ups.**CHARACTER DEPTH AND DEVELOPMENT**\nFirst thing I have to give credit for is that even the character's intonation and accent was thought of so they got the character depth down to that little detail. Each and every of them was severely distinguishable compared to one another. The character of the death was actually very well put in perspective because when in the end he gave up on killing Puss in boots that distinctively shows how if you are no longer after of the end you will be able to simply enjoy it as it is, not the fast and unappreciated life, but one where you are grateful for everything you already have. Which also put the development of Puss' on first place, and Kitty coming in second, their mutual realisation and confession actually made the overused \"happy ending\" trope meaningful. I can't not speak of Perrito's character because it was clearly the most down to earth, positive creature that lives in that vile world, his impact was massive on viewing how someone can stay happy and innocent. It's important to acknowledge his story that no one asked for until they were near the middle of the screen time, and he didn't brag about it, he told it as this \"funny story\" without realising how horribly gut wrenching it sounded making him the pure, gold hearted character that shows everyone they can be better even with such a life story behind him. The three bears and Goldy also supported the theme of being grateful for that you already have as stated earlier in this review.**SCRIPT WRITING**\nThe most lovely part is that the development was like a non stop progressive movement that felt as if the time passed by quicker than it was in reality. And the last 20 minutes of the movie felt so intense that you would stare at the screen at the edge of your seat without time to process or to question whatever is going on you just sit and experience it. The only little flaw I experienced is that I wished there was a few more scenes inbetween the moment when Puss escaped the \"place of the lost souls\" and him reaching the star, but it was still good. The fact the whole movie revolved around the idea of the perfect ending, but then destroying what it built up to made the writing style very outstanding for a \"child's movie\". And on top of that it still had that exact \"perfect ending\" but in a different, more moral and meaningful way. On top of that the whole production had a very high emotional impact on the viewers. At a time I dropped a tear or two I admit, but that only meant to me that the movie was getting better and better.**CONCLUSION**\nThis instantly became my favourite animation of all time bot only because of the beautiful visuals, but also the genius writing of the movie.",

Even some of the villains have great movements like when Jack Horner sacrifices his minions or the banter between Goldilocks and the three bears.

Probably most. But that is a big mistake. The second part came with the animation of Into the Spider-Verse, familiar characters and above all.......a great dark story. There is no shortage of humor and exaggeration, but as one of the few animated films, it even contains horror sequences and adult themes. The central point is the fear of death and the questions surrounding it. She takes the form of a Wolf in the film and is really disturbing to say the least. Related to this is the perfect dubbing where we hear Antonio Banderas aka Kocouro, Selma Hayek as Chichi and the excellent Wagner Ruma as Death, who steals the scenes for himself. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a great sequel to a slightly above average spin-off. It can entertain children and give a powerful and chilling story to adults.",

Not because I thought it's going to surprise me, but because I thought it's too suspicious for people to literally glorify an animated movie made today, especially one that didn't look promising.

No. It's not an issue that the wolf, the most (seemingly) intriguing character among all barely had a screentime, the issue is that they waste that screentime on characters that have no importance to the story or connection to the main character other that being an obstacle to reach the star when they could've given it to the wolf or some more worthy characters. They have their own backstories which don't play a huge role in the movie or enough to make me give a damn about them. The importance of the backstories lasts for only couple of minutes. The rest of the characters' screentime is filled with quarrels and dialogues that don't reveal any depth to them than we already know. As someone who hasn't seen the first movie, this one doesn't introduce Kitty Softpaws as anything other than Puss in Boots' acquaintance and ex-fianc\u00e9e. She is tough and that's all I know about her now. Everyone loves Perrito, even people who dislike this movie, but for me he is a dumbed down version of Donkey. As I remember, Donkey is a happy-go-lucky character who despite his troubles and rejections, he is not extremely oblivious and serves as a good moral support to Fiona and Shrek in their moments of crisis where he becomes the more reasonable out of them, while Perrito is completely oblivious to how annoying he is to the characters around him and what kind of intentions they have towards him. His moral support is basically platitudes and quotes/advices on mental health copy-pasted from social media's psychology coaches, a trend I see too often in modern movies. A touch on mental health topic is not bad. What is bad that your touch on it does not have originality and Twitter users are your best scriptwriters for it. The Fairy Godmother did not tell Cinderella that \"Nothing bad lasts forever, every storm is temporary, sunny days will come.\", she told her \"Even miracles take a little time.\" and that's the simple originality that it's so hard for current scriptwriters. Big Jack Horner has a disturbing, ugly design and aura together with his bakers or pastry chef's and I don't see the greatness in him as a villain except that he wants power and he doesn't care if people die, but there are so many villains like that and they are labelled as evil for the sake of being evil. Him being a previously unnoticed good theatre kid is not a big driving force in this story. Most interesting thing about him is that he has huge collection of various fairytale items he can use to obtain his goals. Goldilocks has a beautiful backstory, but you can't notice that she has any inner struggle about having a bear family except in those couple of minutes in the dark forest where she reminisces of the time she fell asleep in the bears' house and when she admits that her wish is to find a human family. All conflict about it is immediately solved between the family with such quick positive response from her bear mom \"I knew this wasn't going to last. If this is what you want, then we'll make it come true.\". Other than that you can't see any abnormality or problems in them as a family except the fact that they have an adopted human daughter, but this is a fairy tale world so why would we think that's odd? They are all loving towards each other and when they are annoying each other they quickly brush it off and it makes you think they have no problem, only goal - to reach the star.Now, the wolf a.k.a. Death who first appears as a bounty hunter. I agree that he is a scary character and his whistling creeped me out as well as his animation plus character design. But is he a deep character? In my honest opinion, no. He is there to kill Puss in Boots and that's the end of his motive. Explanation for like why does he want to kill him so much to the point of making him anxious is not mentioned as much as I remember. It needs to be mentioned because if he is indeed Death and he was there everytime Puss in Boots died, why would he hunt him so much in his last life when he can just wait for him to make a fool of himself and die? Is Death chasing him a metaphor of reminding Puss in Boots that this will be his final death? I don't know, they don't make it clear especially since everyone can see him as Death and perhaps he is no metaphor. I found everything about him a gimmick to make you think you're watching such a cool, terrifying, interesting villain when in reality he is there to make you scared and that's it. I can see how kids can have nightmares of him and other parts of this movie, like the gore of the bakers dying from big blue flowers and razors or whatever. Really unnecessary.Another of the big flaws in this movie is that they don't need the map. Any\ntime a character has it, the dark forest changes its surface which should make it confusing for the characters that don't have the map to find their way to the star or the way to map. Well, all of them find the way to either of those things without the map either way.Also, this is in Shrek's universe, but I forgot about that during most of the movie and was only reminded through the flashbacks where Shrek's characters appear. This doesn't look a bit like Shrek's universe and it puzzles me how other people can see that. I've seen all Shrek's movies and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish doesn't have their spirit either in script or animation which is by the way psychedelic, not fairytale-like.I don't know why they constantly try to come up with new Puss in Boots stories when they haven't even considered the original with the poor boy that inherits the cat, though that doesn't mean that they can do it justice, not nowadays. The character Puss in Boots takes inspiration from Zorro, the most memorable role of Antonio Banderas for me, but it's disappointing how The Mask of Zorro which is certainly not perfect, but has great effort in directing and dialogue has such a low score compared to Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. Some may say that it's stupid to compare the standard of what makes an excellent animated movie for kids to that of regular movies, but how can you raise the value of animation if you frequently make it or intend it for kids? This doesn't even look intended for kids, that's a point to remember. I'm not against people who think this is a good movie, there's always going to be someone that's easily satisfied, what actually bothers me is that the majority declares it a masterpiece. But as that word is thrown around to the point of losing its meaning there is nothing to be confused about, I guess. As others who have rated this movie low or same as me, I agree that the reasons for the high reviews and ratings can be bots or simply that the bar for movies is low these days. Older actually enjoyable movies have ratings lower than these \"masterpieces\" perhaps because there were many more quality movies you can choose from and it was unfair to give 10, 9 or 8 stars just like that when there were movies better than them, but now when you're jumping from one bad movie to another those that have something more exciting or meaningful than all the awful ones will seem like a masterpiece to you...Especially animated movies. It's sad and I will not agree that animation has progressed. In other words, when you have constant access to water you'll never drink from a puddle, but when your throat and mouth are dry and you haven't tasted water for a long time, a puddle will taste like fresh water.My conclusion: maybe a fine movie for some, but certainty not a deep masterpiece.",

The wolf was just a character made for furries. You want a good villain? Go look at Hans from Frozen then you will know what a good villain is. Oh boohoo meow meow oh no only one life left I'm so scared. And what's even worse? No Shrek! \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 I am not kidding when I say that I am truly ogre with these Puss in Boots movies. They somehow made this worse than the first one. At least with the first one and had a good twist villain, but this couldn't even deliver a good villain. And I can't stand when this film tries to be dark. If you want to know how to make a dark film then go look at Shrek the Third and Boss Baby. DreamWorks really needs to learn from their past mistakes such as Kung Fu Panda, Shrek one and two, and How to Train Your Dragon. They have finally been making good movies such as Boss Baby 1 and 2, but they just never learn from their mistakes. \ud83d\ude24",

The best scenes are honest to god 10/10 material, executed to near-perfection. In an age when so many animated kids' films always feel the need to make villains somehow sympathetic or relatable to the audience, here we get some real monsters that get to be unapologetically fun and bloodthirsty. And because of that, we get a hero who feels genuinely imperiled. The film is smart. From its absolutely madcap opening sequence that makes Puss in Boots out to be an invincible Looney Tunes cartoon character, we then get a killer introduction to the movie's big bad who doesn't play by those same wacky rules. Puss has his whole world turned upside down in one gripping life or death fight sequence, and must learn for the first time what it means to be a legend who can actually live up to the high, prideful standard he's set for himself. It takes guts to stand up to terror and truly gamble everything one values-there is a subtle morality that infuses the hero's journey here which feels straight out of the most classic spaghetti westerns. But the emotions expressed come off as much stronger and more genuine for our vulnerable protagonist. His journey really brings out his kindness, understanding, fear, depression, and truly epic bravery which might be enough to move you to tears (amazing range from Antonio Banderas here). And it looks and sounds eye-wateringly gorgeous at times, with bits that beg to be paused and admired on re-watch. This is a great movie and one that absolutely deserves all the love (and word-of-mouth hype) it's been getting. I highly recommend you check it out for a vivid, gag-loaded swashbuckling fantasy with a heart of gold.",

The villian, Death, based of the Big Bad Wolf, was horrifying. I do warn you there are jump-scares with Death in it. After all he is the sort of Grim Reaper. The other villians like Goldilocks and the Bears were great too. But not as good as Death, the best DreamWorks villian in my opinion. Can I just say, with Puss's therapy dog, the whole movie just gets 10x funnier. The animation is also pretty decent, though it resembles Into the Spiderverse animation style. Anyways, action is amazing, storyline extremely good and the villian, perfect just absolutely perfect. I strongly recommend watching this film if you like, well... Masterpieces.

For some kids it might be scary but it's better what Pixar and Disney do now so I would rather watch this than what Disney and Pixar do Pixar posting LGBTQ+ movies, while I was watching it I had such a cool vibe. Probably DreamWorks gonna earn a lot money from this movie I'm gonna wait untill part two gonna come out I already have watched puss in boots two time when you watching it it gets more better and better I recommend to everyone probably it's best movie in 2023. But for now I'm gonna wait until shrek 5 date release at May 20.....",

            "content": "Yes, I love it!Here is why:Let's start with animation and visuals... Cause it's the best part film! The animation is really fluid, with a lot of movement, personality, it's fast and slow (when it needs), fur animation (rare animation). What I want to say is that is the animation is gorgeous and really different from any other animated film that I watched over the years. Everything that I write here is in principles of animation, like anticipation (character prepares to do an action), slow in and slow out (acceleration of actions) and a lot of other animation things that make this movie out of this world. For me, it's not normal what this movie did with animation, I mean it! And the characters designs are unique as well, with colors vibrant, very well shaped, with different items which makes them distinct from every other character (what is good to understand those characters well), sometimes the designs makes fun of themselves (which I really like)... it's just perfect in every aspect. Production design (Scenarios) is brilliant as well with cartoon designs (like the characters), colors true to color psychology (that is a study about the influence of colors in our brains) and color theory (human perception of colors). Like when the wolf appears and make the screen red to produce the viewer thinking to know that this guy is really DANGEROUS (cause of the red). Well I think that's all in the part of visuals thingy.Now, to storytelling/narrative... It's great as well, but sometimes it's just a little predictable due to conveniences in the story, like when Goldilocks says something o bears and... Pickles (puss in boots) hear the whole conversation... why they say that out loud?? It just doesn't make sense. But it doesn't make the movie bad, it's just a convenience that a lot of movies do, but it's not like one scene, it's a lot, BUT, this doesn't make the movie bad, it's normal, it's in the premise of the film, so it's ok. It has good parts to, like in the final (which made me cry, a little XD), cause it's just too beautiful when Puss in boots accepts the friendship with the other characters. And the antagonist is really good too, because I think is so good, and it's really scary sometimes, because of the moment when he shows up, when the main character know that he can die, the moment is perfect! And the girlfriend of the main character shows up in perfect time too. She has good timing, great motivation (with past and own philosophies). All characters are really well written (good motivation and past, in general). Actually, maybe Death should have more past and motivations.... only maybe, probably. So in general the movie is well written, not just the characters but the World too. Because it has world building due to fairy tales, it's a meta to those, like the Goldilocks, Little Jack Horner, all the magic in the movie... Is very well done! And the message, that is live the life like if its was the last is really good! They had screen time to do everything they needed but I didn't see the time pass because it's dynamic and very well build! Congratulations to whoever wrote this movie! It's almost perfect!So, now I just want to watch the new Shrek movie that this movie teases with my \"Far Far Away\" logo and the dialogues in the end which makes this movie more perfect!!!!See ya, in the next review! =D.",

            "content": "One prop is that it didnt treat the audience like children and had genuine subtlety and scary moments. You would assume that 3 antagonists would be overwelming and atleast one would be boring but noo all of them where unique and fun in thier own way.1. Jack Horner\nA unaplologetic, no nonsense, unsypathetic, funny, selfish brat.Jack is the pinnacle of a villan who knows hes evil and rocks it, he is heavily foucused on comedy even more than Goldi and the bears but dont let that fool you he is evil he hoards all the magic items he can get his fat hands on and uses them to kill anything that opposes him. He had a good child hood with only one bad thing and that was that all the kids only cared about the performances and because of that he wants to get all the magic of the world and kill all that dont like him. And its such a creative spin on the first nursery rhyme.He is the pure evil antagonist2. The wolf\nA intimadating, confident and downright scary force.The wolf is the litteral personifaction of death, he is not sympathetic he is not sorry for being who he is. He doesent hate Puss'n boots himself he hates that puss doesent value the lives he spent he hates that puss is so over confident and arrogant that he cant die and in the end he realises that puss has changed and now values his life and he just leaves. The wolf has no backstory because he doesent need one he doesnt even have a complicated personality! But thats what makes him special, he is just death, thats all his purpose is just to make puss change and learn that he is not indomitable.The wolf the force of nature antagonist.3. Goldi and the 3 bears\nThey are sympathetic, fun and each of them have unique characteristics.I am not gonna go to far with them because they are not so simple as the wolf or Jack, but i can say that unlike the wolf they have comedy and unlike Jack Horner they are likable in the good way. I love how the writers made them like just older version of a what if of the original story where goldi was adopted by the bears and raised with brother bear, I loved how fun they were and how much it seemed like they care about eachother. Again im not gonna go to close into their characters because im not writing 3 more paragraphs so watch the movie or something. Though there is growth and change among them unlike how jack never changed and the wolf just was suprised.They are the sypathetic antagonistAnd thats why this movies antagonists are sooo good and why I cannot make a full movie review without writing an essay about anything. WATCH THE MOVIE ITS SO GOOD. Sorry about the spelling I dont want this to be like school work and I tried.",

Oh, and there's some female cat as well.\"\nThat was all that either of us remembered (besides his theme song) when we went into the theater.So man did it blow us away!The movie was actually good.Not for a kid's movie. Not for a Dreamworks movie. A legitimately good film.They talked intelligently about mortality, heroes, commitment, and responsibility, made brilliant satire of current movie tropes, and threw in a good dash of humor and a feel-good attitude.The villain was epically portrayed, and the characters were well done.I was so certain that the little dog character would be the death of me, but when I watched the movie I learned that he was actually funny and useful to the plot.The lore was well built, and the characters and themes well-developed.And I can't stress enough how they handled the theme of mortality. It blew me away.I very much recommend this movie.As we got back to the car I told her, \"But it wasn't just us having fun, either. Every little kid in that theater had a good time as well.

It didn't bother my 6yo daughter as she's into dark stuff but I can see children having nightmares after meeting him lol. This very character felt out of place in this mellowish Disney inspired movie.And... I may be nitpicking there but I really disliked that weird sluggish animation style they used during the fights. Not only it hurt my head but also looked bad and got me out of the movie every time it happened, destroying the immersion.Felt like you're eating your favourite meal at the restaurant and suddenly the waiter jumps out of nowhere and drown your plate in liters of ketchup, making it gross and disgusting.Kitty felt like her character from 1st movie got switched with some generic soulless cat.Story was ok.. a cat scared of losing his last life was a cool idea, graphics and animation were really nice too (except during the fights, urgh...).Story was ok.",

The movie deals with topics like anxiety, fear, death, and many other topics, all of which are dealt with very well.In the scene where Puss has a panic attack, it was dealt with extremely well. I deal with very bad anxiety, and this scene felt very personal to me. And when Perrito helps Puss deal with it, it's done very well.The animation is done very, very well. The fight and action scenes made my jaw drop. Fantastic animation.On the topic of the characters themselves - Puss, who at the beginning, was an arrogant warrior who felt as if he was above death. And throughout the movie, but then is brought down to his last life of 9. He learns to appreciate the life he has left instead of wasting it like he did before.Kitty, her trust issues are not hammered down on the viewer to get the message across, but it is clear to the viewer that it is how she feels. Her growth and development to learn to trust people - to trust Puss, specifically - was very well done.Perrito, I thought he would be an annoying sidekick like in many movies. But he ended up being one of the most endearing characters in the movie with his love of life and positive attitude. I cant possibly talk about every character, so I chose the 3 main characters, but every character has a great personality and development.The story itself was very good. The topic of Puss running from the manifestation of death itself alongside everything else was amazing. The characters mix well with eachother and the story to make something phenomenal.This movie was also very friendly to new watchers. You don't need to watch the original Puss In Boots or Shrek franchise to understand what happens, which is really good!

I really like the character development and seriousness of the plot - but in the same time keeping the humor and family friendly vibes on point. The music is great and animation is on another lvl. The Last Wish is the closest I've ever seen a movie get to emulating hand-painted concept art. On their way to the wishing star, Puss and company traverse prismatic backdrops, from bright pinks and green forests to the rustic interiors of a cat-lady prison that feel dabbed on by the artistic team - it's just awesome! The hopes for a good animated movies returned!",

The comedy is very well written and nicely tuned with the more serious scenes of the movie.I did not expect such a battle with death and mortality as well as coming to terms with it in a Dreamworks animated movie. My expectations were shattered, it outperformed in every way. I also really like the continuation of the story with Kitty as well as the implementation of new characters, Pusses' past lives, his personality, and his ego.I love how the motives of the characters come out and how they on their own tell stories. And I especially love the fight scene with death, and how it affects Puss and Kitty, all in all, a highly recommended watch.",

Everything about this movie is perfect, from the wonderfully creative animation, to the well crafted story that genuinely almost made me cry. And of course the villains oh my god the villains. At first it appeared that the villains in this movie would be overcrowded, considering there are 3 of them, but each and every one of them was so expertly written and fun to watch. The movies score is something that just isn't talked about enough, with the music blending seemlesly with the animation and each song the soundtrack is an absolute banger (fearless hero and jack Horner's theme are some personal favourites).

The Antagonists were great, the villain was funny and disturbing at the same time. The film doesn't take itself too seriously and remembers it's supposed to be a kids movie. This movie was the first time I was genuinely felt scared and intimidated by an animated movie's antagonist. I feel like one antagonist in particular would scare the life out of small children, which happened in the theater I was in so don't take young children to see the movie it could make them too scared. The only bad thing about my experience in the theater was the guy snoring loudly in one of the rows behind me which made me really annoyed, make sure not to go to watch the movie only to fall asleep and snore.

There were a few funny moments but it was mostly slapstick rather than clever humour.The animation style was unusual. During normal scenes, Puss and the other characters looked their normal 3D selves, and the backgrounds had the impression of an oil painting. But during action scenes (and there were quite a few), the characters took on a more 2D, anime-like appearance. The frame rate dropped right down, reinforcing the anime look. I found the effect quite jarring and the \"flick book\" frame rate was quite distracting for me.My daughter enjoyed it, but it felt like the Puss franchise has probably run its course.

This movie manages to complete so many different character arcs in its just over 90 minute runtime it is genuinely spectacular. The three antagonists all work because they are all very different types of villains. And genuinely, Wolf is one of the best animated villains of all time. I cannot stress enough how absolutely terrifying he is in this movie. Some parents may think he is too scary for small children, I don't necessarily agree, but it can be argued. The animation looks amazing, you could pause almost anywhere and get a beautiful shot. Some people may be turned off that this movie is not going for the hyper-realism that other recent animated movies use. And during action scenes they actually lower the frames per second which may seem like an odd choice, but it makes the action far easier to follow and makes it more visceral. Of course, this being a kids movie, the story is very predictable, but the movie focuses far more on the journey that each character takes to get to their inevitable ending. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone, parents or not. If you haven't seen it already, do yourself a favor and watch this movie, you won't be disappointed.",

Simple, smart, exciting and moving, it's the perfect movie for all ages (and for all tastes but this is me being a fanboy). It plays very well with the ideas it establishes and involves all the characters, not depriving any of the remarkable and genuinely funny moments. I laughed like a kid, vibrated like an adult and cried like an old man. That's the power of a good movie.And the fantastic direction of Crawford, (totally inspired by Spider-Man in the Spider-Verse) contributes and in what way to the grandeur, excitement and beauty of the scenes. Not only that, but also for the dramatic moments, showing great maturity behind the wheel. I can't wait for the next project.Now, the cast, but that cast, stuffed with quality stars. Even so I ended up going for the dubbing and it was the best part of the movie without a doubt. Everyone's accents were fantastic, but the Alentejo totally stole the scene. It is rare to see a movie voiced by people with an accent (which is a shame), fortunately this film changed it and gave life to the film. It surpassed the simple dubbing they became part of the creative process. Certain Portuguese expressions have given a different taste and contribute a lot to a better and memorable experience.The editing is fantastic, the action is very well marked and the transitions are of another caliber: quite creative and visually fantastic. They provided really good moments thus helping to ward off the general conception that ''animated films are not cinema'' .Finally, the post-credit scene (it's more post-film, because fortunately it was before the credits), yes THAT scene. What a good time and that warmed me in an indescribable way. It is the return to childhood with the same or even greater joy with which I started this journey and I hope very much (REALLY HOPE) continue to enjoy it.

            "content": "I haven't seen an animated movie this impactful and truly moving in such a long time. However, from the moment I saw the trailers, and only got a snippet of the amazing action sequences, I just knew it would be something special.(Very Minor spoilers)First, I'll start off with the story and characters. Puss in boots has some of the best character development I've ever seen, and it was truly impactful. Kitty Softpaws' internal conflict is also integrated very well and leaves a nice message that isn't too in your face, but it was still crystal clear. Perrito was an amazing addition that not only made me laugh, but cry, frown in sadness, and feel warm inside. Perrito also taught me that it's great to stop and smell the flowers throughout life ;). The bear crime family was an amazing addition to the cast, and the message that they gave was so heartwarming, and they made me cry a few times too for sure. Jack Horner was a hilarious villain that brought some nice good vs evil conflict and levity to the film. Finally, Death gave me the chills every time I heard his whistle theme play throughout the sound system, and he was a truly harrowing villain that I couldn't get enough of. Truly terrifying. The story was executed fantastically as well. Nothing felt too rushed and everyone in the movie got enough screen time. The humor was hilarious, the touching scenes were tear inducing, and the action was butt-clenching. 10/10Now, the animation was something else. The way the frame rate of the movie shifted gave the action such a dramatic effect. Sometimes, I thought I could almost see a smear from for a millisecond and I found that to be such a cool effect. The camerawork was INSANE. As the characters flipped and fought, the camera would move a ton of different angles, making this not just a movie, but a whole experience. The stylization was beautiful too, I really like how more 3D movies are going a more \"2D\" stylization. The backgrounds looked so vibrant, and the characters really popped out as well, I have to say this is the best animation I have seen in a while.In conclusion, Puss in Boots really knocked my boots off this movie. I have no regrets spending my time and money on it, I wish I could give it more. This movie was made with so much love and care, and it shows.",

I loved the chilling introduction of death as his whistle sent chills down my spine. The movies portrayal of death as an antagonist makes death my favorite character in the dreamworks universe. I loved the animation quality in each of the fights. My favorite thing about the DreamWorks universe is the different takes on classic fairytale characters. The movie pacing was good as there was a never a dull moment in the movie. I was able to enjoy the movie even without watching the previous movies.",

It was received as more entertaining than the movie. The animation made it difficult and unpleasant to watch. The fight scenes were choppy . I actually turned away several times because visually the movie was stressful. The movie leaves the impression that the studio needed money and rushed production just to have a product. Or worse the studio supports lazy production now. I didn't see much advertising for Puss in Boots so I feel they knew it is a bad product. The hype of new animation and what I now expect as cooked reviews on another sight appears as spin to catch the dollars. I really want an apology.",

I appreciated how, despite being a kids movie (and I am very much not a kid), it did not treat the audience like they are dumb. Because we're not, and neither are kids! It was very refreshing.The spiderverse style inspired animation was VERY much appreciated. I hope dreamworks continues with it in the future, as I'm now invested.

It also has Goldi and the bears and this pie Kid guy, although they are sometimes funny, they are definitely not as good as death. I also LOVE the animation. It's the same as the animation in spiderman: into the spiderverse wich I also loved for its animation and especially the fight scenes with the wolf gave me goosebumps. The humor is also sometimes pretty funny although sometimes it's just basic kids humor, but I think that's a good thing, because it makes it enjoyable for even more peoples. But at some parts it's sooo dark that I would definitely rate it for 12+ years and not for 6+ years.

Goldi and the 3 bears were really nice aswell! The family dynamic they have is really nice and relatable. The sound design in this movie is great aswell! The heart beat in the movie making every scene with it feel more tense. No sounds in this movie felt like they didn't belong. The music in this movie aswell, god is the music in this movie great! Since I watched the movie I have found myself listening to the sound track a lot! Especially Fearless Hero and Big Jack Horner's theme! The one thing that's stopping this from being a 10/10 is some of the Goldi scenes.

Jerry and I took our seats, and as we reclined to view the king-tier saga of a film that is Puss and Boots, we rejoiced, cried, and laughed at such a work of art. As the pure joy that this movie radiated continued, I found it to be the single funniest thing I have ever seen in the entire year and dare I say my entire life as well. Jerry and I couldn't hold ourselves from letting the entire movie theater know that such a movie had brought back years of laughter and most of all love that I had previously been without in my drought of a marriage. As soon as we walked out of that theater, Jerry Bear started to release a masculine, dominating, and sigma male growl from deep inside his lungs\nHis rizz was just right. He was looking for some good porridge. My puss in boots was all out to lose another life. This bed is too hard. This angle is too soft. When we got into the right bed, we had to find a position that was just right. At first he was too soft, then he was too hard, then mmphh, he was just right\nBefore this, Jerry was the most boring, dry, and limp-dicked shell of a man I had ever encountered, but after this, he turned into an absolute joy and my marriage was completely and utterly restored, and thanks to Puss and Boots, every aspect of my life was completely resolved.

It has jokes all ages can enjoy, and the animation is visually stunning and beautiful, you can tell a lot of art work and visual design thought went into creating it. It keeps the cliche feel of a feel good animated movie while keeping you on the edge of your seat of what's to happen. The main villain also steals the show every shot he's in and keeps the suspense of the movie at an high and was beautifully written. Side not, appreciate and respect dreamworks to not pull a Disney and try to force small messages with political agendas into the film which inherently made the film feel so much more authentic and enjoyable.

Dreamworks had no business making a movie this good! The foundation of Death, the INTRODUCTION of Death, the appearance of Death, it made me feel the same fear that Puss must've faced; and as a member of the audience, that's what you want.

The only reason why it loses 1 star is I felt that there were too many antagonists.For me, Puss vs his ego and Death and relationship with Kitty is could have been the final fight. It would've been exciting for a final duel to the death between Puss and Death. Before that would be Team Friendship vs Goldi and the Bears, in which Goldi would realize she already has everything \"just right\". I felt Jack Horner unnecessary to the story, and the conflict between Kitty and Puss, while needing to work together to outwit Goldi and the Bears, then defeating Death, was more than sufficient for the story to hit the same note.Overall good family fun.

The wolf character made it darker sometimes and funny the other time. I think this sequel is better than all Shrek's franchise and the first movie.Big thanks to Mr Zoro and the cast.

This movie honestly made me want more, like I was begging and hoping Dreamworks would make at least one more installment of that franchise. Now, to get into more detail, I want to mention the villains in particular. One of them is actually dreary and makes you feel anxiety, ultimately making you sympathise with the main character. It is so well done and well written that I actually shivered multiple times throughout the movie. And this is A PUSS IN BOOTS MOVIE! A kids movie, if you wish. Astounding, absolutely blew my mind. I highly recommend it to everyone, kids and adults alike, its pleasing to watch, the morals are good, there are jokes for both kids and adults, its just... Perfect. Take my word for it and visit the theaters as soon as you can, so the studio will make more like this...",

My little ones also had to hold their fingers and cringe in pain when the \"Spanish splinter\" occurred, they felt that. Children's movies should avoid blood, cringe, and spook, in my opinion.

My God, THIS is how you do a sequel. Hell, this is even how you do a stand-alone film. I would argue that one doesn't even need to have seen the first \"Puss in Boots\" film to see this one. The only thing that really crosses over is Kitty, but even then she stands on her own pretty well.I just can't get over this movie. Dreamworks brought their A game and man does it show. Such a simple story in concept but it's good so masterfully that it feels fresh and new. It's also incredibly character driven, with our main players all being likable and charming in their own ways. Even our villain is a nice change of pace, almost poking fun at the trope of giving villains redeeming qualities. Nope, he's just genuinely a bad guy with no redeeming traits. Yet he's still likable and charismatic in his own unique way. The character dynamics in this film are just gorgeous. The familial relationship between the bears and Goldi, the slow but sure bonds that build and strengthen between Puss, Kitty, and Perrito, even the dynamic between Puss and the Wolf when they encounter each other are all so endearing and believable.Don't even get me started on the animation. My God, I'm in love with how this film looks. I'm so happy Dreamworks has been experimenting with their animation lately because it looks fantastic. The \"Spider-verse\" style lends itself so nicely to this film and the story it is trying to tell. I could prattle on forever about this film, so I might as well stop while I'm ahead.I cannot recommend this movie enough. I know GDT's \"Pinocchio\" will probably (and rightfully so) take the Oscar, but this is a close second and my pick for sure. I can't praise this film enough. 10/10 recommend to all. A beautiful, mature, and charming story and film that can appeal to anyone young or old.",

Why does the plot of a movie have to be unpredictable? Reading Hegel and other philosophical works can completely achieve a similar effect. This movie is completely funny, and the advancement of the story is logical and has a starting point. To be honest, it's been a long time since I encountered a movie plot that made me feel comfortable. Although everything was almost a rough idea at the beginning, this movie is really enjoyable. The character of the gray wolf Reaper gives people a sense of horror directly from the physical and psychological aspects. It is really scary, and the design of whistling is very old-fashioned, but the horror effect is simply the scariest I have ever seen whistling.",

I found myself invested in many of the characters' individual storylines. I loved Goldie and her family's storyline, Jack was a fun villain, my heart broke for Perrito, and oh my gosh I LOVED the wolf. One of the best villain characters I have seen in a long time. He was ACTUALLY scary and every time he was on screen, I felt some of the same fear Puss in Boots did. Such a cool villain.I think all of the voice actors did a great job, and I honestly didn't find Perrito super annoying, and he actually made me laugh a few times.TL;DR - go see this movie!

We watched the first puss in boots movie again before going to the theatre to refresh, which didn't help raise my hopes.However.I was sold as soon as the first song started playing, as soon as puss lifts his head for that introductory wink, as if knowing something my mom and i didn't. And every second after that, i was absolutely sold. The animation, the coloring, the choreo, the updated as well as new character designs, it's all absolutely gorgeous. I've seen that most of the criticism directed towards this movie have to deal with how \"it looks nothing like the original shrek franchise.\" ...why would you want it to? The first puss movie came out in 2011, and it feels absurd to me to keep a movie released over a decade later in the same visual box, but i digress. The overall visual style of this movie alone had my eyes glued.The characters. My god, they are all near-perfect. Remember that instagram ad? It included perrito, our favorite fearless canine protagonist, and seeing him there, i was 100% ready to hate him in the same kind of way i grew to hate olaf from frozen, like an overdone cutesy visual gag added purely to appease small children. Nope. His personality, design, story, themes and role, it astounded me just how much i absolutely loved him as a character. Seeing such a depth to kitty compared to her first movie debut? Amazing. Seeing goldi and the bears who at first appear seemingly as villains but turn out to be incredibly sympathetic and likeable? Loved every second they were on screen. Jack horner? Absolutely hilarious in every way shape and form and added such great contrast to all of the other characters as someone completely unsympathetic, yet still such a captivating character to watch. And i don't think there's Anything new to be said about death that hasn't already been said. His simple but menacing design, his voice, the little hints here and there to his \"true identity,\" and especially his motives, which are not directly villainous at all. He's hands down one of, if not The, best dreamworks villain to waltz out of the studio. And the fact that this movie has ALL of these characters, and a couple more on the side, and they ALL feel properly fleshed out while keeping my adoration through every single scene? Perfect. Huge bravo.And the themes. The plot itself. None of it feels convoluted or contrived, not even necessarily complex; there's a legend of a star in a scary forest that can grant one wish, and multiple parties want to reach said star to make said wish. That's all there is to it- until you apply all of those deep and vexing character motivations, then jam them all onto one long road they're sharing to win the race to it. All of them have a unique wish, all but one is a completely valid and sympathetic wish to make, and yet no one gets to make their wish, and all ends well. On paper it may sound clich\u00e9, but we are still dealing in the fairytale realm here. And it all fits in \"just right.\"the way the movie deals with death, mortality, the fear and panic of it, the emotional turmoil of learning to trust and to ask for help, to rely on others, to find positivity in darkness, it's all so masterfully done in a way that's digestible for young audiences and so very hard hitting for older ones. Seeing this movie multiple times, i found a new reason to tear up everytime i saw it because it was all just that Meaningful to me, even parts that don't feel they apply to me quite as strongly (such as goldi's plight to have a happy family and being content with a found one).I'm sure there's more i could say about this film but i've yammered on enough. Do yourself a favor and see it if you haven't already, or better yet, go see it again. Tell your friends, spread the word. This movie, and entire team behind it, deserve all the praise they can get their hands on for their amazing, gorgeous, passion-filled product.",

However, the script leaves a little to be desired, with some very truncated narratives, which does not mean that it is bad, just to say that the story was very mediocre in some aspects, but these aspects almost become imperceptible at such a large scale. Aesthetic beauty that the film provides. In short, it is a film with a charming aesthetic, which easily captures the viewer's attention even in the first minutes of the film, and holds it throughout the rest of it, in addition to guaranteeing some laughs, the comic tone is characteristic of DreamWorks films, however nothing exaggerated, here they hit the tone between the comic and the dramatic.

But to call him a villain is almost inaccurate because sure he fought puss and stuff like that. But in the end he only wanted puss to appreciate life more. And that shared feeling of terror you share with puss every time Death appears on screen. That fading of the audio and the whistle it's amazing to say the least.",

I guess The Bad Guys isn't that bad either and I'm kinda a Spider-Man purist so there were some parts that kind of bothered me in it (especially with aunt May). But that aside the humor and the story of this film, it shows that they cared and put in effort. The only nitpick I have is that they overdid it a bit with the \"just right\" with Goldie and there was probably a better way to have Puss do the big eyes than they did, it made it kinda cringey. But again those are only nitpicks and not enough of a reason to not give it a 10/10.",

I don't mean out-right expose them to the cruelty of reality, I mean stop pretending bad things in life don't happen. It only makes life worse for them.When I was a kid, I was scared of death. I constantly thought about it. I constantly worried about when it'll happen to me or someone I love. I constantly kept shutting myself in my house where it was safe.No one taught me what it was. No one taught me what it truly meant. And because of being shielded my entire life, no one taught me how to cope with it.How am I now?The exact same, but worse. I haven't gone months of not thinking about it at least once a day. I'm still worrying, I'm still scared, but now that fear leads me to rash decisions. And I'm still sitting alone for days and days. But now, it's not just fear. It's anger. It's confusion. It's hopelessness. Now, I feel like no matter what I do, or how hard I try, my efforts will be useless in the end.This movie felt like a breath of fresh air. It felt like I actually wasn't alone. It felt like...for once in my life, it was okay for me to be sad. It was okay to be scared.It's your kid so it's your decision, but please, don't let them end up like me. Help and prepare them, please.Also, P. S,\nKids are smart enough to understand or at least slightly grasp complex morals or concepts. This generation is opening their eyes more. My parents missed every single moral and couldn't understand why characters did what they did or said what they said. Life is getting more complicated mentally, and we need to prepare the new generations who will have to live in that mess.",

It is a sequence so haunting that it had me questioning if i was even watching a kids movie. The bone chilling whistle that precludes his appearance combined with stunning animation and a great vocal performance left my heart racing and a genuine feeling of fear coursing through my blood, which is more than i can say for most horror films. Puss in boots goes from an indomitable living legend, to a petrified and cornered animal in a matter of seconds at the hands of death. His fur stands on end as he stares at his bloodied paw, and his life flashes before his eyes. The fear and panic in the face of this unstoppable force of nature is only natural. Easily one of the top villains in the past few years of cinema, animated or not. It would be a shame to this amazing movie flop in our modern sea of soulless cashgrabs and mediocrity for the sake of marketing, so get down to your local theater and support this genuine work of art.",

For once, I understand the difference between an evil villain and a villain. You have characters to root against, and characters to outright fear.

The characters are super well-written and comedic in a way that's more natural and the humor doesn't overpower the story. Dreamworks did a phenomenal job on designing Death's character seeing that he's trending on social media. The movie teaches a great lesson on mortality and the value of life.

The animation was refreshing and engaging.More importantly, the characters in this were well thought out, with personal stories and struggles that all of us can relate to, resulting in an often highly emotional watching experience.

The animation, storyline and comedy was perfect.Beautiful scene shifting and the comic style (similar to the spider-man films) was amazingly projected.Had me laughing out loud and up there with the first 2 Shrek films (we don't talk about 3 & 4...)\nWaaay better than the first Puss In Boots film. I went to go see it last night and I will be going to see it again it was that good!Wholesome and an absolute masterpiece! <3.",

            "content": "Hard to believe this is a part of the shrek franchise.Puss in buts: the last wish accomplishes things that few children's movies even dare to dream of in our time. With it's well-directed and charming opening sequence it immediately brings us back to the same feeling of the last movie, wich was released over a decade ago, but makes us feel like we had watched it only yesterday.The movie's first subversion to it's predecessor lies in the meeting with our main antagonist that comes right after the opening sequence.Our new main antagonist is nothing you can find in other children's movies, he is pure evil, he's brutal, he's menacing and he's enjoying every second of it.The rest of our antagonist, who are more family-friendly, are also handled quite well.Goldilocks and the three bears are villains you can and will eventually relate to and root for.And \"big\" Jack Horner is a villain that we love to hate, he's an evil manager with funny lines and he gets beaten at the end.The film uses its new antagonists and familiar protagonists well, every scene where they all interact with each other is well written and beautifully animated and directed.The action scenes are out of this world, the use of color and the \"into the spider-versey\" animation create magnificent arenas for our characters and every frame is a work of art.The character of puss in boots himself is much more relatable this time. It is uncommon for a protagonist to admit his fears, especially in a movie meant for children, but his journey and eventual acceptance of death as a part of life is a bold and wonderful lesson.This movie reminds me why I love cinema, and how to enjoy it. Puss in boots: the last wish made me both laugh and be on the edge of my sit, it better get the recognition it deserves.Because honestly, a sequel of a spinoff to the shrek franchise has no logical reason to be this ****ing RAW.",

The Last Wish is easily the best animated film of 2022, a great return to the beloved Shrek franchise, and a theme that actually makes the viewer emotional. Without diving into spoilers, the antagonist is a genuine threat, and his looming presence instills a feeling of dread. The movie is so colorful and vibrant too- it never feels boring to look at. This is exactly what animation should be. You never want to take your eyes off the screen, and the spectacle couldn't be achieved in live action. If I could, I'd give this movie 9.5 stars because there were some parts I felt weren't perfect, but I have no problem rounding up for this review. Easily recommend this film for anyone.",

His magic weapons arsenal is pretty good usage of shown by Shrek films world where all fairytales lives together.Death himself is just amazing. First scene with him shows his potential perfectly. While watching i couldn't wait to see him again and when he does, i was scared about what is going to happen, what puss is going to do?Goldilocks and bears are pretty charming and they aren't that antagonistic as Jack Horner (Death himself isn't hunting but for puss so im not comparing him).

Probably, this new style will become more popular in new animations, imitating Spider-Man. The combination of adult elements and jokes between the colorful childlike world of the animation is well done. Fight scene are busy and breathtaking, and the fight scenes are very action-packed and similar to anime's. Perhaps the message of the story is more understandable by adults than children. I personally enjoyed the character of death. His presence with music and dark moments made gave me goose bumps everytime. He was one of the best animation villains who had a small presence. However, the story may have taken a repetitive path and adventure, but I think it has done it's mission correctly and is worth watching for one and a half hours. Perhaps only a few questions remain unanswered but I shouldn't expect too high of an animation that os aimed for kids.And I won't expect much from my first review and bad Grammer.",

But that doesn't happen! Everything is neatly done and all the story arcs have great endings by the end of the movie. They managed to give every character a change to shine, without giving up any of the fun gags and shenanigans.The choice of dropping the framerate during action scenes is a master's trick in my opinion, the flow of the characters makes these shots very unique and differentiate them from the rest of the movie.The themes were well thought out and come together at the end of the movie, the payoff is worth the incredible journey.Will definitely rewatch this before it leaves theaters.",

This may sound insane but the sequel to a bad spin off of Shrek is a masterpiece in so many ways. The biggest surprise I've had in years. Firstly, this movie balances three villains perfectly, (technically six but anyway.) I won't talk about them much but the best character is the wolf by an extremely long shot. All, and yes I do mean all, of the characters are so entertaining.I can easily say this should win best picture or at least be nominated for best animated picture. Another thing to mention is that the trailer in my opinion should not be watched to get an idea of the film except the animation. Oh the animation. It is probably the best looking thing in the Dreamworks catalogue. They also use it in some of the greatest ways especially with the wolf villain.Not to mention the fight sequences. Those both use animation to its fullest potential and are incredibly well choreographed. Please watch it. Dreamworks both needs it and deserves it for this amazing amazing film .",

I thought it was alright, but because I watched it as a kid, it stuck with me.When I saw the news about a new Puss in Boots getting a sequel, I was so excited. Years pass by as I was waiting to get more news about it, but it's finally here!Like most people who have reviewed this movie, my expectations were blown away!The Music was superb! The Art and Animation screamed personality and passion! And let's not forget about the story and it's characters! Everything about it screams fun! But then I was surprised by the dark twist this story went for.It didn't even bother me, if anything, I was intrigued.In this movie, the legendary Puss in Boots is stripped away from his confidence as he literally faces death. All he has is a single life. He's lost the other eight, being completely careless of his past lives.We have Kitty Softpaws, a character who was in the previous movie (Don't even need to watch the first movie to see the relationship between Puss and Kitty) and Perrito, a new character who is just as important as the other two.Just wanted to say that the very last part of the movie had my heart pounding as I'm watching Puss fight Death (He's literally a character). Seeing Puss fight for his life made me smile, because it really felt like Puss has changed for the better. I felt so genuinely happy that I almost shed a tear.I don't want to go over everything because one, too lazy, and two, you really should go see the movie for yourself and experience all of what this movie has to offer! (That's if you haven't seen it yet) Because it's criminal that this movie still isn't getting the attention it truly deserves.I went to go see this movie six times in the theater.Just thought I'd show my support to Dreamworks...01/21/23.",

The movie shows a more mature take on a shrek character so hopefully they do the same for Shrek himself. The movie has some flaws without a daubt, but the good parts heavily overshadowed them. Death is an actually scary villain for once in animated films from past years and i love it so much. Death as a villain is perfect, materializing a fear many of us have allows the character of Puss in boots to become more relatable, especially with the anxiety attack scene, it captures what it feels like and how our little friends can help us through out it.Love it.",

The Story is very simple and yet incredibly effective the way the Wishing Star ties in the three main groups of characters and what each want from it is done incredibly and how at the end each character gets their wish (except one) without the wishing star and whilst that might seem like a very generic plot the characters, animation, themes all make seem so fresh and new, and that brings me to my next point the animation is incredibly stunning and beautiful it feels like a fresh take in animation and it reminds me of when animation company's pushed the boundaries and made such creative and expressive art which feels so rare these days, the perfect mix of the 2D and 3D animation is seamless and the drops in frames in certain scenes, the small details in scenes, and how colorful and distinct every scene is it just makes the viewing experience and spectacle incredible. Now for me the strongest part of this movie were it's characters which is surprising to me because in a movie with nearly 10 main characters it perfectly juggles them with enough development and screen time that makes you care about each and everyone of them even Perrito who many thought would be an annoying gag character is used so well throughout the movie and his scene where he helps Puss through his panic attack like a real life therapy dog is so emotional and well done, now this brings me to the strongest part of the movie it's villains now of course everyone already knows about Death so I won't talk to much about him, but he is now objectively one of the greatest Dreamwork's villains ever created alongside Lord Shen, Lord Farquaad, and even the Fairy Godmother the way the tone of a scene changes when he enters is so dramatic and perfectly executed his motives make complete sense and the final confrontation where he excepts that Puss has changed and he won't try two kill him anymore is so well done and fits perfectly with his character, and also there is Big Jack Horner who is in my opinion one of the funniest characters in the movie his dynamic with Jiminy Cricket is hilarious and also how he is pretty much evil incarnate for no reason is just funny and I really liked that they did that because for the past decade we have had sympathetic villains who we are meant to feel bad for and Disney twist villains who feel like a cheap way of trying to subvert the audience so just having a character be evil for the sake of being evil is just hilarious to me and also his death where instead of some moment of sorrow or regret for his actions he simply accepts that he was a horrible human being. Overall this movie was near perfection my only gripe is that I feel Puss's initial retirement from his heroic life early in the film could have been more fleshed out but other than that this movie checked every box for a timeless classic and it also proved that Dreamwork's can still make incredible, mature, funny, and creative movies.",

I didnt like this new animationstyle, it is comicbooklike and too colourful. My opinion about this movie is that too much was happening at the same time, it was like they tried to show as much as possible in as little time as possible. They tried to make everything funny, but it didnt work for me most of the time, this made it really cringe.The storyline was also cliche and therefore predictable. When you are a fan of romantic, artsy animation movies, this one is definitely not worth your time and money.",

A great sequel. For my extended review I will speak on aspects of the movie so if you do not want to be spoiled please do not read. First I would like to talk about Puss and his growth as a character. I absolutely love the way Puss goes from a prideful, arrogant, and irresponsible cat to something more mature and less reckless.  He learns that he is not indestructible and that he feels fear. Through this realization Puss does not run away from his problems anymore and decides to instead go head first into his biggest fear. Death. Which leads me to my second aspect of the film, the antagonist. In the movie there is a bundle of side antagonist who actually have a purpose and fit the story well. Each with their own motives and the writers did a great job explaining what they were after and why in such a short time. The lead antagonist Death was by far the best aspect of not only the film but also the development of Puss. He shows that Puss is both vulnerable and scared which leads him to face his fears and fight Death head on. Such a great antagonist to a great film. I would suggest leaving the franchise as it is and to not make a third movie so that they can't potentially ruin everything the second movie brought to the table. A must see movie.",

Even the camera direction and angles used, alongside the editing is something that seriously lends to the viewing experience.\n\nWith unique character designs and bold, oversaturated use of colours, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, is a film that isn't afraid to lean into its painterly and cartoonish roots to help convey mood and emotion within scenes, in a way that does not in any way retract from the experience. It, alternatively, lifts the viewing experience up immensely with the way in which it is done. \n\nIt's a film that evokes unexpected emotion from the viewer, with scenes that tackle real life issues such as mental health struggles and even the concept of mortality and existential dread, with a realistic and raw approach, in a fashion typically not explored or portrayed in these styles of movie, at-least not with the level of care and tone-appropriate humour the film manages to utilise without denoting the character struggles.\n\nThis film also uses an interesting story telling mechanic, employed by having several characters within it that one could consider the \u2018true antagonist' of the film depending on either the viewers perspective, or the time within the story as it progresses. The villains in this movie are all very three dimensional, and the level of foreshadowing that comes alongside that, is simply astounding. \n\nAll in all, a film definitely worth a watch, and then another, to catch all of the details you might have missed the first time, thanks to that pesky yet effective foreshadowing.",

The animation style is stellar, vibrant and the character art is crisp and flourishing to see with the vfx effects. \n\nIn a more in depth dive into the films pacing, at first the Giant being set up as the 'villain' but immediately losing to Puss set up an interesting perspective of 'who is the villain'. Whilst many would argue death is the main antagonist, he also equally isn't in a sense that his existence sets up Puss's own character development, death isn't evil he is instead a major factor in a characters growth. \n\nOverall the film takes you along the ride of seeing Puss not only as a character grow but also face his own fears as well as establish a bond with others as well.",

Soon after, his journey begins one again as he finds out the mystical Magic Wishing Star exists, with the ability to grant his one wish \u2013 the wish to reclaim his nine lives of course. \n\nThis, however, is not an easy mission as other well-known fairy tale characters with a twist also battle for the wish. Overall, the epic quest is filled with hilarious, hearty and fearful moments, with an incredibly fleshed out storyline jam-packed with emotion and meaning. The film successfully explores themes of friendship, courage, love and ultimately the beauty that one life has to offer.\nIt is perfectly paced, with the main characters having sufficient and meaningful screen time, as well as an incredible dynamic with each other, and each scene having an importance and relevance. The animation is phenomenal and visually striking, and the action scenes are fast paced, smoothly transitioned, and spread out to keep the film intriguing.

It has wild half anime visual style, crazy action scenes, fairy tale craziness (although that shtick has dropped off since the original Shrek).  The humor is not wall to wall, but organic, and almost always lands.  But more importantly, it has more mature themes of coming to grips with mortality and life priorities.

Not the best movie, The Prince of Egypt and A Beautiful Day in The Neighborhood are the best movies I've seen, but Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is a must-watch. Even as someone who didn't like the first movie, I think this movie soars in every aspect. Puss, Kitty, and Perrito are a great cast of main characters, each of which feel grounded and entertaining at the same time. This movie having 3 villains could have made it feel overstuffed and like it was doing too much, but no one villain takes time from the others and they're all so well written. Jack Horner is a refreshing villain, he is completely irredeemable and evil, something that Disney should do more with its villains if they ever decide to have an actual villain again. Goldilocks and the 3 bears are incredibly sympathetic, well written characters, they're some of my favorites. Wolf was so threatening, generating chills any time he was onscreen. The animation of this movie is so stylized and gorgeous and puts what the first Puss in Boots did to shame. The music is great, \"Fearless Hero\" is one of my favorite songs from a movie, there's a reason everyone remembers this song after seeing this movie. I could go on and on, but you get the point. Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is an uncontested masterpiece, by far my favorite Dreamworks movie",

            "content": "(SPOILER WARNING) (TLDR AT THE BOTTOM)\n\nThis is what animated kids movies should be like. Behind all of the bright colours of the gorgeous animation, making all of the action scenes an absolute spectacle to feast your eyes onto, is a simple plot with an absolutely massive impact. \n\nThe story is light hearted enough so kids can get enjoyment out of it, but it also treats its audience with maturity, not playing safe and having the \u2018bravery' to insert extremely deep messages. One of which is the over-arching theme of mortality and how we need to appreciate what we have.\n\nThis theme is represented beautifully through its characters. The protagonist puss in boots learns how he has taken his lives for granted. He learns this through the other characters such as Perrito. \n\nAt first glance he seems like the clich\u00e9 annoying side character for comic relief, but turns out being a warm, friendly and extremely likeable little chap. The fact that he does not have a wish, along with some other character traits, shows us and puss how he is content with the life he has, and only looks forward to his simple dreams, letting the rest develop along the way. His dream is to become a therapy dog, which is an important detail to note further into the film. \n\nOf course I cannot review this movie without mentioning Death, one of the best animated villains I have seen in a while. He shows puss his hatred towards him for taking his lives for granted, and enjoys inflicting fear into other people. In his introduction scene he is extremely close to taking puss' final life, coming as close to a scar on his forehead, with one drop of blood slowly creeping down to his shocked face. (Another example of this film's maturity) in this scene we see puss experience true fear for the first time in his life, as he is petrified of dying right there, right then. This is the moment he comes to realise how much he has taken for granted, and it was all at the fault of this menacing wolf character.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there, he constantly torments puss, showing up throughout random parts of the film, in which every appearance, send massive chills down puss' and my spine, with his truly uncanny whistle. \n\nOne of these appearances leads to what is in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in the film. Puss begins to run away in a state of absolute to panic before coming to a stop. We see that he is struggling to breathe, and his vision is blurry. Perrito is the only one there, and without any dialogue, Perrito simply rests his head on puss' chest, and in a slow decent into calmness, puss regains his control. Perrito has completed his dream of being a therapy dog. The shear realism of this scene, along with the mature dealing of the situation is what makes this scene, and this film in general truly one of a kind. \n\nTo finalise, we also have many other great characters, most notably, Goldi the three bears, the redeemable villains who learn to appreciate their family, and Big Jack Horner, the pure evil villain who does not appreciate what he has at all, to which he learns to consequences. Overall he is an extremely funny character with a \u2018charming evil' to him. All of these characters are balanced out perfectly through the films perfect pacing. Nothing seems to drag on at all.\n\nTLDR:\nThis movie is an incredible creation. All the characters are amazing in their respected ways, the animation is a true spectacle of passion and creativity, and the plot is simple, but truly impactful with the balance of light hearted humour and the downright mature themes. \n\nPersonal experience:\nI have never felt so much towards a film before, the mature themes especially hit hard and really made me look over how I spend my one life. I would honestly not recommend this film to really young audiences, because this film is best experienced when you truly understand the mature tones and messages. I absolutely adored this film, and I hope you did as well.\n\nP.S. this is my first proper review of a film, so sorry if some parts are a bit confusing, and the pacing on this is no where near as good as the films lol. There's so much to say but I don't want this to be too long. But still if you made it this far, even if skipping to the TLDR, thanks for reading, hope i expressed my opinions well enough.",

It's a film that anyone can enjoy. I don't think I really have any real big problems with this film because the animation is super vibrant the characters are lively, even the villains, Jack and death are some of the best, animated villains or even just villains in general that I have seen in a long time there's a big complaint about this movie being too crowded but I think it's just fine. The first half really makes it feel like a Puss in boots film but by the end, it really flashes out all the other characters in Waze I didn't expect, and I love this film for doing that. I really don't know how Shrek five would top this but if it does, then respect because this film was incredible I don't think it's as good as Shrek two, but it is darn close also, I watch this film with my friend after I watch this film you'll never guess what I watched after I watch this film again for a second time it's that good 9/10",

The animation is amazing and Goldilocks and the three bears were a funny, and an emotional group with great character arcs. Perrito is a great character with funny jokes and a kind and adorable personality, and his sad backstor\n Iv'e watched this movie 3 times and on my second viewing iv'e noticed that one of the locations in the map when perrito holds it is called the river of relaxation which is where his owners nearly drowned him. Trust, anxiety, fear and emotion is handled so well and there's a lot of things for adults to enjoy. Death is an extremely dark villain and there is some bleeped swearing but that makes this movie the best. This movie took risks and after being stuck in hell for years. Hollywood doesn't respect animation. They think of it as something that is only meant for kids, but movies like this, and many other DreamWorks movies like Shrek, how to train your dragon, Kung fu panda, and Wallace and Gromit the curse of the were rabbit.

It takes a character you've probably never heard of despite being a real poetry character \"Little Jack horner\" and turns him into a heartless villain with no tragic backstory, just straight up evil, and it makes his character really funny, while still having other villains that have motives like goldilocks, who wants to have a real family, and death who wants to take puss's life because he doesn't appreciate it.

Puss in Boots: The Last Wish goes surprisingly deep into its main character giving a multi-layered personality and a very satisfying character development. The whole cast is particularly efficient to hook you up in their adventure, protagonists and antagonists all shine in their way and give you new favorites in the Shrek Universe. \nThings go fast here since the main goal is to entertain Puss in Boots don't take too much time in event that would usually ask for a little more development. It's notable but not necessarily a bad thing since the characters really help to smooth things with how they command the pacing.\nThe Last Wish is unexpectedly violent with literal deaths in it, a few drops of bloods, and one of the character is scary. Not a bad point actually, I found it pretty great that they dared to push a little the boundaries of family entertainment.",

They did a wonderful job telling the story. Even the parts I initially thought would be annoying were great. It was perfectly balanced and had such good messages throughout. \n\nThis movie reminds you to appreciate life and what you have, to live in the moment, to make the most of the time you have, to not let fear control you but that it is ok to be afraid sometimes you just need to work to overcome it. It supports strong family connections, whether that family is biological or not. The antagonists/villains are superb.  It's really funny but still gives the emotional moments time to breath. And this is from a sequel movie to a spinoff about a swashbuckling cat. \n\nSo many movies are the equivalent of junk food and we just keep accepting it and getting more of the same.\n\nMovies like this need to be praised and supported. It's the only way to send a message that we are tired of the constant junk thrown at us.\n\nEnormous thanks to everyone involved with the creation of this gem.",

Over all it was one of the best kids movies and our son ranked it in his top 3 of all time.  My wife ranked it as one of her favoritesmaybe her best of all time.

            "content": "beg for mercy from puss! in boots!\n\nthe concept for this film is simple, puss has run out of his nine lives and can only get them back with the means of a wishing star which is in pretty high demand among the bad guys of the shrek cinematic universe. the competition is Goldilocks and the Three Bears and Little Jack Horner who is not so little anymore along with a certain someone who is behind puss for a very specific reason.\n\nthe execution of this concept is what makes this film such a treat. the screenplay is straightforward and fast-paced, drags somewhat in the second act but manages itself by the end. the music is perfect for the aesthetic (chef's kiss to be more accurate). the voice acting is muy buena (very good). Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Florence Pugh, Harvey Guill\u00e9n, John Mulaney, Wagner Moura they're all just fantastic. I was genuinely invested in the characters and not solely on nostalgia. not that this film does a few callbacks but those aren't some cheap fan-services but something that add a little substance to the greater story.\n\nnow, the animation and the cinematography. ughhhh, it's so freaking beautiful !!! spiderverse swung in style so puss in boots could land perfecttly on it's feet. there is clearly inspiration for the animation here but instead of some cheap rip-off, it really feels like an artistic choice and comes off as an artist's fairytale come to life here. the movie literally starts with the words \"this is a fairytale...\" and lives up to it! the cinematography too is something to look out for. this film haz better shots than I can spot in a big budget Hollywood blockbuster these days. DreamWorks atleast never fails in that department and always manages to exceed expectations!\n\nto be honest, I wasn't really expecting anything from this film because the shrek cinematic universe has been near-dead for so long, but this film gives me hope. this film gives me something to put my faith in. you'd think that years of development hell would usually mean bad for a film but not for PUSS!... IN BOOTS!\n\njust go and have a good time with this. and if you haven't yet seen the trailer for the film, don't do it. just go into the film blindly like I did. It will surely give you a few surprises! in my opinion, this is the best film in the Shrek Cinematic Universe since Shrek 2, which isn't saying a lot, but it should since Shrek: Forever After was the only good film after Shrek 2.\n\nP.S.: the new DreamWorks intro is so good. I just love it!",

When he come on screen and the whistling just gave me chills it was perfect, its was like i were being hunted by the one and only death like i can feel the fear he carries. Great project for a kids movie, it add a lot of story to puss like the way he revealed his true colors at the end of the movie and the friendships he have along with the adventures he have, showing that puss is a huge character in the Shrek universe even one of the strongest he last against death in a battle. I really like how they end the movie, SPOILERS they way death gave him a chance at life because he showed who he really is and hes not that overconfident guy who think he can work alone, he shows that he have heart. Death was no longer searching for that same guy anymore he saw his true self i love that, instead of just making it where they made death surrender or die OR show that hes weak. The moral of the story and the text make a lot of sense and was inspiring truly an experience.\n\nThe villain in this movie is really scary and the whistling sound that he make gave me chills. I could feel the fear that he carry, like I was being hunted by Death himself. This movie is a great project for kids because it add a lot of story to Puss in Boots' character. We see him reveal his true colors at the end of the movie, and the friendships he have along with the adventures he go on. This show that Puss is a huge character in the Shrek universe and even one of the strongest because he last against Death in a battle.\n\nI really like how the movie end. SPOILERS Death gave Puss a chance at life because he showed who he really is and he's not just an overconfident guy who think he can work alone. He show that he have heart. Death was no longer searching for that same guy anymore because he saw Puss's true self. I love that the movie didn't just make Death surrender or die, or show that he's weak. The moral of the story and the text make a lot of sense and was truly inspiring. The movie is a great reminder that it's important to show our true selves and that we can all change for the better.\n\nIn conclusion, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a great movie that you should definitely watch. The story is engaging, the characters are interesting, and the villain is truly scary. The movie add a lot of depth to Puss in Boots' character, showing that he's a strong and complex character in the Shrek universe. The movie's ending is satisfying and inspiring, reminding us of the importance of being true to ourselves. If you're a fan of Shrek or just looking for a great family movie, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is definitely worth a watch.",

It doesn't harp on at the audience; it doesn't lecture, and it doesn't reiterate the typical \"environment good, white men bad\" rhetoric that Disney has been repeating since they turned awful. Puss carries a genuinely essential and universal message about making the most of your life, overcoming hardships and bad luck and coming out all the stronger for it with an appreciation for what you have. It may be hard for modern audiences to relate to putting others' needs before your own instant selfish gratification, but it's nice that that's also a theme.\n\nIt's fantastic, and I would love to see more studios returning to a more wholesome and honest approach to making movies.

            "content": "I watched the movie for the first time a little under two months ago and can I just say, I was in awe. I was in Florida, visiting my grandparents for vacation and it was one of the first things I wanted to do with my grandma while there. I had heard a lot of praise for the movie from my friends (age range 14-20) and since I'm an enjoyer of animation in the first place, I went to go see it. Now, I will say I went into this with little background of how the first movie went - I had watched it once, and that was several years prior. Good thing about The Last Wish, though - you don't need too much background information, so to an extent it can work as a standalone movie if you really want it to be. Going into the actual movie, WOW! The animation was absolutely stunning. They definitely took a lot of inspiration from Into The Spiderverse regarding the animation, mixing the 2D and 3D together. I've seen several reviews saying that made it \"hard to watch\" or \"look cheap\", but it was quite the opposite, quite dynamic! It was also very colorful and very detailed, but not too much so - \"just right\", as Goldilocks would say. Speaking of Goldilocks: regarding the characters, I think they were also very well done. It's easy to root for Puss, he's not one of those protagonists that you get bored and annoyed with, especially with Kitty and Perrito supporting him in his leading role. The villains of the movie were also very well done: Death (the wolf) was quite ominous and accurately embodied Death, \"straight up\". Goldilocks was a flawed character rather than an actual evil one, and it was nice that her story and wish was resolved at the end in a sweet way, though I will say if I have any critiques at all you could see that from a mile away. Jack Horner, though being the most unapologetically evil character, is also one of the funniest and most memorable of all. Killer design, funny lines, John Mulaney did such a great job voicing him. In fact, all of the voice actors and actresses were flawless - they fit their characters and fit the tones perfectly. \nA lot of reviews against this movie say it's too dark, but I think that's what makes this movie so beautiful. Yes, one of the main topics is mortality, and if that's not something you are ready to talk about with your child - assuming that's who you're going to bring to the movie - then do not bring them. However, if you want them to be able to discuss and see the topic of mortality in a healthy, safe way, this is definitely the movie for you. A lot of media these days struggles in how to discuss death. I think The Last Wish definitely illustrates how ominous and scary the topic of death may be, with its personification of death (the wolf character). At the same time, Puss is able to tackle his fear of death in the end. \nAll things considered, this movie absolutely knocked it out of the park. There is so much to enjoy out of this movie, from humor, fun characters, sweet moments, dynamic fight scenes (which do NOT take up the whole movie, by the way!), absolutely GORGEOUS animation, and a killer soundtrack that doesn't get enough credit...and of course, the fact that there is a lot to think about after watching it. \nI highly recommend this movie. Treat yourself and/or your loved ones and go watch it.",

The side characters are very entertaining and give the audience some strong emotional scenes as well as lots of laughs. Death's character design was beautiful and he is one of the coolest animated villains ever. Jack Horner was hilarious! The way he disregards human life and is irredeemably evil is so refreshing and something I haven't seen a lot of since old Disney. DreamWorks really put their heart and soul into this film and made it one of the best animated movies in recent memory. Would recommend and is definitely worth your time.

Great storytelling, great villains, excellent character journeys and a kid's film that has more profound and more mature themes that even 12A and 15 films lack. While I admit the Wolf may be slightly too scary for the age range it appeals to in its more vibrant child-like audience, I think it fits into a wider family film that has its laughs for the kids while not being afraid to make an emotional effect on the grown-ups. Kids and grown-ups love this film alike, just what a FAMILY film should do. Family films are now more kid's films that grown-ups watch out of necessity, but Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is hopefully the start of animation going back to being a family occasion and not just a kids-only appeal. Dreamworks could be onto the renaissance of animation, and if the same team is working on Shrek 5, I am definitely on board.",

            "content": "This is the first time where I have seen the audience scores aligned with the critic scores. Normally, I would say critic scores are trying to be cooperate-friendly and be as nice as possible to the movie(the exact opposite of what a critic is ironically), but I have to say, the critic and audience score is very justified. I may or may not update this post, because I have only seen this movie once.\n\nSo right now, I am going to be upfront, and write my critiques out of the way so I can talk about the good stuff after.\n\nSo, I don't know if it's the effects of my sensory issues and loud movie theater speakers clashing, but it induced a bit of anxiety in me. It could've just be the first few minutes kind of rushing through along with other effects, or it was just loud speakers and my sensitive ears colliding. I really don't know, I would have to rewatch so other time to see. The first few minutes are kind of just a fuzzy memory to me.\n\nI also don't know why they didn't just address the problem between Puss and Soft-paws earlier in the movie. There isn't necessarily anything bad about it, but I feel it would've been better addressed earlier.\n\nThat's really my only concerns, not even a problem really.\n\nI think that all the villians are all pretty solid for there being multiple villains. You know what. Scratch that. They aren't just solid villains. They are all really good villains. Plain an simple. \n\nJack Horner isn't trying to be relatable at all. He doesn't have some sad back story that tries to get you to sympathize with him. He is just pure evil. He believes only he should be entitled to his power, doesn't give a damn about anyone else, and would do anything to get what he want, even if it means needlessly putting others lives at risk, even those who dedicate there services to him. It is a bit more refreshing to see that we aren't being guilt tripped through a story, and we are being shown that evil isn't made because of bad things. It can just be made in anyone, regardless. Plain and simple. \n\nHe also isn't 2 dimensional either. He might not have a conscious telling him what right and wrong is, but you are shown he has a reason for doing it, even if you don't understand his ideologies or reasonings. It is showcased in ways that you understand what he is doing and why. He knows that once he gets his hands on the power, no one will be able to stop him anyway, and he is confident he can get it.\n\nOhhh\u2026 and death. Death is just amazing to watch on screen. He literally gave me the chills anytime he was on screen, and I love it. That's how you right a villain. When his presence on screen is so intense, that you get chills just seeing him. He is just a badass. Through and through. Nothing else. And I don't mean it metaphorically or rhetorically or poetically or theoretically or any other fancy way. He is a total badass. Straight. Up.\n\nHe has so many memorable quotes, I just can't help but reference them as I am writing this review! He is genuinely that fun and memorable as a villain!!! \n\nHe also has a motive that isn't just clear like Jack Horners, but you understand why. And you don't just understand why, his motives are almost justified. You almost root for him at times.\n\nNot to mention Puss in Boots arc where he goes from arrogant ass who doesn't truly value his lives until he realizes he doesn't have any to lose, to one who would like to spend his life wisely and happily, realizing what life is.\n\nEveryone going after the wish has a reason to go after the wish, and then they realize they had what they wished for, and it's just so good. It shows that you could learn to look at what you have and not take it for granted.\n\nI could go on for hours and hours why this movie was such a good movie. But I bet you probably came here for a shorter review just to see if this movie. You didn't come for a whole essay. So I am going to cut it short here and save everyone including myself time. This movie is going to be one of the highest ratings I may ever give to a movie. It's that good. Watch it as soon as possible.",

Puss in Boots: The Last Wish takes what made the character enticing to begin with and elevates him, while also giving him a worthwhile journey full of emotion, fear, and comedy. The rest of the movie around Puss is equally entertaining. Salma Hayek is the perfect match for Kitty Softpaws who herself is elevated and doesn't feel forced. John Mulaney as Big Jack Horner may not be the top villain of the film but provides a loose and silly portrayal. Oh and who's the best villain in the film? Discover it for yourself but it's worth watching just for that. I'll just say, it's a thing of beauty.",

This movie was one of the last movies that I thought was going to be really good but I'm very happy that it went above and beyond what I thought it was going to be. The story is pretty cliche and generic yes but it's everything around the story that makes this film so good. The animation is incredibly. The Spider-Verse style works very well for this film and it still stands out from Spider-Verse in its own unique way. The characters and their own respective arcs are great. There really isn't one weak character here. Puss himself gets some excellent development and his journey of grabbing with the concept of death is very emotional and well written. Kitty Softpaws also has a really good arc and chemistry with Puss and Perrito has some really great moments. All of the villains here are great. Goldilocks and the 3 bears all have a good arc and Jack Horner is one of the funniest characters ever included in an animated film and works amazingly well as the irredeemable villain but the real standout here is Death. Death is probably one of if not the best Dreamworks villain. To have Death be personified and built up the way it is in the film is just something else. His interactions with Puss were always amazing. The humor was great as well. Pretty much every joke from Jack landed and all the other jokes were really great as well.

I'm still getting over how amazing the wolf looked, absolutely horrifying but so fun to watch. The direction was one of the best I've seen in any animated movie, with stunning shots that I'm shocked other films haven't used. The worldbuilding was so compelling, with elements of fantasy and adventure so interesting and thought-provoking, and ideas so brilliant I've truly never seen anything like it. The voice acting was perfect, casting celebrities that are actually good at voice acting, and actors I've never seen before that still were great. The characters were set up so well, with emotional sequences and character building that was heartfelt and realistic, despite the movie being about talking animals and fictional creatures. The comedy was wonderful, with Disney parodies and fairy tale references, plus sequences that were extremely funny. There's practically nothing wrong with this movie- everything was so riveting and fun to watch, always entertaining you while keeping you in suspense. Overall, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, animated or not. I was invested throughout the entire experience, rooting for characters in their toughest moments, and genuinely tearing up multiple times. This movie is outstanding.",

Me, who has watched the original Puss in boots movie and Netflix series as a young child, tought: \"Well, I have forgotten anyway what happend in the crap I watched back then. It won't hurt wasting my time watching this.\" \nAfter I have watched this movie I had felt something which also occured to me when I watched: \"How to train your Dragon the Hidden World\" Other than the fact that the animation of the movie and the casting was just purely stunning, It really went sodeap. I never tought that I, who watches in my age World War movies and documenteries would feal such passion towards an animated movie. This movie made me watch \"The Adventures of Puss in Boots\" andthe original movie again. The love between Puss and Kitty or Puss and Dolcinea is for me even comparable with Hiccup and Astrid. There is so much to add to this movie. I couldn't imagine how someone wouldn't want to watch this movie. I would really recommend this mvoie for anyone, who is seeking to live his childhood life again.",

I didn't have high expectations - I decided on a whim to see it after two recommendations in separate, unrelated YouTube videos. I didn't even remember this is a sequel. Nevertheless, it was fantastic, and a fantastic standalone film. The animation style is delightful, and similar in many ways to Into The Spiderverse, with an overall painterly, comic book aesthetic and creative use of variable frame rate and colour. The story brilliantly balances real heart with cracking jokes. The characters are all super endearing and energetically acted - suave Puss and his old flame Kitty, effervescent Perrito, relentlessly, comedically cruel Jack Horner, surprisingly familial Goldi and her three bears, and the spectre following Puss everywhere. The story is interesting, taking someone who has grown to think himself untouchable and challenging him to stop thinking about himself for once, and along the way a loner learns to trust again, a dog with the saddest backstory finds a loving family, and an adopted child comes to appreciate her found family. So much else to love - the Shrek cameos, the touching portrayal of a panic attack, the in-universe theme song (\"He is your favourite fearless hero\"), the touches of anime in fight choreography. I can't wait to see it again.",

I'm always an active critic, yelling in my mind on why the movie is terrible and unrealistic while I'm watching it, yet I didn't do that at all while watching this. \n\nThe story plot line is perfect, it is somewhat bit more fast paced but there is 0 filler or unnecessary moments. Each and every part seems to contribute to a lesson or meaning, and really builds each of the characters that we see in the short amount of time (less than 2 hours). The buildup is solid and the ending is amazing.\n\nThe voice acting is flat down some of the best I've ever heard for any animated movie, fantastic and describes each character exactly. I actually never noticed this about any other movies but it really stood out to me from this one. \n\nOverall the movie is a 10/10, from a solid critics viewpoint.",

            "content": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a masterpiece. The movie was over 10 years in the making and it shows. Not a single part of it feels rushed, forced, or poorly done. It has gotten stellar reviews on all fronts because the movie is flawless in every regard. It's no wonder that a fantastically executed depiction of one of the most consistently beloved characters in history makes for the greatest movie of all time.\nThe movie utilizes an animation style inspired by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, a movie similarly praised by critics, nigh on universally for its fantastic art. Dreamworks used this same system in the production of Puss in Boots, another example of why the decade-long wait after its original announcement contributed to how truly spectacular the movie is. The painting-like style of art created an atmosphere that felt very much like a fairy-tale as opposed to the just-off-reality vibe that CGI movies of the past had, or the totally devoid of realism style of completely hand-drawn movies such as Aladdin or the Lion King. Dreamworks gave us the best that there is in the animated world by refusing to hold back on the art style. The fact that all movies with higher acclaim amongst critics happen to be live action only serves to illustrate why this movie isn't considered better by so called professionals.\n\tThis art-style helps contribute to the simply stunning fight scenes in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. However, the visuals are not the only thing that makes the swordsmanship in this movie stand out. Unlike other movies using swords, The Last Wish holds a great degree of accuracy to real life swordsmanship. In every single fight, it is clear who is attacking who, who is on offense, who is on defense. Puss can be seen parrying, and then counter attacking with a well executed riposte just like in real fencing. Puss' fight with Death at the end of the movie is the most spectacular fight throughout, with both characters showing off the true height of their ability, utilizing their respective advantages in speed, dexterity, strength, size, cunning, and more and not just pointlessly slapping sticks together between them. What's more, Puss' use of a so-called \u2018gatito blade' in his offhand, is highly consistent with the use of parrying daggers, which were quite popular in Italy and Spain for use in rapier fencing. Such historical accuracy is quite rare in TV shows and movies, and for it to be found in a children's movie where that is rarely a concern just goes to show how much effort was put into the movie. Finer details such as these serve to show just how great of flawless masterpiece this movie really is. What's more, every fight in the movie serves a purpose other than just violence for the sake of violence. They help create exposition, advance the plot, and develop characters, whether that be by showing \u2018Big' Jack Horner's ruthlessness, the strengthening of Three Bears familial bonds, or galvanizing Puss to be brave and value his lives and the time he has with his friends.\nThe message of the story is found in the final fight scene. Without having to be explicitly said, the message is still clear, you should cherish every second. The movie also has much to say about how it's ok to be afraid, a lesson many young boys, and all men really, need to hear. It has a flawless and nuanced depiction of a panic attack, something that can't be said for most movies, and shows us that we don't always have as much control as we thought we did, and that's ok. Therein lies the elegance of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. It is, at its heart, a children's movie, and therefore has the obligation to leave the audience with a clear and positive message. This is no easy task for a movie to accomplish without being heavy handed. Luckily, for the Last Wish, the movie is far from heavy handed, with every message in the story being flawlessly woven into the very essence of the movie, instead of being carelessly stapled on top like so many other movies do. The reward of being appropriate for all audiences and for leaving them all with a positive message is incalculable and one of the many reasons Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is greater than any other movie, despite their higher approval amongst critics.\nPuss in Boots: The Last Wish is a work of art. It is not only accessible to all audiences, but entertaining to them as well. It surrounds a beloved character that is a known-quantity in his beloved status amongst all, and does him justice in innumerable ways. The movie's attention to detail, and sheer visual beauty set it apart from any other animated movie ever made, while its character development, positive messages, and ability to stay within a PG rating puts it far ahead the dark live action movies that dominate the highest rated spots amongst movie review websites. Dreamworks didn't hold back on this one and, on God, it shows.",

The animation style was refreshing for the franchise, the humor was more balanced with the character-driven story, and despite maintaining three different villains the film feels solid rather than clunky. Instead of frequent pop culture references and dodgy jokes that pad for time in the later Shrek films, this Puss in Boots sequel weaves the influences of classic Spaghetti Westerns and swashbuckler films with a family adventure storyline and affirmative, positive themes about appreciating life and those around you. It knows when to be lighthearted and when to be serious, and introduces us to one of the coolest original villains in family animation - a wolf embodiment of death - by not holding back on the menacing aura and instead focusing on it; hopefully the sense of danger will encourage other franchises to stop oversanitizing their films. If I were in the movie's target audience, it would probably be a film I would swear by for the rest of my life (sort of like Shrek 2), but in this case I'll just call it a very good family movie that came out of nowhere.\n\nI hope you're all ready for more Shrek because now it's basically guaranteed to happen. And they will likely be disappointing. (3.5/5)",

Why on earth are you giving this one a 10?!?\u201dBecause this movie\u2026is DIFFERENT than the others. Different in that it strives to be a funnier, deeper, prettier, bolder, edgier, (surprisingly) scarier and overall more complete experience than the original Puss in Boots film over 11 years ago, and unlike that movie holds a distinct accomplishment in simply being a darn fine animated film that stands on its own, one as good as any I\u2019ve seen in the past few years.The Shrekiverse is officially back, and judging by what DreamWorks managed to pull off here the world probably isn\u2019t ready for whatever comes next.PS: That cricket with the spot-on Jimmy Stewart voice is one of the funniest things I\u2019ve seen this year, whoever came up with him deserves a pay raise and a medal and free coffee and recognition from the United Nations.",

Puss in Boots: The last wish was ten times better than I expected. I went into the theatres expecting an alright movie perfect for an afternoon with nothing else to do, I however got out with my head and heart both in shock after the shear amount of love this film has into it.1) The animation: It definitely is inspired on the style of Into The Spiderverse, and it fits into this movie perfectly. The fight scenes look phenomenal, the colour pallette is bright and interesting to look at, and the world Dreamworks created always captivated me especially for the second half of the film.2) Characters: Puss himself is at the centre of the film, with many side characters around him also experiencing personal growth and learning important life values and lessons. The Dog character is not irritating at all, and he even helped Puss and Kitty throughout their adventure. There are no filler characters, all of them fit nicely into the narrative and into the conflict, and are relatable to the audience which is crucial in a character growth driven story. To put it shortly, all characters have believable and relatable fears, emotions and goals which help in selling the ultimate message of the film perfectly.3) The message: Despite being targeted for all ages, this movie contains many scary scenes and deals with serious themes such as anxiety, trauma and death, all of these through the character of Puss himself. Being on his last life, Puss is confronted with the reality that death is nearer than ever, which pushes him into the adventure that unfolds in the film. The ultimate message I won't spoil, but you could already figure out what it is. It's perfect, beautiful, and inspiring for anyone who watches it. 4) The humour: I wouldn't say I laughed as hard as I did with Kung Fu Panda, but thankfully the film has good jokes that land well enough and made me chuckle many times. Don't think that it has silly fart jokes or kid humour, because this film doesn't. Conclusion: Ultimately this is one of the best film I've watched this year. I will probably go many times to the cinema just to watch it, it's beautifully animated, the characters are well written and are developped flawlessly, it ends with a beautiful message and deals with severe themes which everyone can learn something from, and to top it all of arrives just in time for christmas. I'm serious, go watch this movie if you still haven't, I'm sure you'll get out just as surprised as I was. Definitely recommended.",

After a splashy opening song and a quick getaway, Puss discovers that he's blown thru 8 of his 9 lives and sets out to get the titular wish. Along the way he picks up some additional supporting characters. The visuals are vivid and colorful, but that's pretty standard for animations these days. What gives this film its oomph is the pacing, which keeps the action moving. Even though some of the new assortment of individuals has fun delivery, the biggest missing element is comedy. Ever since Trek, these films are usually crammed with clever quips and snarky references. There are some here, but it lacks punch and punchlines.

When I first saw the trailer I remembered that the first movie wasn't amazing it was OK, but this film WOW it is stellar, this is the quality I expect from Dreamworks. The passion, the glory, the boots of this film truly reminded me of Shrek 2. The action is really well animated even if its chopped down a few frames, the scenes and cinematography are powerful and exiting combined with some music flares.The Visuals are really great to look at, but there are some scenes I've noticed where they looked a bit off, like it was a Pre-3D render without lighting I don't know if it Jack Horners' Face that threw me off a bit but it looked bad in some scenes.The story is generic in the last half of the film, they maybe should have stretched it out a little bit by 10 mins with some mystery, or more exploration. Other than that I like it.Lastly are the characters, these characters are excellently picked, well voice acted, and thought out. Every element of this film is linked to a scene, the directors,animators and writers really payed attention to what they can use in each scene.As for Dialogue its not bad its just lacking in something, possibly reasoning, there are one liners in here(again not bad, just missing something), especially in the last half of the film.Ratings if I dare,Visuals: 9/10Story: 8/10Characters: 9/10Plot and Pacing: 8/10Boots: 2/2Puss: 1/9Overall 7/10, wait a minute, No that's not how I feel, this is an 8/10 film it has its problems but I watched this all the way through and enjoyed it.I NEED MORE OF THIS, never knew I would say that for a Puss in Boots Film, shows you that something if done right can work. Can't wait to see the adventures in Far Far Away, hopefully we see the legend himself taking a bath or something.Great job on getting back on the Horse Dreamworks, now are we going to see some other Animations get Sequels, Personally a Megamind 2 would interest me, or maybe something brand new, pls no more Kung Fu Panda Movies unless you are going to take notes from the second film. Whatever it is go all out, and no music numbers like Disney films, something original would do well.",

The film is gorgeously animated, featuring a 2D/3D hybrid similar to the likes of Spider-Verse and Mitchells vs. the Machines, yet improved upon in some manners. The voice cast is beyond exceptional, from the returning actors in Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek, as well as newcomers in Florence Pugh and John Mulaney. Finally, and most important, the writing of this film is masterful, blending both excellent humor aimed at a more mature audience (like the Shrek movies) and deep subject matter relating to making the most of the life we do have and the people we spend it with, all of which told in a great story.

I've watched the earlier Puss in Boots movie and frankly found it to be quite dull.But this one is another matter! It's zany, witty, action-packed, sweet and a glory to behold! Sometimes swerving into old-school animation-style scenes during the action where it sort of mimics the style of \"Into the Spiderverse\" where it runs at about 15 frames per second making it look sort of like stop-motion. It's odd since they use this effect only in fast-paced action sequences and mix it with some almost 2D-centric effects. It works well, but it does take a bit getting used to. But I think I like it!The movie itself starts out a bit slow in the first 10 minutes where we sort of get the usual run-of-the-mill musical scene that always bore me to death. But I now realize that THAT scene was actually quite important for the overall plot of the movie. And the style of it as well. So now I kind of appreciate it being there. But it did make me want to turn the movie off, so I'm glad I stuck with it. I'd heard good things about it, so that made me stay.And I'm glad I did. There's some really fun and lovable characters in this one. And throughout the movie you'll realize that almost the entire movie itself becomes a character transforming and molding itself as the story unfolds. Hard to explain, just watch it!

The latter will appeal to people of all ages.   2) The film uses at least two animation styles, one of which is like that of Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse, but it is done better here. I don't think the style of the Shrek series is used here. Overall, it was refreshing to see a new style.  3) There are numerous good jokes in this film.

Most of the jokes work (it's a shame they show the montage of lives in the trailers), the arcs are well divided, the characters' goal, I can say that Spiderverse had its share of influence in the animation, which is beautiful.The team has a lot of work ahead of them if they want to make one more, and the cat is an excellent character who deserves the challenge.You can watch it, it's really worth it !",

One of the cleanest animation styles that's really appealing to look at (need I mention how vibrant the colors are? Pure eye candy). The story can be understood by anyone but is surprisingly mature. I should warn that if your child easily gets terrified, as it has its genuinely scary moments it might be worth saving this movie for later, but I think anyone can enjoy it.

Sometimes the characters are fun, sometimes they're overbearing. The dialogue can be witty and schmaltzy at the same time, but gets the job done pretty well. Some of the scenes feel like they're just right, while others feel too long or short. But above anything, animation, as well as Death, the antagonist, are spectacular. The rough animation on some parts contrast to the fluidity of what's going on on screen and it collides to create some really impressive action scenes.

For the first time in more than a decade, DreamWorks Animation presents a new adventure in the Shrek universe as daring outlaw Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for peril and disregard for safety have taken their toll. Puss has burned through eight of his nine lives, though he lost count along the way. Getting those lives back will send Puss in Boots on his grandest quest yet. Academy Award\u00ae nominee Antonio Banderas returns as the voice of the notorious PiB as he embarks on an epic journey into the Black Forest to find the mythical Wishing Star and restore his lost lives. But with only one life left, Puss will have to humble himself and ask for help from his former partner and nemesis: the captivating Kitty Soft Paws (Oscar\u00ae nominee Salma Hayek). In their quest, Puss and Kitty will be aided--against their better judgment--by a ratty, chatty, relentlessly cheerful mutt, Perro (Harvey Guill\u00e9n, What We Do in the Shadows). Together, our trio of heroes will have to stay one step ahead of Goldilocks (Oscar\u00ae nominee Florence Pugh, Black Widow) and the Three Bears Crime Family, \"Big\" Jack Horner (Emmy winner John Mulaney, Big Mouth) and terrifying bounty hunter, The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura, Narcos).",
