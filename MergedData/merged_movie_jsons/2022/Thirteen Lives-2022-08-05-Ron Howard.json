            "review_title": "A fantastic, no-nonsense re-telling of a real rescue incident! [+78%]",
            "content": "Maybe, it helps that I didn't watch The Rescue prior to seeing the film, but Ron Howard's work is excellent nonetheless. The film doesn't waste any time getting to its \"rescue mission\" core, bringing in the likes of Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell, and eventually Joel Edgerton to help tell this thrilling and utterly grounded tale. Howard ensures that the film doesn't forget where it is set, allowing the region's culture to breathe life into its Thai characters as opposed to showcasing just white sentiment.The major highlight, as you expect, is the underwater cinematography (by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom) which plays an essential role in making us gasp for breath often and inducing claustrophobic feels. William Nicholson's script plays out chronologically, adding more gravity to the events. The melodrama is kept to a bare minimum, and the narrative is very matter-of-fact. Benjamin Wallfisch's score infuses itself into the fantastic sound design, making it indistinguishable from the sounds of water splashing, diving helmets hitting rock, and oxygen cylinders being dragged along. It's 2.5 hours long, and you already know the ending, but it's still one of the finest films this year.",

            "review_title": "Based On The True Story - Action-Packed And Extremely Suspenseful",
            "content": "I absolutely loved this film by Ron Howard! Thirteen Lives is based on the true story of thirteen people who got stuck in a flooded cave in Thailand in the summer of 2018. The storyline is action-packed and extremely suspenseful. It felt like my heart was racing a million miles a minute while I watched it.Thirteen Lives takes us on the journey of twelve boys and their soccer coach getting stuck in the Tham Luang cave in northern Thailand. The boys wanted to visit the cave; however, little did they know that there was an approaching monsoon that would soon after flood the entire cave. People from all over the world were watching their rescue attempt with the many challenging obstacles they had to overcome. Will someone find them inside the cave? If they do, will the boys get out of the cave in time before they starve, or run out of oxygen?The acting in this film is phenomenal. The portrayal of these young boys, their coach and their rescuers is so believable that you feel like you are there along with them. The cast includes Colin Farrell as John Volanthen, Viggo Mortensen as Richard Stanton, Joel Edgerton as Richard Harris and Tom Bateman as Chris Jewell. The production team, led by director Ron Howard also delivered. The way the film is made makes you feel like you're actually in the cave with the rescue workers. It took a lot of effort and coordination, which is very impressive. Over 5,000 people, including cave divers, doctors, rescuers, Navy SEALS, farmers and others contributed to helping the boys. They put their own lives at risk to help the boys and their coach, whom they didn't even know! Without those people playing a part in this rescue who knows if they would have saved them. My favorite part is when the farmers give up their crops so water can flood them and divert the water from going into the cave. It took a lot of heroism and sacrifice to lose their entire crop in order to give the boys a better chance of surviving.The message of this film is that working together is essential. You should be aware that there is a lot of blood in some scenes and there is some bad language used a couple of times.I give Thirteen Lives 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. This film releases in select theaters on July 29, 2022, and starts streaming on Prime Video August 5, 2022. By Selene W., KIDS FIRST!",

            "content": "Despite the fact the we all know how things are going to turn out, Ron Howard pulls off the same trick he managed in Apollo 13, which is to keep us on the edge of our seats throughout.The film is very deliberately shot from the point of view of the outside world. We learn very little about the boys, and none is introduced to us as an individual. Indeed, they vanish from the screen from the moment they enter the caves to the moment the first divers make contact - just as they vanished in real life. I was irked by this approach at first - the boys being reduced to mere ciphers, but then it dawned on me that that's what they were to the news-feeds of the time: twelve unknown boys (plus their coach) trapped in cave in a country a long way away.The performances are excellent throughout, the direction first-class, and the sense of claustrophobia almost overwhelming at times. I admit to wondering whether there would be a side-swipe at Elon Musk for being a publicity-seeking nuisance, but there wasn't. This was probably the right decision.Any time I turn on the news, I can hear about humanity at its worst. It's nice to hear the odd story about humanity at its best.",

Really phenomenal film. It's from the perspective of the rescue mission, so be prepared about that. It was so intense and stressful to watch! You know the story but actually watching what happened is much worse. It's really heartbreaking at times. I thought I would cry more but I burst into tears at the end. I think they were tears of relief honestly. Lol I had been holding in so much stress. Everyone in the film did a phenomenal job and the character Viggo played, Rick, was at our screening. So much respect for\nThis man and all the others who stayed calm under pressure! I only took a point away because the movie gets started practically right away And I would have liked a little more connection to the boys first. Maybe that was the point though.",

One Thai diver died, but from a mechanical malfunction.The movie does seem very dry of course, because Ron stuck to the reality rather than trying to make it flashy...and I really thank him for it...",

            "content": "Thirteen Lives (2022)It seems like the filmstagram community's number one priority in regards to this film is to state how a documentary called \"The Rescue\" is much better. Well, personally I haven't seen the documentary and considering how long ago this story took place, I didn't even remember what the outcome was. Quite frankly, the less you know about this story, the more enjoyable the movie is going to be. There were only three things I knew for certain: the film is based on a true story of saving a group of kids stuck in a cave, it is directed by Ron Howard and it has Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell.In about 10 minutes we are introduced to a football team, see them enter the cave and after that it's all hands on deck as the operation begins. There are no big monologues or grand debates as the movie aims to create a grounded atmosphere and allow the audience the be as close to the events as possible. An emotion that I kept experiencing, on top claustrophobia, is a sense of admiration for the courage, skill and endurance of these divers. That point is further accentuated whenever the film uses mapping to show the twisted path in terms of length and the time it takes to swim it.One strong element of this movie is how it shows the impact of volunteering and the importance of receiving as much help as possible. While the divers risked their lives, everyone else put in the effort to ease their burden. The actors often seemed like they have been diving their entire lives because of how naturally they were portraying their roles. As a result, the moments of sadness, joy and intense stress will allow you to slip into the wet suits of those divers to be as in-touch with the experience as possible.Heroism and selflessness are always a winning formula and when it's based on true events, while being filmed with the expert skills of Ron Howard, it leaves a very pleasant aftertaste.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV Show reviews.",

No frills, no unnecessary story lines and rarely, if ever, any manipulation of the story. In Thirteen Lives, he sticks to what he does best - presents the facts and lets the story build its own suspense. For a movie that, I presume, most folks know the ending, this movie will keep you totally engrossed as you ride the roller coaster of emotions that all involved felt. From the distraught families to the mentally and physically drained rescuers, no one escaped without being overcome by the sheer enormity of an attempt to save the lives of these thirteen individuals.This movie is taut and well paced with little or no filler. The actors were all extremely believable in their rolls. The sets and the action sequences were beyond reproach.Having said all that, I would like to give special praise to the sound engineers. The sound when the divers were in the cave attempting to do the impossible was truly worthy of Academy Award considerationI cannot recommend this movie more highly. It is one wet and wild ride.",

They portray the divers as kooky misfits who just happen to be the best cave divers in the world and the only men who could have pulled this off. The Rescue tells their story in their own, self-deprecating words.With that said, this film was excellent and the casting was spot on. Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrel looked a lot like the real players.When I watched the documentary I had no idea how the story ended making the film really agonizing and heart-breaking to watch. I suggest that you at least read up on the story before venturing down into this black hole of nightmarish horror, and I'm not even particularly claustrophobic. If this fear is deeply imbedded in your psyche, I'd avoid this movie, and definitely skip \"The Rescue\" that has real footage of some caving and cave diving that caused me to hyperventilate.",

The trip to them was over a mile and took several hours by experienced divers.This is Ron Howard's movie about that event and eventual rescue in July, using a technique that had never been tried. So great was the fear of killing the boys the government provided diplomatic immunity to several rescuers in case all or most of the boys died.

In addition, another positive point of the film is the apparent fidelity to what happened, the characters discuss, dialogue, demonstrate different opinions for the same situation. Another good thing was to give protagonism to the other people, the firefighters, doctors, local residents who also helped in the rescue and who were as important as the divers.A great movie with a moving story, it doesn't surprise me if it has any Oscar nominations.",

            "content": "I'm familiar with the story but I was still on the edge of my seat for much of this film. Howard has a way of spotlighting the emotional details and he didn't disappoint here. Rather than objectively looking on, we're brought in to the minutia behind the scenes and the intellectual threads among the divers as well as the enormous courage, perseverance, & strength that was required of them. This film really involves the viewer to understand what a Herculean effort this rescue was by thousands of people who worked to exhaustion and then kept going. Amazing. These are true heroes.What Howard leaves out, though, is the extremeness of the cave passages, presumably to open the film to a broader audience (watching cavers going through such narrow passages can be very claustrophobic). But in reality, getting to the boys took 6 hours, not because of the length of the canal but because of the extraordinarily narrow passages and difficulty in maneuvering with their equipment. I would recommend The Rescue to get a better understanding of the actual caves and the extreme difficulty of traversing through them.The majority of cave deaths in the US occur in Florida inside flooded caves. Out of 161 known cave deaths in the US, 67 were experienced cavers (not to be confused with spelunkers who are beginner to intermediate hobbyists). There isn't much data on cave deaths outside the US but probably much higher. Most countries don't have the detailed records the US has.But having said that, this rescue would not have been possible in the US due to the severe restrictions on what processes could be implemented. Such as with John Johns - They declined to forcefully pull him out because the toxins could have then rushed to his brain and caused instant death. Therefore, despite imminent death without such a bold and risky attempt, they struggled for hours to try to save him within the confines of extreme limitations set forth due to the massive lawsuits pursued by those who survive but with complications and/or who die due to extreme attempts that later may appear negligent to the family. I love my country but as someone interested in things like extreme sports I am disgusted by the squeaky wheels who impose limitations on what people can or can not do based on, often uneducated, opinion. In the US, all 13 would have likely become casualties of a decision to not allow the method these cavers dared to use.No one really talks about that but if you're a caver and you know Jone's story, you have to ask the question: Why weren't they more aggressive. That's why.",

The cinematographer will definitely be nominated for an Oscar. The realism and truthfulness of the equipment and equipment does not allow you to doubt what you have seen.Moreover, with such a cast, it was very difficult to fail. Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell did a great job, fully conveying their anxiety and uncertainty, tension and anxiety. Again, the outcome is known from the very beginning, but the atmosphere does not allow to calm down, even for a second.Very solid work with chances for awards and nominations.",

Well, Ron Howard has done did it again. As much as \"The Rescue\" keeps you by the edge of your seat, \"Thirteen Lives\" does the same and more. Using its creative license, everything about the series of events is more enhanced: We see the anguish of the parents, the trepidation from the boys, a peek into the government red tape, beautiful Thailand scenery, and most of all, the nail-biting depiction of water from all over - the sink holes, gushing in the caves, flooding the fields, and the relentless rain. Then we get the treat of famous veteran actors portraying the cave diver heroes. Having watched \"The Rescue\" with much respect to Rick, John, and Harry, I am always up for Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell with their fictionalized take on anything. And here, they deliver. It is a delight to witness Viggo morph into Rick perfecting the British accent and his physical mannerisms. One minor downside is that this movie suffers from the biggest spoiler alert. Going in, if you don't know yet how it turns out, the movie would be a 10.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. It is 2018 and a group of boys have just finished soccer practice. After some motivational words from their coach, the boys start joking around with one of their teammates who has a birthday party slated for later that day. Boys being boys, they decide to bike over the local cave for some pre-party exploring. Their coach tags along to keep an eye on them. All of that sounds innocent enough until we realize this is the Tham Luang cave, and they don't realize Thailand's monsoon season is about to arrive early and with full force.The film is directed by Oscar winner Ron Howard, who is adept at mainstream storytelling as evidenced by APOLLO 13 (1994), A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2001), and CINDERELLA MAN (2005). The script was penned by William Nicholson (GLADIATOR, 2000) and Don MacPherson (THE AVENGERS, 1998), and tells the all-too-true story of the daring rescue mission that most of recall following on news reports. When the boys were no-shows for the birthday party, parents and friends rushed to the cave to find the bicycles, but not the 12 boys and their coach. Immediately, rescue efforts began with Thai Navy SEALS rushing to the sight. Cave diving is a unique skill practiced by only a few, and is much different than the open water diving in which the SEALS excel.British cave divers John Volanthen (Colin Farrell) and Rick Stanton (Viggo Mortensen) are called in. Volanthen is the father of a son, and can't help but empathize with what the parents must be going through, while Stanton is crusty old geezer who admits to not liking kids, while also understanding he's one of the few on earth capable of making the necessary dive. Once the two men reach the stranded boys and coach, it becomes apparent that, as difficult and challenging it was to find the group, getting them out of the cave seems all but impossible. Death hung heavy over the operation of last resort, which included calling in Dr. Harry Harris (Joel Edgerton), a cave diving hobbyist, and more importantly, an anesthetist.The diving scenes are expertly filmed by DP Sayombhu Mukdeeprom and underwater camera operator Tyrone Canning. The ever-present claustrophobia and risk of disaster underscores how courageous these men were. Director Howard offers up multiple perspectives: the government, the military, the divers, and the parents. We get very little from those trapped, but that adds to the tension. We get a feel for the entire operation as water is being pumped out of the cave, a water expert and volunteers frantically divert new rainwater into the rice fields, and political maneuvering occurs as the outgoing Governor (Sahajak Boonthankakit) is being set up as fall guy in case the efforts fail.So many elements could have caused failure - low oxygen levels in the cave, a brisk current of water making diving more difficult, and obviously too much rainwater entering the cave would endanger the boys and the divers. The rescue mission lasted more than two weeks. It's a disaster movie based on a real event, and follows up the excellent 2021 documentary, THE RESCUE. Evidently the dramatization is for those who don't watch or have access to documentaries, and as strong as Howard's movie is, there is simply no way for it to eclipse the documentary or what occurred in real time. At its best, the film offers tension and a reminder of what can be accomplished with collaboration.Available on PRIME VIDEO beginning August 5, 2022.",

A story of breathtaking heroism and coorperation on a massive scale, which expertly avoids sentimentality and chest-thumping; it is low-key and perfectly reflects the pragmatic focus of the people involved.

            "content": "My Review - Thirteen Lives\nStreaming on Prime\nMy Rating 7/10First I'll say if you haven't seen the splendid Documentary The Rescue which I gave a 10/10 you will I'm sure be impressed by this movie reenactment of one of the most dangerous and miraculous rescue attempts in recent history.Ron Howard the Director has skilfully Directed his third disaster movie after Apollo13 (1995) and Everest (2015)\nThirteen Lives is an account of the events surrounding the miraculous rescue of 12 teenage boys and their Soccer coach in June 2018 who were trapped deep inside the flooded Tham Luang caves in Northern Thailand .They were eventually rescued after an ordeal that lasted 18 Days by elite cave divers Rick Stanton played by Viggo Mortensen John Volanthen played by Colin Farrell Chis Jewell played by Tom Bateman and Australian Dr Harry Harris played by Joel Edgerton plus others including the skilled Thai Navy SEAL team two who lost their lives during and after the event.For some puzzling reason one of the Australian divers contribution is not represented in the movie ? Dr Craig Challen who shared the 2019 Australian of the year award with Harry Harris isn't mentioned for his vital role in administering the anaesthetic that allowed the divers to safely bring the boys home through the perilous caves.However this Docudrama reenactment has been praised for its authenticity by one of the actual divers Diver Rick Stanton played by an almost unrecognisable Viggo Mortensen in the film. Of course a movie version of an amazing rescue event of this magnitude has to take some liberties to recreate the drama on the cinema screen.That's gets me to my next question why was this feature movie only released in select Cinemas for a week before streaming this new marketing of movies really astounds me I would have preferred to see The Rescue on a Cinema Screen.I read that stunt doubles were used at a minimum in the movie as requested by Vigo Mortensen and that Ron Howard said it made editing easier that both Vigo Mortensen and Colin Farrell had training sessions with the actual divers they were portraying Rick Stanton and John Valanthen.What I missed in this movie depiction of these amazing events was the warmth of Spirit of the documentary the Thai culture is depicted in the movie version but for me the Spiritual aspect of this miracle rescue is only touched on .There is a poignant moment in the Documentary sadly not included in the Screenplay by William Nicholson .A Buddhist monk known as Maing Hpone Sayadaw from Myanmar is featured briefly but his greatest contribution to the morale and faith of the parents of the trapped Thai soccer players doesn't even get a mention?Braving the monsoon rains to perform religious rites several days before the boys were rescued when most people had given up hope and thought that it would be a body retrieval mission instead of a rescue mission the monk told journalists \"\nThey are all still there and would be found in one or two days\" he also said one diver would die trying to rescue the boys and that also happened .In one of the most moving parts of the documentary the divers are reluctant to take the amulets blessed by the monk but the boys parents insisted that they were as vital for survival as the food and other life saving supplies .Filmed in Queensland Australia and Thailand for obvious reasons this movie version couldn't be filmed totally on location as the caves were dry again and the monsoons were over . The amazing sets were built in an enormous airplane hangar-sized building using double Olympic-size tanks and long sections of tunnel which would be flooded with 20 feet of water.The visibility of the divers was non existent in the blackness of the water during the actual rescue so Diver Rick Stanton while praising the film's accuracy, said that the one cinematic change was that the cave water was muddy so that viewers could see the divers in action.The cast would practice for several hours each day to work out their movements through each passage. Each successive section was more difficult to navigate, and was built while the first one was in use for filming. The cast would film their underwater scenes then train on the next section.I enjoyed Thirteen Lives as a dramatic film but much prefer the documentary The Rescue for its emotional impact and authenticity it had a very profound affect on me .It demonstrated that where there is life there is hope and that miracles can still occur in this troubled world we live in.",

After a couple of undermined directions, Ron Howard gets it right this time around with this biographical drama, due to it's gripping and no nonsense approach. It's an approach that succeeds overall, though a little more time with the boys, their frantic families, and a bit deeper window into the central characters' inner lives would have hit the story's tension and impact a little harder home. Nonetheless, it's a fine drama with adept performances that are sure to keep viewers on the edge of their seats.My Rating: 8.5/10.",

Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell both play their roles of expert British cave divers with a suprising amount of honesty and restraint which allows Howard's direction and the story of the Thai Navy Seals involvement to have its time in the spotlight but it is hard to overcome a feeling that the movie feels a little whitewashed focusing most of its energy on the two white characters in an otherwise entirely Thai rescue effort.

A group of 12 boys and their soccer coach who gets trapped in the Tham Luang cave in Thailand and how it took weeks of effort in rescuing all the lives. Unfortunately, I was never able to watch the national geographic documentary from last year, which is why I was not aware of the key details of the rescue operation. I guess it might have helped me to get more involved and attached to the story than I would have if I had watched that documentary.Ron Howard is already an established name in the industry and once again with his Thirteen Lives, he has successfully recreated the horror and the heightened tension of a rescue operation. The screenplay is very grounded and doesn't involve any over-the-top heroic moments. The film rather than focusing on celebrating heroism, emphasizes creating tension by putting the raw situations and challenges faced by the rescue divers and navy seals. The film respectfully highlights the collective involvement of locals and volunteers who helped in every possible way they could. So everyone is a hero in this film. It's a powerful story and the situations are like an emotional tremor. There is this one specific scene where the coach tells the navy seal 'The parents are thanking me for taking care of their children. I thought they would blame me.' This scene literally filled my eyes with tears and is just one of such moments.Thirteen lives is helmed with the presence of a talented cast of Colin Farrell, Viggo Mortensen, Joel Edgerton and Tom Bateman with fabulous Thai actors Pattrakorn Tungsupakul, Vithaya Pansringarm and Teeradon Supapunpinyo. All these actors have given a terrific performance. The film is strong in technical aspects as well. The bgm is chilling and brilliantly serves its purpose of elevating the tension.The underwater cinematography and scenes are breathtaking. The mountains and terrains captured via drones are equally captivating. The respectful treatment of Thai culture and beliefs is praiseworthy.Thirteen Lives is a story of courage, bravery and sacrifices that must be told. The film is full of hearts and seems very accurate in its representation of the facts. If you haven't watched any documentaries or movies on this incident, Thirteen Lives is a must-watch for you. Even if you have watched anything focused on this incident, Thirteen Lives is a worthy representation and should be watched.If you liked this you might wanna check these: The 33 (2015), Everest (2015)Theme(s): Survival, Man vs. Nature, Rescue Mission, Cultural BeliefsRating: 8.4/10.",

A group of young people - still schoolchildren and their football coach go for a walk in the cave. However, the rain that has begun floods the latter, and people are cut off from the path to return or simply have already died. Ron Howard's painting \"13 Lives\" will show how thousands of people from all over the world will try to help save the children.The narration takes almost 2.5 hours. Decent timing, but absolutely justified. In the allotted time, the creators show the central story of the search and rescue of people, as well as demonstrate several secondary plots, several stories within one big one. Such a competent approach makes it possible to convey the full scale of the events that took place, to tell who and how, for their part, tried to contribute to the salvation of young children.At first, what happened seems even implausible. Well, how can you go into a cave that there will simply be no way out. The authors competently reveal this possibility to us, giving out essentially documentary facts in portions. And only then do you begin to realize how unpredictable and original nature can be. After all, the cave presented is absolutely real, and it stretches for huge distances deep into the mountain, from where it is not so easy to get out, especially if it is flooded by a stream of water.The project was not created as a blockbuster or a heart-wrenching drama. This is a high-quality film without any distortions, in which the screenwriters and director could put pressure on pity or show the story of saving people as a kind of epic in the style of a disaster movie. There is none of this, fortunately. However, the narration is so verified that it is impossible to break away from the screen. After all, the creators place emphasis on the most important things, making viewing fascinating and interesting. The hand of the master is recognized, who has already shown a similar style of narration in the paintings \"In the heart of the Sea\" and \"Apollo 13\". Howard successfully places accents, which keeps the viewer in constant tension and interest in what is happening on the screen. At the same time, the authors do not forget to highlight various aspects of the ongoing tragedy. Here they will show how certain services operated in those days, how numerous divers explored the cave under water, employees of other services set up lighting inside the cave, volunteers climbed the mountain itself to create whole water drainage systems there, which in many places went inside the mountain and thereby increased the overall level of flooding of the cave.But most of all I was struck by the responsiveness of people. I still don't understand how thousands participated in this rescue for the sake of 13 people. It pleases to the depths of the soul, inspires, reminds that a person is a brother and a comrade to a person. Recently, the value of human life has long since come to naught, which is proved by a lot of events in the world. That's probably why I was so amazed and inspired that so many people took part in this story of salvation. I want to believe that this would be done in any corner of the planet. I want to believe it, but it's unlikely to work.The picture also leaves a pleasant impression. High-quality staging and successful scenario moves shift the real story to an artistic way. In addition, the project involves famous actors who embodied the direct participants of that story: Colin Farrell, Viggo Mortensen, Joel Edgerton. The chosen method of saving people, as well as the rejection of such raises questions. What will happen next, how is this possible? These are the questions you ask when watching a movie.The picture came out strong. I think this is one of the most successful projects of the director. A high-quality picture, excellent locations, the change of claustrophobic shots of caves to magnificent landscapes of local locations and vice versa, an excellent demonstration of all participants in the events - all this allowed the picture to become a strong work and an inspiring work.9 out of 10.",

            "content": "I thoroughly enjoyed this film.I remember being emotionally attached to this rescue as it was happening. I prayed for the boys, their coach and all those who were working so hard to save those who were trapped. It was a tragedy that Saman Kunan died in his effort and that following the rescue, Beirut Pakbara lost his life to a blood infection contracted during the operation. Their loss was not in vain considering all the boys and their coach survived the ordeal. In that regard, their efforts contributed to one of the most dangerous and daring rescues ever attempted.Ron Howard's direction of this film was amazing. It was a direct take on the situation and made no attempt to sugar coat the weight of responsibility everyone involved carried on their shoulders. It was, for me, an intense and emotional watch despite knowing the outcome. The actors played their roles well. I appreciated that the film was dedicated to the memory of the two men who lost their lives.I would recommend this to anyone who was interested in the retelling of this story.",

            "content": "IN A NUTSHELL:\nFour separate movies been released almost simultaneously about this story. It's a fascinating story because it's true. A boys' soccer team was trapped in the Tham Luang cave by rising floodwaters in Thailand in 2018. There's Cave Rescue by Tom Waller and Lionsgate, Ron Howard's Thirteen Lives on Amazon Prime, a National Geographic documentary called The Rescue that was nominated for an Oscar, and a Netflix limited series called Thai Cave Rescue. More than 5000 people from 17 countries participated in the real-life rescue.THINGS I LIKED:\nIn all of them, we get to travel to beautiful Thailand.Thirteen Lives gives us time to get to know some of the rescuers a little bit better.It's fun to see the food, homes, and religious culture illustrated in all of them.In all of the films, we get to learn and watch various rescue techniques that were used to try to save the boys.We get to see how the world came together to rescue the boys.While Thirteen Lives was a big Hollywood production with elaborate sets and soundstages, Cave Rescue was actually filmed in Thailand near the actual locations where the events occurred. Rescue diver Jim Warny plays himself in that version.I adore Viggo Mortensen, so that persuaded me to favor the Thirteen Lives version by Academy Award-winning director Ron Howard. Viggo Mortensen speaks multiple languages, and apparently, he's also a fix-it guy, volunteering to fix equipment rather than wait for the crew. Also in that movie are Colin Farrell and Joel Edgerton. They all speak with accents and are absolutely fantastic.It's fun to hear Thai being spoken. We also hear Chinese and English. In Cave Rescue, we also hear French and Spanish.Ron Howard's film utilized over a thousand people to portray all of the action!Even though we know the outcome of the story (if you paid attention to the news when this was happening in real life), all movies do a good job of building tension and suspense.In both Thirteen Lives and Cave Rescue, we're shown a map of the cave and a time counter that tells us where the divers are and how much time has passed since the rescue operations began.The cinematography by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom in Thirteen Lives does an excellent job of making us hold our breath and gasp for air. In reality, the water would have been extremely muddy with terrible visibility.Many of the actors in the movie Cave Rescue were the people in real life who experienced the ordeal.So much for superheroes...these rescue workers are the real deal.There's a super sweet scene in Thirteen Lives that really touched me. It's when two of the divers first found the boys. The first thing the boys said was \"Thank you.\" They were so humble and affirmed that they loved their coach, even though he felt terrible for getting the boys into dangerous trouble. They explained that the coach taught them how to meditate and be calm. I just wanted to hug the boys and was so emotional watching these films!The boys went so long without food, which is possible, so I wondered how they were getting water. For a split second in the movie Thirteen Lives, we see one of the young boys opening his mouth to get drips of water from the cave wall. Wow.At the end of Cave Rescue, we get to see video footage of the real people who experienced the events.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nIn both Thirteen Lives and Cave Rescue, we don't get to see how the boys got stuck in the cave. Instead, we see the boys wander near a cave and then, suddenly, rescue workers are seen swarming the area. We don't get to see how the boys survived for so long.In Cave Rescue, a lot more Thai is spoken, often without subtitles. There are also a lot of title cards that you have to read that let you know what's going on. You have to read fast because they don't stay on the screen very long. I also felt like some details were missing in this version that made it harder to understand what was going on than in Thirteen Lives.TIPS FOR PARENTS:\nThere is a lot of reading text in all four movies.Boys are in a dangerous situation.Talk of death\nSomeone drowns.In Cave Rescue, there is an F-bomb.THEMES:\nHumanity\nThe value of life\nTeamwork\nThinking outside the box\nHope\nFamily\nInnocence\nMother Nature\nHeroismYou can see the full review on the Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.",

Everyone is fighting the same fight against the nature where nothing is 100% sure. My heart was beating so fast as if it wants to jump out of my chest. I felt like it was an event that happened on the news and i was part of the story. They really brought us into the deepest moments and the sound effect and music made it even worse and more tense that i could imagine. I caught myself praying and crying as coming mechanism for all of the tesion. I study film and i say say fog, water and cave scenes were so nicely shot, with perfect amount of lighting. Also the director of photography did a great job with showing acters emotions with close up scenes and showing disgrace of nature. Sound effects were just on point.

I liked a lot that the usual sentimentality Howard puts into that genere is missng here and it was rather a very factual and rough film with much less manipulative elements than you would usually expect from him.Some cuts were strange, and although I understand that if he had shown more detail, then it would have ended up being a miniserie, but still it was not the best edited film.The acting was solid. Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell both turned into very good performance, that were phyiscally more demanding than from an acting perspective but I liked how they developed their characters nd gave them special traits, especially Mortensen succeded with that.Joel Edgerton also gives nice support.There were many creative decisions Howard took for the film like not showing the kids, after entering the cave, until it was clear they are alive ( I dont consider this is a spoiler, as everybody knows that fact).It was also not overlong as you were permanently on the edge of the seat , even knowing the outcome, it was still thrilling. Especially those claustrophobic diving sequences. All in all a great film with a lot of value and certainly one that deserves to be seen and pays justice to the real live events.",

This is also one of the best films ever made by Ron Howard, a talented director, but one whose television roots come through all too often, a factor that scarred the otherwise excellent Apollo 13. This true story wastes no time with little background noise to help us understand more about what makes characters the characters tick. The characters in this film exist for only one reason and that is to rescue, under incredible circumstances, 13 young people trapped at the end of a very long cave due to massive flooding in beautiful Thailand. It is intense with lots of hold your breath moments and ultimately very moving. It's beautifully directed with outstandingly non-showy honest performances by all including the three famous leading actors. It does have a little too recognizable of an ending that we've seen often before, but overall this is an exhilarating piece of filmmaking.",

That version had bite, suspense, urgency, even (believe it or not) romance. While Howard remains one of the most reliable directors in the biz, he lost it here. Here, the Hollywood version is dull as old socks. With the sole exception of Joel Edgerton, all the big name actors are wasted and forgettable.

All of it felt real and kept me on the edge of my seat.One of the few things I didn't like is the abrupt cuts between one end of the cave to the other. It just didn't feel like it was a long ride unless you paid attention to the time counter and followed the pointless map that appeared throughout the movie and really didn't add much to the vastness of the cave. Every time I looked at that random map, it seemed like the red dot was in the same 2 spots. After awhile the abrupt cuts just became repetitive and tedious.I also felt the interaction between the boys and rescue divers was rushed and it felt it should have been more engaging. For example, after the first 4 boys were rescued and the rest had to wait another day or two, there should've been a spoken line of some sort of encouragement when the rescuers came back, to celebrate that their friends made it alive and well.",

Rick and John finally reach the trapped boys after Thai Navy Seals failed and then work with Thai authorities with a hand selected team of fellow cave divers from all over the world backed by an enormous number of local military and volunteers. Operating in very tight rock formations, murky and very turbulent water across a labyrinth of cave formations stretching 2km (1.5 miles) and racing against the clock of increasing monsoon rain and starving children, an audacious and potentially dangerous plan is hatched to anesthetize the boys and extract them as inert as possible. Whilst the ultimate success is history, the movie maintains a high degree of tension re-creating the intense drama the rescue became.Having watched the documentary The Rescue, it is stunning how accurate and authentic Director Ron Howard has managed to be compared to the real events and people. The lead actors were superb, the massive sets mirror the tight, wet and awful conditions, the actual rescuers trained their in-film counterparts fabulously, the teenage Thai actors looked just like the stranded boys and the movie was filled with a vast retinue of Thai talent and extras that paid special attention to Thai cultural sensitivities and religious beliefs in re-creating the rescue.The movie focused more on the planning and logistics of the actual dive rescue as it lay at the heart of the story versus the documentary that featured more interviews with parents and examination of the Thai authorities' operations. The movie fully underscores what a truly amazing and miraculous thing was achieved and it is a strong and faithful rendition of this unique chapter in history.",

At the same time, the pessimist in me thinks about how many other children currently need saving as a direct result of governmental decisions, colonialism and endless war. (1 viewing, 12/26/2022)",

It is on a Hollywood budget, I mean, MGM? But it never felt sensationalized with Thai languages being spoken just as much as English. Everyone knew the importance of recreating the harrowing events and you can tell that all who was involved gave their uttermost to the production.It really shouldn't be compared to The Rescue as if they're comparable. I have never heard of anyone compare The Titanic to any of the thousands of documentaries out there. Whoever is saying the documentary is \"better\" sounds pretentious. We have seen many narrative movies based on real events, and that is the power of cinematic storytelling. The documentary is brilliant and powerful in its own way, just so is Thirteen Lives.",

            "content": "A little over four years ago, the entire world was watching (literally, for those fortunate enough to have access to TV) the unfolding of something that definitely confirmed the saying \"real life is stranger than fiction\" - the rescue of a youth soccer team and their coach trapped in a deep cave Thailand, during a most unwisely timed fun exploration, at the height of the monsoon season. I will not dwell on the details which have been fully reported worldwide. Over these past 4 years, several documentary and dramatized cinematic accounts have appeared. \"Thirteen lives\", recently released, is the first (probably only) full scale Hollywood-type movie.Under the experienced baton (just borrowing an orchestral term) of Ron Howard, the 150-minute movie effectively tells the story of this miracle (I cannot find a better word to describe it), without sensationalising, and with just the right (small, that is) amount of dramatic human touch. After all, this is just one quick snapshot of something that happened in the lives of these characters. They moved on, even if it left something imprinted in their mind, to various degrees.While Howard has been considerate enough to avoid the \"white man save the world\" syndrome, this is after all a Hollywood-type movie, with all the three leads Caucasians, ably cast.Viggo Mortensen is Rick Stanton, the best confined-space diver in the world. Other than a top professional, entirely no-nonsense, we know very little about this taciturn man who lives alone in a somewhat Spartan existence. Mortensen displays just the right amount of emotion to show that Rick, who claims he \"doesn't even like children\" is not entirely without warmth of emotion.Colin Farrell's John Volanthen is the one who carries the movie's main share of palpable emotions, anchored on his pre-teen son at home awaiting dad to come home after another successful mission.Joel Edgerton's Harry Harris has the heaviest of the emotional burdens to bear, in a sense. As a specialist, his job is to sedate the 13 people to be rescued so that they can be carried through the half-flooded, treacherously crooked passage, just like a corpse (albeit a corpse that still breaths, wearing an oxygen mask), through a 7-hour swim, to safety. At the mid-point of the rescue mission, our three heroes lament to each other \"After we brought one out alive, we were hailed as heroes. Now, if we bring just one out dead......\". If not a \"miracle\" I don't know what to call this. Incidentally, a warning: if you have claustrophobia, have yourself mentally prepared before watching this movie.Parallel to the torturing claustrophobic rescue scenes, there is a parallel endeavour, \"battle with water\" as coined by the mayor. This is a massive effort to divert the torrential rainwater away from the caves, using plastic piping. When these run out, they use bamboo trunks cut in halves. The big sacrifice however is from the farmers whose crops will be flooded by the water drained towards their fields. It is comforting to see at the end credit that they have been compensated by the government. This is no easy battle, if you recall Bruce Lee's famous two words \"be water\". It is the worst enemy you can have.The entire cast (including very minor ones), the three above plus another two or three score (primarily Thai) turn in a solid performance. Two big stars are the visual and audio teams that recreate the miracle on the silver screen.",

No stone is left unturned in the seemingly impossible task of rescuing the party including bringing in rescue divers from across the globe, including Vigo Mortensen, Colin Farrell and Joel Edgerton.The first half is a little slow and the second, where the ingenious rescue attempt is made, is full of suspense and claustrophobia in the flooded tight fitting caves. But in fairness, director Ron Howard has chosen to recreate this end to end story as accurately, I guess with a touch of dramatic license, as he can. As such, there will be changes in pace as there will have been at the time, sometimes focussing on family angst, operational constraints, local politics and our heroes doing their thing. That Howard has played it straight without melodrama and daft speeches, is to his credit. This isn't the most exciting film ever made, but it has its moments and is certainly to the credit of the divers involved in the rescue operation, played with understated aplomb by the 3 leads.",

            "content": "The national geographic documentary about this miracle event was so good I was so ready to be disappointed by this and thought it would be a cheap Hollywood attempt at making money out of such an emotional but ultimately inspiring real life event. I was so pleased to be wrong. It is a long film but it never drags. The swimming through the cave shots get a bit repetitive and were not done as well as National Geographic managed to do them - they were too dark and obscured. But everything about this felt deeply respectful to authenticity, the facts of the event, the people involved, the victims, etc. Colin Farrell and Viggo Mortensen are absolutely brilliant in their attempts to accurately portray the mannerisms and personalities of the normal unremarkable but remarkable British heroes who led the expedition. Colin Farrell the actor completely disappeared, you could not discern any of him in his voice or his mannerisms. And this was without wearing any makeup or costume. Absolutely outstanding. Viggo was equally good though not quite as impressive. But the energy they both carried themselves with was one of utter respect for the real life heroes they were portraying. And this imbued out to all of the production. There was no hollywood sensationalism. Just respect. And that was deeply felt. And because of that all the raw emotion of the ordeal was allowed to shine through organically. One of the most emotional hollywood films I have seen in sometime, on par with the documentary. This is not to be underestimated. We live in a crazy sensationalist world where everything is completely overblown and catastrophised because we are so difficult to shock and surprise these days because with the worst and best of humanity available everyday at our fingertips on the internet we think we have seen it all. So to take this approach was very brave and extremely refreshing and was what Hollywood and audiences have drastically been missing. Hopefully this will inspire more films, real and fiction, to a higher form of authenticity for the future. We so badly need it.",

Sometimes there are some events that can feel shoehorned in out of necessity, but for the most part every sequence feels important and advances the direction situation.Like a lot of biographical films of this nature, this one does juggle a lot of characters, and at times more than it can feasibly handle.

Ron Howard is a great director. Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell and Joel Edgerton are great actors. Taking all that into account, \"Thirteen Lives\" is a good movie.

I watched the new Ron Howard Prime Video film, \"Thirteen Lives\" and I must confess I got misty. You'll probably recall the 2018 incident in Thailand when 12 boys and their soccer coach got trapped in a huge cave that flooded. Help came from all over the world - more than 5000 pitched in to this difficult rescue effort.For this movie, the cave's interiors and miles of flooded passageways were recreated on a set. Could have fooled me though. As someone who has been spelunking, I can say that Howard captured the claustrophobic atmosphere perfectly. After taking basic scuba training during role prep, Viggo Mortensen advocated for his fellow actors and won the \"privilege\" of doing all their own diving scenes. Very impressive.In an interesting script choice, the viewer is largely given the perspective of the rescuers. After we see the kids and their coach disappear into the cave, the point of view switches to the parents who first sound the alarm to authorities. Unexpected pre-monsoon rains make the situation critical. The kids came straight from soccer practice and are not equipped to survive such an ordeal.Then the focus shifts to the rescuers as the agonized parents look on. Watching the rescue team grow and come up with a plan, then execute it is the heart of the film. This is largely because of the kindness of countless strangers - many of whom simply showed up at the site and asked to help. I believe the movie accurately portrays the mental and physical perils involved. The diving scenes are harrowing and not for the claustrophobic. Although the actors were OK, two of the real life rescuers died as a result of their efforts.I found Thirteen Lives a thrilling, suspenseful, and heartwarming film. I'd like to think that we still live in a world where such kindness is still possible. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "One Hollywood's best directors, Ron Howard, has engaged three of the world's best actors, Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell & Joel Edgerton to tell the true story of the \"world's greatest rescue.\" In June 2018, a 12-person Thai soccer team of young men (after their ordeal, even the youngest deserve to be called men) plus their coach go to explore a local cave after practice. Then monsoon season begins earlier than usual, and they're all trapped deep within a chamber by the ensuing severe flooding. Late that night, their parents realize what's happened and the \"authorities\" are called in. Unfortunately, the best \"cave rescue divers\" in the world (who even knew that was a thing?) from the UK arrived more than a week later, when some of the community had already begun to lose hope. After finally reaching the boys (no mean feat, and one that Thai Navy Seals couldn't do), and returning successfully, Viggo's character Rick (\"I don't even like kids\") comes up with a cra-cra plan involving their mutual friend, Dr. Harris (Edgerton) and I won't spoil what the plan is, but we all know that-incredibly-it worked! If this already lengthy film had featured detailed backgrounds on the rescuees, as well, it would be a potential 10/10, but admittedly too long. Hence I give it a strong 8/10 and recommend it!",

            "content": "Over the last 10 - 15 years the career of beloved TV actor turned Academy Award winning director Ron Howard has turned more and more into a workmanlike loop, one that sees the talented if often uninspiring talent either bait Oscar voters with surefire award hits or direct mindless blockbuster's designed purely for mass entertainment and nothing else.Leaning towards his former staple, the based on the true story Thirteen Lives is the usual type of Howard film that would've in times past shown up in limited showings around the Xmas period with hope of making its way into some Top 10 of the year lists and snaring a few cheeky award nominations but after falling victim to the recent MGM aquirement that has seen much of its line up of films be shunned too direct to streaming offerings, Thirteen Lives is unlikely to make much of a mark despite its innoffensive treatment of a miraculous true story that is far more engaging than this effort.Facing another hurdle in the fact just mere months ago in 2021 the BAFTA nominated The Rescue came out, a documentary that mixed real life footage with carefully recreated reinactments of this incident, for anyone that has watched that film or carefully studied the story of 13 Thailand souls trapped in a deadly underground cave system, Howard's effort here suffers badly from what has come before it and while it's precision to accuracy can be applauded, when weighed up against The Rescue it pales in comparion in the tension and character building stakes.Nabbing an all-star cast to bring proceedings some extra prestige, Howard's actors all deliver typically solid turns, with it particulary good to once more see Viggo Mortensen in a Hollywood leading role and Colin Farrell and Joel Edgerton doing well in their turns as the trio bring the real life heroes of Rick Stanton, John Volanthen and Harry Harris to life but with a lack of development or background exploration of these amazing true figures halting the emotional enagement levels of Thirteen Lives in its tracks, even if there's no doubt many viewers will be kept on tenterhooks in the films trial against the odds final act.Much like he has done with recent efforts like In the Heart of the Sea, Solo: A Star Wars Story and Hillbilly Elergy, Howard directs Thirteen Lives like you would expect someone to do sticking very closely to the Hollywood rulebook 101, there's little surprise with his decisions, little flair with how things are shot and there being a feeling that while perfectly watchable and no doubt effective in certain circles, Thirteen Lives is another Howard film that is happy in its generic self at all times and for a story like this, one would've hoped for a little more imagaination and heart.Final Say -Unlikely to make much of a dent in any signifcantly impactful way, Thirteen Lives is another mildly entertaining Ron Howard drama that is unable to better its preceeding documentary counterpart and becomes a film that misses a chance to turn a miraculous true story into a similary special viewing experience.3 Spongebob Squarepants cakes out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",

I agree with what some of the reviewers say that there's no focus on the background of the children. Actually the viewers have more information on the foreign rescuers than on those being rescued. I guess that's one fault there in this movie. But I do appreciate that the movie does show a bit of culture and lifestyle of the locals. In any case, the length of the movie is already about 2.5 hours.",

That humans can do great things when they work together.But this felt cheap and it felt like it was leaving out all the other amazing divers involved in the rescue.Leaving out Harry's diving partner Craig felt wrong and the way they made it seem like they approved the whole thing quickly was a joke. Harry and Craig could have gone to Thai prison for taking the risks they did and Harry could have lost his licence. They just washed over all that like it was easy.On the flip side there were parts in this that were beautifully done and moments where Ron Howard captured the humanity of this event and how department and terrifying the situation was for all involved. Moments that moved me to tears.So still we'll worth watching but I highly recommend watching The National Geographic's The Rescue on Disney Plus to get a better understanding of what really went down.

All the divers had their particular skills but none more than Richard (Harry) Harris to do what he did to the children. I was a bit surprised that his dive buddy and fellow Australian Craig Challen (jointly awarded the 2019 Australian of the year) was not mentioned in the movie. There could be a reason for this but could not find it. As a fellow diver I was very surprised to see that none of the divers wore gloves which is why their hands were all cut up. There is a reason divers wear gloves especially in confined places like cave diving. All in all it was a great movie and brought back great memories of how I felt when all 13 soccer players came out alive.",

He does a strong job of recreating the situation and placing you in it. The movie itself is no small feat production wise.Running roughly two and a half hours the film is long but you don't really feel the length as it remains intresting though the last five to ten minutes start to wobble.Since it happened to take place in Thailand a good portion of the movie is in the native language which is a set back for all those who don't speak Thai; it's always better to hear a movie than read it. To attain full accuracy it is necessary but the film doesn't make any attempt to minimize it.The mission itself was a collective effort so while it focuses more on Viggo Mortensen's and Colin Farrell's characters they sort of get lost in the crowd and while they deliver convincing performances, they aren't the center of your attention. I doubt this will get Mortensen the Oscar he's deserved for so long.",

It was tense and not at all boring. Very unpretentious. It would have been nice to have seen more of the other aspects of the rescue, such as the 'water guy' and his role. And yet the film was already 2.5hrs long and it didn't feel dragged.The dynamics between the actors was great. Very unpretentious. No unnecessary frills. The actors did their own stunts and it paid off because the reality of the situation the film was portraying was brought to life.My singular criticism is that Viggo Mortensen's English accent sounded at times more African.

            "content": "STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulIn June 2018, young Thai football team The Wild Boars celebrate after a victory, and find themselves wondering in to the Tham Luang cave, which is exposed and open to the elements. Before long, the heavy rains have trapped the boys inside, and an alert to their disappearance is raised when they fail to turn up to a party organised by their parents. A massive rescue operation, on a worldwide scale, is launched to save them, and renowned divers Jack Valanthan (Colin Farrell) and Rick Stanton (Viggo Mortensen) lead the mission, but when their efforts come under strain, an unconventional method is used to ensure the boys rescue.Real life can often be looked on to form the most stirring drama, more affecting than any Hollywood screenwriter could manage, especially given the real world outcomes attached to it, which will provoke more natural human reactions. Thirteen Lives brings to the screen a soberingly recent real life event, that will still be powerfully fresh in peoples minds, and so potentially more impactful. With two A list stars in the lead, and decorated director Ron Howard at the helm, the stage is set for a dynamic, charged production. But while Thirteen Lives is not without its merits, sadly it can't be said to be totally the sum of its parts.Even if the story overshadows the star power, it can still be said that the pairing of Farrell and Mortensen is a mouth-watering prospect that promises some raw dynamism, but somehow here, even with true life stakes attached to their deeds, they fail to truly generate the spark that their ability could muster, even if they are individually believable and convincing (even with Farrell's off-putting British accent.) As events progress, and the story goes on, it does create an authentic sense of realism, without any Hollywood theatrics and sensationalism, which is to its credit. However, no matter how in depth it is, the concluding impression is just the feeling of a glorified movie of the week, somewhat overlong and over-indulgent to further add to the problems.There's nothing more uplifting (in the heart and mind, anyway) than a true life tale with a happy ending, and there's definitely some good stuff to unwrap here. There's just too much going on, and not enough to really hit your taste buds. ***",

There are pacing issues, the characters are all at odds and unlikable (why would you be a firefighter, cave rescue diver if you had such disdain for others?) not to mention the ropey accents from Viggo & Colin.This is then juxtaposed against how this achievement was about people from across the globe coming together and working for a greater good.

I feared a film like this, telling a genuinely remarkable true story which we all know - would play to the worst of those. The reverse is true. It brings out the best in Howard and those around him; it's understated in the best ways, there's a lack of sentimentality which makes it all the more moving, and it's success stems at least in part from an unpredictable creative decision which pays off well. Movies about disasters like to - need to, in fact - lay on a spectacular disaster. This doesn't show us any of that - perhaps because the involvement of children might have made it somehow exploitative - and instead focuses on the widespread relief effort and the emotional toll on those involved. Most impressively it eschews a classic trap of these films - there is not a hint of the white saviour about all this. The breadth of those involved is always well portrayed, and no one person is in charge or more heroic than anyone else. Local customs, rituals and religion are to the fore. It packs a subtly powerful emotional punch, and it speaks to something deeper by choosing a path less often trod by these sorts of films.",

It's shot in a way where it almost feels like a documentary. When the divers traverse through the cave system, the sound is distinct and heightens the tension which gets complimented by its score. The actors all play their part well, nothing dramatic, they keep it to a minimum, but it helps with the realism. It also does a good job at highlighting the efforts made by the people on the outside while our main characters make their way through the flooded tunnels of the cave. The way that Ron Howard decided to direct and tell this real life story makes this a worthwhile experience and one of his best movies. Final verdict: 9/10.",

This version features big name Hollywood actors. I'll leave it up to you to decide which is the more accurate account. There's also a documentary which I haven't seen.The main difference is the treatment of Vernon Unsworth, the British cave diver who co-ordinated the rescue attempt. In the 2019 Thai version, Vernon is treated as a central character and is given the respect he deserves. In the Hollywood version, Vernon is a peripheral character and is even derided by the other divers. Given Vernon was honored by both the Thai and British Crown for his efforts and this movie is an insult to him.Neither the Thai nor Hollywood version mention a certain African American billionaire and IMDB don't want him mentioned either, so I won't.",

Also I don't want to say the actors were very cold, emotionless and that made their acting very bland but I guess they were just trying to be as accurate as the real divers.

The diving scenes are not repetitive because each time they show a new challenge or outcome. It was really a story about how 5 nerdy English cave divers risked their lives to save these kids. The Thai Seals were not cave divers, but did support work and the many Thai people outside the cave helped as well, even flooding their own rice fields to help the boys.

The bravery of all those involved in saving these Thai children is laudable and faithfully represented by Ron Howard. Darkness, strong currents, falling rocks, tight cave entrances and an almost 3k of passages underwater presented a daunting challenge to the international team of volunteers who risked their own lives to rescue the stranded children. Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell lend their undeniable talent to this understated gem. The director also makes a conscious effort to respectfully portray the vitality of the Thai people's faith, the sacrifices made by their farmers, and the resolve shown by youths who faced death as a team.With time running out for those trapped, it is important to remember that \"real-life's tony stark\" and the world's wealthiest man sought to capitalize on the relief effort, sending a Submarine which he reminded the world was developed by engineers at SpaceX. Upon being rejected, King Twit launched an unhinged attack on one of the divers who helped coordinate the rescue. I hope one day he will stoop to watching this movie.",

Technically I'm sure this was difficult to make, expensive, and the production value is somewhat good. But, the cinematography, casting, costume design, all pretty low brow. The worst part is how they make the thai people look stupid and over governed with useless bureaucrats. A typically american perspective even when the heros are brits and aussies.

            "content": "Barely four years have passed since one of history's most astonishing rescues. In Thailand, twelve young soccer players and their coach were trapped in a cave system being relentlessly flooded in pre-monsoon rains. Volunteers from Chiang Rai Province and the world gathered to help for 18 hopeless days.Fortunately for that world and the team caught in the cave, retired firefighter Richard Stanton (Viggo Mortensen), tech consultant John Volanthen (Colin Farrell), and Dr. Harry Harris (Joel Edgerton) came to help and ultimately provide the solution to saving the doomed boys. Director Ron Howard, who knows something about tight spots and its heroes (see Apollo 13) and writer William Nicholson (see Everest) have crafted a clear story of heroism and cool in the face of death.Howard, leagues away from his disappointing Hillbilly Elegy, doesn't clutter the narrative with choking emotionalism but rather elects to tell the linear story including parents, local authorities, and divers with spare back story but minute by minute tension as the days tick off and the solution remains elusive.It's only a short film time until the boys are located but seeming centuries until the two Brits come upon the answer, which is as fraught as any fictionalized drama ever seen on the screen.Nature with its indomitable rains seems the likely winner when combating frail humanity; in true Howard style and the best of humanity, only one life will be lost, that of former Thai Navy Seal Saman Kunan, dying of asphyxiation after he delivered diving cylinders to the team.Thirteen Lives is a splendid version of a reality that seems unreal (see the competent documentary, The Rescue). During a time when we have lost confidence in our selves and our leaders combatting a scurrilous pandemic, it is heartening to see real selflessness in the face of tragedy and Nature once again challenging us to be more than we thought we could be.",

            "content": "A constantly riveting & consistently thrilling dramatisation of the Tham Luang cave rescue effort that saw the best of humanity join hands & work together to save 13 people trapped deep within the flooded cave, Thirteen Lives is neat, straightforward & uncomplicated and delivers the thrills without deviating much from the true story to succeed as a gripping survival offering.Directed by Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind & Rush), the film picks up momentum relatively quick with its swift setup & early establishment of the stakes at play and keeps the tension alive at all times by letting the elements deepen the peril. The scenes within the cave brim with suffocation & claustrophobia while the media circus on the outside brings a chaotic energy of its own.What stands out about Howard's direction is his documentary-like approach as he keeps things grounded and doesn't attempt to dilute the real-life incident with fabricated scenes to make the journey more cinematic or have the story be all about one character's heroics. Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell & Joel Edgerton play their unassuming roles with an understated touch and it works in the film's favour.Overall, Thirteen Lives is clean & clinical filmmaking that may not offer a full-fledged account of the rescue operation but skims through enough detail to keep the viewers' interest & investment sustained in the proceedings. While its 147 mins runtime is a tad excessive, the steady pacing & kinetic treatment helps keep the complaints at bay. Crafted with finesse & packed with emotion, Ron Howard's latest is worth a shot.",

I actually didn't even realize it was that long. There was so many people and factors that were really involved, it would have to be a mini series. I really enjoyed this one.

I am so thoroughly disappointed.What he has failed to capture is the real life drama that unfolded. He has over dramatised some scenes and missed the boat with others.With due respect to the actors, I think they make the best of a bad lot. Joel Edgerton for one doesn't overplay his part.But, as we know, the Thai Captain in charge of the operation did not jump in the water to help the last diver out. Not was it as simple to get the Minister to give the go ahead.If this had been portrayed truly and faithfully, the stress of the divers concocting a plan while the authorities were aiming for a zero risk rescue, contemplating leaving the boys in the cave, would have been more than enough drama for the big screen.Maybe Ron has lost his touch.Nothing but respect for the divers, but it's not their job to make this into a movie - that falls to the director, writers and producers.Like I said, stick with the National Geographic documentary - a far better production in all measures.",

The underwater cinematography by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom is impressive and the sound mix is often quite eerie in its depiction of water and cave noises. All this effort is for naught. Ron Howard's latest directorial effort is a tedious, mediocre retelling of the June, 2018 incident where 12 Thai adolescents and their soccer coach were trapped in a flooded cave for 18 days. They were rescued by an international crew of cave divers led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen. \"Thirteen Lives,\" despite spending an equal amount of time watching underwater sequences in passageways so narrow that one person can barely fit through, let alone ferry another person to safety. Despite an occasional map being superimposed on the screen, viewers are barely afforded a sense of geography. Howard and his editor, James Wilcox kill the momentum and tension by often cutting between what's going on underground and the numerous attempts to divert water above. \"Thirteen Lives\" begins with scenes of the team practicing then riding to the cave for that poorly timed descent that coincides with the monsoon that will entrap them. In those moments, the film appears to be centering its focus on them. It's a while before we even meet any of the White actors playing the divers. And yet, the teammates are reduced to mere victims, pawns in their own story. The only parent we hear from in any regard is played by Pattrakorn Tungsupakul. As the mother of a boy named Chai, she's given very little to do besides wander around in the background praying and looking worried.",

The tech specs are quite good with exceptional sound design.Screenwriter William Nicholson (working with Don MacPherson) and Howard follow a pretty straightforward path. Colin Ferrell and Viggo Mortensen similarly are fairly low key even as the two major stars in the film. Good use of graphics to show where the rescuers are helps viewers keep their bearings. Still, the filmmakers do add a bit of 'Hollywood' melodrama at points and some of the suspense seems to be - if not artificial- at least prolonged.There has already been another feature and several documentaries made on the incident, and Howard and his team add little beyond being the best made of productions. The quite exemplary 2021 doc THE RESCUE had the good sense to understand where the story peaked and moved expeditiously to its conclusion, whereas Howard milks it for almost another full hour. It's not an obscure tale - it was literally the biggest news in the world only a couple of years ago.THIRTEEN LIVES is an honorable effort, if a bit superfluous.",

            "content": "Thirteen Lives is based on the Tham Luang cave rescue that occurred in 2018, the film is directed and produced by Ron Howard, from a screenplay written by William Nicholson. Thirteen Lives has Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell, Joel Edgerton and Tom Bateman in main roles. In my opinion, Colin Farrell takes home the best performance but there's so many good acting performances in this film.A rescue mission is assembled in Thailand where a group of young boys and their soccer coach are trapped in a system of underground caves that are flooding.The film placed authenticity at the front, with the writers and director along with the producers creating something brilliant, something people who were there could only praise. Diver Rick Stanton praised the film's accuracy, saying the one cinematic change was that the cave water was muddy. The real divers had zero visibility. Actors Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell even did their own stunts and diving rather than doubles doing the work to make it even more immersive and accurate, they'd been training with Rick Stanton and John Volanthen. With the need and want for authenticity, to ultimately do the true events justice, the actors suffered panic attacks whilst doing the diving and also the experts assigned to supervise the filming stated this was the most potentially dangerous production they worked on. It shows and I'm glad they did it like that, as the suspension is kept throughout every single scene. The sets were built in an enormous airplane hangar-sized building using double Olympic-size tanks and long sections of tunnel which would be flooded with 20 feet of water. The cast would practice for several hours each day to work out their movements through each passage. Each successive section was more difficult to navigate, and was built while the first one was in use for filming. There are many more things that adds to the accuracy, the cast and crew cared something immensely.This sure is a movie you'll want to see in 2022 as it has some strong acting, stunning cinematography and a director who cares. Ron Howard created a great biopic and overall an incredible film with some flaws, and the grounded approach to tell the story is appreciated. I'm glad I did some research before watching the movie as I would otherwise have been quite lost, so do that before starting as you'll appreciate the film even more. Ron Howard did a great job making you feel invested and immersed in the story, reliving the events of that day. The cast did a phenomenal job at portraying the real people, it's thanks to them that I was emotionally invested in the characters and events. Thirteen Lives is truly a fine film, cinematically, a must watch.",

The main narrative is focused on five members of cave rescuers from UK and Austrailia, but Howard also distributes time for a water technician with villagers, all coming together and sacrificing their livelihood and for Thailand Navy SEALs and a governor. Thai community and culture are dissolved in the movie, giving more realistic and genuine impression. The two parts of the story - foreign volunteers and solidarity within the community - are in such a harmony.Form - Setting, camera movement, lighting, and so on.. just everything. Every component of the film 'Thirteen Lives' works its part to take audience back to June in 2018 in front of TV waiting for an update on Tham Luang Cave rescue mission. After the movie, I searched internet to find out whether it was shot in the actual Tham Luang Cave or not. It turned out that they built the whole set of intricate structure of cave. Gosh so realistic that I almost believed that it was an actual cave. Camera movement sometimes following the diver's point of view or shaking hard going up and down from water level is spectacular.

A ton of books and other docs and I have seen quite a few Youtube videos about it. The Rescue (2021) is in my view essential to watch before watching the movie. It's the best doc on the subject and respects all people involved. Many docs overlook the farmers or what the other crews did. This movie clearly just follows what the doc set up. And I'd say the doc is clearly better. The movie is a bit slow and misses some proper setup for more tension. For example, the lead diver had a Thai girlfriend, but she moved back to Thailand. It was one of the great personal stories in the doc as they got back together when he came to Thailand for this rescue and they looked like a happy couple in the doc. These small things make it personal. The movie mentioned a few other small family matters, but totally ignored any stories connecting the divers to Thailand. We also never once see any village or town. So it feels like a big miss culturally. But I loved how they weren't forced to speak English. The movie legit feels true to real life.Some diving sequences were not always clearly explained. We know the Navy seals were way out of their depth, but the movie only gets into it later and not fully. Some Navy seals were actually in the cave with the kids using up crucial oxygen. Which wasn't even mentioned as a point of tension. They mention the low oxygen, but not how extremely serious it was and why it got worse. And the monsoon season coming up would have killed the boys if they weren't rescued very fast. Which also was not mentioned before the very end. This stuff only being mentioned later as it happens makes the movie feel way less exciting than the docs. In the main doc you feel the tension. You know what happens when. You also see other workers crawl into small tunnels on top of the mountain to see if they can get in that way. They can't. This shows just how much work they did and also illustrates there was only 1 way to get the 12 boys out. The movie does show all the main events, but you really need to know the story to understand why a certain early scene is actually way more crucial than it looks like in the movie.I think the romantic dating events would have added the needed personal touch and connection to the country. And then showing the local town for a short moment. I did like how the movie just presented the men as regular guys. Kinda normal, even a bit fearful middle aged men. Not good looking, not that fit, not that brave, not heroic. Just doing what they do best. It's rare you see this in a movie. And all in all it's by far the best cave diving movie I have seen with nothing else even half as good. I tried to watch all the ones I could find and many have terrible camerawork and silly unrealistic stories. This one is the first one I can fully recommend to any type of viewer. It's not just the first good cave diving movie, but also a very good movie based on a real life rescue scenario as these movies tend to be cheap and silly. This one never tries any humor or fake drama and you actually see the actors do diving scenes. I do wish they had used more 3D graphics and showed way more diving. That's frankly why we watch the movie: we want to see actual diving. Instead they gave us a few short shots of the divers in a fake cave. More than you could do 20 years ago, but way less than you can do today if you use a Gopro in a real cave system. Should have used real cave divers and picked a few good caves.Overall recommended. It's not tension filled and lacks movie magic. But if you have seen the real story already you are going to enjoy this one. If you are totally uninterested in the real story and just want a great movie, then maybe this is not for you. The movie runs long, and does feel hollow unless you can input your own emotions into it.",

            "content": "One of the most exciting rescues that they have given us in recent times is the one brought to the screen by the great Ron Howard in Thirteen Lives. The film based on the tragedy of the children of Thailand, is one of the most exciting surprises of the year and leaves the feeling that it should have been enjoyed longer in cinemas.A fairly solid recreation is the one that its director offers us about the planning and subsequent development of a rescue that seemed impossible and that ends with a satisfactory ending. Howard manages to take us at all times to the tension of being trapped in a cave for more than 20 days.The story is supported in a good way on the shoulders of Viggo Mortensen and Col\u00edn Farrell who mix well with a totally international cast. With fairly correct performances, the film manages to convey the tension and anguish that such a tragedy means.The drama grows throughout its 142-minute runtime and that is Howard's virtue that maintains the connection with the viewer throughout its duration, knowing that we all already knew the end of the story. The work that the director and cast do to bring you the reality of a tragedy in the most natural and credible way possible, allows us as viewers to always remain attentive to every detail.Technically, the work is really surprising, Howard is not limited to putting the camera as one of those who collaborate with the mission and that allows us to experience the anguish from the first person, with great sequences underwater and out of it, in addition to having always that tension on screen without ever losing track of what was at stake.The surprise ends up being that we find ourselves with a really solid and forceful film, taking the best of those films based on real events, it allows itself to maintain reality, without neglecting the fictional drama that a story brings to the cinema. A great plus achieved by his script and his direction, a story in good hands, always ends up being a good result.",

            "content": "Movies on rescue operations are always exciting whether the leader of the group is Vin Diesel or Jason Statham or Bruce Willis or Sylvester Stallone or Liam Neeson etc etc. The plot of this movie set in Thailand is slightly different in the sense that 12 teenaged soccer players with their coach are marooned in a flooded and very narrow long tunnel. This rescue presents quite a challenge in terms of planning and execution. The movie is based on true events which took place in Thailand in 2018. Two Brits ,Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farell ( experts in diving and under water rescue) have been requisitioned by the Governor of the province. They are able to reach the marooned group after wading through a kilometre of flood water, they shoot a video to show all that they are OK and report back with this info so that appropriate rescue teams can get into action.Director Ron Howard had a complex and challenging task at hand. There is no doubt that he has made an absorbing movie surmounting all hurdles of shooting under difficult conditions. However one only wishes that this 130 minutes run time could have been cropped by 30 minutes or so to give the movie a taut and smart look. Presently the scenes tend to get monotonous in the docudrama format. Cinematography of the rescue is done exceedingly well with considerable amount of underwater work. The scenes are realistically shot and tend to give you a claustrophobic feeling what with the soundtrack full of sounds of gushing water, dragging of oxygen tanks, laboured breathing etc. The scenes are palpably tense, but one wonders whether was it an overdose keeping in mind the long run time.",

It is hereafter, the known faces make their entry as a British rescuers kickstarting the rescue mission against all odds.I wished the film to have presented the survivors perspective as well along with the rescuers pov. Instead, it is all about the preparation of the rescue mission which took much of the screen time followed by the actual rescue. The final 20 odd minutes indeed were effective, pushing to the edge of the seat experience with the final rescue. But the narrative pace here is extremely slow making one ask for more dramatization of the actual event.It is still a commendable attempt nevertheless but I had higher expectations from this which it didn't meet.",

            "content": "Ron Howard has created an on-the-edge of your seat suspenseful three-and-a-half hour cinema treat that documents the story of the 12 young soccer players and their coach, trapped in a flooded cave just four short years ago. Many comparisons have been made to Apollo 13, with thousands of people rallying to help three astronauts return home in a broken spaceship, but it's a different type of story reflecting nuances and choices through the process.First, the story gets told almost entirely from the viewpoint of the parents, the British and Thai rescue dive teams, and the locals who try to divert flood water from the cave. Here and there, the movie manages to show bits and pieces of Thai/Buddhist culture from the way the coach helped the boys to meditate to cope with their ordeal to mention of the \"sleeping princess\" aspect of the mountain with the cave. Locals outside of the cave are also shown praying at various times.Viggo Mortenson and Colin Farrell portray two members of the British rescue team, but both go about their roles in a stoic, subdued manner. The actual rescue was even more treacherous than was shown in the film because the murky water in the flooded cave providing nearly zero visibility. As a certified diver myself, cave diving requires extensive training and nerves of steel and that's when the water is spring-fed clear, so this gives one a new appreciation for the brave British and Thai men who had to feel their way around the stalagtites and rock outcroppings.The delicate balance of anesthetizing the boys and the coach in order to carry them out of the cave represents as complicated a problem as the corridor control burns in Apollo 13 yet the directors wisely avoid overwhelming the viewer with the medical details. They do manage to show how harrowing the 13 rescues were. It was 13 dives through murky water lasting four to five hours long!In the end, it's a celebration of the human spirit and human ingenuity. Outside the cave, the locals also improvise pipe out of bamboo stalks to help divert water from the cave. When all the boys, the coach, and the rescue divers are accounted for, the celebration is a subdued whew of relief rather than a fist-pumping, war whooping spectacle, yet another wise choice for the production team.See it! Although, if you're claustrophobic some of the action may be hard to watch!",

Not surprised, because it's tough to follow the great 2021 NatGeo doc, The Rescue.This was a missed opportunity by Ron Howard and company. No behind scenes military discussions or strategic planning. No back stories on how families discovered or how they endured over two weeks of the unknown. Instead, we get one mother with wide eyes and one father who can't thank the authorities enough. The screenplay was childish and clich\u00e9.The true life story was intense and followed by the entire world. This movie had no build up, nothing gripping, and no grand ending. What about the 13 lives? All we got was one kid and a birthday cake. What about the collaboration between and across countries? This movie gave us nothing. No one cares about who ate the cookies.I'm giving this two stars just for the somewhat good acting from Farrell, Mortensen, and Edgerton. Too bad the production was epically poor.",

Ron Howard is back!!!!!Movie gets into the thick of things immediately and doesn't let go. It stays intense throughout while not losing the emotional and humanitarian aspect of the movie while still making sure that even though most of the movie is in a cave, we do not forget that we are in Northern Thailand bordering Myanmar and the cultural aesthetics are not forgotten.And now the performances!!!They were excellent. There was no over the top stuff here. Ron probably did a good amount of research but the pedigree he brings makes sure that the professional actors understand that they are playing professional divers who have to keep their ego in check, understand that they are in a foreign country and look at the bigger picture while not losing sight that they are here to save lives and making sure that they do not die themselves. Viggo and Colin show that sometimes showing restraint in such performances is everything. Viggo is more used to these kind of performances than Colin but both did an excellent job. The Thai actors did a good job and the kids were awesome and I am happy they made them speak Northern Thai language rather than English making their performances even more believable.Definitely 9/10.",

Also critical is the local Governor, who performs magnificently in the face of incredible pressure.The reason that it works is that the true story is so incredible and needs no embellishment.

I believe this is a respectful accurate adaptation probably one of the best I've seen as a movie. Movies based on true events tend to highly dramatize events and specific situations but this felt like a very realistic and on point re-telling of that unthinkable rescue. The locations, the editing, the camera work, the actors (Viggo amazing as always) everything just really spot on, and probably the most important aspect of all that goes against the trend of most Hollywood movies these days and I never tire to criticize, they depicted a story that take place in another country where most of the involved are Thai native and they were bold enough to not only hire Thai actors but also to have a big portion of the movie spoken in Thai.I cannot tell you the amount of frustration I have watching American productions telling stories from other countries and they decide to just keep it in English sometimes just making a weird and fake accent, it loses its essence entirely, my respect to Ron Howard to have the courage to make this, I feel this might be one of the snubs for the Academy Awards this year.",

I thought Johnny Depp was the only what I call actor (someone who takes on different roles and is totally different - unlike the Tom Hanks, Wil Smith's of this world). Colin is very talented.Anyway we all know the story, and seeing the events unfolding is moving and exciting too.Great acting by all.",

I love the underwater scenes in the cave, and the editing and cinematography really help give those scenes a sense of depth and tension, which adds greatly to this film. Overall, it's an immensely tense thrill-ride, which I think is the best film of August.",

The whole thing feels utterly authentic with the monsoon rain, mud and deluge of mountain streams - let alone the flooded cave itself (you don't question it while watching but afterwards I'm thinking - how did they do that?). Then there is the cultural context, the dramatic mountain scenery, incense and offerings, the street food and the common greeting of praying hands. The drama is also heightened by the huge cast and stellar performances from Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell - down to earth Brits, reluctant but determined volunteers, sharing custard creams. The fear and peril is palpable and the underwater diving sequences combined with the music and sound design keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. Hats off to everyone who helped get these boys out and for this fitting tribute to them all. Highly Recommend.",

Ron Howard's workman like directing is a perfect match here, eschewing any kind of deep message/subtext for a weighty verisimilitude. It's a smart choice that allows us to understand and honor what happened without piling on any unnecessary baggage. The art direction, cinematography, and score are all cinematic, but also have a sense of documentary realism to them. That realism is helped by two subtle but moving performances by Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell who play the head divers Rick Stanton and John Volanthen. I like that as the story plays out the end game of \"how are we gonna get the boys out alive\" is always haunting these two men until it becomes time to address it. If the boys weren't really sedated in the real evacuation, I'm not sure we would have believed it. This is one of those heartwarming and insightful true story films that you can't help but love.",

The scenes as they laboriously make their way through the cave system, in often claustrophobic and perilous condition, are so well filmed and show the sheer strength and determination shown by not just by the divers but the hundreds of other people, both locals and internationals, to get the best possible outcome for the boys, their anxious parents and the watching media.Colin Farrell, Virgo Mortensen and Joel Edgerton are all fantastic in this. Tom Bateman also shines in a smaller role but is amazing in a scene where the stress and exhaustion overwhelms him.Above ground, a young water engineer and an old mountain man lead a team of people in the difficult job of trying to move the heavy flowing water cascading down in the monsoon and stop it from getting through into the caves. This work played a big part in the rescue and they did brilliantly.The actors playing the Governor and Minister are excellent, as well as the Thai Navy Seal leader and his team.This film is about 2 hrs 20 mins long but is never boring, it's emotional and inspirational in it's portrayal of so many people from all walks of life who came together in a time of crisis and achieved something wonderful.",

Ferrell also just superb. And all the divers! Bravo. I was glad to see Edgerton can do more than Star Wars. He has real talent. Bateman's scene at the end, his fear, his disappointment, his relief. The struggle someone goes through to give up one life to save your own or you both die. Wry well done. I wanted to cry with him and give him a man hug.Like I said, who could give this less than 10.

I did shed a tear occasionally, but it felt manipulated and I felt dirty afterwards. When the poor farmers agreed to give up their crop, without even asking for a dime of government assistance, imagine the sacrifice! It works for a moment - it does touch the heart for a second or two - but in the back of your mind something feels off. How did they all end up on that porch? The farmers didn't ask for compensation before agreeing to give up their means of survival? The heroic governor didn't even offer?Other such fabrications, sometimes used to heighten the tension during the cave rescue - like fishing for dropped needles as the boy is waking up - seem suspiciously over-the-top.",

What was accomplished was nothing less than a miracle made possible by humans working together. I didn't get the sense of that watching this, and there is zero footage of what it might have been like for the boys inside.The location shots are nice, the diving shots are fine. The reminders on screen of the cave system and which links were which were handy. The performance by Mortensen and Farrell at least are watchable, but that reduces the interesting parts of the film to the two British divers instead of the boys that it should be about.In all I found it forgettable, though the long technical expertise of Ron Howard comes through on pacing.Skip unless you don't know the ending.",

Unfortunately, the story never really got going and apart from a few exciting underwater moments, everything seemed quite well-behaved and dialogue-heavy. Of course, the actors were (mostly) good, but why do you need 150 minutes for such a minimalist story, which also lacked any background as to who the characters are? In the end, I played with my mobile phone several times in between and had the feeling at the end that nothing would linger here. And so it is. I am disappointed.",

There is no personalization, if that makes sense.They also missed out on adding little things, like why the boys went out in the order they did, what the boys went through in that cave, etc...I highly recommend watching The Rescue, it gives detailed interviews with the divers and adds much more to the story.

He stays true to the facts and avoids unnecessary embellishments, which only adds to the sense of urgency and tension.The film does an excellent job of conveying the enormity of the challenge the rescuers faced, and the tremendous risks they took to bring the boys to safety. The sense of claustrophobia is palpable, and the cinematography is outstanding, immersing you in the dark, dank world of the caves.One thing that was striking was that the boys themselves are not given much individual characterization. But this is precisely the point: they were twelve unknown boys who suddenly became the focus of a worldwide rescue effort. By keeping the focus on the rescuers and their herculean efforts, Howard underscores the enormity of the task at hand.It truly shows testament to the courage and determination of the human spirit. It's a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and leave you feeling inspired and hopeful about our capacity for kindness and compassion in times of crisis. Highly recommend!!",

Some clown reviewing this movie on IMDB was complaining that it was too long, and they fast forwarded through parts, but I would highly recommend watching it through and through.Wow, just wow!",

It was hard to see Colin Farrell and (especially) Viggo Mortense as over-the-hill dweebs they were supposed to play, but they are exceptional actors and they depicted their characters very effectively which actually downplayed their role as heroes compared to the documentary.I recommend watching documentary about the event, \"The Rescue\", first as it is more hard-hitting and all the more so seeing the full story depicted for the first time. \"Thirteen Lives\" is a fine follow-up, almost like a \"director's cut\" of the story which delves into more detail (2.5 hours of detail) into depicting more of the surrounding players (local farmers, the families, local authorities, the boys themselves) than \"The Rescue\" (which focused more on the rescue operation).",

The acting is great, cast is brilliant and I am truly in awe of these guys did to save these 13 boys from that cave.

            "review_title": "Unity - is the key",
            "content": "The film \"Thirteen lives\" tells about a real amazing story that happened in Thailand. This story about the \"Thirteen Lives\" unfolded over 17 days in the summer of 2018 in the Tham Luang Nang Non Cave, where school-age children and their coach go for a walk.The sudden onset of the rainy season spoils the children's summer hike, putting them in danger. 13 lives of schoolchildren and their coach were at stake, risking to remain forever in the labyrinth of a water-filled cave. The probability that they would come out unharmed was getting closer to zero every day.The timing of the project takes about 2.5 hours. In the allotted time, the director decides to show the process of a special operation from 0 to successful completion. And also indirectly affecting the equally important fate of minor characters (as an immigrant parent of one of the victims).The intense plot, which director Ron Harward was able to convey, does not let go until the end, which already could not believe in the fact that the young guys were able to survive in a damp cave. Taking full responsibility for the children, the coach did not panic, taught them meditation and was able to correctly distribute the amount of food for 9 days before they were found by rescuers. Thanks to their leader, the children were unharmed, apart from physical indicators such as weakness and low temperature.The only thing that is not completed for me is that the saved characters were not revealed in the film. That is, it was not fully told and filmed how the team got into such a dead end of the cave and how they were able to find the highest point of the cave from the filled water. How and when they realized that they were stuck in a cave, and other similar questions I asked while watching. Considering that the film was made about the victims, I think the main characters were few. There was a feeling that rescuers and security services stood in 1 row compared to the final object.Overtaking all these disadvantages, the authors of the project were able to cover up the shortcomings of the work. For example, Howard successfully places accents, which keeps the viewer in constant tension and interest in what is happening on the screen. At the same time, the authors do not forget to highlight various aspects of the ongoing tragedy. Here they will show how certain services operated in those days, how numerous divers explored the cave under water, employees of other services adjusted lighting inside the cave, volunteers climbed the mountain itself to create whole water drainage systems there, which in many places went inside the mountain and thereby increased the overall level of flooding of the cave. In the footage about solving the independent work of foreign divers, I can note the selected music and color correction. These key things were able to convey an atmosphere of courage and hopelessness. The initial non-reciprocal relationship between American divers and local rescue services caused extraordinary emotions, as if their personal misunderstandings would affect the entire rescue operation. Considering how the authors emphasized the inconsistency of the saviors among themselves, in the middle of the picture I began to think about the resonance of the decision that could cause the tragedy, because it was the time they were losing that was the most important thing.The picture touches on no less important things, as due to the lack of citizenship, the child of one of the parents thought that her child might not be saved, or put on the back burner for salvation. This speaks to the existing and significant problem of how immigrants have to hide and live in fear.Also From the pros, I will note the presence in the script of all the main rescuers, the play of actors Viggo Mortensen, Vithaya Pansringarm, Tom Bateman. High-quality underwater shots that convey the complexity of movement in a cave under water.In general, the picture came out emotional, especially i can note the unity of the Thai people, the help of different states, which proves the real footage from the news, from the operation process filmed these 17 days of 2018. Comparing the articles from the news of those times and the plot of the film, I can say that everything was shot in as much detail as possible.",

As it is, this movie uses excellent story-telling devices to truly give the viewer the sense of how dangerous and difficult this rescue was. As well as to show that this wasn't the coach's fault. What they did was a common activity, and the flooding was out of season. The coach helped keep the boys calm and this certainly saved lives. And I appreciate the inclusion of the religious aspect involved, it was and is a big part of the story as it is to the lives of those people.

Unfortunately, this film is longer than a Chick Fil A drive thru. I wanted to love it, but found myself having to rewind when dozing off through constant dialogue. Its not that the writing was poor, the writing was solid, but wow there was alot of screen time donated to filled rooms with briefings and planning, etc. At times it felt like film Daeja vu. Back to the drawing board, back to the cave, back to the drawing board, back to the cave. I recommend parting it out to 2 or 3 segments to not lose interest because this film is still worth a full watch due to solid story, solid acting and some cinematography tossed in as well. I also applaud the display of how they represented the various cave locations; it was well done to where you didn't get to lost in various cave locations yourself, the movie keeps you informed of whats happening when and where (its a big cave!)There are moments of excitement for sure. The pro dive squad carried that wave in my opinion, and also just hearing \"diving talk' was cool in and of itself. I have the respect of the directors for keeping the narrative as accurate to the reality of the real event that it was, but the predicability and knowing that pretty much, folks are going to attempt saves and run into challenges, wasn't enough to make me say woooah, and instead more like \"saw that coming.\" The biggest twist and turns of this feature unfortunately came from the cave itself. A great workweek watch, but I don't recommend canceling weekend plans over it!",

They survive initally for 10 days before anyone can even sight them in the caves. Then a rescue mission is mounted, primarliy by two English divers, to get them out.

            "content": "The true tale of rescuing the trapped 13 Thai boys in the summer of 2018 is turned into an engrossing and often thrilling if overly long 2022 movie experience thanks to director Ron Howard and a dedicated crew bringing to vivid life the harrowing drama. I was vaguely aware of this story as it played out originally, though missed the critically acclaimed documentary The Rescue from last year that covered the same material, but watching the movie I realize I knew very little of the actual horror. The movie centers around a pair of English divers (Colin Farrell, Viggo Mortensen), both with over 30 years of specific cave diving experience, helping the Thai Navy Seals and government officials to find and save the missing children and their coach. The submerged path is one that lasts about seven hours, and it's narrow, dark, and treacherous, easy to lose your way. when you only have a tank of air, navigation is the difference between life and death. It's also a race against time as the monsoon waters are flooding the cave further. The cave traversal sequences are nerve-wracking and deeply immersive, enough so that even I, while watching, started sitting on the edge of my couch in the safety of my own home. The story isn't entirely centered on our two heroic white guys, as the screenplay by William Nicholson (Gladiator) widens the focus onto many who contributed to the boys eventual rescue, from an engineer who realized they needed to dam water drainage at the top of a mountain, to the locals who agreed to have their crops flooded for the possibility of saving the kids, to the bravery of the Thai Seals, to the hope and burdens of the parents. I never knew the boys had to literally be anesthetized to be removed, and the ensuring climax as the rescue team keeps tabs on how their precious cargo is responding during the multi-hour journey underwater. Howard keeps things pretty straightforward and helpfully provides onscreen graphics to better provide a sense of distance within the cave, which just makes the heroics even more dizzying. Thirteen Lives is an inspiring story about the world coming together for common cause (except Elon Musk, who baselessly accused one of the divers as being a \"pedo\") and it's also genuinely exciting even when you know they all make it out alive, which is its own credit. It might have used some tightening up for pacing, but it's a well-made dramatization that pays real homage to the many heroes without overplaying its drama.\n\nNate's Grade: B+",

So first of all, this movie needs to get some technical academy award nominations, at least for sound, incredible work. The VFX in this movie are invisible, the cinematography is pretty good, the production design is incredible and the camerawork is fantastic. I thought Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell did an incredible job as the cave divers, as well as the rest of the cast, it really didnt feel like a movie, more like a documentary of the rescue mission. The movie really tries to respect the divers, family and everyone else involved in the rescue of the football time and sometimes that hurts the characters and the dialog a bit, but for this situation i can understand it. Overall an impactfull technical movie, with of course an story which will forever be incredible.",

Hollywood has never much cared for him. He's had just one nomination as director for Frost/Nixon. I think this is because you don't watch a Ron Howard movie and think \"Ah, this is clearly a Ron Howard movie\". He's just quietly professional. He doesn't leave his own mark on the way the story is told. He tells the story the way he feels it should be told, which is different each time. I wish more directors were like Ron Howard. Just professional. Far too many directors are trying to be the next bit thing, the next Scorsese, Coppola, and failing. There's much to be said for just doing a great job.\n\nIn this film Ron Howard tells the story as a straight docu-drama. There is a bit of the old \"shaky-cam\" going on which by now everybody detests, but it seems to  fade into the background over time. This is a big, big story and with 10,000 people involved there are far too many people with stories to tell in a movie that is 2 and a half hours long. Consequently the action tends to focus on the British and Australian divers, who with expertise gained from similar rescues were able to pull off a seemingly impossible task of raising these boys from the depths of the mountain through 3 hours of crawling through underground tubes of rock filled with water. It really brings home the impossibility of these boys having survived in this underground bubble of air in the first place, as well as the impossibility of bringing them to the surface as more rain threatens to come and flood the cave entirely. \n\nAccording to reports, the film is entirely accurate except for one detail - it shows the cave water as being clear. This is obviously for the purposes of showing the underwater action as the divers, boys and air cylinders are squeezed through the tiniest of gaps, but it is certainly worth noting that the apparently impossible rescue was carried out in water so thick with mud that the divers lights were almost useless as they could see absolutely nothing. With that in mind the diver Vern was more crucial to the rescue than suggested in the film, with his pre-prepared divers map being the only thing that indicated where the divers in the flooded cave would be going. \n\nThere is one twist in the tale that I wasn't aware of. We were told at the time that the boys were taught how to use diving equipment and then swam out of the cave themselves. That, it turns out, was not the case, and the story at the time was a cover for what actually happened. \n\nColin Farrell and Viggo Mortensen do an unbelievable job of portraying divers Rick Stanton and John Volanthen and I have no doubt that is exactly as Mr Stanton and Mr Volanthen are as people. \n\nA fantastic true-life story and filmed exactly as it should've been filmed by Ron Howard. Worth watching by everybody. Don't be put off by the long running time - it felt like half the time when the story unfolded.",

I feared a film like this, telling a genuinely remarkable true story which we all know  - would play to the worst of those. The reverse is true. It brings out the best in Howard and those around him; it's understated in the best ways, there's a lack of sentimentality which makes it all the more moving, and it's success stems at least in part from an unpredictable creative decision which pays off well. Movies about disasters like to - need to, in fact - lay on a spectacular disaster. This doesn't show us any of that - perhaps because the involvement of children might have made it somehow exploitative  - and instead focuses on the widespread relief effort and the emotional toll on those involved. Most impressively it eschews a classic trap of these films - there is not a hint of the white saviour about all this. The breadth of those involved is always well portrayed, and no one person is in charge or more heroic than anyone else. Local customs, rituals and religion are to the fore. It packs a subtly powerful emotional punch, and it speaks to something deeper by choosing a path less often trod by these sorts of films.",

It made the story fresh and even more should keep the viewer on the edge of their seat.  The stars all do what you expect, but it's Ron Howard and his ability to tell a story in a way that everyone can enjoy that make this entertaining and not just repetitive.  He just gets how to make a movie and with a real drama that stands alone, like this one, Howard's skill shines even more.  While it could have been shaved closer to 2-hours (the film drags at times), you're rewarded with a paint by numbers charmer in the 3rd act.  Final Score: 8/10",

It's a gripping, intense and emotionally charged film of an incredible true story\u2026 however when considering the documentary that came before this\u2026 that was a better account of events. Hell, the only reason this movie really works and was so gripping and emotional is because it was a true story. It's just amazing to see what the human spirit can do, but the movie rides off the emotions of the true story and does nothing really creative itself. There's nothing to explore character-wise, and it plays literally like a dramatized version of the documentary. It's fine and good, it does work and it has impact, I just didn't think it was as strong as it could be, especially considering the incredible documentary made on this subject. The movie is also way too long, it didn't need to be 2.5 hours. I liked Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell's performances, and Ron Howard's direction is good (not as good as he used to be though). Overall it's a decent re-telling of an incredible true story. It's worth a watch, especially if you'd rather watch a narrative film over a documentary, and while I think the documentary is better, it's undeniable that this does do a good job telling the story and making you feel it's impact.",

The ensuing rescue mission that lasted over 2 weeks has now earned a Hollywood dramatization, capably directed by Ron Howard, which depicts how the rescuers, in particular a bunch of predominantly British cave-diving volunteers (underplayed by Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell) who have the necessary skills to navigate the treacherous underground/water terrains and who also hatch a risky plan to transport them back to safety. The film is a surprisingly tense though straightforward and conventional 2\u00bd hours that is restraint enough to convey the frustration and pressure involved without resorting to hysteria or melodrama; and sensitive and inclusive enough not to be just another portrayal of the Caucasian heroes coming in to save the day. Diligently recreating the claustrophobic and dangerous conditions the rescuers face, they've managed to make rainwater and undercurrents into a visual peril that the audience can understand and appreciate by showing the extensive damage it can cause or the consequences of either inexperience or just bad luck under the circumstances. Tension is further ramped up with visual aids that pop up intermittently at crucial moments to inform us precisely of the time and geography of each critical manoeuvre. Howard has proven success with the similar Apollo 13, where the outcome is already known to most viewers, yet it's the details we learn that aren't previously known that make it engaging and tense; and our knowledge of how it turned out works somewhat in its favour in the end, as we feel safe enough to enjoy the film without feeling guilty that we're simply indulging in disaster porn.",

It loses 1 half a point because it ignores the faith based component of the rescue, specifically the transcendental meditation used by the boys to survive without food for ELEVEN DAYS.

Its well made and certainly is quite tense and gripping at times, even though viewers will likely know the ultimate outcome. I reckon if your prone to claustrophobia then this is best avoided, as I felt it was quite atmospheric and they don't shy away from portraying the perilous situation the kids (and their coach) found themselves in. \n\nI found myself respecting the decisions and actions of the various cave rescue workers/volunteers, given what they were putting on the line and having to think up new solutions, or potential solutions, to try and rescue those stuck alive. I can only imagine how frustrating it must have been for the series of events that happens, the relationship between the volunteers/specialists and the media circus that gathers. Its a sobering watch and it'd be hard not to feel sorry, to one extent or another, to people in both sides of the proverbial camps I feel. It is a long film and I did feel less engaged at times, which maybe says more about my attention span than anything else (I'm annoyingly easily distracted at times). I noticed it often states on screen a duration and location, relating to where, I assume, the workers were - it didn't make sense to me initially that it seemed to say, for example, '8 hours 15 minutes' as if thats how long said 13 people had been stuck there, when I knew there were foreign helpers attempting to reach them - it would likely have taken over 8 hours for some of them to have reached the local area. That's perhaps my fault for not paying as much attention as I should have.\n\nI note that at first the British cave rescue helpers/workers were almost laughing off the situation in Thailand, which is frustrating to view. There's a sentiment (almost precisely these words) about 'well if they managed to get there, surely they can get themselves back out again as well' (seriously, its as simple as that?!). I can't comment how exaggerated or not that was - quite probably those used to working in different sorts of rescue scenarios may shrug off such an incident, given it wasn't (it'd seem) a situation that often happens.\n\nRon Howard has done well to treat the story with respect, I feel and I appreciate that the film does feature a fair amount (not exclusively but a fair bit) of the local language (Thai) and that there are numerous Thai characters, rather than it being entirely a list, Hollywood and British actors on screen. I think if this story intrigues you and the cast interests you then yes, I'd recommend this.",

Also not shown were the 110 Thai Navy Seals and divers from around the world who had tried and failed to reach the boys before the expert cave divers were called in.\n\nOverall, a superb film about an incredible true story.",

That would've been crazy to see what they have done to survive. I highly doubt all they did was mediate for days. It's kinda crazy to think that these kids have the discipline for how many days again? Is it 10 days? Anyway it was a long long time and if I had to do that, I highly doubt I could. Those kids have guts. But again it would've been better if it was through their perspective or if it switched between them and the adults. In the end this is a great movie and I highly recommend.",

Too bad it was a day late and a dollar short.\n\nI may have not minded as much if the 147 min runtime was chopped down to around 90-100 mins, but with the slow pacing, this was just too long and dragged out.\n\nSure, excellent cinematography, and amazing casting and performances, but nothing new or different from the docu-film The Rescue, which was just as well shot, and felt more authentic with the actual real-life rescuers and kids - and only 107 mins long.\n\nI guess if you haven't seen the docu-film, you may enjoy this one more if you can sit through repetitive and slow dive scenes, and dull, drab, emotionless and uninspiring story-telling, with only Hollywood-styled impressive camera-work to look forward to. Howard's Blueberry Hill's thrill was 301 days too late and $55M too much.",

I also appreciate that the movie isn't just about the British Cavers and that the movie gives a lot of focus to what the Thai people die as well.

I was also surprised by the cast, I didn't know who was in it, and was pleasantly surprised to see Colin Farrell, and Viggo Mortensen, who both transformed into the characters, and were not immediately recognizable. Thankfully Amazon has that awesome feature that tells you the cast members when you hit pause. Anyway the movie was absolutely perfect. I was nervous for much of the movie, even though I thought I knew the outcome. Great performances by all, great cinematography, and direction. 13 Lives is definitely a MUST SEE",

Director Ron Howard has helmed this \"narrative\" version that features actors in the re-creation. There is some attention paid to the plight of families and authorities in Thailand, but most of the focus is on the English cave divers who led the effort (played by Colin Farrell, Viggo Mortensen & Joel Edgerton). While this version goes into more deeply into the fascinating procedure, it's also 2.5 hours long. Howard has told the story effectively, but there's surprisingly little emotion on display (the doc did it better). Still, if you haven't \"dived\" into the deets of this incident, it's an incredible true story of determination.",

The film based on the tragedy of the children of Thailand, is one of the most exciting surprises of the year and leaves the feeling that it should have been enjoyed longer in cinemas.\n\nA fairly solid recreation is the one that its director offers us about the planning and subsequent development of a rescue that seemed impossible and that ends with a satisfactory ending. Howard manages to take us at all times to the tension of being trapped in a cave for more than 20 days.\n\nThe story is supported in a good way on the shoulders of Viggo Mortensen and Col\u00edn Farrell who mix well with a totally international cast. With fairly correct performances, the film manages to convey the tension and anguish that such a tragedy means.\n\nThe drama grows throughout its 142-minute runtime and that is Howard's virtue that maintains the connection with the viewer throughout its duration, knowing that we all already knew the end of the story. The work that the director and cast do to bring you the reality of a tragedy in the most natural and credible way possible, allows us as viewers to always remain attentive to every detail.\n\nTechnically, the work is really surprising, Howard is not limited to putting the camera as one of those who collaborate with the mission and that allows us to experience the anguish from the first person, with great sequences underwater and out of it, in addition to having always that tension on screen without ever losing track of what was at stake.\n\nThe surprise ends up being that we find ourselves with a really solid and forceful film, taking the best of those films based on real events, it allows itself to maintain reality, without neglecting the fictional drama that a story brings to the cinema. A great plus achieved by his script and his direction, a story in good hands, always ends up being a good result.",

When the cave started flooding in from the heavy rain. And a few experienced cave divers are at a race against time to figure out a way to get the kids out. Good plot. Ron Howards direction is good. Showing a rescue team on a desperate search on trying to rescue the kids. Before they lose the air in the caves or starvation. The script did not focus on the kids as much when they were stuck in the caves. Or there struggle on trying to dig there way out which was briefly discussed. The film does show the rescue teams desperate search for solutions on getting into the cave and out with the kids safely. Colin Farrell, Viggo Mortensen, and Joel Edgerton all did great with their roles. The film does get a bit of a thrill and suspense during the rescue mission. It definitely is one of those strong powerful films about survival.",

Interesting for viewers with little to no knowledge of what happened, but the question remains as to whether it adds anything truly significant to the documentary The Rescue about the same 18 days of suffering, anxiety, and uncertainty.\n\nMassive praise for the worthy amount of screentime of the Thai language.\"",

Little moments are peppered throughout that really show each character's humanity in a way that is very touching. The bad: It's just too long at 140 minutes.

However, as capably made as this picture is, its overlong 2:29:00 runtime can try the patience of viewers at times, especially when some of it sequences become drawn out and repetitive. This is by no means intended to diminish the uplifting nature of the story or the adeptness with which it has been produced cinematically, but, given the emphasis on the picture's technical merits, this approach to telling the tale tends to shortchange its tremendous emotional impact.  A journalistically styled by-the-numbers take on telling a story like this is fine, but I was hoping for something a little more heartfelt in light of the miracle this epically heroic yarn turned out to be. \"Thirteen Lives\" definitely earns a passing grade, but I can't help but wonder what it might have been with a little more emotion \u2013 and a lot more heart-tugging.",

Personally, I'd recommend the documentary, which was not only engaging but realistic without all the unnecessary dramatization that you get from Thirteen Lives. What I didn't like mostly about the Thirteen Lives were the emphasis on drama over the actual rescue mission and how they actually did the rescue, as well as the mediocre acting of some Thai actors, which was baffling as they were pretty well known actors in the Thai industry. When I watched The Rescue, I actually felt like I was there with the divers every step of the way. Thirteen Lives does not really reveal all the interesting details during the dive, the rescue plan and the actual rescue as much as The Rescue, so if you are looking for something realistic, entertaining and educational, go for The Rescue (2021).",

But what really elevates this movie is the overwhelming inspiration that you just can't help but feel as you watch these events unfold. It's a story of people from all over the world coming together and putting their own selves aside in order to save lives. This film shows us the beauty of humanity, which is especially resonate today. The story of the Tham Luang cave rescue is an incredible one, and it's not always easy to translate real life events like this into film. But I think that this movie absolutely delivered and brings a thrilling, emotional, and deeply inspirational film that highlights what true heroes look like in the real world. It might be a bit long, and it starts to get a little repetitive with the diving scenes. I also wish that we could've gotten some more time with the kids while they were stranded in the cave.

The storyline is action-packed and extremely suspenseful. It felt like my heart was racing a million miles a minute while I watched it.  \n \nThirteen Lives takes us on the journey of twelve boys and their soccer coach getting stuck in the Tham Luang cave in northern Thailand. The boys wanted to visit the cave; however, little did they know that there was an approaching monsoon that would soon after flood the entire cave. People from all over the world were watching their rescue attempt with the many challenging obstacles they had to overcome. Will someone find them inside the cave? If they do, will the boys get out of the cave in time before they starve, or run out of oxygen?\n \nThe acting in this film is phenomenal. The portrayal of these young boys, their coach and their rescuers is so believable that you feel like you are there along with them. The cast includes Colin Farrell as John Volanthen, Viggo Mortensen as Richard Stanton, Joel Edgerton as Richard Harris and Tom Bateman as Chris Jewell. The production team, led by director Ron Howard also delivered. The way the film is made makes you feel like you're actually in the cave with the rescue workers. It took a lot of effort and coordination, which is very impressive. Over 5,000 people, including cave divers, doctors, rescuers, Navy SEALS, farmers and others contributed to helping the boys. They put their own lives at risk to help the boys and their coach, whom they didn't even know! Without those people playing a part in this rescue who knows if they would have saved them. My favorite part is when the farmers give up their crops so water can flood them and divert the water from going into the cave. It took a lot of heroism and sacrifice to lose their entire crop in order to give the boys a better chance of surviving.\n \nThe message of this film is that working together is essential. You should be aware that there is a lot of blood in some scenes and there is some bad language used a couple of times.\n \nI give Thirteen Lives 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. This film releases in select theaters on July 29, 2022, and starts streaming on Prime Video August 5, 2022. By Sydney S., KIDS FIRST!",

It was an inspiring story that moved people around the globe, and director Ron Howard has now brought it to life in a technically masterful re-creation. However, as capably made as this picture is, its overlong 2:29:00 runtime can try the patience of viewers at times, especially when some of it sequences become drawn out and repetitive. This is by no means intended to diminish the uplifting nature of the story or the adeptness with which it has been produced cinematically, but, given the emphasis on the picture's technical merits, this approach to telling the tale tends to shortchange its tremendous emotional impact. A journalistically styled by-the-numbers take on telling a story like this is fine, but I was hoping for something a little more heartfelt in light of the miracle this epically heroic yarn turned out to be. \"Thirteen Lives\" definitely earns a passing grade, but I can't help but wonder what it might have been with a little more emotion \u2013 and a lot more heart-tugging.",

The world needs to band together more often like these guys did. All courageous heros in my book.",

Didn't tell us about the lives of the divers or soccer team before hand. Even though the British accents from Viggo and Colin were basically half Australian, they seemed good enough for the job but they were not directed enough to give an impactful performance and all the interactions between the divers fell flat. The underwater and cave diving footage was quite well done but still even that could have been done with more precision as there was never enough context given as to the situation inside and out of the cave and there was not enough clarity of which diver you were watching or the ultimate goal of what the diver was supposed to be doing.You also never truly felt the claustrophobia of what the dive would have been like as the water was mostly crystal clear with the scary sections basically amounting to getting stuck, and you never truly felt the fear, even when the Navy seal drowns because the pacing was off and there was no music to accompany it. It also seemed like they got through the cave too quickly the first time which made all subsequent expeditions feel less impactful. The constant heads up display of the location inside the cave didn't do anything to help us understand the distances and time involved, and more than that actually took you out of the realism. The way Nat Geo did this was far more insightful. They could have used aerial shots of the mountains or CGI of the cave to show how far it was for them to go but all they give you is a white line with a red dot. They could easily have fit in showing us the boys go into the cave which would have showed us how big the cave us and given them a chance to introduce them as actual characters.I will give points that the final sequence had the anxiety levels up, however when the divers come out at the end, two of the three Thai divers come out together and then the last after and it seemed like only two had come out and then everyone was celebrating while you were left without closure, which made it so the most crucial part of the film - the sigh of relief - never comes. After this, the movie abruptly ends with the boys waving to their mothers in the hospital. We don't see Rick Stanton meet his wife or see the divers get knighted or the Australian diver return home.Overall the movie is a missed opportunity to expand beyond what the documentary told us. None of the characters are fleshed out, there is no main character, no supporting cast. Just a bunch of actors who fill in for real people, all participating in the aimless goal of retelling a story that was already told more succinctly and in far more detail and impact before in the National Geographic documentary. Apparently a film called 'the Cave' was already made in 2019 and by watching the trailer shows the divers lives before hand. I would watch that or the Nat Geo documentary if you want a more detailed and interesting depiction.",

This film succeeds in giving me an appreciation for everyone involved in this rescue. Ron Howard delivers a gripping dramatization of the story and manages to keep it suspenseful, despite knowing the resolution. I also appreciate that the movie isn't just about the British Cavers and that the movie gives a lot of focus to what the Thai people die as well.
