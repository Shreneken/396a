Though it is a remake of a Tamil film of the same name, it is indeed a mass entertainer.Hritik Rohan and Saif Ali Khan have delivered strong performances. For the first 10 to 15 minutes, I thought 'what is going on in the movie?' but the movie takes a grip just after that.With a very engaging storyline, strong acting by the lead actors, and top-notch direction, this is a very good movie.I haven't seen the original one, so I think I'm not well qualified to compare the original one to this one. Still, I can guarantee you that if you haven't seen the original one, you will enjoy this one very much.",

            "content": "The duo of Pushkar and Gayathri have enthralled audiences in the South, first with their original smash hit Tamil film \"Vikram Vedhan (2017)\" and now most recently with the hit Amazon prime series \"Suzhal (2022)\". But to make a smooth transition into the tumultuous world of Bollywood is a mean ask but the two capable filmmakers pass the test with flying colours, delivering a faithful remake of the cult classic, enhanced by the unmistakeable swag of superstar Hrithik Roshan.Roshan stars as the titular \"Vedha\" a ferocious gangster terrorizing the streets of Lucknow. Saif Ali Khan plays \"Vikram\", the trigger-happy encounter specialist cop leading the task force assigned with curbing the gangsters of the city. Although both actors don't the same range as the ace performers in the original film, namely National Award winner Vijay Sethupathi and R Madhavan, the directors smartly pivot the character to play to these actors' strengths. The confrontation sequences between the gangster and the cop are laced with mass and gravitas, with Hrithik especially excelling in the stunt sequences with his agility and panache.The gritty, serpentine streets of Lucknow are depicted in painstaking detail as the makers transpose the impact that Chennai had in the original movie, to a North Indian context. The storyline sticks to the original but with Hrithik's version of Vedha coming across as wackier, more gung-ho and fanatical than the smoother, more reserved depiction by Vijay Sethupathi.Bollywood remakes of South blockbusters seldom rise to meet the standards of their original versions. Ajay Devgn's \"Drishyam (2015)\" and Shahid Kapoor's \"Kabir Singh (2019)\" stand at one end of the spectrum, having delivered while most remakes end up in the trash pile, case in point being dismal efforts like \"Force (2011)\", \"Rowdy Rathore (2012)\" and \"Bhaagi 2 (2018)\". Thankfully, due to the deft direction of Pushkar-Gayathri and earnest performances from the two lead actors, \"Vikram Vedha\" ends up in the former category, as a faithful remake that also stands apart with its contextualized take on the Vikramaditya-Betaal folktale. A recommended watch in theatres!",

If you have seen the original, this will surprise you with its twists and turns. The director duo Pushkar and Gayatri has done an excellent job again, after delivering a blockbuster Vikram Vedha in Tamil and one of the best thriller series Suzhal: The Vortex, they are back and given another impressive film to the Hindi audience.The pace of the film in the first 20 minutes is a bit slow but the movie gathers its pace once Hrithik Roshan enters the screen and you won't be able to leave your seat when both the lead actors are on the screen. The second half is, even more, engaging with its taut screenplay. The dialogue, cinematography, and the climax are other highlights of the film.The songs are just average. All the fight scenes are stylishly choreographed. Apart from the perfect direction and remarkable performance, the background score and writing are the film's biggest strengths. The intelligent writing surprises you at regular intervals.The script has given equal importance to both the lead actors and does not let one overshadow the other. Hrithik Roshan has done complete justice to the character of Vedha and delivers outstanding performances. Saif Ali Khan also gave a noteworthy performance. Radhika Apte, Sharib Hashmi, Rohit Saraf, and other supporting casts have done a decent job.Direction 4/5\nActing 3.5/5\nEditing 3/5\nStory 3.5/5\nScreenplay 3.5/5.",

The director deserves standing ovation for keeping the narrative tight and engaging.Saif ali khan is superb as cool, composed yet mysterious cop! Radhika apte has small but effective role,But it's the one man Hrithik roshan who will outshine everyone with his finest act! The actor always challenges himself to outdo his last one. Here he is ruthless yet sensitive. Although initially the dialect may sound like Super30 but it doesn't hamper. With in 5 mins you are in his world. Outstanding act.It is little more violent but not nonsense. The logic doesn't go for toss! Recommended.",

I'll congrats the directors Pushkar & Gayatri who had directed the 1st one also and has directed the remake too and I can honestly say that they have done a brilliant job. The storytelling of this movie is so unique and different that it felt like we are watching episodes wise and that is really cool. Movie will keep you engaged till the end of the scene and the suspense that they built throughout the movie even the audience can't judge who's the killer and that was perfectly done. HRITIK ROSHAN is the soul of the movie. Another best performance by him. The accent that he has carried throughout the film was just amazing. SAIF ALI KHAN is the backbone of the movie he keeps investigate till he reach to the results. Both the lead actors have done a tremendous job and its amazing to watch both of them on screen. Rest of the cast was average but they performed well too. Best part of the movie is the climax totally surprisable. Movie could've been trimmed little bit in the start but still it'll kept you engaged till the end of it. Bgm & songs are delight to watch. Specially BGM is fantastic.So if you haven't watched the original then don't waste a single minute go to the theatres and experience this perfect thriller. You will be satisfied....",

            "content": "The OG 2017 movie was a brilliant movie (Screenplay!! \ud83d\ude2e ) so, when the remake was announced, they had my curiosity. When they announced Hrithik was gonna play Vedha, they had my attention.Now that the remake is out, is it good? Is it better than the Tamil versions? Read on.First off, this is how you do remakes. Bollywood has fallen off over the past several years with the remakes (let alone the horrible originals) but this one was very well done. Is it because the directors were the same? Dunno. Doesn't have to be the case, but I'm sure it helped. Pretty much a frame-to-frame so perhaps, there wasn't much to change from a brilliant movie to begin with. Of course, cultural elements had to be altered to set the film in Kanpur/Lucknow.Vedha - I really liked how understated Vijay Sethupathi's Vedha was. Now, is that the character's meant to be? Or was it his personality shining through Vedha? I think it's the latter and whoever played this role would have made it their own and played it different. Hrithik's Vedha, on the other hand, was anything but understated, and given his personality, you can see why. Not that one's better than the other, both versions are just different.Vikram - Contrary to Vedha, I don't think Vikram could have had a lot of variation, I might be wrong. Saif played the role well, but I thought the internal conflict was better done by Madhavan. There were certain nuances and expressions that I was looking for, that were absent in the remake.Supporting Cast - The Tamil version had a lot of screen-space for everybody, both good and bad, other than the lead. The actors did a better job in delivering the limited time they were given, especially Vikram Prasanna as Ravi. Babloo bhiaya didn't feel as villainous. Didn't care as much for the brother and Chandra in this one. The cops were...so so.I always wondered why Madhavan wasn't cast as Vikram in the Hindi remake, or why someone else wasn't cast as Vedha in the Tamil version. I think having two actors of equal star power helped the 2017 movie but even though Hrithik shined in the new one, I felt that this shine might have taken some spotlight off the rest of the cast and the film itself.As a standalone movie, the hindi version is a breath of fresh air for Bollywood. For people who've not watched the original, this will be a feast. People who've seen the 2017 version, you'll still think 2022 is good but will say it's missing minor things here and there which made the OG the brilliant movie it was.",

            "review_title": "Pushkar-Gayathri Recreated Their Magic Again, Vikram Vedha is a Sure-Shot Terrific Masala Entertainer !!!",
            "content": "Crafted out of the Tamil hit of the same name, 'Vikram Vedha' is a neo-noir action thriller which is rooted in Betaal Pachhisi, a popular Indian folktale. Vikram, a top-billed officer of the Lucknow Police Special Task Force (STF), is assigned to find and kill gangster Vedha Betaal. However, Vedha surrenders himself to the police. During interrogation, he starts narrating stories to Vikram, which slowly start changing the latter's own perception of good and evil.Conceptually, the film has been written and throughout really well. Almost everything, even little props and minor satellite characters that play out in the film have relevance to the central plot. The directors, Pushkar and Gayathri, also the writers of the film, make it a point to leave the story's flow to the two central characters after establishing them sufficiently. Vikram and Vedha's parts have been written with a kind of finer detailing that works at so many levels. Like Vedha's love for Raj Kapoor songs, which has been used in action scenes. It's impressive how nuanced things like these have been woven into the narrative.Nearly, everything ties up neatly at the end, without much wastage. The exception here is the track of a prominent character like Parshuram bhaiyya who is still out there with his minions. It's left unfinished, though you keep hoping that it would tie up somewhere to the central plot at the end. The writers also could have focussed a little more on Chanda and Shatak's (Yogita Bihani and Rohit Saraf) love story which gives rise to a pivotal conflict in the film. You also yearn to experience a little more of Vikram, and dwell some more on how Vedha became as powerful as he is.In terms of execution, the film offers a degree of freshness, and stays true to its world. Even with a non-linear narrative, it's not tough to keep a track of the story's movement and the characters. Yes, the proceedings do feel slow at times, and the climax feels a tad stretched. But the film delivers on a host of accounts. Like the action scenes have been choreographed really well. Like the pre-interval action sequence where the police are combing an area for Vedha, and how he escapes to a container yard is quite slickly done. The use of Lucknow as a setting is quite neat. The film has a smattering of delicious local flavours - from the food to the bylanes to the neighbourhoods. The film's music album is above average. The Alcholia track becomes even better with Hrithik dancing in the video, but you wonder if it was really required.In terms of balance, the film tilts towards Vedha's character, which has been performed excellently by Hrithik. He's menacing, ruthless and yet, extremely emotional in parts. He imbibes the vibe of the character really well. He's effortlessly convincing as Vedha. You can't help but notice the dialect which reminds you of the actor from his Super 30 avatar; that needed a little more attention.Saif as an honest cop, who thinks he knows what's right and wrong, perfectly compliments Hrithik on screen. He's in control of his body language, he embraces the character's inner strengths, vulnerabilities and depicts the gradual change in his thinking really well. Yes, one would have loved to see a little more of Saif in the story. The actor is in his classic good form here, but he needed a little more to chew on. Ditto for Radhika Apte, who plays Vikram's wife, Priya.To sum up, Pushkar-Gayathri, the writer-directors of the film, have pretty much stuck to the blue-print they created for the original, including the way they weave in the elements of folklore in it. It's a plus that they haven't changed the roadmap too much. But they've also not tried revisiting the elements that they had at hand to make the redux better than the original. And yet, this one's worth a ride to the big screen.",

            "content": "Even though it follows the original storyline with unwavering faith and is helmed by the same writers and directors, the Hindi version of Vikram Vedha is, on paper, not a Xerox copy of the 2017 Tamil film. While R. Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi played cop versus gangster in the grey-toned metropolitan clutter of modern Chennai, the Hindi Vikram Vedha is set in Lucknow and Kanpur, which directors Pushkar-Gayatri depict as peak, north Indian exotica: Mughal architecture; a palette of saturated, warm colours; labyrinthine slums with brightly-painted buildings; Ram leela actors and explosive Dussehra celebrations in the background; Hrithik Roshan prowling with his trademark, feline grace in the foreground. Technically, all this should serve to make the Hindi Vikram Vedha look and feel different from the original. Yet barring Roshan's solo action sequences, there are few moments in this remake that don't make you nostalgic for the original.Read the full review at filmcompanion.in.",

This movie doesn't disappoint the first time watcher however to the people who have watched original there is nothing new. Saif as vicky has pulled a good act however hritik sometimes looks like he is mimicking. Radhika's talent however I felt like wasted she is not a prop but not a strong character either.some of the scenes between radhika and saif looks artificial.The story premise is well crafted and loosely adapted from vikram betaal is itself an interesting move. As the story is unique, the story shows there is nothing such as right or wrong.Interesting movie might do good. Recommendation: a one time watch.",

Hritik as vedha is his best combination of acting and star power since agneepath,Absolutely electric. The story keeps you hooked up till the end with lots of twist and turns. I did watch the original one but they nailed it all over again with this. Saif ali khan gets a great role and knocks it out of the park.

            "content": "After 3 years, Hrithik returns to the big screen with a Crime Thriller that tests the boundaries of Good & Evil. Taking inspiration from Vetal Panchavimshati which put forth complex tales of morality, the film pits two heavyweights against each other with the backdrop of Lucknow Gang Culture. On one side is Vikram, an Encounter specialist who believes there is a definite line that separates good and evil people And on the other side is Vedha, an unhinged gangster who is not so sure about that line. Remake of a very popular Tamil film, this takes more of a larger than life commercial approach. Screenplay is full of intriguing scenes and revelations. Hrithik is phenomenal as Vedha, showing many shades of him with equal mastery. Saif Ali Khan provides a solid opposition to him. The supporting cast is really good also. The score is amazing and is highlight of the film. The action scenes bar one, are very stylized and full of slow mo which didn't do justice to the overall tone of the film. Some scenes had weak writing also. Overall a very enjoyable movie with some flaws, headed by an absolutely mesmerizing Hrithik Performance.",

Presented as a hindi remake of the 2017 blockbuster of the same name which I have missed intentionally. Pushkar-Gayathri's film is a refreshing take on the battle between right and wrong, told flamboyantly through two fine actors. The characters development is beautifully done and are extremely well fleshed out. The thumping background score, the raw and hard-hitting action set pieces and well laid plot all boils down to making Vikram Vedha the much needed push for the masses to go to theatres.Both Saif and Hrithik have given superlative performances and are brilliant throughout. Saif as Vikram, a rough, strong headed police officer who sleeps well thinking he hasn't killed any innocent man and Hrithik as Vedha a self righteous gangster who thinks he does the right thing always. Instead of playing a Greek god, Hrithik, for once, attempts an Indian anti-hero in a larger-than-life scenario and consistently delivers, both in terms of performance as well as screen presence.Overall, Vikram Vedha is for the masses and a worthy big screen entertainer. A true commercial extravaganza which offers a gritty style of storytelling, powerhouse lead performances in addition to their screen presence, a chest-thumping score and exceptional one liners. Even if you have seen the original, you won't want to miss such a badass bollywood flick .",

However, the one thing I can definitely vouch for - is that this is one of the worst ways of adapting movies that I have seen in recent times. All the doubts and scepticism about and if the film will do justice to the original can be well justified with this movie.More often than not, makers go textbook and pin out scenes not effectively making it suitable for the new target audience you are catering to. With this movie, actors and directors have successfully failed. Not only does the film become extreme headache with the subtle nuances but they are done with such unfitness and thought that it flows with all difficulties. Bad acting has affected the story or making sanitised but important changes to the more complex subjects from the original - it is indeed worst. Fortunately or unfortunately for the film, both halves compete with each other to make it worse. Amazingly, that was not the case with the original. With this movie, the pace and tempo fails drastically in the second half. As scenes get heavier with emotions, the writing takes a backseat and it is then on the actors in the frame to enhance it with their acting chops. That doesn't entirely happen and hence it starts becoming a worst movie.",

If you have been longing for a good action movie... this is it!If you walked in to watch \"vikram vedha \" (as I did), confident that you knew what was in store, not expecting to be surprised you'd be right...and wrong, I watched this movie just because of legendary actor Hrithik roshan his facial expressions and dialogue delivery is amazing he proved he is the greatest actor no doubt his acting skills no one can beat. I've already watched the original version of this film with the same director Pushkar-Gayathri i went to theater for Hrithik roshan, on the other hand saif ali khan also played his character very well his cop looks blew audience mind just like in sacred game,in trailer many of audience judge that saif is not doing good but he did very well , I can't say enough good things about vikram vedha it's everything we need from a summer blockbuster. Get yourself down to your nearest cinema and see for yourself. It's Awesome. Vikram vedha takes you on an emotional nostalgia filled thrill ride that will have you on the edge of your seat. I was genuinely sweating just watching the incredible action sequences which should be on track for cinematography awards aplenty.I will watch this movie 10 times or more! Let me explain why Lots of action, humor, plot twists, good acting and special effects, cameos, a tight story, tension, and surprises. There's violence and language here, but you pretty much get what you expect if you've seen the preview.! Vikram vedha is a masterpiece of a movie, hell I would even say that it's one of my favorite movies of all time. After 20 years Hrithik and saif have seen on screen it's literally goosebumps and the background score is just no words to describe each and every cast of the film did their best and best director Pushkar-Gayathri.

            "content": "Hrithik Roshan And Saif Ali Khan Deliver Standout Performances.A remake is a remake even if it overruns with style and swag. Banish that thought and calibrate your expectations accordingly and Vikram Vedha, Pushkar and Gayatri's reshaping of their own 2017 Tamil smash hit of the same title, is a meaty mass entertainer that packs quite a punch.Working with a screenplay that has yielded dividends before and banking on a pair of Bollywood stars who give a solid account of themselves, the directing duo cash in handsomely on the film's intelligently assembled resources.Minor tweaks in the story, a drastic backdrop change and Hindi dialogue that alternates between the conversational and philosophical enable them to craft a movie that not only does not appear like a once-too-often exercise but also possesses the potential to pull the crowds in.Saif Ali Khan and Hrithik Roshan face off in a battle of attrition that is crammed with intrigue and energy, what with an array of characters orbiting around the cop and the criminal engaged in penetrating mind games. The two male leads, on their parts, deliver performances that stand out amid the orchestrated din.Fleshing out characters that have been drawn from a centuries-old folktale and placed in present-day Lucknow, the actors are aided in rising above the stereotypical nature of the two men - one a policeman, the other an urban brigand; one on the side of good, the other against it - by the out-of-the-ordinary situations and the questions of ethics and emotions that the screenplay hinges on.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Vikram (Khan) is drafted into a special task force and pressed into an operation aimed at nabbing the sly and slippery Vedha (Roshan), who lords over the Lucknow underworld and keeps the law enforcers on their toes.Vikram Vedha kicks off with a shootout in which a few gangsters are killed, which sparks off a round of violent confrontations between the STF and the vengeful Vedha. The end of violence seems nigh when the dreaded Vedha turns himself in to the police.Vedha's surprise move is only the beginning. He has more up his sleeves than the cops anticipate. One of his trump cards is lawyer Priya (Radhika Apte), who happens to be Vikram's wife. A woman doing her job, her husband doing his and the two at loggerheads with each other - this recipe for marital discord adds a layer to the story that occasionally yanks it away from the hurly-burly of the police station and deposits it within the walls of domesticity.Thrice in the course of the narrative, delivered as a series of flashbacks that spring out of twisted and protracted tales that Vedha narrates to Vikram, the cop is close to eliminating (or at least outwitting) the criminal. Each time, the latter convinces the former to hear a story rooted in his own life. Every story ends in the manner of a fable with a question of moral import centred on good and evil, the nature of crime, policing and culpability, and the dynamics of revenge and justice.Inspired by the folktale Baital Pachisi in which King Vikramaditya sets out to capture a wily demon who repeatedly foxes the righteous ruler with riddles on whose answers their fate rests, Vikram Vedha transports the mythic tale to the capital city of Uttar Pradesh.Lucknow, with its historic structures, has a key role in the film if only as a physical setting that gives the film a distinctive visual texture just as Chennai did in the original Vikram Vedha.At three specific junctures, the police officer is forced by Vedha to confront an ethical dilemma regarding his role as a defender of the law and his firm belief that none of the encounter deaths he has caused was of an innocent man.If you are among those that have seen the Tamil-language original, be warned that this is by and large a scene-by-scene, line-by-line reiteration that is 20 minutes longer than the Madhavan-Vijay Sethupathi starrer. The film's ability to startle and shock is therefore severely curtailed. But if you are unaware of the plot, Vikram Vedha has enough twists and turns to hold your attention all the way through.Pushkar and Gayatri, perhaps the only husband-wife duo of directors in Asia, do well not to tinker with a successful construct. They fall back on not only the same Sam C. S. background score to shore up the action on the screen, but also on the director of photography (P. S. Vinod) and the editor (Richard Kevin).While the cinematographer has to make significant adjustments to factor in a new location and a significantly altered production design, the editor is not required to do much that he has not done once before. But familiarity does not take anything away from Vikram Vedha.Thanks to a new setting - Lucknow serves as a strikingly evocative backdrop to the fast-paced crime drama - and a fresh set of actors, Vikram Vedha has a colour palette of its own. Despite its length, it never feels stodgy or sluggish. The credit for that accrues as much to the technicians as to the writers (the directors themselves).If comparisons are to be made no matter how odious they may be, Saif Ali Khan makes a far better Vikram. He inhabits the character of the tough cop with conviction and exudes the external toughness that defines the man and his mission.Hrithik Roshan, who refrains from modelling his performance on that of Vijay Sethupathi, harnesses his star appeal and screen presence to deliver the goods and then some. It is well-nigh impossible to go one better on the inimitable Vijay Sethupathi. Roshan does not even try and that stands him in good stead.With two major Bollywood stars powering the film, the actors in the supporting roles suffer just a touch. Be that as it may, Radhika Apte, stepping into Shraddha Srinath's shoes as Vikram's lawyer-wife, Satyadeep Mishra playing Vikram's police academy mate SSP Abbas Ali (replacing the Tamil film's Simon), and Sharib Hashmi in the role of Vedha's foe-turned-friend-turned-foe Babloo add their mite to the film.The characters played by Rohit Saraf and Yogita Bihani - Vedha's younger brother and the girl in his life - somehow do not seem to make the impact that Kathir and Varalaxmi Sarathkumar did in the same roles in the 2017 movie. But these are but small blips in a power-packed, compelling action thriller that knows exactly what it is getting at and achieves its ends with aplomb.",

            "content": "In a time before pan-India movies became all the craze, a Tamil movie titled Vikram Vedha blew everyone's mind. Released in 2017, this film boasted of stellar performances by R Madhavan & Vijay Sethupathi as modern day versions of the Vikramadityan and Vetal. 5 years later, the directors of the movie, Pushkar Gayatri are at the helm of the Hindi remake starring Saif Ali Khan & Hrithik Roshan.Set in Lucknow, Vikram is a law-abiding, honest cop, who believes that he is doing the right thing by killing gangsters. But when the dreaded Vedha willingly surrenders, Vikram is left baffled by the stories that he has to narrate.When filmmakers remake their own movies, you are bound to wonder what can they do to make the remake different or standout. But for most part (99.5%), the remake is exactly the same. The shift from Chennai to Lucknow only changes the nature of the crimes & the language.The remake gets the casting right. Hrithik Roshan is an actor worthy enough to step into Vijay Sethupathi's shoes as he brings his own charisma to the role. He is at his menacing best that will have you root for him from the moment he enters the frame. But on the flipside, Saif Ali Khan's Vikram is a stepdown from R Madhavan's rendition. Said & his onscreen wife, Radhika Apte's chemistry seems forced. The ideal combination would have seen Madhavan square off against Hrithik. Rohit Saraf, Yogita Bihani, Sharib Hashmi co-star.For all those who have watched the original (in Tamil and not the dubbed version), this remake doesn't have much to offer unless you are a Hrithik fan (then do go for it). And if you haven't watched the original, then definitely go for it. Pushkar-Gayatri's story must be seen irrespective of the language.",

To be honest, I can do without the song and dance as well as the bit over-the-top soundtrack but that didn't take up too much time. The acting sometimes gets a little stilted but you can get through it easy enough. Some of the shooting scenes could have been a bit tighter and realistic in the sense of less swagger or more realism. Shooting a handgun is a serious endeavor and I personally prefer to see it portrayed as such on the screen. If you cut out the filler song-and-dance, some silly love scenes plus tightening it in a few spots and this would be one pretty solid 2:00 hour movie. Regardless, this is one of the better Indian movies I've seen and it is worth seeing. The storyline itself is very good and I can see Hollywood doing a remake on this one. Go out and enjoy.",

The film explores the grey areas where the lines between good and evil overlap.Hritik's screen presence, swag , dance and emotions portrayed are topnotch. Even then Saif has a strong role as a tough cop and has played it very well. Radhika Apte as Saif's wife , Satyadeep Mishra as Saif's cop friend and Sharib Hashmi as Hritik's sidekick too have played their parts very well.BGM is just wow and has a powerful impact on the narrative.

The film picks up pace from the first scene itself and is gripping throughout its 2 hrs 27 mins runtime.Twists & turns in the plot are many and suspense is revealed in a very logical manner as Vedha relates 3 stories to Vikram which leads to an explosive climax. Superb ending too !! The makers have also kept the back stories of certain characters to a minimum to avoid digressing from the main plot.I did not watch the original R Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathy film, but all I can say is that this one is entertaining as hell.Worth watching in theatres!! Full action, full dhamaal Go for it!!4/5 from me .. adios \ud83d\ude42!!",

            "content": "Vikram vedha is an action crime drama thriller directed by pushkar and gayatri which is an official hindi remake of the tamil film titled 'vikram vedha.'\nHrithik roshan is the backbone of this film. The way he has brought the madness in this character is just awesome. You can observe his eyes during the action scenes and seriously his expressions are insane. Saif ali khan too delivers a very complete performance. He was emotionless at first but as the screenplay progresses you can see he is an emotional character and saif portrays the same. The supporting cast including rohit saraf, satyadip mishra, radhika apte and co do a commendable job. The character writing is interesting. The characters of vikram and vedha are very well written. Their character arcs are beautifully fleshed out. Vedha's interaction with shatak's character really pull at your heart strings. It happens primarily due to the conviction with which both have played their characters. You will see hrithik gets teary eyed whenever he interacts with shatak. Again, vikram and vedha's tussle was really worth the big screen. Abbas' character needed some more time to flesh out. So the writing is fairly good. The dialogues are pretty good. Pretty apt for a big mass movie. Not too much complicated but also has its density. The screenplay is very good but i guess in the third story the screenplay revolves too much and confuses its customers.The music is good. 'O sahiba' is a very good song and when the table enters it sounds impeccable. It also establishes the relationship between vikram and priya. 'Alcoholia' is pretty interesting. It starts with a generic rhythm but then vishal-shekhar' bring in their magic with the rhythm section going bonkers. Very good! And what to say about 'bande.' The song in sync with the bgm acts as perfect suit for the gritty sequences. The bgm is very good but i feel it has been excessively used. Whenever vikram or vedha enters the frame, the bgm goes on over-kill mode. I wish they used it more smartly.The cinematography is terrific. The colour grading giving vibes of a gritty drama suits very well. Also the lighting during many frames is absolutely breathtaking. One such sequence is when vikram first interrogates vedha. The one take sequence at the beginning sequence was also very well shot.This is a pretty good film. I rate it 8 out of 10.",

If Vijay Sethupati can don vedha as a calm and silent villian, Hrithik raises the volume with intensity and lunacy, even though the plot was same, there's this aura Saif and Hrithik have on screen that really conceives the bigger picture. This movie's supporting cast has also done an absolute unprejudiced justice, it feels like from Hrithik Saif to Rohit Saraf everyone was made for their respective roles.I'd definitely recommend this watching it at least once.",

Radhika looked good but her role was very very small.Overall very less time given for audience to create some empathy for the characters on screen as most of the time heavy entry and action scenes are shown.Only saving grace was the twist in the 2nd half only if you are still watching the movie(as some people left the hall in 2nd half beginning only.)\nOverall avoid this movie to stay free from headache.",

While 'Alcoholia' the item song thrown in is a bit of a stretch though tolerable in spite of the cheese factor.Great for multiple viewings, it's fresh and stands on it's own. I have watched the Tamil version and think it's a solid remake and rather a more interesting one if you are the Hindi-speaking audience.

The end when they both unite is the best part of full movie the theater was full of whistles and shouts and ahh saif ali khans encounter and crime scene analysis was pretty big brain moment in the movie.

            "content": "With the release of Vikram Vedha-after a long time, a big Hindi action film has hit the screens. Though an official remake of the great Tamil film (which I guess most of us have already enjoyed on OTT as well) of the same title, yet there was anticipation for its release. Like the Tamil version, the Hindi remake has also been directed by the husband-wife pair of Pushkar-Gayathri. The characters of Madhavan and Vijay are replayed by Saif Ali Khan and Hrithik Roshan. The film takes its inspiration from the stories that the ghost Vetaal(Betaal Pachisi based) tells King Vikram(Vikramaditya) when Vikram tries to catch and carry Vetaal to his place. The Tamil flick was set in Chenna and the Hindi one is nicely set up in Lucknow. While the plot and almost scene by scene remain the same the novelty is the setting in the heartland of U. P. and the star cast of Saif and Hrithik. It's a tough job to remake a cult crime noir thriller, especially when the cast is perfect, yet I feel the makers along with the cast have done justice to the remake. Saif Ali Khan plays Vikram quite well, though in the initial parts he looks trying hard in the second half gets into the skin and carries the character well on his broad shoulders. Hrithik plays the stylised baddie Vedha(Vetaal) with panache and is a treat to watch. He makes the character very different from the stylised anti-hero he played in Dhoom 2. I agree that those who have watched Madhavan and Vijay in the Tamil flick will take time to see the Bollywood actors playing their parts, but trust me they have done a good job. The setting of Lucknow aided by dialogues is done rather perfectly. Instead of forcing things, the conversation, the locales and even the references are straight out of Lucknow of 2022! A lot of references are thrown for Lucknow food and so the Mutton Chops of Chenna become The Nihari Kulcha of Lucknow in the Hindi version. The film maintains its grip and the film is good technically too. The supporting star cast including Sharib Hashmi and others have done a fine form. So all in all I will say while the original is original yet, the Hindi remake is well made!!",

Saif ali khan is superb as cool, composed yet mysterious cop! Radhika apte has small but effective role!!But it's the one man Hrithik roshan who will outshine everyone with his finest act! The actor always challenges himself to outdo his last one. Here he is ruthless yet sensitive. With in 5 mins you are in his world. Outstanding act.

In the initial time, when I heard Bollywood is remaking this cult with Saif n Aameer. I thought they'// make Saif as the antagonist,\"Vedha\" but it was vice e versa. Although Saif played his character well as Vikram but in my opinion he should given the role of Vedha , due to his previous played characters (langda tyagi, Naga sadhu etc) , he could have fitted in that one. But altogether Aamir was also not a bad choice , due to his perfection,he can mould himself. But Aamir ,left this movie and makers roped Hrithik in it. Although Hrithik was also good but not an exact fit according to the character. I thought Hrithik could have put its charm n different aura the way he putted during Agnipath but this time you '// miss that thing. Although for the ppl who didn't watched the original they might accept the characters well as it has been portrayed. So for the makers it might be a win win situation. The other things, which the makers keep it similar to the original was the other characters were also not known faces apart from Babloo ( Sharing Hashmi) n Priya (Radhika Aapte) ( similar in original).Altogether it's a good flick and you won't be surprised if Hrithik Roshan would get a filmfare award for his performance.",

But it just didn't click for me.I was going into the movie with a lot of expectations because I've watched the original. But that zing was missing. Although, silver lining was Saif's acting. But most other characters were not really into it. Seemed a bit out of place. When things are right, the story comes to life. It reels you in and makes you comfortable with the fictional world created by the filmmaker. But Vikram Vedha didn't really have that pull that I felt in the original one. Maybe, it was the execution of the script which wasn't done right.",

            "content": "First Day, First Show ... and well worth it.This engrossing tale gripped us right from the opening credit sequence. Simple animation recalled the thousand-year-old Sanskrit myth of 'Vikram aur Betaal' which probes the universal question of good versus evil and suggests that human life is more accurately understood as shades of grey rather than either. A \"good\" king Vikramaditya seeks to save his people by subduing an \"evil\" spirit/entity called Betaal (in many versions of the myth not precisely human) only to learn through a series of challenging moral questions posed by Betaal how nothing may be quite what it seems.Writer-director duo Pushkar & Gayatri deftly shift us into what seems at first a disarmingly simple police encounter that will nonetheless resonate later throughout the film: \"good\" cop Inspector Vikram (Saif Ali Khan) and his special police team ambush and annihilate the gang of \"evil\" criminal Vedha Betal (Hrithik Roshan). The central conflict of our story develops as Vedha stages his own surrender to Vikram in order to force Vikram to solve three great questions. And therein lies the unexpectedly deep and compelling tale.So satisfying, to walk out of the cinema with so much to think about!Hrithik Roshan yet again proves how he is not just an industry superstar but a super actor, completely submerged into the persona of a complex and challenging character who rivets our attention throughout. I loved how directors Pushkar & Gayatri deliberately keep his Vedha mysterious and almost unknowable ... he retains his secrets! ... perhaps in homage to the not-quite-human Betaal from the original myths. But in \"Vikram Vedha\" Hrithik portrays for once the catalyst, rather than protagonist, of our film. Saif Ali Khan's Vikram is truly our central character about whose evolving journey and discovery the whole movie turns. And I confess, it is Saif who really surprised me here. For all the ups and downs of his long and on the whole successful career as a leading film actor, never before had I seen Saif Ali Khan bring forth this much power and subtlety to any role. And the two actors, together, play off each other brilliantly.The supporting cast - particularly Radhika Apte as Vikram's wife who is also the lawyer defending Vedha and Rohit Saraf as Vedha's innocent younger brother - are uniformly excellent and well cast. But \"Vikram Vedha\" is never really their show. Here, and most rightly, all focus remains throughout on our two compelling title characters.Special shout-out to the exceptionally good art direction, which due to the horrifically deadly COVID-19 pandemic prevailing in India during time of production had to be largely Lucknow and Kanpur rebuilt on backlots overseas in Abu Dhabi.If the action choreography never quite reaches the international standard we'd seen in other recent Hrithik films such as \"Bang Bang!\" (2014) or \"War\" (2019), there are still some particularly memorable scenes. Any scene where Hrithik's Vedha and Saif's Vikram are going head-to-head, definitely. There is a Vedha gun battle scene shortly before the climax in a ruined roof-less structure with an open looping staircase that was nicely shot. My special favourite, though, is a mid-film rooftop 'parkour' sequence where the Vedha character escapes by nonchalantly walking - not running - up down and around while the feverishly seeking police madly hunt for him at street level: perfectly illustrated the character.Much recommended viewing!",

I hadn't watched movies for a long time as no such other movie caught my attention as this one did. The movie's build-up was quite gradual at first but since Hrithik's entry comes into the play, the movie has been absolutely mind-boggling.I haven't watched OG but the story outline was such that you'd get thrilled when the movie starts connecting all the dots imprinted earlier.A complete blockbuster from my end.

This is just nitpicking, the movie has an amazing pace and the angle of deception is amazing, directors know how to tell a story. Lots of suspense and twist, you may think that the story is going in one way but then it will flip on it's head, Saif Ali Khan has put in a good performance, I wish the directors changed a few things more from the Tamil version.

Then of course, the change in places and respective references based on that.Saif's character felt pretty similar to Madhavan's, but here too, didn't feel like as much of a drag as I expected it to be.

Two great artists coming together just delivers on screen every time.I haven't seen the original but I feel like it deserves a watch. See what madhavan and sethupathi have done with the characters.

I haven't been impressed by Bollywood recently and had my eyes on this particular movie hoping that it would be good. It didn't disappoint,it was absolutely breathtaking with marvellous action sequences and had my eyes glued to the screen. It left me thinking about it for the next few days as well and i think its gonna stay in my mind longer now.",

Didn't watch the original vikraam vedha on purpose since i didn't want to spoil the suspense of a good hrithik movie after a long time. Loved radhika's role as well . A few songs in the movie ensured that the story doesn't go haywire keeping the indian audience in mind .",

The perfect pace stands out first kept the audience thrilled and guessing till the end. Dialogues are sharp as knife and powerful as the gun shots in the movie. The BGM was rock solid which had added the feel to the play.Coming to the performances Madhavan as Vikram the protagonist a perfect police maintains his grip and emotes intensive emotions particularly when he feels he was used.

Given the movie length is 2h 40m long it always keeps you invested in the movie. The main hero of Vikram Vedha is it's story. Hats off to the directors Pushkar and Gayatri , you guys nailed it once again though I haven't seen the OG Vikram Vedha so my perspective is for this one only. The BGM in the Action scenes is what elevated the movie more. Hrithik Roshan's performance without a doubt is one of his career best. He nailed the expression and attitude of Vedha. Saif whom I underestimated in the trailer , shined in his part and was neck to neck with Hrithik in most of scenes. The supporting cast does it's job very well which includes Radhika apte, Sharib Hashmi and Rohit Sharaf.

His action scenes should have been more visceral and less slow motion. The sense of craziness in his character was fleeting, it felt like a wasted opportunity.A few minor things were also better in original. Screenplay and minor characters were more polished.

Hrithik back after 3 long years on big screen and when it comes to performance-wise he never disappoint.Personally, I loved this movie and I request you all to go and watch this movie atleast once.

The plot was really well-paced and the characters were all unique and interesting, which is something I find in all of Vikram Vedha's movies. Also there are so many new twists that I didn't see coming, which made me enjoy it even more. A definite recommend!I couldn't agree more with you. There are many scenes in the movie that are remakes of scenes from the original one and we can tell which ones they are. But overall Vikram Vedha is a much better film than the original one was in my opinion!",

            "content": "The Vikram Vedha movie is a Hindi remake of the movie Vikram Vedha which was originally a South movie released in 2017. Hrithik Roshan and Saif Ali Khan play lead roles in this Hindi remake.The film tells us the basic story of 'Vikram and Betal' from 'Panchatantra'. How Betal always put Vikram in a dilemma by narrating him different and intresting stories and asking questions about it. This film is also the same Vedha(Hrithik Roshan) narrates a story every time he meets Vikram(Saif Ali Khan) and put him in dilemma by asking him a question about that story. This thing goes until they find their final goal. And after watching the movie a question arises in our mind that is good really good and is evil really that evil?The acting of Hrithik Roshan is very amazing and up to the mark and Saif Ali Khan also played the stern and honest cop very effortlessly. Use of songs in this movie is decent but background music is very cool. It's a theme song of original Vikram Vedha movie. The only thing is that the first half of the movie is a little bit slow but let me tell you it's not boring. The Gayatri - Pushkar duo has done some great work while making this movie and action scenes are very cool and more realistic. So, summary is it's a great movie and if you want a package of good entertainment, action, twist and turns then you must watch this movie once.",

            "content": "The Hindi version is powered by the innate cleverness of the original concept, Pushkar-Gayatri's filmmaking chops, and Hrithik Roshan's effortless cool. Saif Ali Khan brings a nervy quality to his portrayal of Vikram, while Radhika Apte makes her handful of scenes count. But this two-hander was always meant to be a solo act. Scroll.'Vikram Vedha' review: Hrithik Roshan shines in an efficient remake with a dash of glam\nPushkar-Gayatri's Hindi adaptation of their Tamil film stars Roshan, Saif Ali Khan and Radhika Apte.Two smart decisions work in favour of Pushkar-Gayatri's Hindi remake of their Tamil film Vikram Vedha from 2017. The Hindi version, which bears the same title, retains the original screenplay's single-most attractive quality: slyness.The Tamil version of Vikram Vedha started out as a regular cop-versus-gangster movie before moving into a debate about moral relativism. Inspired by the Betalpachisi folk tales, Vikram Vedha was built around three conversations between the police officer Vikram and the gangster Vedha. Both have a long list of kills to their names. What is the difference anyway, Vedha wonders - a question that ricochets through the flashback-laden structure before taking the narrative into a wholly unexpected direction. The remake replicates the original film's beats, if to a somewhat more muted degree.The second clever choice is the handling of the actor tasked with stepping into the gargantuan shoes of Vijay Sethupathi, who brilliantly played Vedha in the Tamil production. Knowing well that Sethupathi is irreplaceable, Pushkar-Gayatri have moulded the Hindi-language Vedha around Hrithik Roshan, who brings immense star power to the role along with a newfound ease before the camera.Roshan has never been this relaxed, not even in War (2019), where his undercover agent left audiences in thrall to his presence. For Vikram Vedha, Roshan sheds the kilos, acquires an age-appropriate scruffiness and never makes the mistake of trying to imitate Sethupathi.The heavy lifting is left to a bulked-up Saif Ali Khan as Vikram. As a member of a special task force in Uttar Pradesh, Vikram is an expert in dressing up extra-judicial executions. Vikram and his team know exactly how to manipulate a crime scene to make so-called encounters look like retaliatory killings. Vikram's rationale for his actions is muddled by Vedha's counter-narrative.The cast includes Sudhanva Deshpande as Vikram's boss, Satyadeep Mishra as Vikram's colleague, Sharib Hashmi as Vedha's associate, Rohit Saraf as Vedha's brother Shatak and Yogita Bihani as Shatak's lover. Radhika Apte plays Vikram's wife Priya, a lawyer who is representing Vedha. I'm merely a go-between, Priya complains at one point, which pretty much sums up her place in a film that revolves around two strong-willed men on a collision.Despite being a faithful remake, there are times when Vikram Vedha feels like it has lost a few shades while being put through the photocopier. The source film's grunginess makes way for bright lighting, choreographed action sequences and slow-motion views of Khan and Roshan striding across the screen.Also eroded in the journey from Tamil to Hindi is the trust reposed in audiences to keep following the complex contours of the good-versus-evil debate. The often-banal Hindi dialogue by BA Fida and Manoj Muntashir, which is overlaid by deafening background music, is more concerned with rolling out punchlines than raising doubts about what we think we know about crime and punishment.The Hindi version is powered by the innate cleverness of the original concept, Pushkar-Gayatri's filmmaking chops, and Hrithik Roshan's effortless cool. Saif Ali Khan brings a nervy quality to his portrayal of Vikram, while Radhika Apte makes her handful of scenes count. But this two-hander was always meant to be a solo act.If the Tamil film was a Vijay Sethupathi show, the Hindi remake is a Hrithik Roshan joint. Roshan's full-tilt glam adds a fourth line of inquiry to Vedha's conscience-pricking triptych.Overall a masterpiece. Go watch it before it's too late. Goosebumps guaranteed. \ud83d\udd25",

The writer should be praised and recognized for this true masterpiece. The background score is a 10/10 and the acting is above average for sure with Hrithik yet again stealing the limelight. Saif was decent nd radhika was wasted. \"Bablu\" Sharib Hashmi, the sensational actor from family man has maintained his standards. All in all a one time must watch film if you haven't watched the Tamil version. The screenplay, cinematography, Action sequence are all at par with the modern best practices. The movie will get unrealistic at times but I guess that is what gives the south indian movies their flavour. Every movie gets to see a Super hero or a super villain flying around and effortlessly bashing 100 people all by himself, this is no different. The concept is one of its kind and I recommend reading or watching one or two episodes of the 1985 blockbuster tv series vikram betal to do justice to the original writer's epic creation.",

            "content": "OPENING THIS WEEK\n'Vikram Vedha' review: Hrithik Roshan shines in an efficient remake with a dash of glam\nPushkar-Gayatri's Hindi adaptation of their Tamil film stars Roshan, Saif Ali Khan and Radhika Apte.Two smart decisions work in favour of Pushkar-Gayatri's Hindi remake of their Tamil film Vikram Vedha from 2017. The Hindi version, which bears the same title, retains the original screenplay's single-most attractive quality: slyness.The Tamil version of Vikram Vedha started out as a regular cop-versus-gangster movie before moving into a debate about moral relativism. Inspired by the Betalpachisi folk tales, Vikram Vedha was built around three conversations between the police officer Vikram and the gangster Vedha. Both have a long list of kills to their names. What is the difference anyway, Vedha wonders - a question that ricochets through the flashback-laden structure before taking the narrative into a wholly unexpected direction. The remake replicates the original film's beats, if to a somewhat more muted degree.The second clever choice is the handling of the actor tasked with stepping into the gargantuan shoes of Vijay Sethupathi, who brilliantly played Vedha in the Tamil production. Knowing well that Sethupathi is irreplaceable, Pushkar-Gayatri have moulded the Hindi-language Vedha around Hrithik Roshan, who brings immense star power to the role along with a newfound ease before the camera.Roshan has never been this relaxed, not even in War (2019), where his undercover agent left audiences in thrall to his presence. For Vikram Vedha, Roshan sheds the kilos, acquires an age-appropriate scruffiness and never makes the mistake of trying to imitate Sethupathi.The heavy lifting is left to a bulked-up Saif Ali Khan as Vikram. As a member of a special task force in Uttar Pradesh, Vikram is an expert in dressing up extra-judicial executions. Vikram and his team know exactly how to manipulate a crime scene to make so-called encounters look like retaliatory killings. Vikram's rationale for his actions is muddled by Vedha's counter-narrative.Saif Ali Khan in Vikram Vedha.The cast includes Sudhanva Deshpande as Vikram's boss, Satyadeep Mishra as Vikram's colleague, Sharib Hashmi as Vedha's associate, Rohit Saraf as Vedha's brother Shatak and Yogita Bihani as Shatak's lover. Radhika Apte plays Vikram's wife Priya, a lawyer who is representing Vedha. I'm merely a go-between, Priya complains at one point, which pretty much sums up her place in a film that revolves around two strong-willed men on a collision course.Despite being a faithful remake, there are times when Vikram Vedha feels like it has lost a few shades while being put through the photocopier. The source film's grunginess makes way for bright lighting, choreographed action sequences and slow-motion views of Khan and Roshan striding across the screen.Also eroded in the journey from Tamil to Hindi is the trust reposed in audiences to keep following the complex contours of the good-versus-evil debate. The often-banal Hindi dialogue by BA Fida and Manoj Muntashir, which is overlaid by deafening background music, is more concerned with rolling out punchlines than raising doubts about what we think we know about crime and punishment.The Hindi version is powered by the innate cleverness of the original concept, Pushkar-Gayatri's filmmaking chops, and Hrithik Roshan's effortless cool. Saif Ali Khan brings a nervy quality to his portrayal of Vikram, while Radhika Apte makes her handful of scenes count. But this two-hander was always meant to be a solo .If the Tamil film was a Vijay Sethupathi show, the Hindi remake is a Hrithik Roshan joint. Roshan's full-tilt glam adds a fourth line of inquiry to Vedha's conscience-pricking triptych. Do we believe Vedha.",

Saif ali khan is superb, Radhika is as goog as always. Hritik shines on the screen with his screen presence. However I find his character slightly tilted towards his earlier played Anand Kumar in Super 30. Script writer is clear in his approach and the direction\nis in complete harmony..

This one's just a cherry on the top.Two brilliant actors, possibly one of the bests of our time, locking horns to offer a festive story of vengeance, gutted with some brilliant screenplay, background score, and camerawork.Each and every scene Hrithik enters, was shot to perfection. So much was the depiction that even my mom (who hardly watches action movies) had barely skipped a beat. And that is where a cleanly knitted storyline comes into the foray, and for that Pushkar and Gayatri deserves accolade.Thank you Hrithik, for this time and all the previous ones, for portraying yet another gripping character with all your Blood, sweat and tear. \ud83d\udda4Forever a fan, and an admirer of yours. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffcPS : I haven't watched the original Telegu version of the same, hence no comparison whatsoever from my side.

Saif Ali Khan is effective as the Vikram who is the quieter character and who goes through a transformation.\nAnother thing I loved about the movie was the background score.
