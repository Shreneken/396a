            "content": "DId I watch a different Kantara ?Initial minutes of the movie was interesting as it was building a mystery around the villagers and demigods. I was expecting a decent fantasy mystery movie. But after a particular scene, the movie shifted its pivot to a different issue and it stayed there till the end. It was frustratingly boring in the second half and it killed all the interest I had watching the first few minutes of the movie. Then, the movie slowly decayed into the same old stuff we have seen 100 times before. Costumes are different, setting is different but core stuff is the same.The last few minutes were good from a performance point of view, but it felt like pointless as at that point, the movie became something else and it didn't matter to the overall outcome of the movie.Animations and VFX were good but could have been better. Especially the wild bore scenes felt a little short and didn't blend well with the scene.Overall, its certainly a one time watchable movie with good cinematic experience but without a plot.",

Which never worked for me. The music and climax stunt is the saviour of the movie. If not there is nothing much this movie can offer me. There no a clear explaination why the god choosed him. He is just a loafer. Never do much all he does is going for hunt, drinking liquor, smoking weed and bring trouble for people. Brother who devoted to the god dies. Does not make sense. Just because he is a hero he gets everything done i guess... A very average revenge story with culture and region based it went sensation.",

Mark my words this movie will get National Award. BGM, cinematography, direction and acting all were topnotch. Final 20 minutes of climax is unbelievable... never expected Rishabh Shetty got such an acting skill. Achyutha Kumar, Kishore acted really well... Daiva, kola, bootharadhane, kambala the classic culture of the Karavali Karnataka has been shown superbly. Goosebumps expected at every scene. Dont miss the climax its the core ot the movie.",

Average, at best.This is what the movie was:1. A very interesting but rushed beginning introducing us to the dev. We wish to see it more but the maker was in a hurry to get to the boring part.2. A 45 year old actor plays a 25 year old guy.3. Daaru, beedi, gaanja.4. Cruelty on animals.5. Cutting and damaging of forests.6. Objectification of women.7. Violence against forest-officials doing their job.8. Justifying everything in a very naxalite way.9. Points 3 to 8 repeated several times till we get to the climax.10. A battle between the villagers and the villain's men in the climax. The villain literally sits on a chair in the middle of the battle and is unscathed.11. After the village is almost razed down and the hero almost killed, he gets possessed by the dev and kills the villain. We want to see more of the dev but the movie ends there. The maker was reluctant showing the interesting bit.You walk out of the theater wondering what was so great about the movie.",

BGM and Song from Ajaneesh gives goosebumps. The Director and Actor Rishabh Shetty is fire. Saptami Gowda did excellent and romantic part is very raw and goes with the story well. Kishore and Achyuth Sir perfect casting and brought justice to the role. Subtle comedy by Shiva and Gang keeps the story moving. The last climax is the must watch theatre experience and a divine moment. Proud film from Kannada industry and deeply rooted cultural but commercial entertainer. Finally thanks for Hombale Films to backing this project.",

            "content": "Absolutely bonkers, wild and a movie worth for a discussion. This film impresses with its variety of forms and feelings - there is a whole bunch of emotions. Rishab Shetty has the ability to cater his films to moviegoers of all class and successfully crossed that divide between indie and mainstream. Even his production 'Pedro' and which is doing wonders in the festival circuit endows his ability to strike a balance. Likewise with Rakshit Shetty who has backed so many indie films including the recent Sakutumba Sametha (2022).Coming to Kantara, this film has so many layers of complexity and it's amazing Rishab expresses a lot while keeping it grounded, rooted and minimalistic. With unending sound of the biosphere set in Tulunadu as a conjunction between ecology, greed of man, civilization and everything in between sums up the tone of the film. I loved the idea of the flashback and voiceover to set things going from the start. On the other hand, this is a proper commercial film so expect all the genre troupes, elevations, guy falling head over heels in love and a story done to death. But Rishab stands out as he chooses this inalienable closeness of mother earth and man, adds the main ingredient, i.e. Is ENTERTAINMENT!Even Shiva as the rebel concept was conveyed so well, the face-off that involves internal and external conflicts will immerse you. His character is grey and not without its downsides as he lives in two worlds at the same time. The first is the world of flesh and bone, and the second is the divine, which is his true calling to carry the legacy of his father. The realization is pretty good, when he gets nightmares for the wrongdoings, he is led to this mysterious place in the forest, like a portal. It happens in the pre-climax after the brilliant \"i am cleansed,\" scene, very short and doesn't go into full details of the transformation. The gloomy atmosphere in the film occupies a central niche, besides, the tone of that forest, it also contributes to the overall outcome of the film.The visuals are ideally combined with subplots and the authenticity to mix the culture of Kambla and Bhootha Kola is not an overkill. It is picturized so well as the climax moments densely settles in memory for quite a long time and it will be the same for other viewers too.The main thing here is that the spirit of Rishab Shetty to keep it authentic right from music, staging, actors and ending with costumes. It is really tough that he will have another big film comparable to Kantara in his career. To put it simply and briefly, I am delighted with the viewing. Enjoyed every minute from start to finish. A community watch, a spectacle made for only celluloid experience. I know when this will be out on OTT so called shallow cinephhiles, purists, Xenolingohassens will find it cringe and problematic. I am still going with 10/10 sure I'm obviously biased, the making, production value soothed the drought of content driven commercial films lacking in kannada industry. Mark my words, this will be remembered by those who have experienced it only on the bring screen even after decades.",

Yes, the God-messenger thing is kind of novel but everything else is what we have been seeing in Indian movies for past several decades, the main storyline being the rich oppressing the poor or say the upper class oppressing the lower. Acting is loud, so is the background, it felt more like noise than background score. Climax is good, everything else is bore. I didnt find anything worth praising, there arent any special moments or dialogues either. I found it nothing but loud, too loud. Filled with overacting characters. I repent watching it.",

The way he is constantly running away from his destiny and taking refuge in the 'material luxuries' (aka. Drink, waste away time etc.).The movie, do subtly and brilliantly captures the exploration of innocence by the rich and powerful! The different paths to the same end (DRFO and Shiva), the complexity and diversity of culture.... Just WOW!When the climax approached, I was left speechless! Had tears in my eyes and had my hands folded(completely unknowningly). I drive back with my wife after a late night show here in Australia and was a good 45 min drive and we both didn't utter a word!I was still in a state of trance the whole of next day!!!If this doesn't deserve an Oscar.... Then not sure what else does....",

            "content": "The opening and ending scene of Kantara is nothing like you've seen before. The way they wrote the mythological background was so good. But those are limited to the opening scene and climax. What happens in between is the overtold story of the rough hero who gets into trouble for his locality, his love interest and the conflict in the name of their place.I can't believe they still write characters like Sreevalli and Leela. In the very first scene in which Leela is introduced, the hero straight up physically assaults her. There are other ways to write a romance, you know? No matter how progressed these movies become. They just can't get the female characters right.The screenplay, direction cinematography, stunts, artwork and acting are pretty great. The screaming could've been dialed down a bit. The repeated screams might give you a headache. Rishab Shetty's performance in the climax is hands down one of the finest work I've ever seen in a Kannada movie. He handled something that could've gone very wrong really well.It's theater material. Each person is different. This review is my opinion. Watch it in theaters and decide for yourself. Movies like these are made for theatres.",

After scouring through an unusually high amount of positive reviews coming from ordinary viewers and professional critics alike who by the way sang only praises for this feature, I was genuinely curious, it was their assessments that led me to believe that I was going to witness something astonishing, otherworldly, something that goes beyond normalcy.Alas! My experience with the movie came to be extensively different.With all due respect to the creators as well as all those people who have had their fair share of fun and entertainment; I find this effort to be rather average. If I put its visceral presentation and the brilliant performance delivered by none other than Rishab Shetty on one side; there's barely anything that caught my interest.The story is generic, the characterizations lack a certain insightfulness (barring Shiva) and on top of all, the screenplay here is unnecessarily elongated which not only made things more complicated but it also made me relish its intricacies far less than I expected.",

This may seem superstitious and even scary initially, but it's okay, believe me, even I felt or used to feel the same. My humble request to the audience who are not familiar with this tradition, is that you to do a small research into 'Bhoota Kola' , 'Panjurli' and 'Guliga' daivas...this would make your experience and understanding this movie more enjoyable!.This movie is a masterpiece trying to bring out the hidden, often misunderstood traditions into the mainstream. This is the reality, who many people in our country are not aware and it's absolutely okay.

In the name of 'mythology', main character dreams about a boar like every 30 minute for 10 seconds, that's it.In my opinions it is a typical South Indian movie with mild references to Hindu mythology.The ratings are result from bombardment of 10 rating by the people who are influenced by the culture shown in movie, not by story itself. I have been watching movies based on ratings and reviews on IMDB since 2008 and it has been quite helpful. Now a days you can't trust IMDB rating because now new movies are often full of fake ratings like this one. Its should be rated not more than 7.5/10 according to the story.Hope, my review helps!

If the unknown power could kill someone on court footsteps then why the landlord wasn't killed the same way? It just doesn't seem to make any sense.",

            "content": "Happened to Watch Kantara (Forest), in a jampacked houseful show. Weekend was a red zone for this movie beating PS1, and Vikram Vedha in Bangalore. I had to travel 16 KM to HSR Thirumala. But all efforts were worth !Kantara is absolutely breath taking, I some how liked more than KGF. Its a next venture of Homable films after KGF chapter 2Kantara is an epitome of how Rishab Shetty as an Actor, DIrector and Writer finds his place is the same film. I always admired Rishab shetty for his excellent story creation and direction, From Kirik Party, Kasargodu Shaale and as an Actor in many.Starting with the story, Kantara is a fight between good and evil, sometimes the god, sometimes the people of the forest. Eventually at the end, the god wins always, it is crafted with a touch of Boota Kola a worship from Tulu nadu - Malanadu and Northern Kerala. It resembles the Theyyam art as well. Just like the demographic picturization , kantara shot in Dakshin Karnataka forest area, the crew made an intense research on Art, Music and folklore in Kundapura to all the way Kasargod. Hence the location, Cinematography, Art all were treat for the eye.Acting cannot be ruled out, Rishab as a main lead was excellent, Kishore did his career best role. Achyuth Kumar, Pramod Shetty, Swaraj Shetty - all were perfect cast.Another best thing about this movie is the music , its a mixture of folklore - jaanapada a form of folk song , ajaneesh loknath is the music director. Some of the songs will give us the goosebumps.In all words, Kantara is a story of Uprising of a Forest against its exploiters. The movie, especially the climax is an Adrenaline Rush !Well made! 9/10.",

            "content": "I watched Kantara (orig. Kannada w/Eng. Subs.) on Prime Video with great expectations given the almost 9/10 imdb rating and so much hype and publicity. The film was overall a big let down and one wonders about the rating system!The Good Parts:The last segment perhaps 45mn, was brilliant where the protagonist Shiva (Rishab Shetty) becomes the Bhoota Kola ritual performer going into a superbly enacted trance.The prologue is also well filmed introducing the background to the plot, where the King of old gives his vast land and forests to the original Adivasi forest dwellers in return for experiencing the divine through the Bhoota Kola ritual; later generations of the Zamindar are shown going to court to get back the land but die at the footsteps as per the curse.The Bhoota Kola shamanic traditions of the region (Tuluvanadu) are well depicted as is the local Kambala harvest festival. This indeed has created interest in a large section of the public to learn more about such ancient rituals which are practised in several forms in old communities world wide as in India.The evils of casteism are well depicted where the \"upper caste\" landlord to look good invites the so called \"lower caste\" villagers to his home but once they leave, the house is ritually cleansed :-(((Conflicts between the forest department and the original forest dwellers which is also a present day issue in many forested parts of India, was also quite well depicted.The music is quite good. Apparently the music of the chart busting Varaha Roopam song is changed in OTT from the cinema version due to a court order vis a vis the plagiarism charge by the band Thaikkudam Bridge for their original song Navarasam. Hombale Films who admit to being \"inspired\" by Navarasam, could easily have settled this issue amicably with T. Bridge! I was also reminded by one of the other songs, of something vaguely from Bollywood. Not to mention certain scenes reminded me of scenes from the recent Telugu blockbuster film Pushpa.The Mediocre Parts:The overall narration between the introduction and the finale which was the core length of the film, did not hold the interest. Some frames were actually boring and quite fast forwardable.There were far too many scenes of violence, albeit slickly choreographed, undoubtedly will appeal to action lovers.Though there were some humorous dialogues, the absence of correct comedic timing spoilt the punchline.Excessive frames of felling the forest as a mode of protest gives a very wrong message to an impressionable public.Summary: Overhyped film. A shorter length, tighter narration and less of the action / violence would have made Kantara a much better production. Anyway, the massive box office profits have surely made the producers very happy !",

            "content": "Firstly i watched the Tamil dubbed version . Having come from Tamil films , there was not much of a story except the usual mainstream ( one line story : A rich man tried to oppress the poor and the fight for land rights), no script, no meaningful dialogue delivery. And the main part, culture ; They failed to show the richness of culture maybe only except in small parts. The main positive aspect about this film are the good visuals and the authentic rural setting.So many people will be offended but the truth is, movie is just on the the average. However is nothing special in this film which we never saw in Tamil Hindi or Telegu films which at most times have much fleshed put e story lines. Its hard to understand what the fuss is about regarding this film. For most part of the film , the politics between different groups of people regarding the aquisition of the land is portrayed. However it would have been much better if the major parts of the film concentrated on the greatness of and mystique of the protector deity.The acting performances are very typical of Kannada films . The first half a dragging storyline and comedy with quirky one-liners of cheap grade films in the 1990s. The fight scenes are not inspiring except for the final scene where it feels slightly better.. It has some decent music and cinemamatography that is not unlike other films in Tamil or Telegu. And thats about as much positive as u can get . Otherwise it is a an average film with as compared with other regional films.",

Without this song the movie is just \"mehh\".Most of the acting atleast for me is overdramatic.. it's mostly overreaction to situations.. and the situation being a typical land mafia vs local tribals cause which just ends abruptly. The culture depicted in the movie is the USP it again seems to be heavily copied or inspired from the navarasam plot and without this song the movie has not meaning at all. 10/10 for the song.. 5/10 for rest of the movie. But finding out that it's copied and production house not giving any credit to the original creators and victim of this daylight robbery, I would put down some points and say that this movie doesn't deserve to be called a win.",

Before you express your love for this character and story, what will you say for these things?1) You will respect a hero only if he wins in competitions? And not just 1. All.This hero always wins every game. Why?Is it bad to lose in games? What is wrong in showing that a hero can lose as well?A mature man accepts defeat and tries again. A mature man doesn't feel bad when defeated. He just tries a different way.The more you give 10 stars to animal heroes, the more they will appear in the movies.2) What do you feel about respect for women? Hero constantly harasses the woman and even pinches her. She's shown as nothing more than a sex object.I've never seen a single kannadiga or outsider doing this to a woman. Then why are we showing such cheap characters?All the locals who love this movie. Do you not care how your women are treated? Imagine if your daughter, sister, mother, cousin were pinched on her waist like this. If you won't like that then why are you giving this movie a 10 stars?3) Entire movie hero is shouting \"woohaaa, woohaaa\". Does that show a mature man or an animal man?Everyone is saying this movie shows Karnataka culture. How many men have you seen in Karnataka who go around jumping like monkeys and fighting like goons the entire day?Imagine Bengaluru if all men were wild like this. Imagine any Karnataka village if men were wild like this. Will it look like civilized place or like caveman days?STOP encouraging gundas in the movie. STOP giving 10 star for animal characters. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f4) You will respect a hero only if he wins every fight, is it?

I kept waiting all this time for the story to pick up and for the film to get better and engaging but it never did. The protagonist is someone I couldn't root for at all. I sat down again later to complete the film in the hope to understand the hype. The cinematography and setup in some scenes is very brilliant specially those showing the ancient ritualistic practices involving the demi God and the Kola dance but that's about it.

Snoozefest for how boring it was and headache for how boring it became and how i just wanted to leave the theatre and wishing for the climax to come as fast as possible.The movie plot is as generic as it can get we have thousands of movies with similar plot. Hero , Villian , Poor Rich , Village and Politicians. The movie met every criteria for how generic a plot can be written. The director actor producer didn't let anything distract him from writing such a plot which we have seen from last 30 years or more.The love story omg literally horrible and totally irrelevant didn't contributed anything for the plot it was just there to stretch the already way long movie . The first half was boring af but i still had some hope that second half might revive it but it became unbearable and i was sleeping in action scenes too and waiting for the climax. The love story had typical harrassment scenes which were romanticized as the heroine also didn't had any problem with . The comedy was also extremely forced and cringe like i was watching some 90's comedy movie. Acting was crap in many scenes apart from the Cop and Rishabh. Many scenes were like why is it even there , no need of those scenes they were just put to cross the 2 hour mark maybe for some reason. The heroine was completely useless as i said the love story didn't contributed even a bit .Everything can't be bad surely. The climax was good ( not great for sure ) the acting was great though which elevated the scene but i have seen such performance from Dhanush already in a much grounded version named Asuran which had similar plot but was much much better than this. Even people comparing it with a masterpiece like Tumbadd lol this is not even 10% of what that movie was .

What is the message?For me the message was that you can be a horrible human being in the name of tradition/culture and you can get away with abusive behaviour, destroying the environment, killing wild and endangered animals, excessive drinking and objectifying women.The main character who is supposedly this \"legend\" is about, and who is titled a \"hero\" is having anger issues, physically abusive, has a drinking and weed problem, exploits nature for his own agenda/benefit oh and has a raging fit when he doesn't win.At the beginning of this movie I thought it had great potential, and that it will make you think about the fragile balance of living with nature. Well it didn't.The environmental officer who is very reasonably tried to protect the jungle was (almost) portrayed as the \"bad guy\".It also had many many clich\u00e9s that you seen in thousands of Indian movies. Seriously why the villan always look exactly the same? I am sure we all knew who is going to be the villain from the first time they showed him to us.In conclusion I would have loved this movie, if the story is at least coherent and that it had some positive message. But unfortunately, that wasn't the case.Also I kinda feel like the positive comments here are the same and they might have been paid to say it was a good movie?Hard pass for me.",

            "content": "I'm probably in the minority here, but Kantara is a film that has the chosen one template written all over it. The protagonist is a typical ruffian who blindly supports the landlord (the obvious bad guy, if you sharply observed the first act), opposes the police officer who goes by the rule-book, and is oddly connected to the lore of the land. It has a fantastic opening stretch (the plagiarized music has been replaced with something less impactful on OTT streaming) where elements of magical realism are effectively positioned. Right from the moment the protagonist was introduced and his arc commenced, I tuned out. The extremely drab romance (nothing unusual in masala films), the generic \"oppose-the-cop\" narrative, and the vain attempts at humour had me woah-ing (in a distasteful way) more than the demigod itself. The less said about the women characters, the better.Thankfully, the film redeems itself somewhat in its final act. I was able to let some aspects in the screenplay (such as the underwritten cop character suddenly having a change of mind, the predictable twist) slide for the sake of the stunningly choreographed set-pieces. The feudal and casteist angles (the villagers not allowed to enter the landlord's house) are frequent motifs but not strongly written or depicted to evoke a \"fight back\" feeling. I think Rishab Shetty spent a little too much time in the film's mid-portions where nothing noteworthy was being conveyed. I'm sure the material connects with the people from coastal Karnataka a lot better. It is essentially a film made by them, for them.",

Hero drinks, smokes , hunts wild boars(new in this movie) teases women and it's made to look cool. Hero has a lover. Hero has romantic songs. Hero as usual can beat 20plus guys alone with his hands. The hero gets angry and keeps screaming screaming everytime for silly reason. The story is also usual rich vs poor.

Instead, the main concept has not been given too much time on screen. Rather, a lot of time, the story revolves around the daily tasks of the main protagonist, the village politics and lot of other things, which is rather unnecessary. The movie could have been atleast 45 minutes shorter by taking out the unnecessary parts. Instead they could have revolved more around the mysterious concept and created a masterclass.I would compare this with Tumbbad (Both mysteries, but completely different concepts). That movie is a masterclass, with no unnecessary hoolabaloo and delivering on point with mystery and thrill.Personally, i prefer a slower pace, giving some time for character development. The fast paced story telling is simply not for me.There are still quite a few good moments in this movie. The jumpscares are pretty good. (There are only a couple of them). Although, script could have been better, the actors have done a very good job. Fight scenes (mandatory in every South Indian movie. Don't understand why) are good.The scenes of the summoning of the Demigod especially has been done very well.Overall, the movie is a good watch, but could have really done much better with better writing and editing. I would have loved to see more of Demigod Panjurli. But all we get is a few fleeting scenes and the last scene.",

It doesn't match the buzz it carries, it's utterly disappointing.Keep ur expectations low if u still want to watch it and waste ur time. VFX are poor , performances are not great.

            "content": "A king, who thinks he is not happy. (I didn't get it)\nHe travels his own properties to look for happiness. (Here I asked myself, whoa, am I still happy? LOL)\nHe encounters an object; he becomes happy right at that moment. (I don't know, who understand it)\nThe dwellers, who look like a group of tribals, not actually villagers, suddenly appear. When the king wants that object and promises to give them anything they want in exchange for that. The villagers (more wild than general villagers) want the properties in exchange for happiness. That is, the villagers will give the king happiness/the object, but he has to give the jungle properties to the dwellers.Here I have listened to hoarse screams, I have seen everything, the object, the king, the villagers, but I didn't see the happiness.When the next generation claim the properties back, a dancer, but the villagers consider him God-like, vanishes without trace. It is not clear to me, who is the pig? Is that vanished dancer who born again as a pig. However, the demigod of the 2nd generation was the father of 3rd generation hero.The 2nd generation claimer dies without reason (some will say it is because of the villagers' curse). (I don't think it exists)Then the story starts with the 3rd generation of two parties.I won't repeat the story. The thing that disturbed me was that the 3rd generation claimer is a very good person in the entire movie. But suddenly becomes rude and violent (as if, the writer can write anything any moment), on the other hand, the (rude and bad) policeman becomes so gentle suddenly, despite almost killed by the 'hero' (as if, the writer can write anything any moment).Many are dying in the battle no one cares, but when a fatso (a joker friend of hero who has nothing to do with the story) dies, everyone after him.The hero is a superman, he can fight even with 100 and win despite taking (sedative charas, we called it ganja). This superman almost dies, but suddenly a ghost appears within him, he screams and screams, as if he is trying to make his viewers laugh. This superman cum ghost cum that dancer which vanished in the 2nd generation moment fix everything. And the villagers don't have to leave their homes.Then without any reason, the hero vanished like him, I already told twice who vanished.I don't know why this crap is called a masterpiece. What have other viewers found in this average movie but I don't find them. Very much overrated and overhyped. I think it is marketing (hype) which makes it very enjoyable for some masterpiece callers (or maybe paid reviewers and paid ratings).The hero has no quality of being a hero of a movie, I am not talking about the actor, I am talking about writing. How a hero who takes weed, kills animals, destroys jungle, makes chaos with the police, wrongfully.In some cases, the property owner has the right to get his property back. It is the villagers who wrongfully occupied the property.In one scene the 3rd generation son told his disabled son that, \"there was a king who was disabled like you\". It makes a point. Why a king would find happiness? What kind of nature of a person is this? Why would he find lots of happiness in an object? The villagers and the dancer cum demigod misguide the king and thus occupied his properties.Okay, let finish it, some I like are, the heroine, the jungle and some comedy.1 out of 5. Not recommended.",

The pacing was slow, dragging on for what felt like an eternity, and I found myself checking my watch multiple times. The cinematography was average, failing to add any flair or creativity to the film.However, the movie wasn't a complete disappointment. There were a few scenes that stood out, keeping me engaged and on the edge of my seat. But unfortunately, these moments were few and far between, and they weren't enough to save the film as a whole. The script was weak, the dialogue was clunky, and the humor fell flat. The characters were one-dimensional, and their relationships were not well-explored.The movie's soundtrack was forgettable, failing to add any depth or emotion to the film. The ending was unsatisfying, feeling rushed and leaving loose ends untied.Overall, this movie was a letdown. It was average at best, lacking the depth and impact that makes a great film. It's not a must-watch, but if you're looking for something to pass the time, it's worth a watch.

I watched the whole movie with that expectation. But me and many others were definitely misled. The movie is nothing but a loud action over-the-top south Indian flick. Maybe people have put their divine and spiritual view while watching but as a true movie buff who appreciates movies irrespective of the language, i can say it is totally disappointing. The climax people are praising about is so loud i had to close my ears. I just couldn't find a single person in the theatre who was satisfied with the movie. I can see why good Indian movies are not appreciated as these bogus movies are.. sole reason is that 80% people don't apply their own senses and just follow the herd. Praise whatever majority praise and boycott whatever majority says. No brains applied.",

But for the most part of the movie, it adds an authentic representation of the culture and dialects of Tulu Nadu tribes engagingly to create a fresh perspective of it. The film does have some outdated comedic moments repeating that don't work for me at all, and a few things that are added for commercialization. There were also some twists and turns without proper exploration which just felt convenient. But even with all those problems, this film is one of the best films of the year.The film works at its best when it focuses on the mystical aspects which was glorious. Those sequences made the film what it is for me, but they were too few and I would've wanted to see more of that. The cinematography and music really worked hand in hand to make the movie as impactful as it is. The climax sequences used the audio-visual potential of the medium in a masala genre to portray the mystic mythology of the land which was absolutely ecstatic to watch.",

The start was okayish, with clean graphics, not overkilling the experience and what followed after the start was an ABSOLUTE nightmare!!!!The film does not have anything to offer than a lame story of feudal lords exploiting the poor. The execution is also so pathetic that it does not go above the mediocre level. This was the point I was waiting anxiously for the climax, for all the hype surrounding the finale and Rishab's performance.The climax was even disastrous, not sure what kind of performance was that from Rishab, it was just average and at times the loud scream was irritating, I did not feel any divinity in this movie at all, it was far far away to bring peace within me, I was irritated and broken to see a failed movie being celebrated like a cult classic.Nowadays, the greatest fear is checking social media reviews for sincere opinions. It was an equal embarrassment to face my family as I did promise them amusing folklore, and it turned out to be a nightmare!Kindly stay away, and watch it on OTT, if you have leisure time!",

And when the climax came, we wondered what the fuss was all about. Everything was so predictable and nothing was new.

The theme of the bands song itself seems like the movie plot. If this is true then the production house should apologize and give credit to the creators.

            "content": "Kantara (2022) :\nMovie Review -Rishabh Shetty's Kantara is making a lot of waves outside the Kannada border, and rightly so. Kannada cinema gave a loud and faulty mass entertainer like the KGF franchise and reached every corner of the nation, and to some extent, of the world. But how many moviegoers in India know that Sandalwood has made much better films? Let's keep others aside for a moment and take Rishabh Shetty's films, for instance. From \"Lucia\" (2013) to \"Ulidavaru Kandanthe\" (2014), \"Kirik Party\" (2016), \"Sarkari Hi Pra Shaale\" (2018), and \"Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana\" (2021). He has done so many quality films as an actor and director, but all we care about is KGF (outside Kannada market). That's unfortunate, but thankfully we have some sensible critics and movie buffs who make these unknown films famous. The quality of these films is way ahead of KGF, but the hype isn't. Well, this is the same case everywhere, be it any cinema industry across the globe. Let's just hope that this picture will change in our digital era so that filmmakers will be encouraged to make some really solid films. Kantara happens to be one of those films, and coincidentally, it came in the same year as \"RRR\". Now what's the connection between these two films? I'll tell you soon.Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana was set in a crime world but used the local traditions and spiritual beliefs to present the same old crime-noir-tale in a new way. In the same way, Kantara attempts to be a socially important film by trying to be spiritually extra powerful. The film captures spiritual and superstitious essences in the simplest possible way, while the visually astonishing climax covers most of its flaws. We have had some recent films talking about the importance of animals and forests, but believe me, none of them had a spellbinding climax like Kantara. Had it not been for the spiritual phenomena in the climax scene, Kantara might have ended up way behind the line. One can even say that it is another version of RRR trying to be religiously powerful with a larger-than-life superfictional extravaganza.Kantara is set in a South Kannada village where demigods are believed to be the guardians and their energies encircle. The land has been protected by the demigods for years, but now modern civilization is there to hunt for development. Shiva (Rishab Shetty) belongs to the family of demigods, who performs Bhootha Kola in the village. His father did it until his death, and now his brother is carrying on the family tradition. Unable to get over his father's death, Shiva sees horrible visions regularly. A new forest officer, Murali (Kishore), takes charge of the village and starts a crossing battle with Shiva for protesting against redevelopment. Shiva gets support from the landlord (Achyuth Kumar), who is everyone's favourite. The entire narrative revolves around the land and what surprises it has for you can't be revealed here.Even though it's a predictable story, Kantara still manages to hold your attention with its rural set-up. The screenplay is messy from the start but thankfully reaches the destination on a strong note. While doing so, it fails to explain many things, including the intellectual social speeches at the end. Like I said, RRR and this film have some similarities, and the concrete writing is definitely one of them. RRR missed logical statistics, and Kantara is no different. In that film, you saw Ram Charan transforming into Lord Ram in the clikax, while here you see Rishabh converting into a demigod. How? Please don't ask.It's not just about this spiritual sequence, but even many normal scenes lack logic. Rishab's fight scene with the FO was so childish. I mean, the guy literally beat 15-20 people and yet the officer didn't shoot. And when he did, he just left him helpless. Shiva too seemed helpless there, and did nothing. What logic was there? Even in the climax, you have our villain sitting on the chair, shooting men off while the entire village group is standing up against the gang of goons, just like we had the Avengers vs. Thanos army in \"Avengers Endgame\". Don't ask me if the villain kills the hero. I mean, that's just too outdated.Now coming to the most amazing part of the film: the acting. Rishabh Shetty as Shiva will go down in memory lane as one of the greatest performances by any Kannada actor of his generation, and all thanks to the astonishing act in the last 10 minutes. He is just mind-blowing there. Kishore gave me a feel of The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) sometimes, but that only helped to improve my viewing experience. Sapthami Gowda's character looks so real and organic. Why don't we have such realistic heroines in every film? The romance was a little too much, unnecessarily, but loved chemistry with Rishabh in some scenes. The supporting cast is highly commendable, including Achyuth Kumar, Pramod Shetty, Manasi Sudhir, Shamol Guru, Prakash Thuminad and Swaraj Shetty.Kantara is quite a long film, and that's why it gets a little boring somewhere in the middle. The screenplay runs without any motive, and hence it hurts the repeat value of the film. If you ever feel like watching this film a second time, I am sure you will not watch the entire 150-minute film. You will just see the last 10 minutes and forget the rest of the 145 minutes. How good is that climax, though. Goosebumps! The music should have been better, especially with romantic songs. Oh gosh, how much I missed that \"Sojugada Sooju Malinge\" here.. Nevertheless, the background score satisfied my hunger.The cinematography is fantastic, but the editing could have been more crisp. Rishab Shetty has made a film that no Kannada villager will ever forget. The cultural and traditional values are kept too high by the director. \"Rangi Taranga\" had done it previously, but Kantara is a level up because of the importance of the issue it handles. Rarely do we see classes and masses both shouting in the cinema halls, and Kantara's conclusive part made that rare thing possible. Overall, a worthy flick with some amazing sequences for a modern Kannada cinema that sets the bar for other industries. Indeed, recommended.",

This movie is like something you have already seen except the last 10 minutes. Last few minutes were the only true deserving moments where this movie is creating so much buzz around. The acting is top notch. But the story was normal. I have already seen many movies with this type of story. Many people are trying to emphasize on the fact that this movie has shown the beauty of the respected culture. It was shown indeed but not much enough. So overall I want to say that this movie was overhyped by the people who blindly supports South Indian movies and think that if a particular movie is from South,then it has to be good. Even I am a South Indian,but I didn't liked movies like Pushpa,KGF 2. They don't even deserve the ratings of 8/10.",

The culture and traditions, rituals depicted are top class and depicted nicely but that's not what the movie is entirely about. I have heard the theater experience is excellent for the last song in the movie and probably that's where all the love and hype comes from. But movie as a whole is nothing substantial and pretty basic. Acting at the end is beautiful but otherwise I'd say it a bit over the fence. Nothing extraordinary and we need to set good benchmarks.",

            "content": "Kantara is a period action movie focused on the conflict within a forest village between a hot headed hunter and Kambala champion Shiva and forest ranger Murali. The movie glorifies animal cruelty as Shiva takes passion from exploiting bulls and happiness from killing animals. The landlord Devendra is his close friend and supporter, and Shiva constantly becomes a thorn on Murali's side. When Murali calls out Shiva's violent practices that endanger the forest wildlife or consume it's resources he and the villagers get into fights, not only with him but Shiva's temper causes him to fight other villagers. He also starts overhunting for fun and cutting down trees just to piss Murali off, which eventually leads to him getting arrested when he nearly kills Murali. All in all this is the majority of the movie, the potential here is that Shiva could have been humbled and reformed from his violent actions, specifically if the village demigod Panjurli taught him. Murali also could have been less violent and explained his cause for safeguarding the forest. The movie is dragged out with this until it's revealed in a twist that Devendra was trying to acquire the land for himself out of greed, and Murali and Shiva quickly have a rushed reform despite the lack of reason too, as they had hurt each other not too long ago. When Devendra gathers men to try to destroy the village Shiva, Murali, and their armies clash with his, and Shiva gets possessed by Panjurli to defeat Devendra. The premise is good but the plot and execution is extremely bland, there was room for character development for interesting characters but nothing as such happened. Shiva was a firm believer in Panjurli, he could have started out as flawed and violent but learned an emotional lesson. Murali became friends with the villagers too quickly and was more victimized by Shiva, but he's still a villain. Shiva's girlfriend Leela could have been conflicted trying to settle the war. Devendra worked and the final battle between him and the villagers/rangers was good, but that was it. The rest of the movie was quite boring and I could have easily improved the plot. I'm confused at why this has acclaim and I believe this of all movies does not remotely deserve it. This is not worth watching, but if you really want to, go for it.",

            "content": "Don't get me wrong... Kantara is an extreme well executed movie with an amazing bgm and a few extremely engaging scenes. You simply cannot forget the scenes with the demigod as they have intense visuals that are very frightening.With a 10-15 crore budget, this movie surpassed all expectations. But to say that it is 'the best movie in cinema' and that it is miles beyond films like RRR and Baahubali is incorrect. Some people even claim that Kantara deserves an Oscar. This is what I have a problem with, considering its numerous flaws:1) Underuse of the demigod:Scenes with the demigod are captivating and kept me hooked to the movie. Especially the amazing start that featured the demigod and the villagers. But after that, the movie becomes, at best, average. Focusing more on the character and the unnecessary romance was a BIG mistake. Instead, if the film provided a backstory to the demigods and included a couple of more scenes featuring the demigod, the story would have been much more engaging.2) Overacting and unnecessary fight scenes:Scenes involving Shiva's mother reminded me of Balamani played by Ramya Krishnan in Liger. The overacting and irritating dialogues simply gave me a headache.Also, there were several fight scenes that seemed unnecessary. By removing them and focusing more on the demigod, they could have significantly upped the storyline.3) The climaxAlthough the climax was extremely well executed, it was quite predictable. With the hype Kanatara has received in the past few days, I expected something unimaginable and out of the world. But the output was very predictable and straight forward.Also, the fight between the villagers and goons could have been reduced and the display of a possessed Shiva could have been stretched. Also, the demigod should have been presented more frequently in the climax.Overall, I give this movie 7/10, considering its low budget. It was slightly better than average and could have been made grand by using the demigod more frequently.",

This film didn't have to be paced like KGF but it is. And it is in this pacing of the film that it loses subtlety and depth. It is this attempt to be everything at once that derails the film's possibility of being better than what it is. The film really stands out for the spirited performances of the cast, they elevate it to a whole new level and thats what keeps us spellbound. Some great drama here. Could have done with a bit more cinema.",

The actions are good and so is dramatization but so many loose plots without any meaningful plot. The actors are ok, special effects are good however this is not worth the hype at all. Visually the scenes are good. Without any sensible display the police keeps changing its action- at one moment seems villain and suddenly changes tack and becomes supportive of villagers. The pace is good and things keep happening but in the end overall nothing special and left me hugely disappointed.",

Never felt excited to know what's going to happen next. It's a masala movie May be will be better enjoyed in a community drama setting! If the movie has a king and is not based on history or an epic then it's hard to digest at this time and age!Some people may argue about special effect, cinematography, blah, blah! My answer to that is you bought all the expensive meat and vegetables, put a lot of food color but you don't know how to cook . You even forgot to put salt!Please stop overhyping movies like this, KGF, Pushpa..,",

            "content": "Today I went for VR cinema theatre to watch Kantara and I must say that this is a gamechanger and masterpiece movie like K. G. F series. It has blended various genres like action, horror, fantasy, thriller and other commercial masala elements to engage the audience and it can be call it as a new-gen masala film by introducing popular folklore culture in Udupi/Mangalore, which we haven't witness in other films.Rishab Shetty is the powerhouse of this entertainer with his mannerism, comic timing and body language (in the climax last 30 minutes) is superb and also excels as a master storyteller who tells a predictable and simple plot in an engaging way and the showcase of Bhoota Kola culture deserves a standing ovation. Sapthami Gowda is also good but her character isn't etched well. Kishore is also superb and deserves applause for his acting and their rovalry in the film reminds of Karnan and recent Malayalam blockbusters like Ayyappanum Koshiyum and Kaduva. Achyuth Kumar is also brilliant in the film and watch out for his character twist in the climax. Pramod Shetty, Prakash Thuminad and other actors comic timing is superb and evoked funny bones.Action sequences are the USP of this film and is well choreographed by Vikram More (who also worked in K. G. F Chapter 1), the 30 minutes war scene, the Kambala race fight and interval were goosebumps worthy and makes the audience to watch it again. Cinematography by Arvind S. Kashyap is superb as they showcased Bhoota Kola culture in a good way. Editing by K. M. Prakash and Pratheek Shetty were also superb. Musical score and soundtrack by B. Ajaneesh Lokanath was good, though one song \"Singara Siriye\" was good, others were below-average, but the musical score (bgm) was praiseworthy. Direction was awesome in the film as Rishab Shetty perfected a cultural film with commercial elements to enthrall Karnataka and foreign audiences.Overall, Kantara is an engaging action thriller with masala elements, comic-dialogues, simple plot, entertainment value, action sequences and good performances makes it so enjoyable and feel that it is not a routine film at all. The film is worthy-watch in Cinemas instead of OTT. So go grab a ticket and buy a popcorn and watch this action-packed entertainer, you will be happy. Don't regret yourself as you didn't watch it in theatres and watch it in IMAX. After watching the film, i felt that this was very engaging like K. G. F.",

This made us keep our focus and relax at the same time. Every character is trying to bring something onto the table. And all of a sudden there was a murder for no reason, this perplexed us. And the story takes a turn with this.The final 20-30mins was in vibrant mode. Literally all of us were resonating by absorbing the final enact.The movie started off with a short story, then it let us audience settle down but with an occasional & random surprise.

            "content": "Kantara\nA movie review by Rajesh PuvvadaA casual conversation lead me to a movie recommendation, and that's how I chose to go to Kantara. I tried for the tickets for this Kannada movie in Pune, and trust me I could not find a decent seat in any of the theaters. They were all almost full this morning. Finally I got a decent Gold class seat for a late night show. I chose to book the expensive ticket against the option of watching this movie in the forthcoming weekend. Don't ask the logic behind this decision. I had a gut feel and urge to watch at the earliest.The movie commences wonderfully with a flashback. Artwork, cinematography, costumes and the cast were a perfect fit. Usually art work takes a back seat at Kannada movies, may be due to budget constraints, but for this movie the thought process towards the artwork was fabulous. A narrative will guide you for sometime until the cast speak up, I felt the narrative was paced, there was a palpable urgency in it. That's not a deterrent.The movie spins around the belief system. The traditional \"Bootha Kola\" and the associated beliefs. The initial song is a fusion of Carnatic and softrock to a \"Bootha Kola\" performance. Though it sounds offbeat, the combo was fantastic.Trust me, the movie will grasp you into its fold. The amount of detail they have presented about the life and times living with the forest range, the kind of language, expressions, the day to day lifestyle was absolutely brilliant. I did not understand the dialect of Kannada the movie mostly carries, but it not bother me at all. My eyes were switching quickly between the subtitles and the scenes and I never wanted the movie to release me from its grasp.Rishabh Shetty, aces his performance as the current generations protagonist. The accent, the facial expressions and the screen presence was never falling short at the same time it was not overdone either. It was well balanced. He lives into the character and made me to live in his world. His side kicks and the cast around him played aptly.Achyuth Kumar peaks in his role delivery at the end of the movie. His portrayal is that friendly, approachable and cool headed landlord and he delivers it quite well.The choice of the heroine can never be underestimated. I am sure Sapthami Gowda is a new kid on the block, but she plays her part decently well.As usual Kishore Kumar plays his role as a rough conservationist well. In my view he is the most unsung roughies in the film industry. I have seen him deliver decent performances in Vada Chennai, Ponniyin Selvan, She (OTT TV series), Sarpatta Parambarai etc..,. You can never ignore his presence in any of the movies mentioned above. Yet no one speaks much about him after watching the movies. I would probably would like to raise a toast for this actor.The conflict between greed, god fearing traditional believers and the science based environmentalists is what the movie's plot is all about. Though the traditional beliefs are questioned flippantly, once in a while the belief system shows its existence by the acts of nature or by the mysteries in a thick forest or like a intense dream. I appreciate the smartness in handling of this mysteries in a very natural and a logical way.Greed will never win the might of the traditional believers and the environment conservators, together.Its after a very long time I had a very strange feeling while watching this movie. That is, I never wanted this movie to end. I wanted to remain in the strong grip of the movie. I have a longing to get back into its grasp this weekend.The underlying message of the movie is not to remain flippant about traditional beliefs and rituals while working along with the people who have the common purpose. I enjoyed this every bit.I am going with a 9.5 /10. I don't know when I gave such a rating before.Just ensure you Live in the grasp of this movie, over and over again. Kudos to Kanada Cinema, its a harbinger of good times to come for this industry.",

The male protagonist drinks liquor, kills wild animals, smokes weed, objectifies woman and engages in deforestation and extreme violence. There is no social message of why all this is wrong and might be an encouragement for the viewers to indulge in these malpractices. Few of the scenes are absolutely cringy and the script is predictable. The writing is loose at my parts of the movie. I waited for months to watch this movie but I am very disappointed with all the hype around it. Still could not understand how this was a spiritual experience for many people.",

            "content": "Deeply rooted in local folklore, mysticism set against a fictional backdrop of a village in southern india, this movie thread a fine line between period social issues, man's relationship with God and Nature.There is a lot of maturity with which the story and cinematography has been handled. Movie was beautifully shot in picturesque locales, stunning pan-shots and aerial shots unlike most jarring, epilepsy inducing Indian cinema. The soundtrack helps us transcend the visual experience to a surreal experience which is just as well implied by the raw dog performance rishab Shetty delivers.Rishab Shetty is the star of the show - no contest. We are lucky to be alive to witness this bombastic performance by Mr Shetty, but a word needs to be said about Prakash thuminad who always keeps us entertained his quirky, slapstick-witty dialogue. Kudos to the writes to involve all the navarasas in both writing and sound design.There is no other Indian movie like Kantara. I'm glad this movie released in 2022, just so it opens the eyes of all those pretentious western reviewers and Indian alike how mediocre of a movie RRR was and the farce they took part in.THIS IS INDIAN CINEMA!After watching the film over 8 times, in multiple languages - I strongly suggest Kannada followed by telugu as the best versions. Hindi version imo is poorly translated.Since most have finished watching Kantara, here is how I interpreted the movie with all it's parallels.1. Lead character is Shiva. Both a destructive personality and a protector all in one character. This is evident with his protective nature kicking in in the 2nd half, destructive in the first. Duality of man personified.2. Shiva in relation to Leela. In a grand sense the movie ends with the story being told to shiva's son, on the whole becoming a Shiva-leela.3. Murali - named appropriately is the forest officer. His sole job being the preserver of the forest runs parallel to his namesake Vishnu.4. Kailasa - where shiva resides.5. Mahadev - another nod to the wise lord shiva consuming ganja, but wise. He shows the way and leads the blind i.e Shiva.6. Devendra - the antagonist shares a name with Indra deva, who is most often associated with trickery, fondness for alcohol. Indra by mythology is also the reason for poison that comes from churning the ocean. The poison that lord shiva takes in, so the rest can have the amrut.7. When the celebration of kola starts in 3rd act, an interesting dialogue occurs. The nalike (patron who dons the role of a palaka) asks \"O preist - O landlord, what do you think lies ahead for you?\"\nthey reply, if it is poison we ask our kshetrapalas to take it, if it is amrut - please confer it on us.This is a chekovs gun. Nothing in this movie happens without a reason, and As per the principle, you will see both how the poison that is let upon the village taken full on by the palaka, and the call back to the sword of the king in first act.8. The demigod in first act is Panjurli. The demigod in final act is Guliga.The characters are so well written that you can see the maturity of panjurli in the first act, and the devastative guliga in the last act.Guliga is always hungry, that's the reason for his primary havoc. Only feeding him can calm him.When the final act begins, the injury on the head is symbolic of opening the third eye, which is usually followed by destruction of evil. The opening shot of guliga begins with a stopped fire torch attack, this followed by fully concious wanton movements.That begins the avahana and the initial arati. The torches are always held close to the body as the belief is such that the spirit shouldn't escape the medium into the material world.After that shot, you see guliga beat up the small fry following which begins the hunger. That's when the villagers start the naivedyam to calm him. Once calm, the usual proceedings continue.. Emding with Justice dished out.9. The final kola doesn't happen immediately after the last fight sequence, as Leela is now pregnant it must be about 7 to 8 months into the future.The final closing scene is not only the reunion of father and son, but also iconically panjurli and guliga. The disappearing Shiva in final act not only strengths the belief in the local legend, it confers legitimacy to everything that happens to the shiva during the final act and what he did to Devendra.10. Staying true to the name, the movie ends as a legend.PS : The sound \"Whoa\" is not a gimmick. Guliga kola involves making sounds that mimic sounds a wild boar makes. The closest reproduction of the sound a boar grunt makes is the interpreted whoaa. Kola is all gestures and sounds.This movie truly is a work of art. This will always be in my global top 10.",

Even after wasting so much money, Bollywood can never make such a film. I think so. Rishabh Shetty is a versatile actor.Rishabh Safety transformation is shown in the ending scene of the movie. Rishab Shetty transfers himself to 'Daiva's. Then you will know how much effort went into making this movie!The tribal life and customs of the village are depicted so well in this movie that you will be mesmerized to see it.",

Shetty is also the writer and lead actor of the film. As screenwriter, his output is probably just a touch shy of being perfect, but the script has enough heft and vibrancy to translate into a mass entertainer that is visceral, rousing and unwaveringly riveting.Rishab Shetty is completely terrific in the role of Shiva. He portrayed the emotions to perfection throughout the film. His performance in the climax will leave you definitely shocked. The funny sequences involving Rishab Shetty and his gang evoke good laughs. The love track between Rishabh and Sapthami Gowda is handled very well. The actress looked alluring, and she did her part well. Other artists like Achyuth Kumar and Kishore Kumar got good roles with more prominence to this story and were also fine in it. The action scenes are solid and give a high.On the flip Side , After a racy and delightful first half, post-interval scenes start on a dull note with unexciting and tedious moments.

I am just telling the things I didn't like. Like what are the even trying to tell from this movie.Even if you are really ill of character you can be a representative of God? I hope not.I kinda expected that there would be village people doing this scheme for land in a sophisticated manner. Maybe that's why I wasn't really thrilled by the ending.I have watched Brahmastra and I would say it is better than Kantara. I can count more logical weird things in Kantara than someone else can in Brahmastra. The genres are different but in my opinion. Now if you are wondering I watch bad quality movies only, no. I don't watch old movies rated less than 7.5. I can see quality.Anyway there are a lot of logical incostintencies.The king feels happiness seeing a sword, not from million other things. Also who gives whole village without any paperwork?What, they didn't have something to write on, is it? The action scenes, have weird portions. People fly off some 7 metres away in a kick. Sometimes even with a knee hit.I am very surprised nobody has talked about this and are saying Pathaan's scenes are illogical. Hypocrisy is clearly visible.Well, I feel the basis of story is bad. Neglecting that the mystery at start was good. At start I thought they certainly wouldn't have god in this. This is a globally famous movie. What in the world, it had god in it. Well, I am an atheist but I hope not that this movie went well because of God in it.No consistent story in between. Nothing constructive happened. The fight scene at end was good but other than that and mystery at start it had barely anything.It has proper representation of tribe oppression and a beautiful setting but many elements of the movie like a tree coincidentally falling after it was cut almost on a police car and some other things were weird.In general barely decent but totally not worth 8.6 as for now. It is maybe the hype that caused some of it's success but yeah worth a watch.You may be thinking I am saying bad things. You watch it then repeat what you were saying.",

In some of the scenes, camera work was really good. A few jump scares looked terrifying as well.-ves : A lot. Firstly, The plot. There were infinite loopholes in the plot. The film was looking good in the first 20-30 minutes as it was giving us a clue that it would present itself as a Mystery Thriller but definitely its not, rather it is a disappointment. The film deviates from its main plot. Screenplay is too slow especially in the second half. Only WOOOOOH is the point around which the whole story revolves (*giggles). Music is not impressive as well. Action scenes & climax was filled with over the top illogical sequences. I feel that they should have released it as a short film instead.

A story of some rich guy trying to trick some uneducated tribal people to take their land - how unique is that. And some minor scenes of divine intervention - also very common. It is always a big red flag when the director plays the lead, and also the action hero who fights and trashes the co-actors; this movie is no exception. I have watched the Hindi version, so I can give some benefit of doubt that the dubbing might have devalued the acting a bit, which generally happens. Otherwise, I found the acting very one dimensional. None of the character had a gray or subtle tone to them - just either good or bad. And loud acting is always easy, but shouting is not necessarily expressing. I found very little effort also in introducing the characters as humans, but instead just put in roles as pillars paving the path for the hero to show his greatness. And the director is the hero, he is in all the scenes, he is the good guy, he also gets the girl, and he also kills the bad guys at the end. Probably we should mature beyond these kinds of stories.",

            "content": "Director Rishab Shetty's Kantara (aka mystic forest) is a story of tribals who inhabit the forest in coastal Karnataka - Tulunadu region. Rishabh has also written the story and stars as the lead. The story which is largely set in 1990s strings together strands from an earlier century as well as 1970s, weaving these three timelines in a brilliant blend of mythology, folklore and movie magic.The narrative yarn is spun around multiple conflicts - some overt and some simmering undercurrents which are on the verge of eruption. Nevertheless, the primary fault line traces the near unending conflict between humans and nature as the humans continue in their vain quest to conquer, own and control nature - land and resources - to satiate their utmost avarice.Rishabh Shetty mounts the movie on a canvas that is deeply drenched in the earthy hues of its milieu and richly textured with unique cultural ethos of the coastal Karnataka.His story presents an eclectic mix of emotions ranging from resonant spirituality, rustic love, healthy oodles of irreverent humour, primal rage, greed that is almost genetic as it transcends and consumes generations, juxtaposed with firmly held beliefs of a close knit community and how such beliefs permeate and define their lives.Within moments into the film, Rishabh magically transports the viewers to the verdant space where his story unfolds with Kola, Kambala, nocturnal hunting and much much more, thanks largely to the songs and background score by B. Ajaneesh Loknath along with the superb cinematography of Arvind S Kashyap who conjure up an immersive experience.Rishabh Shetty excels in the role of Shiva as he emotes with ease through the character arc which sees him go from a irresponsible ruffian to the transformation with a final tour-de-force. He is complemented well by a supporting cast including an excellent Kishore, ever-dependable Achyuth Kumar, Pramod Shetty, Sapthami Gowda and the rest. Rishabh's control on the medium as a director is evident through the entire runtime of Kantara, especially as it crescendos to a phenomenal final stretch that packs the potency akin to a force of nature.Rishabh the writer cooks up a heady cocktail - masterfully mixing up the sensational with the subtle and the surreall; this is one happy \"made-in-heaven\" marriage of mystique philosophy and mass masala moments.A delectable coastal Karnataka delicacy that is cooked to perfection to delight the discerning viewers.As the final visual vanishes from the screen, the viewers leave with the lingering legend of Kantara lurking in their minds.AN UNFORGETTABLE & UNMISSBALE EXPERIENCE !!",

Rishab Shetty has outdone himself as the writer, director and actor. His expressions in every scene is captivating and character shown is larger than life.Background score is top notch and brings back the local, rich tribal culture who has a strong voice. Story is bit slow initially but engaging.Climax provides goosebumps moments and invigorates your body.This movie is not everyone's cup of tea due to its unique experiment, with a display of folk and Bhoota Kola version.Kannada movies are rising the bar and such movies will keep the industry afresh!",

Coming to the movie itself the middle part was bad. It was too chessy and disrespectful towards women and could have been shown in a better way. The direction and cinematography is really good. Rishab Shetty deserves a standing ovation for making this movie. I watched it in Hindi Dubbed and I recommend everyone to watch in original with subs as the dubbing was bad and too loud.",

            "content": "Kanthara (Ondu Dantha Kathe)Movies are made with the intention of telling a story that will have a climax. #Kanthara Kannada movie is a \"Climax\" told with a story attached to it.Short review: The most stunning climax I've watched in any movie.Whole thing about climax: Rishab Shetty hails from my land, the Tulunadu or that blessed land between the Arabian sea and western ghats. Tulunadu is divided between different districts of Karnataka and also involves Kasaragod in Kerala. But it is united by a rich Sanatana culture, Tulu language and beautiful fables apart from stunning landscapes.Kanthara is a fable or Dantha Kathe. It begins with a fable of a King transferring his lands to his people in exchange of peace of mind offered to him by Panjurli, the protector \"Daiva\" of the lands and forests.Then it tells the story of a closely knit community that worships the land, the forest and Panjurli. Transcending through 19th century to later decades of 20th century, it projects the rich culture involving Kambala (Buffalo race of coastal Karnataka), Kola (The protector Daivas appearing in humans to connect to the devotees) and the intricacies surrounding the lives of believers.While we have countless movies that lampoon and insult our culture, here is a movie that magnificently glorifies the culture of a small strip of land in a corner of India. To clear short of rationalist attacks, the movie has a tagline that says, it's a fable. Apart from that, it's just a heady mix of art, lifestyle, language, generosity of people, their faith, pettiness of people in power and the enlightenment of the order of Daiva to live with the nature, not against the nature.Rishab Shetty writes, directs and acts in Kanthara and he does a mind boggling job in all three roles. The national award jury will be confused which of the three deserves the National award more, the Writer or the Director or the Actor. I don't want to be there in the jury. Easiest way will be to give all three awards to Rishab Shetty.Kanthara is unabashed celebration of a culture, the people and their life. It may sound alien to people who don't know the place and culture, like it happens to the Deputy Forest Range Officer in the first half. But the movie grows on the viewers as it moves towards the most stunning climax that cannot be explained. It can only be experienced.Performances of all the starcast is natural and topnotch. The art department, music, background music and cinematography gel beautifully to create an audiovisual treat. It's an apt lesson to Bollywood about how to make an original movie that can enthral without burning hundreds of Crores.I had rated Rishab Shetty's \"Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana\" directed by Raj B Shetty as one of the Top 5 gangster movies ever made in India. Kanthara cannot be easily placed in a genre. We can call it a fable retold in a realistic setup. It is nothing short of a classic. A modern day classic of \"Divine\" proportions.The climax blurs the difference between the Human and Divine. Kanthara is once in a lifetime movie experience and enters into my Top 10 all time great Indian movies.Post script: My review may be biased because of my love for my Tulunadu. I attach that disclaimer before I recommend Kanthara to all cinema lovers. The movie comes with English subtitles. Go celebrate Kanthara!",

Only a person who is steeped in that culture can pull it off. Whether it is the Kambala race, boar hunting or the romance scenes or even the comedy scenes, you can see the nativity of the same.Every member of the cast has done a splendid job. Not even one character seems out of place. The script is too tightly written that you don't feel bored even for one minute and you are enthralled by the story.The direction is spot on and the camera work is amazing, whether it is the capture of the beautiful forest or the fight scenes. But the best is capturing the Devine moments of Booth Kola.And finally Rishabh Shetty has done a splendid job as lead actor. The last 20 minutes of the movie is divinely.

Should get a national award for the Climax acting, he really nailed it at the end. But the character arch to become a God is completely missing. There is clearly no reason for the forest officer to change his mind, should gave a solid reason.Please watch \"Marmadesam, Vidathu Karuppu.\" each and every character in the village has a respectful character arch.Final though Tumbbad wins a surprisingly good movie award from me.

This one is related to local God but in general story line is not interesting . May be It's been hyped by local audiences who can relate this story but for an outsider it's totally an average movie. Camera visuals are very average when you compare to recent films. First half is boring and second is little bit moving with well predicted story line . No surprise moments . Music is good . Frankly speaking , it made me little sleepy when I watched in Prime during first half but i made myself motivated to watch as it's been hyped so waiting for turnaround!!",

It roars into you and demolishes your faux sense of control by creating a moment of reckoning and truth.But, most important of all, Kantara illuminates the recognition, that you may abandon the gods, but the gods won't abandon you.

In the name of 'mythology', main character dreams about a boar like every 30 minute for 10 seconds, that's it.In my opinions it is a typical South Indian movie with mild references to Hindu mythology.The ratings are result from bombardment of 10 rating by the people who are influenced by the culture shown in movie, not by story itself. I have been watching movies based on ratings and reviews on IMDB since 2008 and it has been quite helpful. Now a days you can't trust IMDB rating because now new movies are often full of fake ratings like this one. Its should be rated not more than 7.5/10 according to the story.Hope, my review helps!

I could really connect with the core story since it was related with ancestoral gods. The climax was a epic unbelieveable. Overall a good film and if u r from village u will sure love this film. Rishab shetty omg he just killed with his performances , the best so for from him as i know. Kishore and the antogonist did their roles very well.

            "content": "The story begins in the 18th century when a king gives a piece of land to the tribals in exchange for peace, joy and prosperity. Centuries later, consumed by greed and selfishness, the king's successor tries to threaten villagers during Bhoota Kola to return the land. But his mysterious death puts an end to the debate. Twenty years later, forest officer Murali, who considers himself the custodian of forest, tries to put an end to 'unscientific rituals' of the forest-dwellers, in a bid to save the forest. But hot-headed Shiva, who believes that the forest does not need to be saved as it is not in danger, takes Murali head on. Though their intentions are same, their way of dealing with it is poles apart. This results in several heated arguments and fights between the two. Leela (Saptami Gowda), a newly appointed forest guard, is initially caught in the crossfire between the villagers and the forest department. But she quickly takes a stand, which puts Shiva in trouble. Landlord (Achyut Kumar), who is also the successor of the dynasty, and now a local politician, also has his eyes on the ancestral property. Who does the land actually belong to ?A predictable storyline that is embellished with technical brilliance to make it a unique experience. Kantara is a Rishab-Shetty-show all the way. He shines as the director as well as the protagonist. The cinematography pulls you into the film and makes you a part of it. The first half has a very engaging storyline and apt comedy with quirky one-liners in coastal dialect. The second half, however, delves deep into the actual story of culture and tradition, blended with a little bit of mystery. The biggest take away is the pre-climax and climax, which is conceived and performed to perfection. Rishab Shetty's performance in the last 20 minutes is chilling. Since he comes from the coastal region, the mannerisms have come out effortlessly on screen. The movie shows the hidden, aggressive side of Rishab as an actor.Kishore gives an equally powerful performance as forest officer. His bald, clean-shaven look adds gravitas to his role. Saptami Gowda has nothing impactful to do till the climax and she has put up a decent show. Achyut Kumar, as a cunning landlord, is a valuable addition. Pramod Shetty, Praveen Tumbe and others have played impactful fillers. The way all these characters come together to tell a compelling story is brilliant.The film is a visual grandeur. DOP Aravind Kashyap has done a brilliant job with lighting and frames. A lot of attention is given to the making, which is dipped in folklore. Situational village comedy works well for the film. The film explores the culture of Tulunadu without any compromise. B Ajaneesh Loknath's music is soothing. With plenty to savour for both mass and class audience, Kantara undoubtedly makes for a wonderful experience.Rishab's biggest victory, I believe, is that he's been able to transport his audiences to this tiny hamlet and be involved in everything going on there. Taking a rooted tale and presenting it to a larger audience is a gamble; not everyone may take a shine to it. But if you at least manage to create an iota of interest in the subject among this audience, it's a job well done. Kantara may not be perfect on all counts, but it will go down in history as a film that will be remembered for all the right reasons.",

Opening and ending scene's are iconic. Rishab Shetty has given his best effort. All the characters are made to look as part of this movie. Especially character of Dhanis wife and Guruva looks apt for the movie. Special effects looked awesome. My bet this movie can be dubbed in English and should be released even in Hollywood. Villain characters and comedians have done marvellous job. Each and every character doent force into the movie. Overall I rate this movie 10/10.",

Shettre the last 20-15 mins are one of my best cinematic and theatrical experience ever. I'm not sure even you could Top what you have done. This is something really Divine and Majestic.

This movie is so boring, so long and so damn tiring to watch. No one watch this and waste their time. Such potential wasted behind old culture and tradition but you had to ruin it with land issues and the same usual nonsense. Have no idea how this movie made 300 crore plus. Every time you expect maybe now the movie will get interesting, it falls flat on its face. Forced humor, illogical storyline seriously I don't know what people enjoyed in this movie. The only movie that was more horrendous than this was Brahmastra.",

            "content": "The buzz around Kantara has been more than unreal. It has been some achievement for this film to gain the popularity nationwide despite not being a pan India release. The increased level of popularity for Sandalwood due to other big releases earlier this year also has helped the cause. But this doesn't take away the fact that Kantara is a well-made film satisfying mass audiences and critics alike. Rishab Shetty has got the right balance of entertainment with good storytelling.The incidents in the movie span across almost a century relating to a piece of land and the inhabitants. The story is all about different kinds of conflicts between humans, nature, and a higher power. There are some fantasy elements added to the mix as well, but it is also shown in such a way that it is left up to the viewer's discretion. Rishab Shetty again excels in introducing the audience to some new cultural elements of the coastal region and its people. You can see the enhanced production values as compared to his previous movies as this is produced by Hombale Films. However, the budget has been spent to perfection and doesn't seem unnecessarily extravagant. Cinematography is exceptional and the sequences shot in the dark are not hard to watch unlike most other movies. The action sequences seem a bit choreographed which can seem unnatural for a movie like this, but it definitely adds to the look and feel of this film. The choice of keeping the main timeline around 1990s gives a lot of creative freedom to the director especially with respect to some characters. One of the best things about the movie is the well-integrated innocent humour. It was very refreshing to see the old school humour but none of it felt repetitive. The dialogues are majorly in the native dialect and subtitles will definitely be helpful even for the Kannada audience at times. The background score is very apt and feels deeply connected with the movie's theme. Although most things near perfect the movie kind of has a conflict with its own theme at times. The movie sometimes goes from a serious track to comedy in no time without really atoning to the consequences.This has to be Rishab Shetty's career best performance as an actor. All credit goes to him for handling an intense role while directing the movie. As lauded by many, his performance in the last few minutes and his characteristic shout (scream?) while donning the 'Kola' getup is a once in a lifetime experience. Kishore (as Murali) and Achyuth Kumar has tailor made roles for them. However, the character arcs of both Shiva and Murali could have been much better especially considering the events that lead to the climax. Manasi Sudhir as Shiva's (Rishab Shetty) is very natural and really suits the character. Sapthami Gowda and other supporting actors around Rishab Shetty do their part. Deepak Rai Paanaje as Sundara is hilarious and subtle. I hope to see him getting more comedic roles in the future. The movie nails it with respect to the casting and it is good to see that they haven't unnecessarily spent money on popular actors for limited roles.Kantara is definitely a one of its kind film and yet another rich cultural juggernaut from the Sandalwood Shetty clan. It truly deserves all the recognition and accolades for adding another feather in Sandalwood's cap.",

            "content": "Kantara is a Kannada film written & directed by & starring Rishab Shetty, who weaves a deeply cultural story with divinity, village politics and the ever shifting relationship between Nature and Humans. A forest village protected by a Demigod, comes under threat when the landlord tries to reclaim the lands which were donated by the former king. Rishab plays the character of Shiva, a delinquent who is haunted by the demigod because he avoids his destiny and what a magnificent performance by him, throughout the film he is complex, loud and subtle at the same time and in the climax he just sends shivers down everyone's spine. The cinematography especially of the nighttime by Arvind Kashyap is gorgeous. Sound design plays a big factor in this film as well as the background score. The action is well designed with some neat camera work. There is a lot of comedy by Shiva's buddies in the first half, which is really fun to watch but it dampens the serious turn that it takes later and lessens the impact of the climax. But its such a unique theater experience, especially for urban audience, who remains far away from this ancient cultural mysticism of our country and divine acts of deities.",

The story had no twists for me and the first half dragged a bit. The main premise of the movie was around forest land but I felt they never make a strong point on conservation but more on the land rights of the natives. In fact the Hero is killing animals ,cutting trees and attacks the forest officer who questions the encroachments. Yes the tribes have the first right but the forest must also survive for them.Maybe it was the language and cultural barrier, I could not understand the hype behind the movie.

Of course, Kantara also puts him on a pedestal of the best all-time all-around talent Indian Cinema has produced thus far.Everything about this movie is mindblowing; the music (Varaah Roopam is still ringing inside me), action, comedy, underlying themes, and the layering of issues. Most importantly, how Rishabh ropes all this in a fantastic entertainment package without losing devoutness towards the village deity is just out of this world.It made me remember my childhood visits to our village and has rekindled my curiosity and reverence for our Kul Devta.It is no ordinary movie but a masterclass of movie-making and a must watch for all, irrespective of age, town, status.

The film revolves around tribal cultures and their clashes with govt officials, also talks about land acquisition, Bhoota Kola culture, etc.The intro was quite good but few minutes after the entry of the hero (who is also the director of this film) it stars getting boring.Some scenes even start to feel repetitive (some jump scare moments where the hero gets nightmares)You start to feel this is no more about Bhoota Kola and the film just revolves around ego fight between the hero Shiva and a DRFO police named Murali (played by Kishore KG)(Shiva vs Murali - a reference to GGVV? Maybe!)Climax was excellent and the ending (with the original Varaha Roopam song) was satisfying beyond words.The first and last 30 minutes were what engaged me. Rest felt like a dragged drama about village lifestyle.Highlights:1. Storytelling2. Sound Design3. Rishab's acting in the climaxDrawbacks:1. Deviations from the plot2. Boring in the middle3.

Like many other says climax acting is amazing on a routine plot.Long way to go Rishab shetty keep up the good work.",

Such was the energy, dedication, acting (or should I call it daiva personified).The last 15-20 mins shows why Rishab as an actor has to be looked out for!!! I will not call it acting as it looked soo real that I am lost for words!!!The only one thing that I felt was it was stretched a little bit towards the end with all those violence, but no regrets... enjoy the movie and learn about the beauty of Tulunadu culture.",

This is one such example.There is also a trend now for over the top mindless action like KGF, RRR, karthikeya 2 etc. This one clearly scores over them with more believable action sequences, except the final one which can be justified as godly act.Not bad, decent one time watch.",

All other villagers are helpless but for one man.. few scenes stand out but not a masterpeace by any means. Good teamwork n kudos to the team.

My eyes are still wide open and my jaw is still fallen on the floor of the theater.I have watched it twice in 24 hours.

With such a small budget, it's commendable that the team was able to manage such clean VFX. I also compare it with a more recent PS1 where the action sequences were not that well executed in terms of VFX.The cast was totally new to me but great job.One thing I particularly liked about the dubbing was that they left out certain dialogs, the one by Deiv, undubbed which was a brilliant move. It gave much more authenticity to the movie and helped keep the impact of those moments on the watching experience intact.

Its rawness, its direction, cinematography and the must ActingSecondly do little research about Panjurli and Guligae to understand the setting and culture. Then you can understand and comment as well.Panjurli and Guliage are the Ganas of Shiv. They are worshiped in the form of demigods also known as Bhoota. Also Bhoota means Past in the sense of bhoot kaal. Ancestors here used to worship this shiv ganas, specially panjurli because panji (wild boars) used to destroy their rice fields. Ancestors decided to speak and worship the spirits of this panji and started worshipping panjurli their spirit god (demigod) to save them from all the calamities and menance. Kola is the form of worship done in the form of dance. Hence you see rice is feeded to Panjurli during the Kola, so that panjurli accepts the offerings and save them. Guligae is the kshetrapal, who protects the kshetra. Panjurli and Guliage stay together in Many parts of this region there by protecting the locals.",

Though the character of Achyuth Kumar was expected to be the Antagonist, writer Rishabh Shetty has exceptionally made the transition of the role. The role of Muralidhar, the forest officer is very well written and has been excellently portrayed by Kishore Kumar. The reference of Varaha, the third Vishnu is mind bending. For those who did not understand the reference. Vishnu incarnated as Varaha in order to save Mother Earth from Hiranyaksha. Similarly in the movie Shiva the protagonist is seen as Varaha who will be saving the land from Devendra. The picture of Varaha constantly haunts Shiva and is consistently given a message.

With a pinch of love story and friendship of shiva, the protagonist. We can ignore some cheap jokes made by some characters and creepy acts done by the protagonist in order to show his love towards he girl, because its not utopia. This deep dive into the culture of coastal karnataka, in the forest of dakshin karnataka, you can feel every aspect of their lives. Director very smartly inserts a divine aspect of the village into the storyline, and leaves you on your toes. Every character has his story and no one seems to be forced into the story. The bull scene also is neatly put up on the screen. These little cultural aspects of film makes it rooted and more impacting. With action, comedy and love angle, this film makes the audience engage and at the end surprise them with the divine experience. If people everyone in india can feel the divinity in the culture that they never were aware of, I think the cinema is successful in what it was meant to deliver, after that people may have issues with what social issues the film touched, but for me, the film one of the finest films of this decade of India cinema.",

Since the release the movie it has gotten great reviews by lot of celebrities and one of the most reputed ratings website #IMDBRating. Well honestly, I have personally come to a conclusion that either I don't understand or resonate with this kind of cinema or even the most reputed websites offer manipulated reviews. The movie was fast paced with no real sense or purpose, sluggish, silly jokes and a big drag. There were some twist of sorts but they way it has presented was really illogical. With due respect to the director and the entire team but it was a huge disappointment and waste of a festive time. And what's most shocking is the UA rating given to the movie inspite of all the violence, aggressive scary characters, abusive language and a scene which has killing of a small child. I am sorry if I have hurt anyone's sentiments or efforts but I am just saying the truth. So be aware what you are going for and my suggestion is don't take kids along in case you still decide to see how bad the movie is.",

With little much budget of 13 Cr.(Indian-Rupee) what an atmosphere he (Rishab Shetty) made.South-Indian movie never failed to amazed me. During the time of my collage Since 2010, I am a big admirer of South movie. Even those days, we didn't get Hindi or English dubbed of South movie this much, but the language couldn't stop us. Despite the star-kid worthless movies, I was astonished by the low-key camera work and the pure storytelling in Malayalam Hit-'Ustad Hotel'. I have since then developed a deep love for South Cinema. I have seen the movie- 'Ottaal' for more than 20 times. As I have seen this one countless times, I have cried like a child every time.Let's talk about 'KANTARA'. What a masterpiece had been made by Rishab Shetty. Legend says that screaming out is a huge part of the movie, so you will find creaming a lot over the movie.There are a lot of good things happening with this movie because of the acting and makeup. It is clear that story and content are crucial elements for a good movie; this movie contains a good story, and the storytelling is the key to connecting with it.Rishab Shetty Proved that a simple story could be most unique one based on its storytelling.And What a Camera work! Giving you a spoiler that-\n\"You will find yourself thinking that a great VFX work through the movie, but there's very less amount of Special effect. All those scenes and Fighting segments is mostly created with a Master-camera work rather than VFX.''If I spent a thousand's of my words to describe my experience, it will be very less for this movie. So, Go to Netflix for Hindi Dubbed, or prime video has its Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu versions.And find your lesson that- 'A simple story and a unique storytelling can have more impact on making a movie the global hit than tons of money or brainless-unskilled Star-Kids.'",

From Acting to BGM to cinematography to small comical moments this gets everything right and to the point. And just when you couldn't get enough of this the climax comes and blows you away......I watched it twice in theaters and my body was shaking in the last 5-7 minutes of the film.

            "content": "I have waited almost 2 months to watch this \"Kantara\" movie after it's initial release,and I must say the waiting was worth it. First time I'm feeling no theatre nearby is a curse for an audiences like me who loves to see powerfull contents like this in the Big Screen. I mean I could just imagine how pumped up people would have felt during it's screening on the theatres with such loud sound effects.. I missed it,coz the theatre nearby is about 65kms far from my place & I didn't have time to schedule my journey.SO coming to the real review. (Rishab Shetty), the writer,director and the leading actor in this movie ; what-a-TALENT you have man! Kannada industry is really impressive. This is the perfect example of justifying how a low budget film should be made. I mean proper utilization of 15Cr. You will not feel it's a low budget movie,kudos it's Powerful BGM,Proper editing,Perfect Slow-MOs' and of course rich gripping Screenplay. This movie is really rich in all aspects. This is what an Indian cinema should be.The best part of this movie is starting 10mins & ending 20mins. The last 15min of this movie is like giving even a paralyzed person goosebumps. WOOW! WHAT_A_PERFORMANCE...Never seen like this in any Indian Cinema. This is a pure redemption of folk-tales and locals believe cultures.. There are 28 states in our country and I feel every state should put forward their hands towards Local Cultures to made story like this. The South Kannada \"Bhoota Kola\" culture is really impressive for sure. Earlier I've watched Rangitharanga and Vikrant Rona on this same concept and their redemption is here in this Kantara..Unlike Shetty, other characters like Police,Landlord,female lead and friends of protagonist were also did their job perfectly here. You can go for this movie with whole family just a little kissing and casual make out scene present which I think not that much impactable with family audiences.. So finally going with 8 Out of 10 Stars for it. I will not call it a masterpiece like other reviewers but the way this movie present us it's simple storyline is commendable.",

Kishore Kumar G as the Forest Officer Murali is top notch.The shining work by cinematographer Arvind Kashyap is visible in each frame by means of carefully blending the story with his framing of visual poetry.The background score is gritty, the music encapsulates local sounds and folklore perfectly and this movie makes you wonder how much we have to learn from our own music before going to look for melody in the west.The fight sequences, the dance of \"daiva\" and the makeup as well as costumes department have done magic.Must watch & highly recommended from my side.",

The landlord, the government, the people or to the nature, that was there before us and will be there after us.Rishab Shetty's performance. He is absolutely terrific. He lives and breathes the character. At times, he reminded me of Toshiru Mifune's various characters in Kurosawa masterpieces. Especially, the last 10 minutes of the climax is one that will be remembered for ages to come.The music and cinematography add to the storytelling immensely so much so that they can be considered as other characters in the movie.Negatives - script is predictable and you know how exactly things will turn out eventually. Sometimes the scenes just drag on in a bit to infuse forced and often crude humor in situations. I am still not able to connect the whole \"prison break plan\" scene to the rest of the movie.Casual and sometimes not so casual sexism - all the female characters in the movie are stereotypes and unidimensional. The hero pinches the heroine on her waist forcibly, secretly watches her bathing naked, kisses her without her permission and it's all ok and no one minds! Another woman's smile is compared with Buffalo's teeth more than once and is supposed to be funny.Promoting superstition and blind faith - the whole village tradition of local deity worship and other local cultural aspects is totally rooted in superstition, blind faith, maintaining the status quo, no scientific temper, no critical thinking and definitely no questioning. The movie is about local tradition where villagers want to keep the land and the forest to themselves but yet are not shown doing anything to protect the forest or even the wild life.",

            "content": "How often do we get to see a writer-director-lead actor ace all 3 of these responsibilities like never before? Rishab Shetty achieves it big time and his growth is visible, hats off to this rare talent. Kantara is a epic tale spanning through whopping 120 years. In 1870, a king finds the peace he is searching for in a mere stone which is more of a deity for the tribal people. In return for that stone, he grants them his land. 100 years later, the greed among the descendants to grab this land back from the tribals makes way for the core conflict. Once this is established in the initial sequences, the world of Kantara is firmly built making for the 1990's.The Kundapura tradition, language and belief gives this world a unique identity of it's own. Enters Shiva (Rishab Shetty) who is a wayward \"youth\", spending much of his time drinking and hunting. He also is running from his past involving losing his father, a bhootakola performer, something he simply fails to outrun. As the lives of Shiva and his people are established, the forest dwellers find their hurdle in the form of the RFO Murali (Kishore), a stubborn honest officer in-charge of protecting the forest. Also there is the landlord (Achyuth Kumar) whom the entire tribe looks upon as their well wisher. The clash between the forest officer and Shiva, along with the tribe excellently takes the story forward without giving up on the deep rooted culture of the tribe. The clash of ego leads to a terrific first half, making way for the clash of beliefs.Though the main reveal of the villain is quite predictable, the second half still has enough meat to keep us speechless as the making, the narrative and the performances come together to keep it as rich as possible. It is here the bhootakola is best used as it justifies being the integral part of the narrative. Despite the risk of going overboard in the third act especially with the pre-climax fight, Rishab Shetty gains full control on the script and elevates it further through his performance to provide a terrific climax.Highly recommended.",

It's Divine.What's interesting is, this is a movie with a great content but not made in a 'award winning, art film' kind in terms of presentation. This is an out and out commercial movie.Rishab Shetty - You made me and I believe all the audience proudest for being part of Karnataka. And your acting throughout the movie goes step by step from good to awesome to great to one of the greatest of all time. NATIONAL AWARD is waiting for you in one way or the other.Went in with an expectation of 'Oh Rishab Shetty's directorial will not disappoint'. Cams out being a fan again after SHPSK.

The story is gripping(until the 3rd act) and is grounded for most part of the film. My biggest issues are with the typical unrealistic fights in the film and super predictable and lame climax which we have already seen a thousand time in Indian Cinema. The arc of the relationship between the Hero and his father is rushed and unimpactful. The only thing the father does throughout the film is Jump scare the hero a couple of times and all of a sudden the hero becomes a messenger of God out of thin air and now shares a good relationship and understanding with his father as they dance and vanish together in the final shot. The entire arc of the villian is boring ,super predictable and nothing new. But despite the flaws the film has some good scenes and Ideas which were explored well. The groundedness and the risks they took with the slow screenplay should be appreciated. Overall it's a decent film with an interesting but also predictable story. One time watch.",

India is like a miracle... if you try and make sense of it you will only get frustrated but if you surrender to the miracle you can also be one ....

Even final fight sequence is cut short and we do not get to see the final justice for the villain on screen to give any satisfaction. The only positive is Rishab Shetty did great acting for the climax in the last 5 minutes but it is not worth watching this long movie for. Definitely a big disappointment.",

            "content": "Kantara, Kantara ... oh what do I do with you. Do you really deserve 9.0 rating on IMDB? Hmmm yes actually.First thing first - this review is based on my second viewing of Kantara on Prime on first day it was released.I did watch the movie first time in a theatre but I feel my movie experience is severely impacted by very noticeable blaring sound, especially for Indian movies - anyone else feel that way?Anyway, I was eagerly waiting for the movie to come on OTT to watch it again in the comfort of my own home theater with a large screen and reasonable sound system - my den.People say that this movie is good in 2 parts the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes with forgettable in between - I beg to differ.Actually the main reason for me to watch it second time was to watch closely the whole movie in its entirely and see if its really worth the high ratings - and it is.This moview is full entertainment - great direction, great story, great music, great cinematography, great editing, great sound effects, great action, comedy (adult) and ofcourse great acting - lifted highly to a different level towards the end.I have a special connection to the movie since I am originally from Mangalore and my dad has deep connection to his own diava temple in our native.So this movie touches me at a level which is inexplicable.To start with, before I knew this movie existed, I happened to visit Pilli Kula this October which is biological park/zoo in the outskirts of Mangalore. I felt a deep connection to the forest area even though I was visiting it for the first time - the whole experience was surreal.I also happenned to visit Sai Radha Heritage which has used as the landlord's house in the movie - again a queer coincidence not knowing the Kantara connection.Coming back to the movie - Kantara is not a movie - it is an experience.However, I was disappointed that they changed the main song on the OTT version but its ok - but it does take away some impact - I am glad I saw it in theater the first time.Nevertheless, I had goose bumps and tears in my eyes both times towards the end- I felt my roots were calling me - I felt my diava is calling me.Your diava is powerful, you take care of your diava and he will take care of you - that is the message I heard.It also made me appreciate the sacrifice and dedication of my dad to uphold these traditions year after year - I feel sad it took me so long to realize what he was doing - he was taking care of his diava.Hats off to Rishab shetty for sharing Kumbala and bhoota kola rituals to not just India but hopefully to the world (hoping an Oscar nomination)",

Bgm & music sound in this movie is perfectly suitable and it'll give you goosebumps at certain moments. Brilliant cast with acting performance. I've watched in a dubbed version and I'll definitely give the credit for dubbing artist. There's also one thing that I need to talk about this film is that the makeup that they have used to create Kantara is just beyond imagination. It looks so perfectly well and the creativity of that is amazing. You can definitely watch the film for it's amazing storyline, fast paced screenplay and the climax.

Kantara, released under this banner, successfully manages to not only keep this reputation but also increase it.Rishabh Shetty, awes audience with his show stealing performance, as well as from his direction. The sophisticated unraveling of events while maintaining the intrigue on screenplay, thanks to Ajaneesh's background score as well, has clearly worked out.Rishab scores from the very start as the audience are rooted upon their seats as they hear the story of Kantara. Kantara, as a film, kicks off with this kind of curiosity and keeps the audience engaged through the story telling. Subtle humor is another big plus of the movie as it feels authentic, and original.The character of Kishore (the deputy officer) could have been written in a better way as his character's transition from being egoistic and evil to suddenly helping the villagers seemed forced. Also, the character of Leela, could have been better explored as she was also stuck in a battle of conflicts and had some character in her, apart from glamour.The film maker's intelligence is still to be adored, by not giving a rating below 8 at least.Watched on Prime ; 12-12-2022.

The world building to writing to acting to background score to costumes to lighting to cinematography and direction everything is perfect to the letter T. Rishabh shetty should win a National award for his performance.I have some minor issues like why did the Forest officer all of a sudden had a change of heart ? One event of finding landlord is cheating shouldnt change his heart there should have been an arc around his change. Secondly I feel climax action scene was unnecessary it brought too much noise. May be Rishabh wanted to give it to the masses but the same could have been handled more smartly. It felt like we went from engaging drama mode to full on 300 mode such tonal shift distracted me from my experience. Can anyone tell me why did Shiva disappear in the end ? I understand his father did cuz he wanted to prove that he is the God who is speaking but what was the motto of Shiva's disappearance ?Apart from the minor issues the movie is an experience which is not bogged down by the usual over the top acting and dialogue delivery or physics defying action. Everything is grounded yet elevated by its humbleness. Indian film industry needs to learn from this. This shows that you can also make a smart movie for masses where acting and story is the hero.",

It's in the league of or better than mass action entertainers with huge budgets. But this movie was made at a puny budget of around 16 crores and yet managed to leap ahead of most other high-budget, high production value movies.The movie's greatest element is its story and script, which Rishabh Shetty created himself.. The fact that it is soo deep-rooted in his culture has made it such a charming and entertaining plot. The climax scene of Kantara is one of those rare experiences that stick with you for days after watching this movie.So, I would recommend that you go and watch this movie in whichever language you prefer.

            "content": "The internet is screaming that Kantara is a masterpiece, but don't let that fool you. It could have been, but it is not. The film had a lot of potential to become a masterpiece. But it was not to be. I will later explain where it fell short.I will nevertheless say that Kantara is a good film. And it could have been so much better. It had all the great ingredients. Nevertheless, Kantara certainly is a breath of fresh air in so many ways, considering the overall standard of the Kannada film industry. If you keep that as the benchmark, then wow it's a great film. But not otherwise.Reiterating, I will say that it had all the ingredients for becoming a masterpiece. Unfortunately, there were a few places where the film failed to become one. The theme and premise were intriguing, the director and actors talented, but I guess somewhere the director lost himself in the greed, insecurity and foolishness of appeasing the mass audience. And in that trap, he made those mistakes which stopped the film from becoming a masterpiece.So what are some of the great things about this film?The entire theme of it - the language, the culture, the location, of Tulunadu. The mystery of the Daiva. The film leaves you wondering what the Daivas are capable of. Are they real? The paradox between the human psyche and the supernatural. Plus, the film becomes relatable and nostalgic to people who are from Tulunadu or those who have visited this wonderful place and are familiar with the divine traditions practised there.The film certainly has its goosebumps moments. The background scores and cinematography being significant contributors in that department, are top notch in some scenes. Along with the cinematography and background scores, there are elements of supernatural mystery in the plot as well, which make the film worth watching.The actors are very talented too. And the various expressions in the dialect of coastal Kannada that they speak is delightful. In fact, that is one the main reasons to watch this film The humor is always there. It makes its way even in typically serious scenes. Now that is improvisation coupled with the beauty of this dialect.So there you go - all the ingredients of a masterpiece. What could possibly go wrong? This is where many people who watched this film were confused into believing that this film is a masterpiece.The main thing that I did not like was that the director pressed the overkill button at many places, probably for the reasons that I have already mentioned above. There was a desperation to make it more intense, over-intense, much more than necessary. You may think that an entertaining film is supposed to be that way. But to what extent? Certainly not to the extent that it becomes too conspicuous. There is a desperate hidden attempt to glorify the hero too, which does not fit well in a film like this. You'll know why. Basically, the noise could have been turned down and the craft could have been turned up in this film.That said, overall, a good film worth watching. But only a one time watch - at least for me. Not exactly a must watch. But I will say that this kind of films will set the precedent for better films to come - from the same director or from others. It's so relieving to see that the Kannada film industry is evolving from its cliche livelihood into unique themes and story lines. And that's the best part. Let there come a true masterpiece.......",

            "content": "First off, I agree that Kantara is likely the most significant and important movie to emerge this year and that in itself is HUGE given the like of KGF, Pushpa, RRR, Kashmir Files etc. And in terms of impact and ROI (Return on Investment) it's probably the biggest after Dangal (let's not forget that Dangal collected more than 2K crores worldwide, so Kantara has a long way to go). Kantara has amazing cinematography, very original and rooted story, great music, and clearly Rishabh Shetty has vaulted into the top tier of Indian cinema with his multi-faceted effort (similar to what Vishal Bharadwaj did with Omkara).... So no arguments with any of that ....kudos to RS and the Kantara team....\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f.BUT, but ..... We need to stop idolizing this movie as if film history begins with this movie as lots of fans and reviewers seem to be doing. That is totally lopsided and unbalanced, in other words just fanatical mass hysteria - probably because (a) many many people have just started returning to theaters after Corona and (b) this current era coincides with both Bollywood and the Tamil industry hitting more or less rock bottom in creativity (with some exceptions of course).Let's not forget that Indian cinema (and let's not even go to World cinema), in very era and decade has produced masterpieces that stunned and wowed those audiences and raised their goosebumps who were lucky to see the first releases in theaters. As part of our own process of discovery and personal experience we tend to overlook or forget that others have undergone similar arguably more profound experiences with cinema in the past.It is our inability to imagine and live in their shoes that causes us to conclude ours must be the greatest. Just two examples will suffice (and there can be 100's of others....arguably almost all movies in the 8-10 range on IMDB, with more than 10,000 reviews).1. Sholay - I dare anyone to challenge that there is a greater or more thrilling action sequence in Cinema done with real sets, no VFX than the opening train robbery sequence in Sholay, now imagine seeing that for the first time on 70mm in 1976.2. Pulp Fiction by Tarantino - again it is difficult to imagine the impact this had on the whole cinema world on any level or category that you want - Story? Originality? Script? Editing? Dialogue? The movie is Gold. One can arguably divide world cinema history before and after Pulp Fiction\nSo ....we need to be careful before declaring Kantara as the best thing to happen since sliced bread. It is damn good for sure, but let's all agree it is in Elite Company ....with many others ....(and oh btw.... HUGE shoutout to Tumbbad - in my opinion the most original movie from India in the last many years)",

            "content": "Saw Kantara this weekend now that it has come on Amazon Prime. Spellbound! What an extraordinary movie, probably one of the finest movies in any language. I have not heard of Rishab Shetty before (my bad!), but he has created a true masterpiece here. The story revolves around a Bhoota Kola tradition in a remote region of Karnataka and about revolves around the local deity in that region. Worshippers of Mutthappan in Kerala can easily relate to this, however to most people the entire Bhoota Kola tradition may seem very surprising and it is about channelizing a local deity (possessed) for a ritual.The movie has a very fine script and storyline. It is about an 'irresponsible' person who is constantly reminded by a deity to take his place and do what is needed. The acting performances are excellent, however, the last 15 minutes were out-of-the-world. In these 15 minutes Rishab delivers a performance that may not even be called 'acting', it was as if he was actually possessed by the deity. Probably one of the best scenes in the history of cinema. I am trying to think of some epic acting scenes by Mohanlal, Mammooty, Kamal Haasan, Al Pacino, Tom Hanks, and I cannot think of a better performance than the last 15 minutes by Rishab in Kantara. I saw the movie on my laptop.... and how I wish I had seen it in a movie theatre.In comparison to the other South Indian languages, Kannada movies have historically taken a backseat. Tamil and Telugu have repeatedly provided us with excellent crossover cinema. Malayalam movies are usually low budget, however, historically they have provided us with world-class storylines and excellent acting performances -- no wonder along with Bengali cinema they dominate India's National Awards. However with Kantara, Kannada cinema has truly come of age... this is spectacular storytelling at its finest. Moreover, you can hear of many people on social media who have begun understanding their roots after watching this movie. The conflicts between tribals and forest officers (government) are also well portrayed. The only minor quibble I have is the use of the word 'demigod' in the subtitles (instead they could have simply used 'god' or 'deity').I don't recall ever writing about a movie that I watched on social media.... but Kantara is on its way to the history books for its unique contribution to world cinema, so I could not resist. It is indeed a masterpiece and a gem of Bharata!",

The BGM is good and kind of mixes modern rock with carnatic. The songs are above average and might not last long on your mind.Overall the weak part I feel is the story itself. The story telling is good and the movie is certainly a visual treat. Watch the movie for a visual experience and brilliance of the direction. The cultural influence of Tulu Nadu is portrayed in a excellent way and makes you believe that this is how it is done. For me who does not know much about the culture , it did amaze me the way make up has been done and character being carried out.There are a couple of jump scare scenes which I feel were kind of unnecessary. Some romantic scenes also could have been avoided which don't add much of a impact to the story.You will not feel bad to have watched this movie in the big screen.

            "content": "A tale of folklore and ancient traditions with a strong social undertone of the Kannada people living in the Tulu region shown in world class manner. The lives of the tribal people was captured in a very authentic manner that makes this truly a special spectacle to witness.SOCIAL STATUS:\nThe film showcases a very strong social undertone lingering in the community and the manner which upper class(read caste) and the lower class is treated at various instances. The film does not talk loudly about discrimination, neither there are scenes directly showing discrimination. However, the few instances in which 'action speaks louder than words' is when we, the audience realise the harsh reality of the people living in that community. Some of the minute details showcased by the director is nerve wrecking and subtle nature of the screenplay really makes us chill through our spine.SPIRITUALITY & ANCIENT TRADITIONS:\nThis is one of the only and unfortunately few films from India that showcases an actual culture and the staunch religious belief system of a community. The \"Varaha Roopam\" was shown in its most authentic and truest form without exaggeration. This made the scenes truly intense with intent to give limelight to the actual ancient traditions of tribal people in that part of India. Rishab Shetty was absolutely unapologetic in doing so, which makes this film stand out against the rest.CONCLUSION:\nMy big cup of tea, a must watch for all cinema fans and those who wants to learn more about the diverse nature of India.",

But for Rishab sir's research I would like to applaud. Editing is good. Songs are inspired. So could have agreed it is remixed. But ajaneesh is a great music composer. I like the plot which is like - In 1847, a king agrees with Panjurli Daiva/Bhoota (a local deity worshipped in its animist form by the people of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada, which are parts of Karnataka and Kasargod district of Kerala) to give a portion of his forest land to the locals in exchange for peace and happiness granted by a shaman who is supposedly possessed by Daiva. He warns the king that his family and successors should keep the word and not reclaim the land which will incur the wrath of Panjurli's companion, the Guliga Daiva. So story should always have my attention in it.",

This main plot has been given to the audience very clearly.When the story starts to flourish and introduce it's subplots, this is also very clearly defined. The writting had a quality content which had enough scenes and moments to flourish the subplots. There are no fillers, no artificially added comedy, and no irrelevant masala which is used by the writer to push the movie when subplots didn't had stuff.The story reveals the subplots on a clear and set phase. And at the correct point, the subplots started to roll over towards the climax. The closing of subplots starts so smoothly towards the climax that we feel that movie is very fastly phased which is actually not. The film is phased in its own way and its progress in the same way. This is achieved greatly by the writer.Cinematography is very optly choreographed that feel of the mountain and rustyness of the village is very well presented.All the cast are well placed and they doesn't change the feel of the film in any place. They have all been well explained about their roles and they act even when they are fillers in a scene.Overall, a worthy watch and very well directed film.

Unfortunately, I could not watch this movie in theatre, but still loved it by watching this on my TV. Amazing performance by Rishabh and great casting. I see, lot of reviews saying that this is hyped, I understand that. If you are not familiar with the Karnataka's coastal region culture/way of life and also Bhootha/kola, lot of things in this movie seems very ordinary. So totally agree that not everyone would like this movie. But no matter what the final 15 mins of the movie will be mind blowing to anyone. I must have seen that scene like 10 times on repeat.Great casting, except for Achyuth Kumar. Although he's a great actor, I felt like someone else of lesser fame with more closer accent could have done justice to the role.Lot of fights were not really necessary, could have kept it much real and still had the same effect.Some of the characters needed some build-up. Like the guy who lifts Rishabh in the final scene, just shows up without any history.Bit more depth into the way of life of the villagers. They are mostly just fighting for land and drinking alcohol. Maybe some plot around why they need and deserve the land.But nevertheless, unbelievable movie. Really happy to see such an impactful movie after a long time.",

That itself takes away the soul of the movie.Secondly the violence. It was both boring and annoying when most of the fights had no real connection to the story.Thirdly, the main plot was reduced and focused mostly on the triangular rivalry between the hero, forest officer and the landlord. I mean that was tragic considering how the first 15 minutes gave us goosebumps. I wish they had focussed more on the depth of the art and brought the pulse of it to the audience rather than follow the cliched plot of personal rivalry and a savior in the village, who takes his own sweet time , literally waits till the last five minutes to embrace his life path and finally decides not to escape it.Don't get me wrong, I had high expectations after hearing so much about it. And for me , I would have still love it if it stuck to its essence and had let me delve into the history and depth of the art form.Kudos to the music , camera angles and comedy.

So much discussion revolves around Kantara, with the court case adding some drama as well.It starts and continues decently, at a standard of a 6.5-7/10 movie. The themes explored are very interesting, with a striking line being told by an old man during the bull race. Taking this into consideration, and averaging out this and the climax, it's a 7/10.But, just as an otherwise average movie such as Shutter Island is elevated by the plot twist (same with Saw, Arrival, and Se7en), Kantara is elevated with the truly electrifying climax. When I say that you will never experience anything like this climax, you truly will. If you consider rewatching the film, you'll only want to rewatch the climax. Rishab Shetty's performance here is outstanding, in a scene that could have easily become cringe and unbearable the music and his acting turn it into truly one of the most powerful scenes in cinema.Other positives are the character of Shiva didn't embody good, as is usually the case with fighting-against-oppressor movies. It had numerous flaws: mistreatment of women, drinking & drugs. This makes for a nice redemption arc, and a good sense of closure with the finale. The romance wasn't conventional, and the heroine was an actual character, believe it or not, rather than a well-dressed, make-up covered lamppost to look at.Honestly, massive congratulations to the music team, Rishab Shetty, and the cinematographer for the thrilling climax.",

Kishore also deserves a special mention.Technical side, everything is just fantastic.

At that brings me to the tone of this movie. Ok, I am not to familiar with south Indian cinema, but the tonal shift is just too much alien to me. I don't complain a gradual tonal shift like for example in the south Korean movie Parasite, the movie starts out as a satirical comedy, and by the end it almost becomes a horror drama.The reason I give the example of Parasite is because people think this movie is Oscar worthy.The action scenes are also not good, there are literally so many cuts that it is impossible to understand what actually is going on in the scene other that the fact that the protagonist is winning.Then there is the cliched romance subplot that is totally unnecessary and doesn't affect the plot in any major way.Overall the movie has been overhyped and despite being a decent movie, it's definitely not Oscar worthy.",

At certain places the movie becomes unnecessarily dragged. There was no need of repetitive double meaning jokes by Shiva's friends. Instead something should have been described regarding the importance of the deities (Panjurli and Guliga) in Mythology. Its a minimum expectation when those two are the core characters around which the story revolves. Also some fight scenes could have been shortened. The roar of the deities was so frequent that after certain time it lost its charm.The story could have been made much gripping when you compare with movies such as Tumbaad, Aayirathil Oruvan, Avane Srimannarayana, Rangitaranga, Ratsasana or even Karthikeya 2. Or not so far such as The Kashmir Files, which shook the entire nation to its core. For a person, who has watched all these masterpieces, Kantara is a normal movie with 6 or max 6.5 stars.",

A good plot, a good cast of actors(and for those who think the cast is horrible, let me remind you that these are veteran actors in the Tulu and Kannada film industry). The cinematography, the detail in representing culture, and literally everything about this film hits the bullseye. If you are open-minded and would love to learn more about the Tulunaadu and Coastal Karnataka culture, highly recommend watching this movie.

Climax of the movie touches the heart and you can't stop yourself to go in the flow of emotions. What a find blend of tradition, folklore, indigenous issues. Such beautiful photography, action. This is what is cinema, what films are for. In the lead role, Shetty brings dizzying energy to bear upon his performance as the buffalo race champion Shiva, a fiery young rebel with a cause. The young man has to contend with demons of his own mind - recurring nightmares in which he sees visions of the reigning deity in a wrathful avatar drive him to the edge of despair and a constant need to give vent to his rising ire. Hats off to Rishabh Shetty! The total Masterpiece!",

Ever since the pandemic, there has been a setback for Bollywood as its experienced series of flop movies and audience rejection of copied content. This allowed rise of South film industry at pan-India level and enabled space for south movies to shine. Kantara is one of those movies that came out at the right time and gained some extra merit in audience similar to Karthikeya 2 (Telugu movie). As a movie, it has a unique plot and engaging story. Rishab performance was definitely a highlight to the movie. Over all it's a good movie and a one-time watch.However, it's not a GREAT movie that makes you emotionally connected to the story . There are other movies in south that has even better plot and stories. (Ex: Jai Bheem). In my opinion, Kantara is a decent movie but totally overrated. It was praised more than it deserved.",

All i can say is it's a beautiful Artistic movie. Which still cannot do justice for this outstanding movie. Looking forward to many more from Rishabh Shetty.

Some lines/words missed it. Otherwise it is a clean and fantastic one. Some needless controversy on song and misogyny. Song although sounds similiar ,context is different . May be they could credit this to the orignial team. To the other bit, people can just ignore and move on. Celebrate the goodness in the movie. Achuyth Kumar is brilliant and Kishore , a very neat role. The lady pc as well along with the initial artist who doned the role of the performer.Loved the theme. Great going !

The initial part and climax of movie is so powerful it will blow your mind.But the middle part is pretty mediocre and may be little bit stretched. And I think thats what made the movie to sink little bit in OTT platform.Acting is brilliant especially from lead characters. Also movie makes you sink right in to the culture and livelihood of the involved communities. Cinematography brilliant, background score up to par. Overall great movie experience with some hiccups in the middle. Also the song Varaharoopam hits different.",

All those dancers have done really mind-blowing acting and no doubt hats off to them. Of course a lot of action so too good if you like the action. Cinematography is really good. A movie totally on village life and forest conservation stuff. Too much use of alcohol and other stuffs like that .This movie is good though because some supernatural stuff has also been depicted. Too much violence which is related with story so not bad. Conclusion is that it is a good movie to watch but not too good or the best.",

The ending, however, is so good that it more than compensates for the lack of excitement in the middle part of the film.Film starts like a mythology , takes a turn to become a slice of life film showing typical village life in Karnataka and ends as a horror film which feels more spiritual actually in last 10 minutes.The characters are grounded in reality. I have not seen such perfectly cast non glamorous cast in any film till date. Only unrealistic thing is the hero beating multiple villain's henchmen easily enough.The film also raises important but opposing social issues like tribal rights and conservation of Nature without being preachy. The film uses a fake villain right until almost the end and the original villain character turns positive towards the end.The ending is the best one I have ever seen. Even if I do not see the whole film again, I can see the ending a dozen, or may be two dozen times.The film may seem simple, but it is very difficult to blend so many different genres in a single film like this. The director and writing team deserves accolades.Recommended.",

            "content": "Kantara, right from the get go espouses a certain veneration which becomes organically manifest as the movie proceeds. The ingenuity and lack of pretense in the screenplay is what allows a witness, a normal moviegoer to get immersed in its world. Mind this, the movie doesn't try too hard to pull you in - but its simple state of being is sufficient enough for one to try and learn more about this world. However, the charade of unfamiliarity (as I write this as a northern Indian) breaks lose when the movie reveals its soulful intent - to present a glorious tableau of divinity.There are going to be many reviews talking about the stellar performance of all departments of the movie and especially Rishab Shetty ji. But what one might cursorily fail to notice is his performance as Daiva, the revered Demigod. It's not a performance, it's a direct manifestation. For anyone familiar with the spiritual science it would not be a surprise. Kantara, then, comes across as an interplay of the divine - perhaps it would act as a beginning of a larger Dharmic revolution that awaits the land of Bharat.The prowess of Daiva is carefully revealed by the end - His howl becoming a bold foretelling of things that are about to come in this country. Kantara is a spark - the larger fire of dharmic revolution is not going to stop. The scream of Daiva, that reverberates through my ears as I write this review (struggling to collate thoughts clearly) is the scream, a roar - an announcement. The Sanatana shall rise again.Watch this movie to experience something ethereal. Especially the last 20 minutes of the movie that are beyond reviews and critical commentaries - the celebration of the Divine in its purity and pristineness. Rishab Shetty and team have been instrumental in something bigger that awaits this beautiful, beautiful nation.",

I had no hope for Kannada cinema few years ago as most of the scripts had same old stories, loud mouthed heroes and filth pushing them to score decently. Rishab Shetty has taken time to mature and become an ace in the industry today. All the writers have mixed well to generate a proper script that does justice to the regional priorities and the beliefs. Cinematography is really good without any vfx or over the head shots. Direction and acting stand tall across all segments and keep you on the toes throughout the run.

That same night i got a message from a fellow movie buff about this again. I saw it as a sign and went on the day of Diwali. And what a surreal experience.The movie talks about a wide array of topics like the land to its ancestry, the concept of paap, friendship, conflict of two thought points and the whole idea of rituals in a contemporary society in a very fresh and micro regional perspective.The writer / director and lead actor Rishab Shetty shines in this marvellous movie. The female lead Sapthami Gowda looks picture perfect as the woman torn between life and duty. Kishore Kumar G. As the Forest Officer Murali is top notch.The shining work by cinematographer Arvind Kashyap is visible in each frame by means of carefully blending the story with his framing of visual poetry.The background score is gritty, the music encapsulates local sounds and folklore perfectly and this movie makes you wonder how much we have to learn from our own music before going to look for melody in the west.The fight sequences, the dance of \"daiva\" and the makeup as well as costumes department have done magic.Locations are all real and the art department has done a beautiful job in capturing the essence of the story with utmost honesty. I can see Kantara as one prime example of how to tell a story effectively.The underlying message of inclusion and nature vs man subplot along with the importance of preservation of nature by the native dwellers coming vis a vis with the ones who look at land as a possession is also a huge takeaway from this stunning masterpiece by the Kannada movie makers who have created yet another visual extravaganza with a heart. This is probably the first movie after maybe Avatar to explore such a rooted storyline with a treatment that is strong and powerful like \"Kantara\"",

What could have been a high class movie has turned out to be a noisy and ordinary affair primarily because of the poor comedy and routine scenes that keep interrupting the narration. The viewer is never allowed to absorb the story as the scenes keep moving from one to the other without letting the viewer get emotionally connected. Excessive noise and violence is quite jarring and several unnecessary shots in the name of nativity could have been avoided. With a taught narration the movie would have been great.",

Rishabh Shetty created magic by picking a deep-rooted ancient Hindu cultural tradition and giving it a cinematic expression that will leave you stunned as the end credit rolls on the screen. Huge respect to everyone involved in the making of Kantara for preserving the essence and mysticism of \"Buta Kola\" without ruining it in the name of artistic license. Big budget Bollywood (Hindi) movie makers who still churn out hackneyed trash should take a lesson from Kantara on how to use a small regional tradition as theme for a movie and turn it into a pan-Indian cinema. Two standouts are the cast and the Varaha Roopam soundtrack. Those who were fortunate enough to watch Kantara in theater should thank God as they got to watch it with the original Varaha Roopam soundtrack. In the OTT release (Amazon Prime) the makers had to replace the original track with another version which sounds so ordinary and soulless compared to the original. Thanks to the music group Thaikkudam Bridge - infamous for remixing and plagiarizing heavy metal songs (listen to their song \"Fish Rock\" and then listen to \"Joker and the Thief\" by Wolfmother) litigating over copyright infringement managed to get a lower court in Kerala order a temporary stay on the original soundtrack from being shown on OTT.

The movie is loud to replicate the kola, the screams and the music and the complete cinematography keeps ringing in your head even after the movie has ended. Highly recomend to watch this movie in the theatres only.",

Hindi movies lying in the corner ... majority trying to copy Hollywood should learn something from Kantara.The protagonist and the director of this movie Rishab Shetty ... has done a brilliant brilliant job .... he is the show stealer ... all other supporting cast have done a commendable job.Horror elements in the movie are also very scary and the jokes will make you chuckle.This movie is a MASTERPIECE !!!",

A movie that shows the character plot of a life of a character definitely need to have the originality and Kantara definitely did it right!!! It's the first movie that I've seen entire auditorium have watched without taking out their mobiles and even clapped after the movie; that too on day 24 that too after 2nd show.The way the locations, music, costumes and the ultimate direction made us believe that we indeed are looking at lives of forest people obviously got a upright involvement of auditorium in to the story and later; whatever might be the journey of the characters, the entire auditorium were involved with them. The authenticity of the folklore, the body languages of the people all came from the extreme observation of the director and the writing is just awesome as always. There are even times which reminded me of GGVV when shiva was possessed. I don't think there was even a moment where a single person in the entire theatre watched it as a movie but watched as if the entire thing is happening in front of our eyes. Hope more and more such films of our culture would be made. I also strongly think that GGVV should be re released in all languages again.Love from Andhra.",

Using folk music in BGM and adding local instruments in music should be appreciated.Singara siriye is one of best composed song.1 out of 2 found this helpfulsudoot1 October 2022\n10/10\nMust watch. First 2 hours is good last 30 minutes is very very good \ud83d\udc4d\nThe story is simple. Around 150 to 200 years before, a local king ends up giving away a portion of his land to a group of tribals. The tribals settles in this land and make it their homes. Current time, Govt considers this land as forest encroachment and orders the tribals to vacate the place. The descendents of the King also get involved in this and they feel that they are the owner of this land.Everyone has given a brilliant performance and Rishab steals the show in the climax. Achyuth Kumar, Sapthami, Kishore, Pramod Shetty and other supporting actors have done great justice to their role. The last 30 minutes is the best I have seen in the recent past. Do not wait till it comes to OTT. Its a theatre movie.",

And then you end up going to the theatre again to try and understand what exactly is this phenomena.The names of characters - Shiva, and his favourite place 'Kailasa' , The forest officer 'Murli' give a good hint about the roles they play. But the story is also so much about the beliefs of this land, how we consider stones and places in the forest as sacred grooves having some special power. But these beliefs have remained with the older people, the new generation thinks it's all a joke. Nothing scientific about it! It's all about greed and materialistic gains now. But that's where Kantara cuts right across all barriers. If you are an environmentalist, it speaks to you. If you are a tribal, it speaks with you. And especially if you are someone who loves to mock the beliefs of people- this film is totally for you! There are dimensions far beyond our logical understanding and the Indians and all ancient cultures have always believed that it's too small of a person to think he knows everything..because we have a tradition of bowing to that which is beyond human intellect and logic. This film reminds us of that dimension, it connects us all to that deep mystery hidden in all our hearts. The doubts we all carry- is he real? God? Does he exist? Glimpses appear, but we aren't sure and we carry on with our lives. Until one day when something shakes us to our very depths and whether it is due to 'time' , our time, or something else, but we finally stop ,we cleanse our beings so that the divine may enter us and all doubt is perished!",

Movie looks so fresh and very new inspite of very old story is because of its picturisation with a music which geled so well with the scenes and justification done by the actors. As a captain of this team Rishabh Shetty has overhelmed all the expectations. It's a commercial movie with tic mark to all aspect, movie has a good comady, mass hero entry, romantic scenes, crime, suspence , thriller, sentiment , mystery and devotional but none was overdosed. This movie is not only about postive it has a quite a few negative scenes which they could have avoided, something like skin galmor of a female lead, even though it was only couple of scenes and not so vaulger but they could have avoided it. Also couple important scenes which involves varaha roopam song was so energetic to watch in theaters but it was a huge let down due to change in music in ott platform because of copyright issues. If they have avoided it this movie might looked so good. So my final verdict is , it is a good movie and worry watchable and I can give 8/10 to this movie.",

The way the climax scene was crafted is simply remarkable.2. Songs were good.3. The organic village life portrayal was good.Coming to the negatives:\nThe story is an already-heard-of one with nothing interesting to offer (apart from the demigods). I was expecting a vast and repetitive portrayal of the demigods, which disappointed me to the core.After the first 10 minutes, the hero's and the villagers' life are shown, which basically did not add much value to the movie.MOST IMPORTANT : The female lead - Oh my god, why do people write such fenale characters and the story involved around them are very forced? The first scene where the hero meets the heroine, hero simply assaults her without her consent. These are some very subtle things that movies show these days and ignore its impact. Its crutial to represent respecting boundaries, consent, mutual love and care without having to be sacrificial, independence in a relationship etc correctly.Overall just a 3/10 for me.PS : This is my opinion, I respect the flowing positive reviews who see the bugger pictuere.

With its deep ties to Indian culture, religion, and the core of Hinduism, this unique narrative captivates us. The film's creator ensures that you are not spoon-fed while watching it. Your questions will be answered as you delve deeper within, and new ones will arise! Unexpectedly, you will reach a point where you are no longer seeking explanations.The creator does not push himself on creation or feel superior to creation in any way; instead, he respects free choice, liberates us, instills in us a sense of balance, and does not forget his words once given.These frames are about someone who has sacrificed himself, done his part, and expects others to keep their word for the greater good. In exchange, he only wants peace and happiness for everyone. However, when the promises made seem to break, and greediness extends so far as to not care about humanity, he awakes to ramp down all.",

Every scene, every shot is perfection. You are transferred to a different world and become so engrossed in the film. Never have I attended a movie where at the end of it people got up from their seats and started clapping! Last time this happened was after Infinity War. That movie too was a damn brilliant one. I'm from Bangladesh and this is legit rare, where people go crazy, so crazy after any kannada film. This was one experience that I will never forget.

Kings got enlightenment and found peace of mind with tribal idol god after miles of wandering in the forest and kingdom. So king wanted to keep the idol and in return king donated the forest land to the tribals.Now, one of the generation came back to the forest and reclaimed their land. Now the whole drama begins.

In 1990, when the story is set, an upright forest officer (played by a brilliant Kishore) is trying to curb tree felling and hunting in that land, which is now a reserve forest. To complicate matters, the villagers believe that the land was given to them as a boon from their Daiva--the demigod protector of the forest, and are hence in no mood to listen to this outsider. Leading the charge against this is the village strongman Shiva (Rishab Shetty), and he is supported by the king's descendant, the village's sahib (Achyuth Kumar).It is hard to pinpoint the one thing that makes Kantara tick. Let's start with the script. It takes a story seen very often in our daily lives and introduces some unique local flavour, rooting it to Indian culture, making it stand out from among other such tales. Then comes the real cherry on top of this beautiful cake- the breathtakingly beautiful cinematography of Arvind Kashyap. The way Arvind's lens has brought alive the folklore of Kantara is a lesson for storytellers. Some of the scenes of the buffalo racing in the beginning of the film deserve special praise, as do all the scenes from the festivities and visuals of the Daiva.",

Story revolves around a simple conflict but the story telling and absolutely fantastic performances by all lead characters makes it special. The reason for casting Rakshit himself as Shiva is understandable (also he wrote the story for himself) as it's very difficult imagine anyone else in that role. Possible Fake accent and many of the sequences would seem very unlikely to have been the case if it were someone else. Final verdict, fantastic experience... Go watch it with family (not recommended for very young kids though)!",

Camera work and action scenes are very well done. Music is the trump card that holds one's interest all through. Finally Rishab Shetty - his direction and acting - a masterpiece. The climax - everyone is just raving about it. Go watch yourself, it left my adrenaline pumping full throttle for a long time after I came out of the cinema hall. I am watching this again.

He should get the National award for his performance. Technically also, film is top class, beautifully shot with a propulsive background score.It has got everything(suspense,horror,romance, action,history,socially relevant)The final 30 mins of the movie will give you goosebumps and are the highlight of the movie.It's an astounding piece of cinema made on such a low budget(less than 20 crore) and has gone on to gross more than 400cr at the box office.The success of this movie shows that if you genuinely work with passion and have a good,original story to tell, people will appreciate and love the movie.

            "review_title": "Kantara - My view - The Shetty gang strikes again",
            "content": "Folklore based movies are a tough nut to crack. Usually movie makers resort to this theme for horror or myth based movies as there is always an element of superstition involved. My favourites in this category would be Tumbbad and Bulbul. Some exceptions of late have been the metaphor dense Karnan by Dhanush and the amazing thriller web series Suzhal by Pushkar-Gayatri. But, Kantara elevates much above all of them for one simple reason - a deep philosophical interpretation of Man and nature based on a simple folk story (and hence the tag line \"Danta kathe\").The movie at its core, is about the ownership of forest (or land) between the villagers, the original \"Dani family\" (descendants of King's family) and the Government who want to convert the forest into a reserve area. But inter-weaving the elements of panjurli (demi-God) dance, Kambala festival and the beautiful use of Varaha avatara of Vishnu (Varaha avatara, again, is a Boar who protects Earth or land out of the cosmic ocean), makes Kantara a satisfyingly unique experience in today's movie landscape. Kantara doesn't ridicule or trivialize any of the rituals of Dakshina Karnataka, but embraces them wholeheartedly to remind us that rituals are a way of life in India and needs an introspection instead of blindly rejecting them.+ve points:\nAll the panjurli sequences! If you think Raj B Shetty's tiger dance in Sojugada song was good, watch out for Rishab's avatara in the climax. The bar has been raised!!The Kambala race. I wish, there was more footage of this sequenceThe amazingly funny motely bunch of Shiva's friends. Some of the one liners are funny by themselves and the Mangalore accent, makes them even more enjoyableThe love track, even though a bit Arjun Reddy in nature, is very well integrated in the storySome of the one liners are nuggets of brilliant writing. Sample this - \"Maleyalli vadde aagi bandya? Illa Shuddhi aagi Bande\" or \"Gadiyaara yalli? Time kooda namma side aa?\" or \"Kona prannakke oodidare, Manushyange medal sigutte\"-ve points:\nThe sudden change of heart by the Forest officer is a bit unconvincingShiva's mother's acting is a bit filmy or over the top. (Interestingly she is a famous YouTuber who went viral with her kannada songs for kids during the lockdown)Shiva's constant rage and hitting everyone becomes repetitive after a pointMy rating:\nStory - 1. Its a beautiful amalgamation of Danta Kathe and its modern day repercussions\nScreenplay - 0.75. The interweaving of panjurli, land ownership, a love track and comedy is done very well.Acting - 0.75. Rishabh and Achyuth Kumar stand out with their power packed performance. The others, even though commendable, pale in comparison\nOther departments - 1. The Music, the cinematography, the VFX all blend in seamlessly into the story telling. This is how VFX should be. As a compliment to the main story, not as a distraction\nOverall package - 1. If you want to experience something unique in today's OTT world, something that will make you re-think about Indian rituals and rich culture, don't even think beyond Kantara. A must watch for any movie buff.Total 4.5/5P. S - Kannada movies are hitting it out of the park off late with the advent of OTT and the confidence provided by K. G. F. After a long time, I am feeling hopeful of the future projects in KFI.",

Mysterious forest)& While I believe it to be a pretty awesome movie, it's not the second incoming of Christ as some youtubers would like you to believe.I walked into the theatre expecting a 9/10 movie, but got that only in the first 20mins & last 20minutes of the movie.Other than that the majority of runtime follows Shiva, & his classic hero's journey, which we have seen countless times before. Mind you the movie's treatment during this time is pretty good, cinematography, superb action scenes add to the delight. Background score is good too, however the Hindi version I watched is a bit overloud at times.Everyone's at their A game while acting, & Rishab Shetty should probably walk away with a national award by the end of the year.Altho It falls into a trap of injecting unnecessary humor into the mix which feels off at times, but I've seen a lot of South Indian movies doing far worse.Action choreography is spectacular, camera work during these shots is brilliant, & so is the cinematography & art direction while capturing the soul of this forests & village.The mythology mixed with this story gives the movie it's much needed X factor, an adrenaline boost which majorly comes into play in the aforementioned first & last sections of the movie. Now I can't claim that I was able to understood each & every symbolism & reference to this tulu Nadu culture involving BUTA KOLA, DAIVVAS, BOAR incarnation of lord Vishnu, reference to classic folk tales about broken promises & betrayal.However unlike movies like KARNAN & TUMBBAD, this mythology is not something deeply embedded in majority of its middle section.(Now for negatives)story is literally tribals & villager fighting to keep their lands & forests, while a govt forest officer(played brilliantly by the actor btw)has his own priorities, & a std south movie villian who you can guess from a mile away. One has seen enough movies with this backbone of a story.Love interest character adds to the overall story, the development of this love story is underwhelming, he harasses her & she gives up the moment he helps him with her job. Her acting is okThere's not a single memorable character except Shiva, the forest officer & his father(despite his brief appearance).Shiva's friends are given ample screen time but they fail to stand out, so does the main villianOverall keep your expectations in check before walking in the theatre & you will have a blastIf you're expecting something extraordinary you'll be probably disssapointed.",

Bollywood directors should learn from south directors how to write scripts and produce a film based on Bharatiya Sanskriti and make films based on local topics, you don't need to skin to sell your content. I hope these Bollywood directors and producers watch this movie and learn from it.",

Overall good film but storytelling would have been done in much better . People who have watched KANTARA should watch KARNAN as well .Both movies are similar in my aspects. From my perspective KARNAN has high rates on cinematography and story telling,where as kantara has failed in it . Both movies have shown regional culture Which are the greatest things about this films . Appreciable thing is that indian audience is giving much support on such movies which shows our culture .

It is an experience like no other. It is mesmerising. I felt all sorts of emotions.When I hear the song varaha roopam I feel so emotional, I can literally see the video in my head, the faces and WOW.

            "content": "Rishab Shetty, like a man possessed, sets out to drag us, the audience, into his world, intent on showing us the beauty, cruelty and the divinity of a magical landscape. When you are done with the spectacle, you, the unsuspecting viewer, leave the theater spellbound, as in, possessed.The scenes unravel in multicolor inside your eyes when you are in a shower, chase you down when you are on your morning run and scream the blood curdling scream when you are tossing and turning on your bed trying to catch some sleep. It is as if Rishab opened your skull, sucked your soul and whisked you on a ride to go visit your ancestors. Your brain, body and heart simply surrender, taking in the sights and sounds. Something alters. You can almost touch the loss, feel the grief, ride the immense joy, yet with no known way to release that energy, you will never be the same after this journey. If you think Rishab was a channel to bring this energy into this world, you will realize that you are a channel too. It may take a while, but you realize and relish the privilege you have been bestowed upon.Nature vs man, spirits vs living, societal hierarchies - there are multiple ways to slice and dice this magnum opus, this humble offering by Rishab to our forefathers. Yet, at its core, I see this as a love story between a father and a son, the paternal spirit relentlessly hovering, reminding, nudging, pushing an adamant man/child into his duties as a son of the soil. The son, as sensitive and brilliant that he is, tries to keep the wisdom at bay, in his vain attempts to keep the real world at bay.Portraying the love of a father who continues guarding his people, his son, even in death, this movie is a tribute to our guardian angels who guide us towards righteousness. The message I walked away with is, \"This is yours, what you are made of. All of it - blood, sweat and beauty. Take it and cherish it.\"",

There is Kambala, and Bhoota Kola, and then there is the story itself that rings true which is captured with stunning visuals. All of this, makes for a film that is definitely worth your time!The music of Kantara is also a star of the film that not only supports the narrative but elevates it as well. The inspiration from local folklore of Karnataka, the local artists that were spoken to, and the ones who were also featured in the film add authenticity to the endeavour of adapting a folklore. It is a simple tale about a community reclaiming the lands that were originally theirs, owed to them by a man who bartered with them. It would have come across as uninspired, if not for the introduction of Bhoota Kola, and the myths that surround spirit worshipping.Above all of this, what really takes the prize is Rishab's acting. This is something that the director-actor's friends had hyped up before the release of the film. However, the hype is real. The last 40 minutes of the film is where Rishab has truly outdone himself, and every moment is gravitating. There is no way you could stray away from the screen, not even momentarily.",

Kudos for taking us into the depths of dravidian coastal culture. But it is not without flaws. When is Indian cinema going to move away from one hero single handedly fighting 10+ henchmen? Instead of the hero's semi-funny entourage there could have been at least 1-2 other strongmen to defend the village. The main villain is so clever through most of the story but suddenly turns dumb enough to even get in a shoot-out with the police/govt which doesn't make sense from a characterisation standpoint. These and a few other minor oversights aside, this is a gripping story with excellent screenplay and direction. The climax is one of the best.",

I have seen so many western and regional films but no one came close to this.I definitely recommend watching this film in a theater.

I discovered new things and nuances in this wonderful creation by Rishab Shetty, the actor,writer and director of this movie.Story is straightforward but told in such a raw fashion that it holds your interest throughout. Rural raw comedy, pure relationships, and friendly locals...all keep the drama going on with hints of Demi Gods appearing in jump scare shots. Romance is just right with just one (great) song. This story has romance,drama,divinity,comedy,music,local culture all in one.Whats mindblowing is last 40 minutes of the movie. This climax will be remembered in Indian cinema as a cinematic acheivement. I came out shaking with happiness/tears as the wonderful story ends in a unimaginable climax. I usually dont watch any movie, however good, more than once. But I watched this 3 times, because this is not a movie..its once in a lifetime experience.I dont know if people will talk about whether this deserves an oscar....but I will tell that Oscar deserves this movie.

But was expecting some production house to take up the responsibility of releasing the film in our telugu language. Thankfully allu aravind team quickly did the needful and released the telugu version today.Tribal people life and life style, their emotions and affection towards god and motherland portrayed very beautifully.Caste system, untouchability and greed are inherent elements of the main story line. First half of the film has all commercial elements like antagonist and protagonist confrontation, action, comedy progressing towards a thrilling intervalpost interval, the story unfolds actual crux and interestingly progresses towards a never seen on screen kind of climaxcinematography, screenplay, music & bgm and direction deserve heartful appreciation.",

Feeling proud that I am also part of this great heritage of Indian culture.I was stunned to see that the lead actor of the movie is also the Director and writer of the movie. I sincerely thank Hombale Films for showing their faith and hope in Shri Rishabh Shetty, who in turn has delivered a movie much bigger than KGF franchise will ever be (Sorry, but no sorry, since Kantara is rich in Heritage). No movie has ever stunned as a human. Mind you all the readers that I never took the pains of reviewing a film, by typing and all, muchless reviewing a movie on IMDB.Final verdict:\n1. It's criminal to watch it later on OTTs.2. With great respect, I am constrained to hold that it's a shame to miss out on the opportunity to watch this incredible Divine Experience in theatres.",

It takes a story seen very often in our daily lives and introduces some unique local flavour, rooting it to Indian culture, making it stand out from among other such tales. Then comes the real cherry on top of this beautiful cake- the breathtakingly beautiful cinematography of Arvind Kashyap. The way Arvind's lens has brought alive the folklore of Kantara is a lesson for storytellers. Some of the scenes of the buffalo racing in the beginning of the film deserve special praise, as do all the scenes from the festivities and visuals of the Daiva.The background score and music from Ajaneesh Loknath complements the camera work totally. The choice to use western instruments in some scenes depicting Indian festivities was a bold one and it pays off quite well. The score brings out the myths, culture, and feel of the land where Kantara is set, taking you into the heart of the story so easily that you forget you are sitting in a movie theatre in another part of the country.",

The movie is so grounded and attached to regional customs and their lives you can smell the soil. Rishabh Shetty penetrates the spirit of the character who is protagonist and takes us thru this unbelievable journey. Gluing story line with beautiful cinematography accompany equally outstanding BGM. Amazing experience Indian cinema needs creator like Rishabh Shetty. I would say the original storyline is the USP climax is mind blowing can Rishabh's acting is stands out to be the best so far. I had to watch in Hindi as I dont know kannada but I understand the culture living in Karnataka for sometime now.",

There have been better movies and i can still rate \"sholey\" above this. Bahubali was a masterpeace in indian cinema and was fully entertaining. Story line of kantara is very simple, and there is nothing unique about it. Of course, people vary in opinions, but this is how i felt after watching the movie. I went to see this movie after hearing a lot about the movie. However, it didnt give me any goosebumps except the last fight, and that too due to the acting portrayed.",

            "content": "After reading raving reviews, we drove an hour from Toronto to watch it. After a long time, good Kannada movies are being made and I wanted to support it by watching it in a theatre. This is a movie which has to be experienced on a big screen! Unfortunately, it was playing in a small screen theatre but nevertheless we are soooo glad that we got to watch it.Growing up in Tulunaad, I had heard about these practices but never got to witness them. I am so glad it took us back to our roots and culture with Bhoothakola, Panjurli and Daivaradhane. The movie grips you from the beginning and it only gets better with time. It's shocking to see how Rishabh did the Kambala. Unbelievable! Everything is presented in its raw nature. Be it the village, villagers or their talk. I loved listening to the phrase\"entha saavu maraya\" as this was so common to hear when we were growing up. So it brought back beautiful memories of hometown.There is nothing to match the climax. I was speechless and tried hard not to cry and I do not even remember the last song. I only remember my emotions,eyes welling up and the divine presence. How often can a movie make one feel like that? What was in it? It is beyond explanation and it is only to be experienced.But this is how India is, filled with divine aspects and this is a reminder for all of us that we cannot sideline such things calling them superstitions or blind beliefs. This is the belief with which people live! This is the reason why it has gone beyond language barriers because this divinity is present all throughout the country. Feels like this movie has connected the whole of India together.Thank you, Rishabh Shetty and team, for giving us such a beautiful movie. Every character was well etched and played amazingly. So simple and beautiful. We do not need men in 6 pack abs and skimpily dressed women in every movie. That does not represent our culture, but these do.When the movie ended, I could feel the shock and silence in the theatre, and I saw people wiping their tears. I did not know what to say myslef. I just drove back in silence trying hard to get hold of myself. I do not know what he must have experienced when he was in that role. He could not have performed like that without divine intervention. Like he said in his interview it is only to be experienced! Please go and watch this to experience the divine! Absolutely loved it and still can't get over the feeling!",

The struggle between uneducated and the literate clearly draws us to an important message on education too. The mysteriously killings across the village, the forest encroachment and the struggle for survival all seem to fit perfectly, it blends into a beautiful plot with an engaging storyline.

            "content": "Lot has been already told. So let me stay with specifics.Numbers:\nA movie that returns 15 times of budget in 30 days of its release is unbelievable. As the saying goes number speaks for themselves.Direction:\nRishab Shetty studied and traveled, developed story for four months. Then went on refining, self training (Mixed marshal arts and Kambala race for 4 months). Made sure every actor in the movie had workshops and training of local dialect. Then the director has to act his role, the hero of the movie. He relentlessly did 10-20 retakes. This was extended to lyrics writing (many trials with varied tunes). Photography/shooting had to deal with incessant raining.Setting:\nRural coastal Karnataka, forest and push the possibilities to limits without getting trapped in unnecessary VFX (most big budget movies spend 30-50% on this)Photography:\nGreat photography needs dedication, patience and using nature to your advantage. Otherwise you will end with some studio settings and artificial light. This movie proved it what a magic can happen with director and photographer in sync.Background Music:\nThis movie kept people either glued to their seats while mesmerized with audio effects. Consistency and working on details for months paid off. Only a good sound system like in theater can impart the experience that music director intended to provide.Songs:\nTake the example of singara siriye song:\nThe song is loaded.. Under 5 minutes it delivered many messages in video and audio.Video maintained the consistency in setting tells the story of its own.. humor, tradition, belief, life in the setting (rural coastal Karnataka) , their food, lifestyle, leisure all in the background while keeping the hero and heroine- blooming love, naughtiness and hero's quiet influence in the foreground.Audio has two parts. Voice/lyrics and instruments. Both were in symphony while turning into worm song. There are many instruments that are local to the place where this movie based used with painstakingly recording and seamlessly including them. Also other standard Indian instruments were used with some small western mix.",

It's doused in local flavour: the Bhoota Kola festival worshipping the Panjurli demigod, the annual kambala event featuring darting buffaloes, and the villagers hunting wild boars. Its cameras sway, its colours scream. It's an atmospheric visual feast: rains lashing the dense forest, fire torches slicing the forbidding nights, the camera swooping down the rural landscape. Rishab Shetty's Kantara is a tale about folklore, the importance of land and the beliefs of people. The film offers an immersive experience ..",

The film stars Shetty as a Kambala champion, who comes to loggerheads with an upright DRFO officer, Mura and You really cannot go wrong when the hero of a film is the story. There was a certain authenticity and rawness in the elements, like the Bhoota Kola festival and the Kambala competitions, that added to the movie. The biggest plus point for the movie is that it did not shy away from showing its imperfections. The actors looked believable as their characters, which strengthened the narrative. They were not just acting, but they had to shed their inhibitions at a level that is a testament to their expertise in their craft. By the looks of it, it is a mass entertainer, but you know immediately enough that it is just a cover. It certainly seeks to entertain, but it does not cater to anyone, and that is a movie with spirit. \"Kantara\" is one such film, and it also comes with a high rewatch value. If you had to watch one good film this week, month, or year, let it be \"Kantara.\" Your life will be all the more enlightened for it.",

Such a low budget movie and such beautiful cinematography is unbelievable. Cons: The only thing I think is the dubbing, could have been a bit higher quality.",

            "content": "A very unique culture that sees the divinity in nature has existed here since ancient times. Even if the upper part of some trees is cut off, the roots spread under the soil and new shoots are seen sprouting up. \"Kantara\" means the mysterious forest. In that mystery lies history, the forester, the god, and the children of the forest.The cinematic expression of a culture that embraces soil, wood, pig and cow is a must see for every Indian. We will have a family goddess to hold everyone together in the family. They have a village goddess to hold a village together, a god to hold a tribe and forest dwellers together. A god who holds the forest and its children together.God in the Varaha concept embraces nature and his children. And the mighty Gulikan as the guardian of the temple. Although he is a fierce figure, it is said that Panchuruli may forgive those who break his word because he is a god in the form of mother, but Gulikan has no such sentiments. For every drop of blood of his children Gulikan would keep the count and ask for every account.Gulikan is very well known to those in South India. It is a common practice in northern Kerala to give food for him at the family temple.There is nothing to be afraid of in the film. But we will be haunted by this story. Even if the movie is over, God's cross will come to our ears and shouts \"ooowwww....\" Kuladevata is someone who is always with us. She is a person we can see as a mother, a friend or a guide. A value-based life becomes its own when we hold them together and we move along with them.At the climax, Gullikan and Panchuruli uproots our conscious mind and throws us to our own existence. If you ask me why people cried, I can only say that some realizations came and went like lightning in their consciousness. Among those realizations there was the komara in the family temple where she was wearing red silk and hung drops of rice and flowers and showered her blessings.Finally there is a look of demigod who looks at us and laughs and it feels like he is asking 'did you forgot me and the promise?'\nAt that point it is natural for us to dig deep into our roots and get emotional.\"If you remember me, I will not forget you.. and if you forget, I will not forgive..\"",

I was not watching the movie I was in it and part of it. Truly a Cinematic masterpiece. Probably the best ending you will see in a cinema of any language. Can't describe the feeling in words.. out of a world experience.Rishab Shetty nailed it as an actor, and director. Those emotions in the movie truly if not for him I'm not sure who could have done. But seeing him as Shiva here is next-level experience, action stunts were top-notch. Raw intense acting & music makes this a classic. The music is haunting and it is uplifting. The casting is fantastic. I can see Kantara as one prime example of how to tell a story effectively.Rishab Shetty's mesmeric blend of action and mythology ranks among the best of Indian cinema. Artistic brilliance. Watching Rishab Shetty in Varah Roopam is pure bliss.The divine aspect is portrayed in a never before seen way. Makes you believe what's happening on-screen Kindles one's forgotten divine links and roots. The best part of the film however is the tenderness and respect with which the daiva aradhane, the bhoota kola is filmed.Kantara will definitely have a special place in the Kannada film industry for what it has achieved. Kantara is not just a movie. It's an experience of a lifetime.If you have not watched the movie, run now to the theaters while you can still experience it on the big screen. Don't miss it in theaters.Most mainstream cinema nowadays raises questions about our beliefs, mocks traditions & questions faith. What Kantara has managed to do is rekindle that belief in age-old traditions. It brought to life that faith so beautifully. Having faith is what brings peace.I am happy the Shetty boys aka RRR from Dakshina Kannada are getting their due. Been their fan since 2016 and watched all movies. Brightest stars from Kannada cinema. More power to them.Hats off to Team Kantara for creating a such piece of art. This movie deserves National Award.This movie is a pride that should be celebrated at many levels. A movie like Kantara comes once in a lifetime.Kantara is indeed a 10/10 movie. In every aspect - story, screenplay, music, bgm, cinematography, direction, emotional connection. Indian CINEMA of the Year!",

The film gives a very clear message\n1. The Government is a servant of the people and not the other way round.2. Governments have no business in controlling temples and its administration. At the most it must solves dispute if approached.3. Dharma and Religion are not the same. Dharma is law of nature ( like gravity ) Religion is a set of rules to understand nature.

Except the fighting scenes (which has to be exaggerated to be made in a movie), rest all seems to be any other folklore that we hear in the villages every day. Comedy dialogues are present at least in 80% of the scenes, they all are natural dialogues by common men. Each song in the movie complements & continuous the story in a beautiful way.The dramatical puzzle is revealed in such a manner, that no one can predict the ending of the story. When you rethink & join all pieces back, we'll realize that it has been told in a very wonderful way.In simpler words, the movie is technically rich, plot is real and raw, the action, narration, direction, music, background score along with Rishab Shetty's acting deserves the oscar award.",

We are introduced to Kambala (buffalo race), Bhootada Kola (worship of a demi god), and the story of a king who gives up a large tract of land for faith. Second layer consists of prime characters of the plot, their relationships and bonds. Third layer is the motivations and hidden agenda behind each of those characters. This unravels slowly in front of our eyes as the story progresses in unexpected twists and turns. The cinematography and the background score are so immersive that you become one with the cinema. This is the type of experience we all crave for. The fight choreography is surreal. The climax of the movie creates a powerful shock and awe. When the movie concludes, your mind remains in a state of trance as it is still processing what just happened. Some are stupefied, some have tears in their eyes, some are exhilarated.

What is remarkable is this movie is much more believable than Bahubali or even Ponniyin Selvan for me. Am no king, am no kingdom seeker, I have seen few inches of land taken away from family and have seen life and death around it. This movie despite the exxagerations (being possessed and killing hundreds of goons) stuck a deep impact in me. Despite not understanding the language fully, emotions soaked me up. We are our belief and the forest gods run deep in our nerves. Hats off Rishabh, thanks for making us believe within our boundaries and struggle for small land parcels and justice!",

Woooooh....\" The exhilarting experience I had in the last 20 mins of this goosebumps inducing masterpiece, written, directed and acted by Rishabh Shetty, will stay on for sometime. Man, what a movie, what a movie!!. The entire theatre erupted during the climax. The story is deep rooted in the mythology of the TuluNadu village of Karnataka. Many years ago in the 1847s, the King, in search of peace and happiness, stumbled upon two dieties: Panjurli and Guliga (one of them is forgiving and another is not), who were worshipped by the local tribes. The king traded his land to the villagers in exchange of the dieties' blessing for peace and happiness. There was a promise made by the king that the lands will always belong to the villagers. Cut to the 1970s, the descendants of the King as well as the villagers now live their lives. There is Shiva, the rowdy hero of the Village and there is a forest officer who is hell bent on making the lands of the Village an encroached area and declaring it a reserve forest. Shiva and the forest officer are always at loggerheads. How the calling comes for Shiva from the dieties and how the story of the promise made by the King is woven in the current age forms the crux of Kantara. This is a story of greed, religion, casteism and so much more. It won't be possible for me to do justice to the brilliance of this movie in a few words. This is simply an experience. Last time I felt so entranced was while watching 'Tumbbaad'. Rishabh Shetty as Shiva will just blow you away with his performance, just see the last 15 mins of his performance, it will definitely give you goosebumps. The rest of the cast is also phenomenal. The Cinematography is so mesmerizing, there are action sequences in mud, there are action sequences in rain, and they are choreographed very very well. The Music and Background music is awesome. Rishabh Shetty as the director and writer also does a phenomenal job. The screenplay is tight, it never loses its point.I watched the Hindi dubbed of this Kannada film, which is decent and will give you all the feels. This has to be, has to be experienced in theatres. Just watch it.",
