            "content": "I think there are some good reasons to criticize this film. It's a fairly stage bound adaptation of a play. That's not always a bad thing. In many cases, staging a film very similarly to the way the play was staged accentuates what works about the play. I don't think it really does here, and the film's repetitive structures leads to some dead patches. There's also a powerfully melodramatic tone to this film that I'm frankly just a bit unsure of.I also think there are extremely bad reasons to criticize the film, and these reasons are starting to emerge as the consensus among critics in the mainstream media. This isn't a film about a very fat man. It's a film about someone with an extremely destructive eating addiction caused by grief and regret and the complete lack of self-worth that accompanies those feelings sometimes. There have been films that deal with drugs, alcohol, gambling and sex, but apparently when it comes to food, the only thing that this film can be doing is inviting you to gawk at the big fat guy. It's a very strange conclusion to reach that I speculate is generated by coming into the film dead set on the idea that this is all it can be doing.I did not come away from this film with any notion that I was supposed to see Frasier as anything less than a human being deserving of our deepest empathy. The film parades in some shocking imagery, especially up front, but I found that once I confronted it, my initial reaction subsided and I was seeing Frasier for who he was. I think it's an extraordinary double-standard that people can watch Nicolas Cage indulge in ridiculous and cartoonish bouts of binge drinking in \"Leaving Las Vegas\" and declare brilliance, but balk at Frasier's fits of VERY CLEARLY self-annihilating eating in this film and think we are only supposed to be processing it as some kind of freak show.I don't think this is an incredible film, and I wouldn't place it among Aronofsky's best. I do think Frasier's performance is brilliant, and the film is a flawed, but often marvelous character piece about a kind of addiction we seldom confront.",

            "content": "Let me start by saying I've been a fan of Fraser since seeing Encino Man as a kid and this guy will always be one of my favorites. To see him somehow thrown out of Hollywood/not casted for the most part for the past decade was very frustrating for me. It was about time someone gave him another chance which Aronofsky and A24 did and it proved successful mainly because of Brendan's dedicated and emotional performance.The film itself is quite less pretentious and more honest than most of A24 films to date . It also has more of a down to earth straight forward delivery than most of Aronofsky's perplexing work. Honestly with the subject matter it needed to be and relies mostly on pure emotion and struggle which is shown masterfully by Fraser.There have been a lot of preconceived outraged overreactions and ridiculous assumptions based on the fact that Fraser is wearing a fat suit/getting prosthetics to appear as a morbidly obese person. I don't see why this is a problem mainly due to the fact this is a film made to entertain and to do so sometimes you wear things or makeup to alter looks. It would be difficult to cast a real life person off the street and have them pour their real emotions out on screen. I don't see that being easy.Also this is so much deeper than the looks of Fraser in the film and that's the true intention and power of this piece. People must see this raw and moving performance from Brendan and it's sure to cause a stir. This is the due Renaissance and comeback for Mr. Fraser. Oscar should be coming his way.",

            "content": "Darren Aronofsky's \"The Whale\" is a deeply moving story about redemption, loss, and trauma. It revolves around a morbidly obese middle-aged man named Charlie who after losing his boyfriend goes into complete shock and denial and starts to gain weight uncontrollably. After his boyfriend tragically passed away, Charlie gives up hope and becomes a nihilist and rather pessimistic, as opposed to an eternal optimist in which he is remembered as. He uses food as a coping mechanism to suppress his deep-rooted feelings. This insatiable hunger lasts for eight years, until his rebellious daughter Ellie shows up. Charlie wants to reconnect with his estranged daughter, whereas his daughter feels differently. The title refers to Herman Melville's seminal novel \"Moby Dick\", which plays an important part in the narrative of the movie. In fact, it foreshadows the eventual climax of the film, which will tear audiences apart. The final minutes of the film completely wrecked me, thanks to Brendan Fraser's incredible performance and his instant chemistry with Sadie Sink. I wouldn't be surprised if the film garners Oscar nominations in the best actor and best supporting actress categories for Brendan Fraser and Sadie Sink respectively. Hong Chau is a knockout, as well.Final verdict: 8.5/10.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Brendan Fraser deserves an Oscar nomination. There's a sentence I never even imagined writing. If you recall (and you are excused if you don't), Mr. Fraser's early acting career is noted for such 'prestige' films as ENCINO MAN (1992), GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE (1997), DUDLEY DO-RIGHT (1999), and BEDAZZLED (2000). And yes, I'm being a bit unfair in the films I chose to name, as he has also had some solid performances along the way. However, nothing on his resume could have prepared us for what he delivers on screen in this latest from director Darren Aronofsky (BLACK SWAN, 2010).Award-winning playwright Samuel D Hunter adapted his own play for the big screen, and it's one that will surely drag you down and pound your emotions, even as it mesmerizes you. We first hear Charlie's (Fraser) soothing voice as he addresses the online college writing class he teaches. We see the students' faces on his laptop, but Charlie's square is blacked out. He explains the camera on his laptop is still \"broken\". Class ends and Charlie's friend Liz (a terrific Hong Chau, \"Watchmen\") shows up to read his blood pressure at 238/134. Charlie is a massive human being, barely mobile, and nearing death.Liz is also a nurse and tends to Charlie in a sense of loyalty and caring through their friendship ... the origin of which we learn later in the story. Thomas (Ty Simpkins, JURASSIC WORLD, 2015), who says he's a missionary from New Life Ministries, knocks on the door as Charlie is in medical distress. Liz treats Thomas as an intruder and demands he leave, while Charlie remains civil to him. Given his ticking clock, Charlie reaches out to his teenage daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink, \"Stranger Things\"). The two haven't seen each other in the years since Charlie left for a new lover. To say that Ellie has pent-up rage and anger directed at her long-lost dad would be understating the situation. She blows into his apartment like a tornado, spewing venom towards Charlie. They do come to an arrangement that entices her to return to visit while he agrees to assist with her delinquent school assignments.Almost the entirety of the story takes place in about 300 square feet of the upstairs apartment Charlie is confined to. The tight space adds tension to every interaction between the four characters, including Charlie's ex-wife Mary (Samantha Morton, IN AMERICA, one of my favorite forgotten gems from 20 years ago). Brendan Fraser uses his eyes to convey so many thoughts, even as we turn in disgust at his eating habits. An excellent score from Rob Simonsen and expert camera work from cinematographer Matthew Libatique complement the stunning performance from Fraser, and the numerous moments of intense tension and emotional turmoil. There are only a few times throughout where the live stage source material sticks out, and the ending is handled beautifully, allowing us a respite from the emotional rollercoaster of the past two hours.Now showing in theaters.",

            "content": "There's a part of this movie that even before going in I was apprehensive about. Is it exploitative? More than probably, yes. Is it phobic in a certain way? It isn't impossible to think that. But being far removed from certain aspects of what the movie shows and yet being so close and feeling related to a lot of other things the movie portrays, I can only speak from what I got and felt about this movie.Performances by Brendon Fraser, Sadie Sink and Hong Chau were absolutely fantastic. But that's something almost everyone knew even before going in. What really touched me was the detailing through which they showed why each character behaves in certain ways and how everything ended up this way. The absolute helplessness of humans under a system and subsystems across various levels of power that are meant to make life better creates more obstacles for everyone involved are arguably the root of the evils here. But the way each person deals with the evils they face is entirely different even when those reactions have so much in common. That is really reflected in each of the performances. Each of them shows a variety of emotions that are so humane and makes your heart break even more with the contrast between their philosophies on life and how life treats them.For me, the film wanted to tell us that everyone is flawed, but it's the authenticity that should matter more than anything else which should be the road to happiness in life.",

Under direction of Aronofsky it's probably the best dramatic film of the year.Fraser portrays the role to perfection. You feel sorrow for his character. The lady from Stranger Things that plays his daughter he is trying to reconnect with is going to be a huge star.There is nothing unlikable about this film. Fraser tugs at your heart strings with the struggles his character goes through.It's almost hard to watch at certain points in film; I had to take several breaks it's very emotional.Fraser is a very genuine guy in real life I have met him twice a decade apart and he was the same amazing guy.I hope this film does very well and ushers back a long awaited revival for Mr Fraser in Hollywood.Brilliant actor & film.10/10.",

Aronofsky is not a subtle filmmaker, but each of these characters is given such satisfying depth and is portrayed with their flawed perspectives and endearing desires on full display.The film has no hero or villain. Everyone is made out to be both to an extent and it's heart-wrenching to come to know these people throughout the film and watch them seek redemption.Some have criticised the screenplay as melodramatic-I didn't find this to be the case. I found it largely authentic, tragic, and full of intrigue that compounds as more information is revealed.My only glaring issue with the film is that one of the characters starts out as complex and with a singular nature, only to have that completely altered, oversimplified, and abandoned in his final scene. It seemed to me that this was done for the sake of the desired themes but at the expense of the character.But Brendan Fraser's performance alone marks this film as a colossal triumph, and there is much excellence to be seen throughout its entirety.",

            "content": "See The Whale just to watch consummate actors, Branden Fraser and Sadie Sink, playing father and daughter, furiously catch up with each other after years of separation. Set in Charlie's apartment, just big enough for his morbidly huge body, The Whale is not only about the reconciliation of this odd couple and the survival of obese Charlie but rather about how obsession can consume faster than a greasy piece of pizza.Besides his abuse of food, Charlie refuses to let the Zoomed-in students see him in his rolling flesh. Yet, he is not self-centered or food-obsessed enough not to care about others, especially his flinty daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink, so much like a young Ellen Page), for whom he writes college essays (he teaches writing) and saves for her over $100K. His heart is as big, well, as his body.Writer Samuel D. Hunter (also author of the play) and director Darren Aronofsky move Charlie toward either reclamation or death; they remind us he did abandon normal life for a gay love, who eventually committed suicide, and over whom Charlie has not recovered. Good enough for Charlie to despair and abandon himself to food.Ellie's finishing high school is Charlie's other obsession, and whether or not they all can survive their confrontation is the abiding suspense. Pervading the drama is a sense of regret in almost every character except maybe the pizza delivery boy, Dan (Sathya Sridharan). Even Charlie's ex, Mary (excellent Samantha Morton), suffers the sorrows of their split family.Hong Chau, who has had a great year, if only for her role in Triangle of Sadness, plays the gritty Liz, a caretaker for Charlie and true friend, regretting Charlie's descent that allows no trips to the hospital and hides his money for his unstable daughter.The itinerant Jesus fan, Thomas (Ty Simpkins), is food for another essay but for now an effective emblem of the intricate characters supporting Charlie's journey. Herman Melville lends figurative richness to the proceedings. If I haven't convinced you of the gold in this small film about a big man, go see it to witness my prediction that Fraser will win Globes and Oscar.",

            "review_title": "A solid 10 for Brendan Fraser! but THE WHALE gets a 6!",
            "content": "Brendan Fraser should win every award possible for his role in THE WHALE. This would have been a very easy role to stereotype, yet Fraser made it complex, compelling, full of vulnerability and heart. This film succeeds because of Fraser's performance.Otherwise the film struggled.WHAT WORKED:\nTonally it worked. It had a dark, dramatic feel, the eating scenes were hard to watch, because you felt the pain of the character. The Production Design also worked well. The relationship between Charlie and Liz was the most believable, compelling, and grounded. I also didn't mind the aspect ratio, a bold and jarring choice at first, but you quickly realize it makes Charlie seem bigger in the frame, and this also works. Sound design worked well and the score (though at times a bit too dramatic) also served the film.WHAT DIDN'T WORK:\nBecause it was based on a play it was filmed much like a play. The blocking was really distracting, characters would get up and walk two steps then turn around, making human actions and purpose a bit unbelievable. There was overacting and overly dramatic performances especially from Ellie and Mary. Ellie was supposed to be a hurt and broken teen, yet it was played one note, with the same intensity from beginning to end. With the exception of Ellie's last line \"Daddy!\" the entire time she's on screen the actress portrays the same over the top actions, lacking in subtlety, nuance and emotional range. Even Samantha Morton who I consider to be a fantastic actress has some moments where it feels overacted/over the top and disingenuous, which makes me wonder if it was directed this way (as a play might have been on a stage). The writing was also at times a problem. It was hard to believe character motivations at times for why they would do certain things. The character of Thomas's want didnt' see earned or strong enough, the main purpose of his existence in the story was to give Ellie a \"person to save\" but the continued appearance of Thomas's character felt unearned and at times unbelievable, and when his true mission is revealed it's not some big altering reveal, more of a forced, and lack-luster one. Overall, some script/story decisions felt forced and convenient. Compared to Aronovsky's Pi, Requiem for a Dream, and Black Swan, The Whale is forgettable, lacking that \"je ne sais quoi\" that exists in Aronovsky's earlier works. But all of that aside, BRAVO to Branden Fraser who deserves to bask in every glory for his stellar performance as Charlie.",

Brendan Fraser's beautiful performance holds the film together and gives it all its power, in a role that I hope will bring him the recognition he deserves. All the rest of the cast also does an excellent job.

            "review_title": "Brendan Fraser's Tour De Force",
            "content": "While the title itself would be a pejorative for someone morbidly obese, it really ties into a story that the lead character Charlie holds dear to his failing heart. That is the story of \"Moby Dick\" Though the tale itself doesn't really come into play, if not for only the last great memory he has is of the sea and of a daughter that he had abandoned when he feel in love with someone of the same sex.Much has been said about Brendan Fraser's performance, and I couldn't agree more with the accolades he will get. As he is someone who is playing someone so uncomfortable in his skin, Fraser seems entirely wrapped up into the man's eat-to-death skin. And as someone who has had friends who are delusional when it comes to self-awareness of excess weight, the character of Charlie REALLY knows he is done with life. When he is reunited with his really estranged daughter, there is so much anger and resentment built up, you can feel the ugliness of family and the ability for them to destroy your insides. But Charlie doesn't take it to heart after all, he is the catalyst for the well earned disgust and hate. Hard to hammer on a guy who knows life has him beat. He is also doted on by his life partner's sister who seems to be both a caretaker and an enabler. She is played by Hong Chau, who brings so much connection to Charlie's lot in life. She both understands and has to standby as he self-destructs. This is very similar to the Elisabeth Shue character in \"Leaving Las Vegas\"This movie is not for everyone. People who have suffered abandonment and require easy answers isn't going to get it fully. There is no forgiveness for Charlie. Though he isn't exactly clamoring for it either. He wants to do the right thing, and tends to annoy people with his optimism despite his physical ailments. At a certain point one has to allow the person to go unto the inevitable end. Is this love? Not quite. Nor has he ever gotten it. But for a movie that relies on the past and history and family dynamics to guide the emotions involved here, a little background may have helped. Perhaps Charlie's own childhood would be a window into his self-destruction. Instead, the audience needs to piece together, perhaps, the backstory from scant clues.A one location drama is a remarkable feat we should all celebrate. \"Who's Afraid Of Virginia Wolf?\" blows any of them away. But director Darren Aronofsky does wonders with an isolated Idaho apartment. As if the outside world is as bleak as the one he is entombed in. The story of Charlie and his ultimate future is what should keep you watching. For others who require a lot of action, this is not for you. It is a quiet piece that Fraser absolutely nails through gestures and emotions. Some have criticized this movie for exploiting an obese person. At moments I felt the pity come through. But the wise decision was to make Charlie seem at peace with his decisions he's made, though still disappointed. What lifts him to the resolution we want comes from him coming to terms with his relationship with his daughter. But also, a incredibly uncomfortable moment with his ex-wife (nearly unrecognizable Samantha Morton) who has fallen into the bottle yet still holds warmth for Charlie.People aren't going to like how the world caters to Charlie. It could be uncomfortably funny as in \"The Simpsons\" where Homer gets morbidly obese to get to work from home. There is no motivation here for that. He is a recluse who enjoys the occasional visit and sometimes self-pity. And that will turn many people off.I wish there was a happier ending. But that's not what you go to an Aronofsky movie for. Not sure what this is trying to fully say. Perhaps...we make decisions in our lives that sometimes we can't repair, but the other person needs to know they tried? Maybe. It's a tricky line that isn't going to sit well with everyone. I happened to appreciate it. Maybe you will too.",

This movie probably will not affect everyone the same way but it definitely had an impact on me. I've never seen anything like this before. Ever.",

I think NOW it's the perfect time to make a one in a lifetime exception and give an Oscar to Austin Butler AND Brendan Fraser - they both deserve this by such gripping and well played performances...but I digress, You want to hear about the movie....Sometimes a movie comes out at the write time and post all the C19 isolation, this movie might actually hit more people than it would have done before, and that is a good thing!This movie is written in such a beautiful manner that it instantly should become a classic of our times. The even more beautiful part here is, that it also relates to a classic, by referencing Moby Dick a lot and this makes you (re-)think and put it all into perspective.You like Max in Stranger things? Excellent, Sadie Sink does such a good job that you can't feel anything but despite and hate for her character. Hong Chau also does great work and delivers probably the best performance of her career here, I would love to see her rewarded for this with at least a nomination.This movie will take you onto a boat, sometimes the waves will hit it hard and it gets rocky, sometimes the quietness of the sea let's you reflect on the bigger picture.

His daughter who he hasn't seen in 9 years he reaches out to because he thinks he is dying and when she arrives it is kind of like she hadn't seen him for a week. I know her character was supposed to be unlikeable but her character had really no depth, just hateful and mean. They could've added more to her understandably let down and abandoned personality. That's kind of how I felt about everything though. Maybe had there been flashbacks of Brendan's character younger with his partner, delving into their relationship more or his struggle with mental health or the period when he chose to leave his family....there wasn't enough depth to any of that. No connection to his partner and what lead him to what he became. I wanted to connect more with this story, I wanted to feel more his past that lead him to his miserable future.I'm also not saying Brendan's performance wasn't good, but I'm not sure I felt it was Oscar worthy.

Even the only kind character (nurse) in the film enabled him by continuing to bring him the exact thing that was killing him while remaining upset with him for his choices?Also, if you were that bothered about about your kid growing up to be a caring person, surely you would use the money to get a gastric band and continue to be her father?

His only visitors are his nurse, his embittered daughter, a religious missionary boy hoping to convert him, his ex-wife, and his pizza delivery man who has come to know him by name. Fraser is buried under a fat suit simulating a 600-pound man. Many have praised Fraser's performance, and it is very good, but I don't think it is Oscar worthy. Working under heavy makeup is not an automatic Oscar nod IMHO. I was actually more impressed with the supporting players' performances, especially Sadie Sink as his daughter and Hong Chau as his long suffering but devoted nurse.

Brendan Fraser gives a career best performance and hits all the right notes, as does the rest of the cast. The issue for me was how the material was handled. I heard so many critics saying how \"kind\" and \"empathetic\" this movie was and how it was Aronofsky's first movie since The Wrestler to accomplish such a thing. The only thing I can say is that this movie is basically a carbon copy of The Wrestler, right down to the ending, but it was anything but empathetic and kind. Unfortunately, one of my biggest complaints of this movie was how mean spirited it was. The only kindness we really get is from Fraser's Charlie. Even Simpkin's ever sweet character succumbs to cruelty. I also understand that the filmmakers want so bad to show food as an addiction, but it got way too over the top. The whole movie, even down to the title, feels more or less like a sideshow attraction to Fraser's character. Plain and simple, it's as much a dramatic character story as it is a deeply cynical body horror film. I'm disappointed.C.",

A smart curveball after the world's response to Aronofsky's last masterwork, Mother! - I have never witnessed another film so passionately hated on in my entire lifetime. While The Whale and Mother are about equally bleak, The Whale sits almost entirely in the realm of realism while Mother was the polar opposite - pure surrealism, which clearly the average person cannot seem to find the value in. Out of all of Aronofsky's films, this one is definitely most comparable to The Wrestler - it comes as no surprise that The Wrestler was his most successful film, as it was the \"easiest to watch\" and was his only other film that featured almost no surrealism. The Whale is definitely a heavier viewing than The Wrestler as it features almost no moments of relief, fun, or positive vibes - it starts heavy, and consistently gets heavier as it progresses, so you have to feel \"up to it\" before you start this anvil of an experience. I feel blessed to have family who I can go to something like this with on Christmas Eve and have everyone be okay with it.Yes, I would be happy if Brendan Fraser wins an Oscar for this. When the film first starts, you kind of feel like you're in for this weird novelty thing, but within 10 or so minutes, you're in Charlie's house - that's not Brendan anymore, it's Charlie. The whole cast does a really great job, even Sadie Sink who's character is very one-dimensional, but she's supposed to be. She is a representation of a teen so damaged and so estranged that forgiveness and softness is impossible, only pure angst remains.My girlfriend calls this \"the saddest movie she's ever seen\", and though I didn't have that thought personally I would never argue against it. I really think that people who hate on Aronofsky films are mostly just people who are either uncomfortable with getting into a deeply emotional state or are uncomfortable with legitimate darkness as a whole. I see people talking smack about the ending in some of these reviews but the ending is what really got me. When I really started bawling was when the credits hit, when the whole cohesive experience came smashing into me like a sledgehammer with a nice Christmas bow on top of it.Everything is just really immaculate here, specifically the writing, directing, acting from the entire cast, and the overall structuring of the entire experience. It's not exactly an ENJOYABLE experience, but it is a crushingly powerful film, and in my opinion its flawless.(FYI, I consider Requiem For A Dream, Black Swan, The Wrestler, Mother, and The Whale to be Aronofsky's masterpieces, while I'm also a big fan of The Fountain - it's got my favorite music composition of all time in its finale!)",

            "content": "SCORE: 10/10I needed to go to bed and regain my energy level before writing a review about this movie I saw last night. By far the most emotionally draining thing I have ever watched. But, before I get into the review of the movie, let me start by saying one thing. DO NOT listen to those idiots on Tik Tok or reviews warning Christians not to see this movie. Those people are the exact type of people this film is calling out and, as a strong Christian myself, I commend them for doing it. They are the ones that give us a bad name. Christianity is a faith, not a people, and it is humans that use their own free will to do messed up things that tarnish its reputation. Their actions do not speak for what all of us believe. Okay, now for the actual movie.In my opinion, this was the movie of the year and one of the best movies I have ever seen. I was someone who loved Elvis more than others and thought Austin Butler was a lock for Best Actor, but this completely changed my mind. I was extremely skeptical when I kept hearing people crown Brendan Fraser as Best Actor in his first film back, but there was something different about his performance and the movie in general. A lot of absolutely amazing movies came out in 2022 and there was no way that I thought this one had a chance of competing or that there was any possible way 2022 could bless us with an almost perfect movie. I was wrong. Most of what makes this movie so amazing is how simple and human it is. The entire movie takes place in one location, Charlie's apartment, and adds to the beauty of the acting performances and how they were able to make something so awesome. Sadie Sink was the perfect casting for his daughter and I enjoyed what both Ty Simpkins and Hong Chau added to the movie.I could honestly speak forever about this film, but it was really all about human struggle, which I know didn't sit well with a lot of people. It was so hard for everyone to sit in the theater and watch Charlie get treated the way he did and constantly see the struggles of all the characters. His line when he exclaims \"I just want to do one good thing with my life\" was the moment that broke me. It gave me \"it's not your fault\" vibes from Good Will Hunting. The movie starts with us meeting Charlie in a very uncomfortable way, but as it goes on we really get to learn more about his personality, mainly his optimism towards people. The plot was definitely more on the dark side, which made the humorous scenes that much better. Ellie's interactions with both her father and Thomas allowed the audience to take a little break from the awfulness of the story and have a genuine good laugh. Time after time we see the characters blame each other, with it getting nastier as the film goes on, but each relationship almost ends in the same way. After shouting, cursing, and belittling the other person, a real, human moment occurs where you see the two people connect again. It's a magical moment where you realize that all the yelling and screaming is coming from a place of care and love so strong that it's not until popping off that they realize what they really value, which is each other and having a relationship. Remember, forgiving someone does not equate to giving them another chance, but is necessary when someone is truly, genuinely sorry.Honestly, the story was just too top tier for me to be solely focused on the lessons I learned, which is unbelievable. I found myself just so emotionally drained for the fictional story that was created and, when I say there wasn't a single person walking out of the theater without crying, I'm not lying. It is also probably the only movie that made me start crying in my car when I thought about it after it was over. I think the most important things to take away from the movie is that people you love will make mistakes, there is always a deeper reason why people do the things that they do, and the more compassion and empathy we show towards other the better. It also, as most powerful movies do, shows the importance of communication and being truthful with how you feel. The ending, although absolutely heartbreaking, was beautiful in the way that it encourages all of us to stop subscribing to the BS way of life that everyone tries to sell you and live authentically. Never give up on those you love and always lend a helping hand to those in need. My gosh was it so painful to watch Charlie go through what he went through, but it's even 1000x more painful to know how realistic it truly is.",

Hunter who also wrote the screenplay should also be nominated for this years Best Picture ,Best Screenplay and Best Director Darren Aronofsky and the very effective but unobtrusive score by Rob Simonsen should also be nominated in my opinion.It's unfathomable to me that this movie has only three nominations Best Actor ,Best Supporting Actress and Best Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling.It's an intimate and honest movie I read that the reason it was shot in the 4.3 frame aspect was so the audience can't ignore the amount of space Charlie takes up in the world as he never leaves the apartment over the course of the movie.The other thing audiences can't possibly ignore is Brendan Fraser's finest screen performance.",

Due to many personal things throughout his life, he hasn't been around much, but I'm very happy he is making a strong return to acting. The Whale is his latest release and while I wouldn't exactly say the film itself is incredible, his performance is and it's actually so good that it almost made me just say, \"screw it, this is the best film of the year.\" I didn't quite get there after thinking about it, but here's why this film is more than worth seeing for the performance alone.Being severely obese after a lifetime of wrong choices and hardships, Charlie (Brendan Fraser) is in his final days and trying to continue his job as an online English teacher. The premise of this film aside from that is the fact that he hasn't seen his daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink) in many years and would like to reconnect with her. Ellie is a troubled teenager and wants nothing to do with her father, as he abandoned her and her mother. The reasoning behind that had me in tears by the end of the film, but I won't ruin that here. The relationship between the two of them is absolutely heartbreaking, but it worked really well.It was nice to see Ty Simpkins return to acting here as well and Hong Chau as Liz was great too. Her back and forth with Fraser was very enjoyable. Why you should see this film though is Brendan Fraser, period. It sounds cliche to say that he transformed himself and he deserves an Oscar, but all of that chatter out of festivals this year is all true. His performance here is unlike anything he has ever done. My eyes couldn't leave the screen due to his performance. I found The Whale slightly slow, but the film also flew past because I was loving him in this film so much. Darren Aronofsky directed a career-best performance out of Fraser and it's why I loved watching this movie overall.The Whale doesn't suffer from being strictly about this man in his apartment, but those issues fade away due to this powerhouse lead. The camerawork by Matthew Libatique, although simple, was also stellar. The choice of aspect ratio also made it feel like you were confined in this apartment with Charlie. Look, this isn't a perfect film and I think the ending is abrupt, but it moved me. It broke my heart into a million pieces in the best way. If you're looking for a heartbreaking drama, look no further than The Whale. Now playing in theatres.",

It suffers when it comes to writing and pacing, and isn't quite as visually dynamic or cohesive as most of Darren Aronofsky's films, but succeeds when it comes to acting (and parts of it are moving, at least during the scenes that are well-written).Brendan Fraser's great of course, and it's worth watching the movie for him. If he wins the Oscar for his performance, I think it'll feel like a deserved win. He does more than just letting the prosthetics and special effects do the work for him, and when it comes to the things he has to do physically and emotionally, he's remarkable.Elsewhere, Hong Chau and Sadie Sink are both very good, but I do question the writing of the latter's character. I also didn't think the characters of Thomas and Charlie's ex-wife were very consistently written or interesting at all, but would blame that more on the writing than the performances of their actors. I'm not sure anyone could make them feel like real people with the material here. Sink's character also feels like a caricature, but she does well considering what she's given.It's all a bit boring visually (even by the standards of one-location movies), and I didn't love the pacing (even if it builds to an ending that's solid). I mean, some things also felt telegraphed and on-the-nose a little too much- I just didn't really think this was well-written or paced, and lacked the visual oomph of Aronofsky's other movies.But Fraser's great, as are the other actors, and it's unique and emotional in parts. I can see some loving this and some hating it. I really liked parts, and wasn't crazy about other parts, but still feel like it ends up being decent overall.",

Meanwhile the men are all weak and pathetic and relentlessly apologetic. It's hard to say what the point of it all is, other than to spend two hours in the company of no-one you'd want to know, but it does hold the attention for the most part and Fraser makes of his role something quite memorable.There's no great twist to the story, and it never escapes the feeling of being just a well-shot play, almost entirely set in the same room, with people continually getting up to leave and then deciding to stay a little too often. Much of the script is lazy, with weak characterizations for everyone, and it falls quite some way short of adding up to anything meaningful enough to truly justify the time out of our lives we give it. But it's still a cut above most things at the cinema these days and one of Aronofsky's better films.",

It appears Charlie, an English teacher, was at one time married with a daughter. He left that behind 8 years prior after falling in love with a male student, abandoning his daughter. In those 8 years his gay lover it appears committed suicide, and as a result Charlie started eating himself to death. The timeline seems a little short for this progression to me. His daughter Ellie renters his life, and she is really an unlikeable, miserable person with zero redeeming qualities. Mixed in is also some sort of boy pretending to be a missionary??? He keeps coming back trying to save Charlie, but his back story is revealed and it makes little sense. Charlie is cared for by his ex lovers sister, a nurse that while caring for him, enables him to continue his slow suicide. None of these characters add much to the story, all are unlikeable. Brendan Frazier did a wonderful job playing this broken fat soul. That's about it. The movie itself was pretty lousy, the supporting characters were forgettable. I wouldn't say not to watch, but don't expect much other than being repulsed and depressed.",

            "content": "Darren Aronofsky has always trafficked in extreme scenarios and grotesque images to convey either addiction or obsession, depending on the film. His scripts would be comic in how OTP they are if they weren't bolstered by flourishes of hyper-intense editing, sound design, score, and photography. I know this because The Whale lacks many of those flourishes until its final act, where they arrive with all the enthusiasm of a student late for a (video) lecture. That's not a slight against the look and sound of the film; it's fine. It's Aronofsky at his most impartial, which makes the extremely repulsive dramatic beats of the film - including but not limited to heart attack masturbation, Brendan Fraser inhaling pizzas, Brendan Fraser vs gravity, and Sadie Sink being the world's most terrible teenager, if not person - hilarious. The filmmaking doesn't mix with the story being told, that's the problem.I don't imagine too many people would legitimately object to the film's framing of morbid obesity as bad. No sane person would consider Charlie's lifestyle and body shape anything other than an illness or malformation. It is perhaps condescending at times, certainly. The scene where Brendan Fraser cannot pick up a key because of his extreme corpulence has the same feel as that episode of The Simpsons where Homer becomes obese. The fat suit prosthetic is not at all convincing, though I don't dispute the need for it. I can think of no working actor who is Charlie's size, and even if there was, there'd be something perverse about ensuring they remained that size throughout production, like enabling a drug addiction. What IS extraordinarily offensive in the film's messaging, though, is its strong and seemingly intentional message that cyberbullying at worst is an authentic expression of the self, and at best an act of charity.The elephant, or whale, in the room is the matter of Brendan Fraser's acting. Is he good? Of course he is. Not Oscar winning material, but perhaps Oscar nominee material. He makes a character that is a near-saint feel real. The stagey script always pushes these anguished declarations from Charlie of how much of a martyr he is. Fraser has to fight against a narrative pull toward a sort of Christ for fat people, countering the resistible impression left from scene after scene of self-pity.Everyone in the film is good, maybe excluding Sink. She's supposed to imbue Ellie with a hidden empathy, but I never saw it in her performance. Such a disappointment from one of my favourite directors.",

            "content": "It's a drama about six people searching for meaning in life. It is set in a single room in Idaho in 2016 during the presidential primary season and follows a week in the life of a morbidly obese college English instructor.Charlie (Brendan Fraser) is the college instructor who gained most of his 600 pounds after his partner, Alan, committed suicide. Charlie left his wife, Mary (Samantha Morton), for Alan eight years earlier. He also left his daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), who is now 16 years old and an intelligent but embittered teenager. Charlie's nurse, Liz (Hong Chau), cares deeply for Charlie and is frustrated that he won't go to the hospital for treatment. Thomas (Ty Simpkins) is an evangelical missionary, apparently from the New Life Church, that believes without a doubt that God is the answer to Charlie's situation.Throughout the movie, these characters interact as they come to see Charlie. The metaphor of Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\" hovers in the background and reappears at crucial times. The relationship between Charlie and Ellie, whom Charlie has not seen in eight years, is particularly sharp. Liz's chiding of Charlie while she enables his food addiction seems spot on. The Thomas character creates some interest as the movie progresses but is the weakest of the characters in the script. Evangelical Christianity does not come off well in \"The Whale.\"\"The Whale\" is a powerful movie that makes viewers yearn for a positive ending. The acting of all the characters is strong. One is almost repulsed by Brendan Fraser but compelled to watch his remarkable performance. This is not an action drama, but the script is very well done.",

            "content": "On the flipside, I wasn't happy with Aronofsky's choice to give us a film sized inside a square - 1970's tube TV's aspect ratio, when many of us paid a lot of money for wide-screen TV's. That was constantly annoying throughout the entire film.But I did enjoy the fact this film had many layers to it, but I'm not sure that all those layers were executed properly. For example, the end result of how Thomas' family responded to Ellie's actions is a coin toss, and either result would've not defined Ellie's true intentions or her character. For that matter, Thomas' relevance in the film was also in question, and felt more like an unnecessary distraction instead of complimenting the narrative.The same goes for Ellie's character and her true feelings about her dad, and questioning her true character; was she a hateful troubled teenager, or did she actually have a caring and loving side. The filmmakers didn't leave that too much in question, and had me convinced she actually was that terrible teenager, which ultimately detracts from the final scene.I've never seen the play, but as a film, just those few issues needed more exploration and cohesion with the films narrative, and I feel the filmmakers could've done a better job with Ellie and Thomas' characters. The rest of the characters, especially Liz, were portrayed properly, especially Fraser's character.Nevertheless, it's a well done film, and an outstanding award winning-worthy performance by Fraser. I know the critics were a little hard on this film, but it's still worthy for a one-time viewing.",

            "review_title": "Subplots Ruin 'The Whale'",
            "content": "It is rare that subplots alone severely impact the quality of a story, but such is the case in The Whale.I'll start by saying that the performances in The Whale are superb (especially Brendan Fraser), as is the direction. The fact that they can make an engaging film set in a single location is awe-inspiring.The main plot focuses on a morbidly obese man named Charlie that is dying (no spoiler yet!). This central plot is well crafted and executed. It would be nice if Charlie explains why he will not seek help (even if it's a lie), but the writer leaves that part up to the audience, which is his prerogative.Then we come to the subplots. Here is where things begin to go downhill.All the subplots in this film involve people coming into Charlie's life, constantly knocking on his unlocked door because he cannot leave his house due to his obesity. In the first scene, Charlie is visited by Thomas, a young man that says he is part of the New Life Church. It is never said what denomination New Life Church is (if any), but Thomas carries a Bible that he quotes. Thomas is a typical Bible-thumper, fanatical and holier than thou. He is judgmental and chastises Charlie for being gay. Being a bigoted, judgmental hypocrite is terrible, no matter what religion a person claims to represent. However, from a story perspective, this is a trope that has been overused. It's lazy writing at this point, with no fresh take. And a white Christian or Catholic male is always the evil hypocrite. Why not have someone affiliated with a different religion represent this character? After all, every religion/cult has them. The answer is simple: it's too risky and not PC.This subplot gets thin when it is revealed that Thomas is a former pothead who stole money from the church and ran away from home. His motivation and backstory suddenly become muddled, as it is unclear why he did anything up to this point. Perhaps it is an ill-fated attempt to show his hypocrisy. Again, lazy writing.Then there is Charlie's daughter, Ellie, one of the most annoying/evil teenagers to be put on film. But, having a heart of gold, Charlie never loses faith in her very well-hidden good nature. I understand she is a hormonal teenager (a bit of clich\u00e9) whom her father abandoned, but Ellie is over the top. She nearly kills Charlie by spiking his food with sleeping pills. Ellie also takes pictures of Thomas smoking pot and secretly records a conversation in which he admits he ran away from his family and old mission in Iowa after stealing all the money from the youth group. Ellie then sends Thomas's confession to his former youth group and family. In a reversal of expectation, his family dismisses the incident and welcomes Thomas home. But it is very unclear why Ellie sent the confession. Was it to out Thomas or to save him? Yes, in the end, Ellie shows a little compassion. But it is too little too late. Her sudden change seems forced.Then there is Liz, the sister of Charlie's deceased partner. This subplot is in a grey area at best. Despite Liz's good intentions, she is not a very good nurse. She gives Charlie junk food and, despite knowing that Charlie is dying from the very beginning of the film, does not call a doctor or get more help. If you know someone is eating themselves to death, wouldn't you feel responsible for getting this person professional help even if they do not want it? Liz and Charlie's interactions are not 'protected' like that of a psychiatrist with a patient or a lawyer with a client.Then there is Dan the Pizza Man. Why is this guy in the film? Just to remind the audience one last time that Charlie is fat and repulsive by giving him a judgmental stare before running away?The best subplot is the ex-wife.",

And in all those films, he always hits you very hard with his emotion in his movies. But in my opinion, none hit more hard then The Whale.

The major problem with it is that it is based on a play, which was obviously one of those modern box-set, small cast affairs. It still has the claustrophobic feel of being shut up and isolated from the outside world. However, that may be a directorial choice to emphasize the central character's dilemma: he is so morbidly obese that his body has become his prison. The ending also has the feel of a stage play where everything is neatly tied up and explained. The theatre is about language; movies are the visuals. But nonetheless, the film is quite moving in many places, thanks primarily to the fine actors. Brendan Fraser as the central character, an obese English professor who teaches an on-line class in effective writing, and Hong Chau as his caregiver have both earned well-deserved Oscar nominations. It's a pity that there could not also be nominations for Samantha Morton as Fraser's bitter ex-wife, Sadie Sink as his bitter estranged daughter, and Ty Simpkins as a sweet religious fanatic, as they are all splendid. The most \"shocking\" scene is right at the beginning of the movie when we see the disgustingly obese Fraser masturbating while watching gay pornography on his laptop. It sounds disgusting, but it quite economically communicates the central issues confronting the lead character, especially when he is caught in the act by a well-meaning fundamentalist missionary. Director Aronofsky is to be congratulated not only for guiding the actors, but for keeping the viewer interested in what happens next. This is no mean feat, given the set-up with very limited options. This is a good movie, worth seeing.",

The entire movie is devastating and holds no punches, the tragic tale addresses one of the only forms of addiction we as a society seem to have deemed unacceptable to accept/understand. Instead, treating it as if it were a disgusting choice made by those who suffer from it. While mental health and substance abuse have become movements we strife to improve upon, food addiction is treated as though the person is simply lazy or stupid. I'm sure most of us, myself included, are guilty of those subconscious thoughts.This isn't a lecture but I ensure you this isn't the case with food addiction. If you believe it is take the time to google leptin resistance, epigenetic role in obesity (ob gene), and the various forms of microbiome development.. This is my request as an obese medical student who finds himself in awkward positions and feeling like a hypocrite in many patient interactions.Beyond the looming subject of food addiction the film further interwinds the treatment of the LGBTQ+ community and how religion participates in the historical treatment of those within the community. The relationships Charlie forms with his friends and family and even random strangers. Such as Dan the pizza man, who is friendly and kind until the day he seems Charlie, at which time all of which changes. Or his students, who upon a face reveal instead of being kind or even normal, appear disgusted or as if they want to snicker at his appearance.There is likely a great deal of symbolism I am missing in the film.

            "review_title": "High in tastelessness, low in gravitas",
            "content": "The Whale (2022) - Darren Aronofsky: A ReviewThere was a time when Aronofsky looked to be one of the most promising directors in American cinema. His pulsating black-and-white low-budget \"Pi\" was remarkable in its intensity, pacing and chaotic energy. Then came the modern classic \"Requiem for a Dream\" in which Aronofsky somehow injected even more chaos and drama, this time coupled with stellar performances by Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burnstyn, alongside a hypnotic, pulverising soundtrack and a general atmosphere of unrelenting anguish to unsettle the nerves of the most sanguine viewer. Since then the director has mostly floundered; yes, there have been bright sparks from time-to-time: \"The Wrestler\" was a worthy character study of a flawed individual, brought to life wonderfully by Mickey Rourke, while \"Black Swan\" provided a similar canvass for Natalie Portman to give what is quite possibly a career-best performance but at no point has the director fully capitalised on the genius that seemed inherent within his film-making almost a quarter of a century ago now.Ironically, as the director has grown older, his films seem to have become more adolescent. In 2017 we got the utterly ridiculous \"Mother!\" and now, finally moving onto the subject of this review, we are presented with the only slightly less ridiculous \"The Whale\": a film about a morbidly obese man who is on the point of a fatal heart attack. Based on the play by Samuel D Hunter, this film almost certainly has nothing to say, but that doesn't stop it from indulgently pontificating on religion, sexuality, grief and the importance of family. Allow me to observe here that when a dramatist has no particular insight on any topic, it is a common trick for him to distract the viewer from noticing this by spreading his themes as widely as possible. One should be under no illusion that any profundity is occurring in this film and there are a number of clues to suggest this.Firstly, none of the characters' motivations are properly thought out. We have a central character, Charlie (played by Brendan Fraser), who is homosexual (the importance of this will become apparent later) and apparently suicidal . He has developed a co-dependent friendship with the fiercely protective Liz (Hong Chau). Liz is depicted as finding value in the dependence that Charlie has on her, so much so that she attempts to prevent her friend from reconnecting with his daughter lest her role in his life be usurped. Yet, so desperate is she to maintain his friendship that she continues to feed him fried chicken and brings him highly-unhealthy snacks, all the while being acutely aware of how close this food is to killing him. It is worth noting here that Liz is also a nurse, something which might lead one to believe that her instinct would be to avoid perpetuating life-shortening habits vis-a-vis her closest friends.Then there is Charlie's daughter, Ellie, from whom he has been estranged for almost a decade. He calls her after he realises the perilousness of his health and she comes to visit him immediately. She is standoffish and hostile but it is made clear to her that there will be a financial and possibly an educational advantage in associating with him. At times it seems as if she is motivated purely by self-interest, at other times she appears driven by motiveless malignity and then, less plausibly perhaps, she appears to be doing acts of great kindness in a roundabout and easily misinterpreted fashion. By the end of the film, all three of these interpretations could easily be true and it comes across as if neither the writer nor the director decided what Ellie's motivations actually were. You could call this artistic ambiguity, I call it a lack of interest in character development. After all, if a character is not particularly defined in any substantial way then they can behave as the writer wishes them to in order to serve the preconceived plot. The character of Ellie does this as does the character of Liz as does, most importantly, the character of Charlie himself.Taking a closer look at Charlie we see a kind, gentle almost childlike individual. He is suffering from grief, hence his extreme comfort eating, but, as an English teacher by profession, he is still capable of being moved by beautiful, honest writing. This in and of itself appears to possess the whiff of something fay but I shall just about allow it to pass. The main issue with Charlie's characterisation is that he is far too kind, gentle and caring to ever be capable of the emotional and physical abandonment of which his character is purportedly responsible. All of the invective and hostility that Charlie receives at the hands of his estranged family in the film is utterly justified by Charlie's past actions and yet Fraser's angelic performance provides not even a scintilla of evidence of the callousness he has previously been responsible for. At one point in the film, his ex-wife says that she is aware that Charlie was only using her to have a child. The audience is unsure whether to interpret this as bitterness or honesty and, once again, I don't think either the writer or director cared to decide themselves in which category the comment belonged. However, its truth would make perfect sense since Charlie is very clearly represented as being gay in the film, right from the very first scene in fact. Yet how could such a kind, genuine man who is so powerfully moved by honesty be capable of such cynical deception? It does not fit with the character that is being projected in any conceivable way.Focusing on the character of Charlie takes me back to my observations regarding the adolescent nature of Aronofsky's more recent cinematic fare. Too much of this film includes \"fat jokes\", including the film's title itself. Oh, of course, this can easily be denied: it's a reference to \"Moby Dick\", it's a reference to the Biblical story of Noah (there's another Aronofsky association by the way). It is also, naturally, a reference to the protagonist's size. There is also too much prurient fascination with the physical degradation associated with being morbidly obese. Virtually nothing is left to the audience's imagination in terms of Charlie's impaired physicality. This doesn't stop with his outward appearance but continues to the unfortunate condition of the protagonist's heart, something which is monitored and tracked in anxiety-inducing detail throughout the film.The film is, quite simply, in poor taste and severely lacking in artistic merit in terms of its writing, its exposition of its themes and its characterisation; however, it would be extremely disingenuous of me to claim that I found no merit in the film at all. The acting is impeccable throughout. Give Aronofsky his due, like Stanley Kubrick, he excels in eliciting powerful, tortured performances from his cast. Fraser has rightly received many plaudits for his performance, the humanity he is able to exude is heart-warming and, at times, deeply moving but he is also ably supported by Sadie Sink, Ty Simpkins, Samantha Morton and, especially, Hong Chau as his erstwhile yet viperishly domineering side-kick. Bearing in mind that the characterisations are so poorly thought out, it is even more impressive that the actors are able to deliver such impressive work. They succeed by playing scenes as much as by playing characters, the actors being malleable and flexible enough to fully deliver to the scenes' requirements without ever appearing false in their performances.The soundtrack is also beautiful and hauntingly atmospheric. If there is so much that is tasteless in the writing and presentation of the film, the music is the exact opposite. Rob Simonsen's tones elevate the film and provide it with an otherwise unearned dignity and grace. And then there are the visual flourishes of which Aronofsky is always immensely capable. The film's use of light in key scenes and the way in which Aronofsky is able to visually invigorate what is essentially a one-set film is commendable and adds value to the experience.Due to the power of individual scenes, you may well leave this film quite moved by what you've watched but, if you are critical by nature and you are inclined to do the maths, you will be hard-pressed not to realise that this film does not add up. Like a number of Aronofsky's recent efforts, it's a film whose main goal is to grab you by the jugular and, in its insistence on achieving this, it is far more trivial than it had any need to be.",

And by the end, you feel a lot of emotions barging in without your permission as you realize the virtues of companionship and fatherhood. It made my eyes wet.(Watched at the International Film Festival of Kerala in Trivandrum.)",

            "content": "The Whale is one of those rare gems where you literally forget about your surroundings and completely invest in the emotionally draining story, the fabulous direction and the Oscar-worthy performances each unfolding on screen. If you're familiar with director Darren Aronofsky's previous melodramatic, surreal or psychological projects, it shouldn't come as a surprise that this one is worth a nomination due to its intense emotional power.The entire film, other than a couple of scenes, is set mainly in one room in the apartment of a morbidly obese English teacher, and the film covers a week in which he attempts to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter while he suffers from obesity. The Whale isn't at all the case of leaving you messed up for some time after you watch them, which how Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream and Mother! Work. But it still proves he has the talent for executing raw concepts you get sucked into very quickly.On the other hand, Brendan Fraser's role in this movie is a completely seperate talent. He truly gives the performance of a lifetime as he plays Charlie, the main character suffering from morbid obesity who takes the spotlight in this movie. Seriously, no words can describe his (no pun intended) incredibly heavy and hard-moving acting skills he gets the opportunity to show us. The Whale is a very entertaining and marvellously directed, yet just above only an average and decently-written experience. But the stars shoot right up because of Brendan Fraser. Being able to portray frustration and obvious care with Charlie, Stranger Things' actress Sadie Sink and every other supporting role deserves major acclaim as well.Plenty of films today rely on convincing performances to engage us in a story that's completely uninteresting, boring and unoriginal, and they still turn out to be rubbish movies with good casting. But Brendan Fraser makes this movie entertaining, he makes you empathise with his character and he overall just makes you forget you're watching a screenplay roll out. This film feels like real life and you actually feel like there's an entire life's story that stretches beyond the movie. Another element this film relies on is its soundtrack, which critics are claiming it's used unnecessarily and displays a lack of trust in the actors, but the soundtrack is honestly beautiful and increases the emotions of many scenes, especially the unusually bittersweet ending.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

Who knows?Anyway, I'm eager to see more new movies with him on the screen. It can be drama if it has to but..",

It's HIGHLY likely to produce an Oscar and deservedly so.The film is sad, sweet, tragic and thought-provoking, and the screenplay provides enough twists in the plot to keep one engaged throughout.But let's not be delusional, this is Brendan's film, as he holds the spotlight from beginning to end - his performance is moving and unforgettable, and so OW* that NOT awarding him the Statuette would be one of the all-time worst Oscar-snubs by the Academy.The only reason I even mention this is the recent history of such snubs over the past two years (Ben Affleck/Tender Bar, and Ralph Fiennes/The Dig). Brendan's nomination brings some comfort that the sensibility of voters has returned this year after a two-year Covid-fever lapse in judgement of not even nominating the aforementioned Actors and films (sorry, I just wanted to take one more shot at the Academy on those two mega-snubs \ud83d\ude09).If you haven't seen the film, that is understandable as it has only recently became available for non-theatre viewing, and at the purchase price of $20 on Amazon Prime (even the wily Russian film-hacking sites don't yet have a copy...thankfully).

The script is pretty decent, but not every line is perfect or great.The other technical aspects all work together in a powerful way, but I wasn't crazy about the way the movie ended, personally.

            "content": "Oh my god. I came very close to crying and I don't easily do that. Brendan Frasier's character and performance deeply moved me and gave me a lot of perspective. He represents the frustration, despair, and loneliness that the vast majority of us experienced during the pandemic. The Whale is the story of a gay man who loses his lover, falls into depression, engorges himself with fast food upon fast food, blows up like a weather balloon and refuses medical attention because he would much prefer the sweet deliverance of a heart attack. But before he departs from Earth, he attempts to repair his relationship with his estranged daughter and to see if he has done one good thing in his life. It's a powerful tale that nobody is beyond redemption. If Brendan Frasier doesn't win an Oscar, I will be VERY upset. Also, I would like to address the woke mob criticizing the fact that a non-obese actor is playing an obese character and saying, \"Don't even TRY to put yourself in their shoes because you could NEVER know!\" First of all, the main point of acting is NOT being yourself for a few minutes, to gain perspective and experience. Second of all, should only obese actors play obese characters? Because a lot of them would not be comfortable doing that. Third of all, casting should be based on merit as much as accuracy. The best possible actor should be chosen for the role and Brendan Frasier has proven himself in this case, which is why The Whale merits a 10/10.P. S. This film was surprisingly tame by Darren Aronofsky's standards. I was expecting at least three nightmarish scenes based on his previous films like Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan.",

            "content": "As an avid A24 fan I knew I would see this film, yet I hesitated, turned-off by a film about a fat person played by an actor in a fat suit. Ultimately the acting is what carries this film- Brendan has incredible access to his emotions and portrays Charlie beautifully. Sadie and Hong are also wonderful. If you are a Brendan fanatic excited for his return to film, you won't be disappointed, although I caution that a lot of the hype around this film stems from that excitement and overlooks the slow pace, distractingly blunt cuts, and stilted delivery of supporting actors toward the end of the film.I read the play first out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised to find it isn't a mockery of fat folk; all the characters are complex and interesting, and there are many full circle things that come around satisfyingly in the end. I was interested to see the adaptation, and was disappointed to sit through a slow-moving film that changed and added things to a less satisfying, at times detrimental effect. Less satisfying was the altering of Alan's story, removing some emotional beats in the play that I was looking forward to seeing on screen. In the play, Alan, Charlie's deceased boyfriend, is raised religious, and goes on a mission abroad to avoid going home and getting married. When he does go home he ends up falling in love with Charlie and completely abandoning the church. There is a point about the last day Alan goes to church, he hears his father give a sermon that breaks him. After this he becomes so depressed he starves himself to death. Then, after his death, Charlie eats himself to death. We finally find out what Alan's father said in the sermon: the story of Jonah and the Whale. In the film this is altered: no Jonah sermon, but Alan's Bible has a verse about living in the flesh marked off; I supposed it was altered so as not to be so \"on the nose\", given the 'Moby Dick' essay which Charlie reads again and again throughout the play/film, which we ultimately find out his daughter wrote, but in a story laden with metaphor, I didn't think this second allusion was too much. To the film's detriment: the small age difference between Charlie and Alan in the play wasn't specified, making Charlie look like a groomer who seduced a student (a damaging trope in stories with queer characters), and, more egregiously, an added scene that was not in the play featuring Charlie being seen by the pizza delivery guy, which triggers shame and then a massive binge the night before his death. There is no reason to include this in the film. At this point we have already seen Charlie vulnerable and hurting, we've seen his shame, we as an audience already feel compassion for him- this added scene felt intended to disturb the audience and remind them of those stereotypes- \"if you're that size you must be doing something wrong, you are out of control, and you should be ashamed\". The play did not have this scene, and the film didn't need it.",

The other characters are there to give him guidelines that he isn't the only person in that play, but... Rob Simonsen's score is brilliantly attached to the story and the sound of the rainy days gives us even stronger compassion toward Charlie, played by Brendan Fraser, who is unforgettable in that role, and should be awarded.

The film is an emotional roller coaster as Fraser's character Charlie resolves at all times to be understanding and accepting of the deficiencies of his daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink), caregiver Liz (Hong Chau), and ex-wife Mary (Samantha Morton). They can scream and curse him all day long and he sees only the good in them. It gets a little frustrating at times because you would think he'd strike back. This is not a comfortable movie to watch given Charlie's agony just breathing, with no attempt to seek medical help for his condition, as if serving penance for the life he led and the family he abandoned to pursue a gay relationship. I'm not sure what to make of Ellie's decision to send pictures and recordings of self described missionary Tom (Ty Simpkins) to his parents and former New Life congregation. It felt cruel and punitive, and yet was met with acceptance and love by the young man who needed to reconnect with his family back home. Excellent performances all around, and I'll go out on a limb here to predict Brendan Fraser will come home with a Best Actor Oscar this film cycle. The irony is that the picture itself wasn't included in the running for Best Picture, since in my estimation, it surpasses at least two of the contenders I've seen which I feel don't have quite what it takes to make the cut.

            "content": "\"The Whale\" was probably my most anticipated movie of the end of the year. I've been waiting for it ever since it was first announced. But I can't say that it lived up to the hype.Most of \"The Whale\" was great. It depicts a story of Charlie, a morbidly obese man played by Brandon Fraser, who is reaching his end of life and try to make reconciliation with his daughter. I thought it was a brave depiction of a morbidly obese character (though there is original story for this). I didn't find it fatphobic like some critics did as I thought it was a realistic and candid depiction of what it's like to live in a larger body. Brandon Fraser, Sadie Sink (personal bias from Stranger Things) and Hong Chau all pulled their weight with especially Fraser being the constant throughout the movie. I hope that Sink gets more role in the future that goes beyond an angsty teenager because there was frankly lots of overlap between Ellie and Max from Stranger Things. It was also good to see familiar faces of Samantha Morton (from Walking Dead, Alpha) and Ty Simpkins (insidious and MCU).Although the performances were great, some of the lines were a little trite and broke my immersion in the movie. They were often shouted at to the audience what they were trying to say and there was lack of subtlety. As the movie got to the ending, it tried so hard to squeeze out the emotions from the audience and I was close to buying it. But in the end, I was confused by what the story was trying to tell you. Charlie himself tells you multiple times to be honest but he himself was not honest to Liz about the money. And if he was ever fully honest to himself, he may have tried to get help about the way he handled grief, which was overeating. It could be that he is a complex character who didn't practice his preach but it didn't feel that way during the movie. Perhaps he needed a little less optimism to take a frank hard look at himself. I did like the way the story tried to handle grief, remorse, guilt and self-loathing that come in many different forms. The religious bit was also very relatable and I found it almost comical to some extent. To me, it's always touching to see broken people performed well on screen.\"A pot of complex emotions like guilt, remorse, and grief. But the pot was forced down too fast\"",

He's been doing it so long that he's morbidly obese and knocking on death's door by the time we see him. His nurse and only friend urges him to go to hospital because he is suffering from congestive heart failure. He refuses.It's all in the eyes. His eyes are wide, shocked, needy, desperate, ashamed, and above all, gentle. To see Charlie is to pity him at first, but after we hear his eloquence and pain, we empathise. We want to help, but as the characters in \"The Whale\" discover, he won't help himself. He is a lost cause.Perhaps a new lease on life is waggled in front of his face like a carrot when his estranged teenage daughter comes to visit him. Charlie treasures an essay his daughter wrote about \"Moby Dick\". He wants his daughter to embrace her writing talent (though if she has any remains unclear), perhaps to enhance her life, despite Charlie having given up on his.His daughter, however, has apparently been scarred by Charlie's perceived abandonment of her and her mother, and remains cruel and abusive to him, and even to Thomas, a Mormon-like missionary who knocked on Charlie's door, and keeps coming back.Brendan Fraser's performance - and long-awaited comeback - is what will draw audiences to see \"The Whale\". They will not be disappointed. It has to be a career best from Fraser, who I now realise I had never really taken seriously as an actor before. I'm not surprised he has been nominated for an Oscar, he deserves one.What I'm less sure about are the other characters. Ellie, Charlie's daughter, doesn't seem to have any arc as a character, and nor does Thomas, the missionary. The character of the nurse provides some exposition, but what do the other two do? I was particularly confused by Thomas. I'm not sure what his character really wanted, and there is a revelation about him toward the end that I didn't really understand.Ellie is so one-note that she becomes repugnant and annoying. I guess she contrasts with Charlie's vulnerability. He's a sitting target, and she's someone who uses words like weapons.Brendan Fraser keeps you interested in \"The Whale\". And despite the requisite controversy with idiots saying that the movie invites you gawk and mock him as Charlie, his performance is just too good to be a parody of anything.With all the other characters, though, the movie gets a lot less interesting, and it made it difficult to focus on.",

Then one day out of the blue, Charlie us visited by Ellie, his estranged daughter who is now a HS senior...Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Darren Aronofsky (Requiem For a Dream\", \"The Wrestler\"). Here he brings the theater play of the same name by Samuel Hunter to the big screen. The movie doesn't betray its theater roots and in fact the entire film plays out in Charlie's apartment. There are a lot of heavy duty discussions in this film, a sizeable portion on religion, of all things. The cast is outstanding, including Hong Chau (as Liz) and. Sadie Sink (as Ellie). But the film will be mostly remembered for the towering performance by Brandon Fraser as the obese Charlie. I read that it took 4 hours each day to get the prosthetics arranged. Of course none of this would've mattered if it weren't for the high quality script by Samuel Hunter (who also wrote the stage play). In all, I didn't know how I would react to this film, obvious Oscar-baiting material. Turns out this is solid film starring a staggering performance by Fraser. Mark my words: for sure he will get a Best Actor Oscar nod and he is probably a strong favorite to win it. Hollywood just loves a good comeback story like this one,\"The Whale\" premiered at Venice film festival in September yo immediate critical acclaim. It opened in US theaters some 2-3 weeks ago.

I really want my money and time back, watched it in theatre. Three times I wanted to get up and leave but I was curious to see how it ends. Well the ending was disappointing and pointless just like I expected. This movie is supposed to be about a dying man who is very sick because of obesity complications, trying to reconnect with his daughter, trying to right his wrongs.Too little too late my friend. You literally wait till the end of your life to do what's right? I can't decide which character in this movie is the most toxic. Is it Charlie? He refuses to seek help for his problems or go to the hospital, choosing death over life. It's obvious that Charlie has complex psychiatric issues, including an eating disorder, severe depression, suicidal tendencies and more. Also did he leave his family to be with his boyfriend, like wtf? Super toxic. Liz, his friend/nurse instead of trying to help him change his life and habits just brings him more food to continue the deadly cycle, just put him in a hospital, he obviously won't do it himself, he wants to die and Liz helps him with that.Charlie keeps calling his daughter an amazing person etc while Ellie is an absolutely toxic person who has only bad things to say about him and any other person she meets. She literally takes pictures, records conversations and humiliates people. The way she talks to her father is disgusting, telling him that she doesn't care if he dies or not and that she cares more about her high school exams, money or whatever else, wtf is wrong with her. She is 17, this is unacceptable behavior. My father wasn't around while I was growing up but I would never talk to him like this.Thomas is a pointless character, his actions made no sense. He existed only as an excuse for the writers to make fun and humiliate people who have faith in God. The whole movie tries really hard and attacks the idea of God and faith in general, every chance they get. The methods they used to do that were absolutely pathetic and felt forced. At some point it got really annoying. The only character that wasn't extremely annoying was Ellie's mother. Many think it's a fatphobic movie. I don't know if i agree with that but I know for sure that this movie makes obese people look very very bad.I don't know what to say about this movie. The writing is awful and sends all the wrong messages. Tries to be deep but isn't. The only good thing has to be Brendan Fraser's performance and that's the only reason I will not give it 1/10 rating. My rating is 2/10. Skip this movie, it's painful.",

It is not filmed the same, rather, it's very claustrophobic. This man is in a prison of his own making. The exploration of grief is deeply compelling, including things like the way it can lead to the forming of unusual bonds, the push-pull of sometimes being in denial, at other times, confronting head-on that the person you lost is never coming back.As a Darren Aronofsky film, it is of course full of misery, and deeply unsubtle. It also frames the lead as an object of shock, which is an issue for a story that is seeking to inspire empathy. He may not have been the right director for this, though he does still do a great job. The movie gets across how tedious and hopeless his life is without being boring to watch.This features very brief sexuality, a little drug content, and a lot of strong language(some of it very homophobic, used to illustrate, not endorse). I recommend this to every fan of those involved in making it. 8/10.",

I then heard the morning DJ give it an amazing review and being the follower that I am I decided to watch it, and I'm so glad I did. Although this is not an action movie or suspensful in any way, this movie manages to capture your attention by the acting alone. No matter what gripes or discriminations you may have about this movie: that he's gay, that he's fat, that he abandoned his daughter, yes, he's as imperfect as they come and his benignness may be as false as we may want to believe it is, yet the protagonist portrays the emptiness that many of us feel, that no matter how much we feed that emptiness, be it by food, sex, drinking, smoking or whatever we use to feed that emptiness, many of us just can't fill it. Many of us just keep going to a point of destruction, to a point where nothing fits anymore, and just like the protagonist we purge it all out at some point. Brendan Frasier and Darren Aronofsky truly do what only a few actors and directors can manage to do in our world of short attention spans and tictoc. They manage to make us look, they manage to hold our attention long enough to care about the pain at least one of the actors carry. No matter who you're looking at, all these characters carry pain, and some don't want to care because caring means holding on to more pain. Brendan Frasier was truly amazing in this role and so were all the supporting actors and actresses. I do recommend this movie at least to see if you can recognize your own whale.",

I was moved from the start. Here's Charlie- he's trapped, sad, sick and lonely. Who hasn't felt this way? I didn't feel like I was watching Charlie, I felt like I was right there with him. Yes, he's dying from morbid obesity but underneath his physical deterioration is a soul starving of love without condition. Those character traits were expressed very well visually through the acting and direction.Wasn't a 10 for me because I didn't love the ending. The culmination of hopeful emotion and possible restoration of Charlie & his daughter weren't represented as well as it could have, with the use of a quick metaphorical flash of ...wait, what? It just took me out of the movie and I felt dissatisfied. I wanted to see more change from his daughter to trust all the good Charlie sees in her. Charlie reached his own version of heaven but maybe there was a better way to show it rather than his feet suddenly lifting off the ground.I also just disagreed with the actions of the character, Liz. The actress herself, Chau, was a believable nurse and her anger and pain seethed through the screen. But her relentless meanness to Thomas, who probably showed the most love to Charlie, was inexcusable. She had the right to disagree with Thomas' worldview but it doesn't justify her incessant rudeness toward the kid, who is more than just his religion. It is plain to see in this movie that we don't have to act hateful to people who have opposing views as us. Thomas didn't agree with Liz, but he didn't act spiteful towards her. Even Charlie's own daughter, who is atheistic herself, showed love to him (in the most unconventional way). We're all human and want real love more than anything in life. I think this type of thinking was shown when Charlie, at his breaking point, asked his students to write something real for once to reveal to them that, \"Just cause I look like a whale, I'm really not that different from you. You're hurting on the inside too, just like me.\" Maybe this attitude in life can make the difference in finding real unity despite our differences. I love the discussions that can come out from this movie. This is one of those movies I would watch over and over again, for different reasons each time :)",

            "content": "This film is an adaptation of a play, so there were bound to be some restraints on the breadth of its spectacle. It becomes immediately apparent that this film was made as a stage adaptation, not a cinematic reimagining. That's fine and all, there are definitely a solid share of movies that have very narrow parameters in terms of the set and cast, but that it still felt like a stage production greatly diminished what of its effect it could have accomplished. Theatre, for the most part, is intended as a means of visually telling a character story. It counters the spectacle of the world-at-large by instead studying the spectacle of character. What we have in much of cinema today is a continuation of that ideal, but the feat of cinema is that anything that people can see or imagine be filmed or animated - it is a widening of the horizon of theatrical storytelling from a singular frame to seeing as far as the mind can take you, in real-time. It's why filmmakers, including Aronofsky, are so revered as magicians who can create a medium that embodies the imagination. Visual storytellers who combine set and acting and music and sounds to create a tangible embodiment of the story they want to tell. It's as close as we can get right now to experiencing a story other than actually living it. So when it feels like I'm watching something that takes a step back and operates more in the vein of theatre, it feels hollow.That's not to say that I haven't been moved by theatrical productions in the past, the element of watching real actors on a stage in the same room as you adds a lot to the overall effect. The Whale does not have that. In fact, I'd say it feels overly caught up in that it is an adaptation of a stage production, and while it wants to create an experience with being a film that Aronofsky is talented at making, it ultimately loses itself somewhere in the middle.Now, I'm someone who is extremely generous when it comes to viewing art. Contrivance is generally the main element that bothers me when it comes to how critical I want to be when watching a piece of cinema or listening to music, etc. The more authentic something is, the harder it is for me to actively notice a piece art being contrived, both in the nature of authenticity but also the level of immersion achieved by the piece. Pi, for example, was very immersive because it was very authentic in its telling of its story. The same could be said of Black Swan and The Wrestler. As far as authentic cinematic storytelling goes, it's hard to find those films overly contrived, or lose the feeling of immersion because they feel inauthentic. Noah, on the other hand, feels a lot more like Hollywood shenanigans and like someone who was given a budget that they weren't used to trying to make as big a spectacle as possible. Big budget films don't have to be overly spectacular, they often are, but when they are, they often fail at being authentic. So, Aronofsky has shown that he can make something that isn't the most authentic filmmaking, and in The Whale, I'd be remiss if I didn't admit that a lot of the movie felt contrived; kept me from feeling appropriately immersed, especially for a film that is supposed to be an adaptation of a stage production, which, again, is a study of the spectacle of character.To be contrived here really diminishes the overall quality of the film. The material the film is based on is moving, but not particularly so that it deserves to be adapted to film. Which is fine, that becomes the responsibility of those involved in the creation of the film, but especially the director's and the actors' responsibility. For the most part, the acting was fine. The side characters felt believable, but, and quite unfortunately, when one performance shines through as exceptional, it really puts a burden on the other performers to keep up, which was not possible. Brendan Fraser became the other actors' white whale while they were trying to create characters that neither had enough life to them to begin with (thanks in part to some lackluster dialog and general characterization), nor had the panache to warrant space next to the main character. It was a story about his relationship with himself and with the other characters, not about their relationships with him, and the performance Brendan Fraser gave was one that didn't even afford the other actors the room to develop and perform their roles well enough to even be compared to his. Of course, comparing a single apple with a cart of cabbages - able to be made into months' worth of food - is futile, but the apple is still an adequate and enjoyable portion of food. Likewise, Brendan Fraser's performance really exists like a cart of cabbage in that there's a lot of it kind of stinks (not the performance but the character, and I'd imagine Brendan Fraser after getting out of the body suit every day).Charlie is kind of a rotten character - not of his own accord, necessarily, but definitely his lack of self-love makes it harder to empathize with him trying to love someone else. It's certainly relatable, but is very frustrating, and makes for a difficult time watching his arc transpire. That's fine, that doesn't necessarily diminish the quality of the film, but it just made it less enjoyable to watch at moments. Truly, Brendan Fraser's ability to bring this character to life is remarkable. Performance of the decade so far, and I really can't wait to se him explore these more authentic, human characters who give him room to shine and who he can paint in his own light.So, unfortunately, the sum of its parts is greater than the whole. I watched this movie to see Brendan Fraser's performance and to watch the new Aronofsky film. Brendan Fraser absolutely delivered, but it wasn't enough to make this film stand on its own merit. Aronofsky didn't exactly fall short, but he didn't exactly score what should have been a pretty easy home run either and ended up stuck in that middle ground of being more or less fine. If this movie cast someone else as Charlie and they gave a performance on par with the rest of the cast, I'd have given it around a 5, but it wasn't. Brendan Fraser absolutely killed it, so the visceral enjoyment of his performance absolutely elevated it quite a few steps. 6.5/10.",

            "content": "It's hard not to walk into this film with a certain bias. Film snobs will often garner the accusation \"You went in wanting to hate it\", while here, we might start hearing the phrase \"You went in wanting to love it\".Indeed, there's been some preemptive celebration of The Whale, not the least of which concerns Brendan Fraser in his first major role in many years. People argue that the press and buzz around the film seem condescending, intermittently treating Fraser like a wounded animal, acting like he hasn't found work whatsoever since his Mummy heyday (he's been a regular on Doom Patrol for years), and continually bringing up all the difficult stuff he's been through since his career height when he'd probably rather just move on and begin anew. (There's also the issue of how his character in The Whale is framed, but we'll get to that.)However, the standing ovation directed at The Whale and then Fraser himself at Vancouver Film Festival was unmistakeable. This isn't about nostalgic fanboyism and coddling; it's a celebration of great cinema and a great actor, known for his 90s crowd-pleasers, making a triumphant comeback by showing his full range in a more serious, artful, frankly devastating work -- if also a bit cheesy at parts. And who else to achieve this than Darren Aronofsky?A critic I follow avidly put it best when he called Aronofsky the most \"expressive\" director working today. When you've seen one of his films, you're going to distinctly remember sounds, images, line deliveries, and bits of music from within it. That said, his tale of the obese, self-loathing English teacher Charlie (Fraser), his laboriously supportive home nurse (Hong Chau), and his estranged daughter (Sadie Sink) has still been a bit disappointing to some.Depressing? You betcha. More than most Aronofsky pictures, in fact. But for a lot of viewers, it fails to \"strike\" the way other Aronofsky films do -- save for the ending, which is indeed a dreamlike experience (with a blinding light that seems right out of The Fountain). It doesn't help that the visual style is dim and drab, even if this arguably accentuates the claustrophobic feel.There's also some controversy, or at the very least some irate discourse, surrounding this character and the stuff we see him do. Critics wonder: Is this a sad tale meant to tug at our heartstrings, or a freakshow display where we're meant to walk away feeling happy that, no matter how bad our lives have gotten, we're not this guy?Indeed, just what does this movie say about Charlie (and, by alleged extension, fat people)? My personal answer is a question: Does it need to be saying anything at all? Could it simply be telling the story of this man's life, and then the rest is in the eye of the beholder? For me, this was more an exploration of a mindset that I'm all too familiar with; a sort of self-hatred and addiction where you're not really addicted to the vices themselves, but to the destruction and misery they bring and the identity that's formed around it.This is Charlie's story, not all fat people's story. I give you that there's a lot of misinformation about fat people; that the problems they face aren't strictly a result of self-destructive behavior. I give you that it's fatphobic to go \"that's your problem\" when fat people can't wear and use certain things. I give you that clothes, chairs, cars, entrances, et al. Are \"skinny-normative\" or whatever and that there's more we can do. I don't think I draw the line at an unreasonable place. When a person is too heavy to walk, that's gravity, not society -- and when they choose not to do anything about it, that is, again, the story of Charlie.I'm also with you that being fat doesn't mean you binge-eat/over-eat and over-eating doesn't mean you're fat (Lord knows my diet should've done SOMETHING to me by now if that were true). Is that what the film is saying? Not any more than it's saying being fat makes you look at porn and neglect your children for a cute boy. I will agree that it might've been \"braver\" of the film to cast an actual obese man instead of going the Norbit route, which surely would've made it feel like less of a joke at fat men's expense to people. Still, we might've then had to endure some sort of \"Why did you fire Brendan Fraser\" outrage.People are going to have their Hot Takes, no matter what -- contrarianism will always be \"cool\" and it's especially fun to do with films that tick just the right number of boxes to net the labels \"Oscar Bait\", \"melodrama\", \"exploitation\", \"offensive\", et cetera. So let's have the Hot Take-makers have their Takes amongst themselves so that those of us who simply like it when films are well-made can enjoy this well-made movie.",

His inability to move on, and his own self destruction through grief-fuelled addiction, is a powerful and important work of art. How many of us have been broken-hearted at the inability of those we love to see themselves as we see them, in all their beauty? How many of us have lost and idealized those we love, and then have lost ourselves to grief and addiction? This was a film which needed to be made, and needs to be seen.

A third great film that was difficult to view was \"My Left Foot\", which featured a character played by Daniel Day-Lewis (who won the Oscar for that role that year).The film is also emotionally depressing in several sections, and the gorging scenes are so horrifying, they make the average horror movie look like a cartoon in comparison. If you ever needed a movie to help you go on a healthier diet, then this film is for you. The other Academy Award (in addition to the LOCK that is Brandon Fraser's Actor in a Leading Role Oscar) this film should win hands down is Makeup; I cannot imagine a film (other than Avatar) that has a chance in this category.

Hunter did churn out a script that had a very nice storyline, and it was definitely a very nicely character-driven storyline. I have to say that I enjoyed this movie, not only for its storyline, but most certainly also because of some powerful performances by the cast.The issues that the movie deals with fall within the drama aspect for sure, and there is actually several layers to the storyline. And as such, then I think that director Darren Aronofsky does manage to reach out to a wider audience with this movie. And \"The Whale\" is definitely a movie that you should take the time to sit down and watch if you enjoy a properly written drama, since it has aspects that we can relate to quite easily I think.What really works for \"The Whale\" is an astonishing performance by lead actor Brendan Fraser in some seriously heavy, no pun intended, prosthetic make-up to make him morbidly obese. It looks realistic and his performance really is one that hits home hard and sinks in. I was also impressed with the performance of Hong Chau, playing Liz. I wasn't familiar with her prior to this movie, but she really shines on the screen in this movie from director Darren Aronofsky.\"The Whale\" is a movie with a relative small cast ensemble, but they have good actors and actresses on the cast list, so it serves the movie quite well.Visually then I was really impressed with what they did here with this movie. The body prosthetics really looked realistic, and it made it look and feel like the Charlie character was actually that size and his struggles seemed realistic as well. If this had been less than adequate, then the movie wouldn't have worked out quite as well.I was genuinely entertained by \"The Whale\", and it is definitely a movie that I warmly recommend you to take 117 minutes to sit down and watch, because it is quite worth it. \"The Whale\" is a very heartfelt and lingering movie that will stick with you for some time. However, I doubt that I will ever return to watch it a second time, as it just doesn't really seem to be able to support more than a single viewing.My rating of \"The Whale\" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",

            "content": "Give Brendan Fraser the Oscar already.Hollywood loves a comeback story and the return of Fraser to the Hollywood \"A\" list is complete with his heart-wrenching, honest turn in Darren Aronofsky's THE WHALE. It is the type of comeback that is deserving of all the accolades and awards that has come his way.Directed, with restraint not normally associated with Aronofsky, THE WHALE tells the tale of a College Professor who drowns his feelings in food. The film, based on the play (and screenplay) by Samuel D. Hunter follows this Professor, Charlie (Brendan Fraser of THE MUMMY fame) as he seeks to make amends with his estranged daughter as his obesity starts to take it's toll.Since this is based on a stage play, most of the film takes place inside Charlie's apartment and the number of characters in this film are limited - and all of them hit their mark very well, thanks to the Best Direction that Aronofsky has ever achieved. He limits his usual histrionics, letting the camera focus on the faces and emotions of his characters, keeping movement to a minimum and engrossing the audience in the punch that these emotions provide. It is a shame that he was not Nominated for an Oscar for his work here, it is masterful.Because of this - and the powerful script by Hunter - the cast of this film shines brightly. From Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) to Ty Simpkins (JURASSIC WORLD) to Sadie Sink (Max Mayfield in Netflix' STRANGER THINGS), Aronofsky draws strong, raw and HONEST performances that elevate as each interact with each other.Hong Chau (giving her 2nd straight strong performance following her work in the under-rated and under-appreciated THE MENU) is also Oscar Nominated (for Supporting Actress) for her work as Charlie's caregiver. It is a subtle, loving, emotional performance that touches the heart and her Oscar nomination is well deserved.But, make no mistake about it, this film is Fraser's and he commands it from start to finish. Sure, the \"fat suit\" he is wearing that gives him the appearance of a 400 lb (+) obese man is jarring, but it is the raw emotions - rage, fear, sadness, hate, self-loathing and love - that Fraser is able to eminate through that wall of prosthetics that is truly astonishing. It is the performance of a career and one that will win him the Oscar.Welcome back, Brendan Fraser, the movies missed you.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

            "content": "The eponymous whale played by a brilliant Brendan Fraser is a curiously frustrating film. I'm by no means unemotional when it comes to watching films. I've cried buckets at loads of films recently, from Mrs Harris goes to Paris (yes, honest), to Till (no surprise there) and back to The Last Bus. But I cry when I'm moved. I cry when I'm angry. I cry when I'm happy. I don't cry when I feel I've been manipulated to cry. I found The Whale surprisingly unemotional. With this being Darron Aromovsky I expected the film to earn its wow factor. There was no wow factor. All a bit too much in your face - \"you should cry now!\". Didn't work for me. I like to feel emotional on my own terms.I'm its defence, we know the main character is obese. And when we first see him naked coming out of the shower, I thought to myself - oh so obvious - his meat and two veg are hidden by his ubiquitous flesh. But there was a point to this. He had lost his loving partner, and, as he tearfully tells his daughter, he used to be thin and he used to make love every day. When he lost the love of his life, there was no longer any need for his meat and two veg and, whilst others might take drugs or alcohol, his chosen means of meeting his maker was through food addiction. Hide the means of love. I get all that. But for reasons I can't explain, it all felt a little, erm, thin. 6 out of ten.",

Knowing his time is limited, he refuses his caregiver, and friends demand that he go to a hospital, choosing instead to spend his remaining time trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter.....Aronofsky is a really difficult director to digest at times. He can make wonderful, often whimsical films such as The Fountain. And then he can make films that leave you depressed and exasperated, such as the rest of the films he has made. The Whale fall into the latter, and then some.From the opening scenes, you know that thus film isn't going to be an easy ride for anyone watching this. The 4:3 aspect ratio making us feel just as claustrophobic and trapped as Charlie is. Both metaphorical and literally for Charlie. Here is a man who literally has a lot on his mind. To say he's let himself go a bit is an understatement, and Fraser is amazing in what has to be his most difficult role ever.Even though Charlie is a wonderful human being, and the audience shows him great empathy, you cannot help but stare at his character throughout the film in disgust, much like John Doe did to Gluttony in Se7en. And Charlie does very little to help himself. We see him gorge on all of the worse foods known to man. And where Favreaus Chef made you yearn for food, don't have dinner reservations after seeing this. I guarantee you won't want to eat after seeing this.The weather plays an important part of the films narrative. The moment we meet Charlie, there is heavy rainfall, and as the film progresses, the weather becomes more settled, clearer, the more Charlie's condition worsens.The rest of the cast are great, but are mostly abhorrent characters with very little redeeming features about them.I'm glad I've seen the film, it's very good. But I have no intention of seeing it again. It's bleak, claustrophobic, depressing, and very upsetting. I live with BPD, and I was down for a long time after this film finished.",

            "content": "THE WHALE is probably the most talked movie of all the ones that are nominated for Academy Awards, and it's also the resurgence of the career of Brendan Fraser, and I seriously hope he wins the Academy Award since he was considered a failed actor despite some great titles in his career. As I saw it in theater with my best friend, we both found it powerful and surprising considering the movies for which Fraser is famous (THE MUMMY trilogy, LOONEY TUNES BACK IN ACTION, FURRY VENGEANCE and some others).Charlie (Fraser) is an obese English teacher that during his online classes keeps the laptop camera switched off because he's afraid of showing his appearence to students. He lives a monotonous lifestyle: he is visited by nurse Liz (Hong Chao) that recommends him to go to check himself for health issues since he is at risk of congestive heart failure, but Charlie refuses because he doesn't want to spend so much money on exams and visits. Every evening he eats a double pizza, and until half of the movie he doesn't sees in face the pizza boy, letting him simply leave the pizzas in the porch and take Charlie's money from the mail box. Charlie wants to reconnect with his daughter that hasn't seen for 8 years: she comes and of course things go awry. Soon we find out why Charlie became obese: he tried to kill himself after the death of his partner for which he left his wife, and feels a huge sense of guilt. As the meetings with his daughter continue, they gradually patch things up until the heart-wrenching ending.If you watch this movie expecting it to be full of action or a comedy, go somewhere else. This is one of those movies where the acting is the most important thing: Fraser did all his best for playing the part of a man that wants to kill himself but as he approaches death he feels the need of patching things up with his daughter because she might be the confirmation that he did at least one thing right in his life (my favourite quote of the movie, and I relate to it when I thing of the crazy things I have done lately). The supporting characters are all great, especially the daughter, and the ending is mind-bending because the heart-attack that kills Charlie is shown with a immense bright light that fulls the screen before the final shot of Charlie and the daughter on the beach when he was still in shape.Overall, a story of redemption for both the character and the lead actor's career and incredibly touching and full of hope as well. If you have a chance of living nearby some theater that still airs it, go to see it at all costs. And I dare to say it... go Fraser! You deserve to win the Academy Award after all the bad things they did to you in the past.",

            "review_title": "A Matter of Interpretation",
            "content": "Aronofsky has always dealt primarily with the theme of obsession taken to the extreme, to the point that it deteriorates or even ends the protagonist's life. His formula is:Act I. Establishing the Obsession\nAct II. The Transformation Into a Deep Obsession\nAct III. In Full Obsession Mode, Life Withers or EndsIn Pi, the obsession was understanding the nature of the universe; in Requiem for a Dream it was drugs; in The Fountain it was immortality; in The Wrestler it was wrestling; in Black Swan it was ballet; in Noah it was devotion to God; and in Mother! It was building and maintaining her house.But this time around we have skipped straight into the end of Act III. We open with cardiac arrest immediately, establishing that his life is ending imminently. But does this mean the formula is broken? Not entirely. The acts are still there; they just happened in the past relative to the story's present setting. Therefore it falls on the viewer to interpret everything.In fact, interpretation is the central theme of this entire film. The very first dialogue is the reading of an essay which contains a very interesting interpretation on Moby Dick, even going as far as to interpret something about the author's very own life. We then see how the protagonist interprets the essay (which is itself an interpretation of something else) and applies it to his own life, showing that interpretation works on many layers. Not to mention he is also an English teacher online, who teaches interpretation of various literature and applying it to one's own life, as he's all about honesty and authenticity.When Thomas reads a biblical passage, he interprets this and applies it not only to Charlie's life but also his own. Heck, even the pizza delivery guy must have formed his own interpretation of what Charlie looks like, until finally curiosity gets the better of him. This is in fact why it bothered Charlie so much; it wasn't just that the guy physically saw him and violated his privacy. But even more importantly: as an idealist and optimist he vastly prefers when people use their imaginations and form interpretations of something, over getting bitten by cynical cold hard reality which stamps out the infinite possibility of interpretation. This is also why he keeps his webcam off during teaching.This was a major polar difference between him and his ex-wife: he even tells her \"You've always been a cynic\", implying that he is the opposite. She interprets her own daughter as Satan (\"she's evil\"), whereas he interprets her as Christ (\"amazing person\"). On the surface her actions do seem very evil, but he interprets them all as salvation, as evidenced by what she did to Thomas ending up as a net positive for him (in his interpretation).This balancing of two extreme polar opposites is another major theme: he explicitly calls it out as such when he tells his ex he \"needs to balance her cynicism out\". But also take note that he is balancing his partner's past anorexia through overeating -- or was the partner balancing his overeating with anorexia? A bit of both most likely.On top of it all, Aronofsky and the playwright Samuel D. Hunter not only celebrate the power of artistic intepretation and how it affects our lives deeply, but in so doing also invite us to interpret their creation as well. Is it a biblical story of Jonah and the Whale, is the whole thing a Moby Dick metaphor, or is he just a literally fat \"whale\"? Is the daughter Satan or Christ, is she the whale (she never forgets anything and whales are known to have impeccable memory), or is she just a lost girl from a broken family? It's a matter of interpretation.",

However his biggest obsession and addiction is food from feasting and loading up on chicken, subs, and candy bars and soda he seems lost with no meaning to live. As this film is a cautionary tale and take that those overweight should see as viewing Charlie shows how being big takes a toll on the body and one's health. Thru all of the sad personal drama his only life line is an in call Nurse Liz(Hong Chau) who's fight to keep Charlie ticking is a drama filled drain and in an emotional wild card subplot in the reconnection with Charlie's estranged brash ,bold, and stubborn go against the grain daughter Ellie the film has tense moody moments. As thru love and reconnection while visiting old wounds and skeletons Charlie comes to realize a shining light of hope as he tutors Ellie finally memories of love comes back and most important a truthful light is shined on both.

Suitably intense and menacing in the Menu, here she was stern in her doling out of tough love but also displaying an OMG level of vulnerability. She probably won't win this year (this is another \"year of the actress\") but she has my vote for best supporting actress this year. Even the peripheral players were amazing, from Frazier's estranged ex-wife and daughter (the legendary Samantha Morton - you have to see her in the Serpent Queen - and Sadie Sink) to the missionary who tries to \"save\" Frazier's characte, and even the literally two second, non-verbal interaction between Grazier and the Pizza Guy.Problematic as it is, I would highly recommend it.

This picture suggests that buckets of fried chicken, drawers full of Three Musketeers candy bars, a half dozen pizzas, gallons of Pepsi and many feet of submarine sandwiches should be consumed daily by anyone interested in emulating Fraser's success at bulking up.",

            "content": "For the past 10 years, one of my childhood friends and I have been wanting for Brendan Fraser comeback. Long before Keanu had his comeback with the 'John Wick' movies, and even before Matthew McConaughey's comeback with 'Lincoln Lawyer', 'Dallas Buyers' and 'Mud', my friend and I knew Brendan was great and that movies are missing his presence.FINALLY, in 2022, Darren Aranofsky gives us a character that allows Brendan to show off all his acting skills and release all that pent-up emotion he's had for the past many years. What Brendan gives us in 'The Whale' is his best performance to date, and easily the best performance of the year. Brendan deserves all the love and praise he's getting for this movie. Sadie Sink also should get a nomination for Supporting Actress since she killed it as well. I'm happy that a teen/child isn't portrayed like an obnoxious pos TikToker and is actually relatable and real.That being said, I found the actual movie and story pretty lackluster. You can feel that this movie is based off a play just by it's pacing and constrictiveness. It's slow, takes place in one room, half the characters' motives and dialogue are just not fully fleshed out. The nurse and missionary both give pretty wooden performances as well. The ending felt way too abrupt and should've had different direction to leave more of an impact.Overall, 'The Whale' is an average film carried by dynamite performances, especially from Mr. Fraser.6.3/10.",

            "content": "A film about addiction, the causes of which are: loss of or a lack of connection to others. I can't disagree with that assessment.I wasn't quite convinced by the character of Charlie. He seemed like such a grotesque figure of pity to the point of caricature. What I did like about the film is that it tackled the subject of gay men and the churches attempt to call their love 'sins of the flesh'. That somehow being gay is some kind of sinful addiction akin to food or drugs. The film seems to float this as a possible interpretation but thankfully clearly and unequivocally denounces such an interpretation to the point where it is wholly in favour of same sex attracted love.The acting was great across the board. Strangely I thought Brendan Fraser had the least best performance of anyone. Sadie Sink, Samantha Morton but especially Hong Chau are brilliant. Brendan Fraser's performance is good but nothing to write home about. Is he being praised more for his physical acting? Perhaps I need to watch the film again to full appreciate it.The actually watching of the film itself is slightly uncomfortable and not overly enjoyable. It was afterwards when I thought a bit more about that film that I felt I appreciated it more. Charlie's character is a bit manipulative and unsubtle as a symbol of addiction but Aronofsky gets his point across. As a man of ideas and symbols Aronofsky can't be beaten, but I'm not sure I could believe in Charlie as a character.",

There's a lot of toxicity within each character but you come out understanding why they are this way, and ultimately why there's effort in between simultaneously giving up.Be prepared going into this one because that box of tissues will be your only shoulder to cry on in the end.BRAVO TO BRENDAN FRASER!",

He has, IMO, always been a masterful actor that has not been given the credit he truly deserves.In this we see Brendan go through such a range of emotions it is hard to look away. Its hard to not feel both critical and empathetic for \"Charlie\" because he shows that he feels that way for himself. \"Liz\" also feels both angry and lovingly towards him but is compelled by her empathy and the love she carries for her deceased brother \"Alan\", to continue to be there for \"Charlie\".\"Charlie's\" desire to feel that he did something right by \"Ellie\" is something I think that most people can recognize. Her attitude and anger are deeper than normal teenage angst but she can not allow herself to reveal or come to terms with the fact that it is ok to love her Dad despite how he might have wronged her. She also has a caring heart that she tries to conceal but eventually shows through her interactions with \"Thomas\".The film is well crafted and while it doesn't elaborate on some of the finer details, enough is there to warrant an understanding of the characters and what they represent. It is a slow film but it opens itself in a consistent manner that keeps your attention.It is quite a drama and an excellent portrayal of Fraser's skill. He was nothing short of impressive in this role. So glad to see him making a comeback. Can't wait to see what the future holds for him.",

He is divorced and has a daughter he has little to no relationship with and he had a lover who has died and ultimately led to his divorce. He sees death as his only logical next step but has some loose ends he wants to tie up before dying.This movie is directed by Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream) and stars Brendan Fraser (The Mummy), Sadie Sink (Stranger Things), Hong Chau (Watchmen), Samantha Morton (Minority Report) and Ty Simpkins (Jurassic World).There is so much to like about this movie. The fine details in the writing and depiction of living obese is really well captured. There's some very smart subplots in this on religion, divorce, sexuality, self destructiveness and selfishness without knowing it. The acting in this is out of this world by everyone, but especially Fraser who delivers a career best performance. His ability to deliver both his character, sorrow and subtle determination was impressive. Chau and Morton deliver fantastic supporting characters. It's impossible to not be frustrated with Morton's character. The storyline is well\npaced and the reveals happen methodically but appropriately as the storyline unfolds. The irony of the ending was perfect.Overall, this is a tremendous character piece that is an absolute must see. I would score this an 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",

            "content": "The subject matter of the film is enough to test the mettle of the acting in the film, which rarely falls short, only to some corny lines here and there. The return of Brendan Fraser is more than welcome when you consider what his Hollywood hiatus life put him through. Showing his dramatic prowess in this film when we are used to seeing him in silly comedies is very refreshing. Half of my personal emotional response to the film is the fact that we do not deserve Brendan back in any capacity after all he's gone though and I'm so ecstatic that he's been embraced so lovingly. (I'd love to meet this legend one day just to pick his brain) The cinematography and directing is simple and is almost paced and blocked like a play (which The Whale is adapted from,) with only a couple of set changes, which keeps it simple in its native 4:3 aspect ratio. It's easy enough to push out a tear jerker. What's harder is to hit several sensitive and existential topics that humans deal with on a daily basis, and The Whale does so, causally and beautifully. These topics including religion, sexual identity, self hatred, belief in humanity's capability, life long regret, family separation and estrangement, parenting styles, body dysmorphia, self harm, emotional codependency, failing education systems, and of course the plight of death and existential dread. Each character has a small individual arc that all play into each others'.SPOILER-\nThe most emotionally intense part of this entire film, for me, was the way they came full circle with the \"essay\" Charlie recited every time he had a health attack, kind of grounding himself, only for it to be revealed that it was his daughter's middle school essay the entire time. As a father who constantly worries he's failing as a single parent, I empathized so much with wanting to let her know whole heartedly that after he's gone, he wants her to know her significance to his life and to everyone she affects.

            "content": "The Whale\nDirected by Darren Aronofsky. Written by Samuel HunterIt's so rare that I find myself anticipating a movie. Rare to be counting the days until it is released. Even rarer when presented with the film itself, it becomes something else. This movie had a chaotic schedule for theatrical release. First it was set to come out on December 9th. I started to gain in excitement that much more. This was directly after my birthday and a new Aronofsky movie was coming out. I love his work so much. The Fountain struck me and The Wrestler was new territory for dramatic stories taking professional wrestling in that vein. Aronofsky doesn't shy away from anything.But it didn't come out that weekend. It was only released in New York and LA. I went looking for new information and the date of December 21st appeared. This is nothing new for a drama like this to come out during Christmas time. But it really only added a few theaters, more than 90 miles away from me in the Crescent city. I was frustrated. In this day and age of ease of access, it can become easy to forget what waiting for something can be like.But then something miraculous happened. When I was looking up times that M3gan was playing, I saw that The Whale was playing at the Cinemark in Gulfport. Holy crap. I was elated. I called my wife to tell her and when looking at schedules, it became clear that we might need to wait. What if it left theaters before I could see it. This is when my wife gave me a wonderful gift. She knew how much I needed to see this movie in the theater and she said it was okay for me to go on my own. So I did. And I haven't had an experience like this in a movie theater in a very long time. It left me shaken.I needed to sit through the credits which were not long and then even when the lights came back up, I needed to sit there. I had to take deep breaths. I was drawn into the story and I found myself in that apartment with Charlie. It wanted me to spend time with him and get to know him as a person. Charlie is a recluse. He teaches online English classes but he never turns on his webcam. Charlie is grieving. He lost the love of his life many years ago and now he sits alone in his apartment except when his friend and nurse visits. Charlie weighs 600 pounds and he can barely move without assistance. He is a compulsive eater and this has been his way of coping. It has finally caught up to him when he suffers a heart attack and wants to get his life in order before anything happens particularly with the daughter he left behind.I can not say anything more as the discovery is integral to appreciating what this movie has to offer. It was adapted from a play by the original author. This takes place entirely in that apartment. It has to by necessity of the main character. I have taken this movie to heart in a way that makes me want to argue and dropkick critics who have completely missed the point or missed the humanity present. Too much agenda and not enough empathy. This includes several of what used to be my favorites to listen to.I don't like to compare with what other critics are saying. I know I'm attracted to movies that are more sad in nature. Many of my favorites are gut punches. This is just who I am and what works for me. It doesn't work for many. Hell I could make the case for film critics that it works for none of them.You can become too bogged down in analyzing things from a technical standpoint. You can find yourself down a rabbit hole of story and plot mechanics trying to make the pieces fit in an engineering standpoint. Every Frame a Pause do things in this fashion. You can find yourself feeling defensive because the movie is about an obese man and you yourself fit a similar or less description. I am overweight myself and can absolutely stand to lose pounds and get more healthy than I currently am. The key though is empathy. Connecting with somebody else and seeing the story from their point of view. You can connect it to elements in your own life. Charlie's relationship with his daughter certainly worked for me. When it comes to fathers and their kids, it gets me every time. It does more when those fathers want to be in the children's lives and for some reason or another, they can't.The Whale hit those things for me. I didn't see Charlie as a freak show. I didn't find him grotesque. I found him in mourning and I found him suffering. This doesn't mean I apply to every overweight or obese person on the planet. That's absurd. This was unique to his story alone. He wants to see the good in the world. He looks for that silver lining. That's not me. That's my wife. She sees things in that way and it makes for a beautiful balance between us.Brendan Fraser disappears into this role and also doesn't. How he is as a person is found in Charlie and it brings new things to the story. He is magnetic. He carries this and it is some of the best work he has ever done but he is not alone. Hong Chau is fantastic. She was also tremendous in The Menu and unique and wonderful in Treme. I see nothing but great things for her. Samantha Morton is in one scene and it is downright heartbreaking but beautiful at the soul level. This brings me to Sadie Sink as his daughter. She's angry at the world. She's angry and bitter at her dad. You may want to turn your nose up at her but there are several layers to why she's acting out in the way she is. She is something else. She is playing so much in so little sometimes. Sadie Sink and Brendan Fraser work miracles in this.Darren Aronofsky also knows when to let his actors be in the moment. He knows where the music is appropriate and how it can accentuate what is happening. I hate the idea that just because something is set in one location, that it's somehow bad or stagey. A filmed play that one guy told me when he got drunk enough to be honest about my film Language of the Sick. Human emotions are action. It is the drama.This movie was damn near a masterpiece. It is right up there with Aronofsky's best work and his most human work. I would rank it right alongside The Wrestler and Requiem for a Dream. It is a heartbreaking and beautiful movie. It showed to me that when you surrender yourself to the story and you become entwined with the characters, you live it with them and the theater is the best place to do that. It is not always the most convenient but it does have the least amount of distractions. I want people to discover this movie and ignore the others about it. It is magnificent. I loved this movie. I give it an A.",

You will feel every emotional dagger that he feels and will be immensely touched by his performance I have no doubt.It's not just about him though, every performance is spot on. Sadie Sink shines in the complex role of Charlie's estranged daughter, and Hong Chau brings such warmth and heart to her role as Charlie's friend and enabler Liz. In a cast on only 5 people all the performances had to be spot on and they really are.The story is deeply emotional and so well thought out. We slowly peel back the layers and uncover more about Charlie, his past, his relationships, and how this has led him to the point he is at. It is a propulsive piece of storytelling that climaxes perfectly.The events of the film are confined to Charlie's apartment, and largely to a single room which really connects you to the character as you experience life through his eyes and a feeling of being trapped.Darren Aronofsky's direction is perfect.

            "content": "Yikes, but this second gay-themed outing for Brendan Fraser could hardly be more different from his 1998 \"Gods and Monsters\" one. Here his is the critically obese \"Charlie\" who has grown to a size where his health is in tatters and he has virtually no mobility as he regularly consumes two large pizzas for dinner and two great meatball subs for lunch. We learn quite quickly a little of what initially drove this man to this level of despair and as things begin to look terminal, we share his aspirations to reconcile with his daughter whom he left eight years earlier to be with his gay lover \"Allan\". Now for all I thought Fraser was superb in this film, I found Sadie Sink's performance as the truly selfish, conniving and odious daughter \"Ellie\" (upon whom he rather dotes) stole this for me. At times I really did want to shoot her! Ty Simpkins also does well as the well meaning god-squadder who finds his association with this dysfunctional family helps open his eyes too. Hong Chau performs well as his long suffering friend/nurse/confidante \"Liz\", and as mortality looms the characters are drawn into an increasingly angry, hostile environment that is full of bitterness, rancour and regret certainly, but maybe - just maybe - the slightest hint of reconciliation. Fraser will never deliver another performance like this again. Sure, his size and generally slothful demeanour are so far from the hale-fellow-well-met series of characters we have seen thus far in his career that they are bound to have an effect. His acting, though, is honest and emotional. His character is torn and distraught and he conveys that potently, especially in the scenes with his obnoxious daughter. The plot has an inevitability to it, which doesn't usually work so well for me - but here, it helps focus on the few interlinked stories and characters allowing little room for distraction. It's not without it's humour now and again, either. I've deliberately avoided reading about how he got to that size - somehow, knowing might spoil what is undoubtedly a tour de force from both him and Miss Sink. Brave and uncompromising - well worth a watch.",

Being morbidly obese in a world where 25000 people die of starvation every single day is the ultimate form of egoism in my opinion. So no I will never feel sorry for all the whales on this planet (the human ones), no matter what struggles they have in their lives. That said The Whale is worth watching just to see the brilliant acting, the story itself isn't that exceptional. Brandon Fraser deserves his nomination as did the make-up artists.

Basically, Charlie (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Brendan Fraser) is a morbidly obese and reclusive English professor who teaches online college writing courses, but he keeps his appearance hidden from his students by switching off the webcam. One day, he is visited by Thomas (Ty Simpkins), claiming to be a missionary from New Life Church, he wants Charlie to be saved. Charlie's nurse and only friend Liz (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Hong Chau) cares for him; she urges him to visit a hospital as he is at severe risk of congestive heart failure. But he refuses because he is concerned that he would never be able to pay off the debts. Charlie frequently orders pizza and has a routine: regular delivery driver Dan (Sathya Sridharan) drops off the pizza and collects the cash payment from Charlie's mailbox, without ever interacting with him. Charlie has recently contacted his estranged teenage daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), whom he has not seen in eight years, and hopes to reconnect with her. Ellie is bitter and rude towards her father, but he offers her the thousands of dollars he has in his bank account to help pay for her education if she spends time with him, without her mother knowing. Ellie agrees, once Charlie agrees to help rewrite her school essay, but he also wants her to write her personal feelings in a notebook he gives her. Thomas continues to frequently visit Charlie, but Liz is displeased with this, telling him that Charlie does not need saving. Liz has a private conversation with Thomas, revealing that she is the adopted daughter of New Life's head pastor, and that her brother, Alan, was Charlie's lover. Alan committed suicide due to religious guilt, his death caused Charlie to uncontrollably binge-eat, he has never fully recovered from the loss. Despite Liz's objections, Thomas still believes his mission is to help Charlie. When Charlie's health begins to decline, Liz brings him a wheelchair to make it easier for him to move around his apartment. One day when Ellie visits Charlie, she secretly slips sleeping pills into a sandwich Liz makes for him. After he falls asleep, Thomas visits, and Ellie begins to question him while smoking marijuana. Thomas hesitates his answers and hides in Alan's former bedroom, which he previously unlocked for Charlie. Behind the closed door, Thomas admits to Ellie that he ran away from his family and his old mission in Iowa, feeling unfulfilled and stealing all the money from the youth group. Ellie secretly records his confession on her phone. Later, Liz brings Charlie's ex-wife and Ellie's mother Mary (Samantha Morton) to visit, Ellie's secret meetings with her father is revealed. There is an argument when Charlie reveals he has $120,000 in his bank account. Liz is angered that he lied to her about not having money for healthcare and storms out. Mary and Charlie argue about the breakdown of their marriage, due to his gay affair with Alan, and him abandoning his daughter, and eventually she leaves. One night, after delivering his pizza, Dan sticks around to see Charlie come outside to take the food, Dan glimpses him for the first time and walks away, seemingly in shock. Charlie is devastated and angered; he experiences a severe binge-eating episode. He later sends out an email to his students, containing swearing, asking them to write something honest. Thomas visits Charlie one last time, informing him that he is moving back home after Ellie sent his confession to his former youth group and family. His family have forgiven the incident and are welcoming him home. Thomas tries to convert Charlie but is chastised after he blames Alan's death on his homosexuality. In his next class, Charlie reveals that he will be replaced as their professor and reads some of their candid responses. To reciprocate their honesty, he decides to turn on his webcam, finally revealing his appearance to them, all with mixed reactions. Charlie ends the class by throwing his laptop against the fridge. Feeling guilty for abandoning him, Liz comforts Charlie, who is nearing death. Ellie storms into the apartment to confront him over his rewritten essay. Charlie reveals that he replaced her rewritten essay with a critical essay of Moby Dick by Herman Melville, which she wrote in eighth grade, he considers it the most honest essay he has ever read. Ellie berates Charlie as he attempts to reconcile one final time. Feeling he is near the end; he asks her to read the essay to him. Ellie reluctantly and tearfully reads the essay as Charlie tries to stand up, he previously failed to when Ellie asked during her first visit. Charlie manages to stand and tries to walk toward her while she continues reading. As Ellie completes the reading, Charlie begins to float, and they are engulfed by a great white light (which may be him dying). As the light fades, it ends with a memory of them both visiting the beach. Also starring Jacey Sink as Young Ellie. This film can be seen as Fraser's comeback, he gives a heroic, sympathetic performance as the unhealthy gay teacher and father heading to self-destruction and seeking redemption, Sink is great as the unhappy and vicious estranged teenage daughter, Chau is terrific as his carer and sister of his dead boyfriend, and Morton makes an impact in her short time as the former wife. It should be noted that the title is a double-meaning, for the size of the lead character, and obviously in relation to the book Moby Dick. It gained controversy for the casting of Fraser, as opposed to an actor with obesity, but he has proved doubters wrong, and it proves the extraordinary work of special effects makeup artists. It is theatrically simple compared to other films directed by Aronofsky, it is claustrophobic but heartfelt, and it is well acted and well scripted, a surprisingly powerful and interesting psychological drama. Very good!",

He inks out a script from the source content that keeps users engaged, wringing out every ounce of talent possible from his actors, cut and framed into a five day chronicle.Yes, Fraser gives the performance of his life. And consequently, so does Hong Chau give her best, whose supporting work here will likely be overshadowed by Fraser's own. Viewers are so transfixed into Charlie's character that it wasn't until credits roll there's a realization some 99% of screen time is all contained inside one tiny, stagnant apartment.The story itself is one that viewers like myself will grapple with, pondering for days how much intervention into other people's lives we should have, and the merits of doing so. There is little glimmer of hope; an outcome that is neither surprising nor expecting. The Whale is painted in a world of being merely a witness, helpless to those you love.The Whale is absolutely worth the watch, irregardless of its destination or agreement.",

A touching story of a man who just wants his daughter to know her value. Another theme is that we each have our own truth and that truth is the most important thing. The most important thing in life is honesty. I also like how Brendens character is always kind despite the cruelty he experiences. I understand some people don't like this movie because he is in a fat suit. In reality if they cast a real person who is that obese to play the role it would not be healthy because the level of acting required could cause them to hurt their heart. I've lived with someone with a physical body like Brendens character and just like the character this real person became that obese because of depression. I think this movie is important because it shows a truth that exists for some people and maybe having a touching story about it could help some people. Also I've met people like the daughter and the nurse. A lot is grounded in reality in this movie. It really touched me and my friend and not very many movies do that anymore. It's hard to put into words but I think this was the best movie of 2022. Granted I haven't seen TAR yet and I've heard that good too. It's definitely the best movie I've seen this year.",

Everyone has had moments in life when a loved one passes, a relationship comes to an end, or an unexpected diagnosis appears which tests our mind, body, souls, and heart. At these times some people go on living, some people strive to go above and beyond, while others may give up and count the hours. Charlie is a character who gives up on living his everyday life and because of this gives in to his vice of over eating causing his weight to spike resulting in dangerous obesity. Each day he does the minimum amount and apologizes excessively for his existence to the people in his life that care the most about him.Fraser gives an Oscar worthy performance as Charlie, as does director Darren Aronofsky in presenting Charlie's world, a one-bedroom apartment presented to the audience in a small format. We feel trapped like Charlie does. The score by Simonsen is beautifully done, especially the end of the film with the track titled \"Safe Return\", it is an emotional rollercoaster.This film shows the audience a reflection of either themselves or someone close to them that has given up on life and each day is just waiting to die by giving into over indulgence. The film shows how we want what is best for these people and how frustrating it can be to see someone who love in this state of being.",

Cheating, divorce, money, father daughter relationships, mother daughter relationships, friendships, taxes, school, stress, anger, depression, but the #1 of all in this, which was very hard for me to view, even though I'm not obese, was the consequences of STRESS eating and how it can affect your entire life.

            "content": "I wanted to love this film. I have liked many of Aronofsky's previous films (particularly Requiem for a Dream) and it was great to see Brendan Fraser back on the screen. Unfortunately, what I found was an astoundingly fatphobic piece of pity porn. Most of the supporting characters are incredibly unlikeable & engage in abusing Charlie in one form or another. It felt like 2 hours of watching \"fat Monica\" from Friends dancing with food in her hands.The actors all do their best with what they are given. Brendan Fraser does well, all things considered, but does overham it (pun intended) at times in an obvious attempt for an Oscar. I fear that he will win it too, for being \"brave\" enough to play such an obese character therefore cementing how acceptable fatphobia is again. Sadie Sink tries her best, but doesn't even reach the levels she achieved in Stranger Things though. Hardly surprising, as her character comes across as a psychopath (particularly given how abusive she is to animals & people alike). At first, Samantha Morton's character seemed like yet another cliche, but her performance managed to redeem that character by giving a great deal more nuance. Hong Chau is excellent as Charlie's friend, despite playing a dangerously enabling character.My main problem is that the film is obsessed with showing the audience a morbidly obese man devouring large amounts of unhealthy food. We get it, he's fat because he eats too much. We don't need to have it shoved down our throats, as we constantly see him doing. The inclusion of things such as various humiliating situations (including seeing his naked torso, him struggling to walk, the porn incident) all reinforce the idea that the only way you can connect with such a character is through pity rather than understanding. They seem to think that's all fine though, because (shock, horror) turns out the obese man has feelings. Who'd a thunk it? This film could've dealt with the issue so much more sensitively, instead it joins in.If anyone needs to go to the cinema & watch something so humiliating towards obese people, just to humanise them & realise they deserve sympathy, then there's something hugely wrong with our society.",

            "content": "Welcome back Brendan Fraser! It should go without saying that he is the highlight of this film, his incredible performance is something that will go down in history. Darren Aronofsky's \"The Whale\" is frankly nothing without Fraser's powerhouse of a performance. If you had an actor who did any less than what Fraser did, this film would not work as well as it does. Fraser is the foundation of this film's success; without him everything would fall. Because it is a one-room story that very much does feel like watching a stage play, even more is left up to the actors than in a usual film, this format demands strong performances. And here we got Brandan Fraser, proving that he has so much more to offer as an actor than what we previously thought! In fact, I would argue he has delivered one of the most emotionally devastating performances we have ever seen on film - he damn near broke my heart over and over again every time he had a line of dialogue. This is a career-defining performance for Fraser, and he should be a shoe-in for a nomination at this year's Academy Awards. Brendan Fraser deserves the Oscar for this one and it's not even close. His performance was so heartbreaking and completely knocks it out of the park, same with the rest of the cast. Sadie Sink was also phenomenal! I have really only ever seen her in \"Stranger Things\", but wow did she ever blow me away here! Hong Chau, Ty Simpkins and Samantha Morton also had some incredible moments, this really is an actor's movie! The main reason to see this movie really is for the performances, as every single actor is giving their best work here!\"The Whale\" is an honest, raw and emotionally devastating film. Don't expect to come out of this one feeling good, it really did tear my emotions to shreds as it touches on themes of depression, religion, faith, pain and regret. It's about human, more specifically family connection. It is a character study about one broken man who is filled with pain and regret; one who has lost himself and seems to have lost everything, and yet he still has such a strong sense of optimism and can see the good in people. Due to the strong direction you really feel Charlie's pain from his perspective. It broke my heart. Aronofsky's direction is very strong, he handled the tone and story very well, even if it does seem like a carbon copy of the stage play. I also liked his visual approach a lot. The murky, dim interior that we're confined to as our protagonist is also trapped in his own regret, grief, and failure. The pouring of light into the room at the end is a very powerful visual choice even if it was somewhat obvious. The 4:3 aspect ratio really helped to assist with the intimate yet claustrophobic feel of the film, and the film's single setting worked to the film's advantage by adding to the film's generally depressing and isolated tone. The setting itself, as mentioned before, really put a lot of onus on the actors to deliver performances that would make the movie stand out. And that they did; those performances are phenomenal. I do think it's a little messy thematically and some moments feel kinda silly, but overall the tragic nature of the story and the emotion woven in really swept me away and broke my heart.The movie is not for everyone, some may find it uncomfortably unenjoyable. Those who enjoy it will be the ones who can find the messages about family connection, about pain, loss and regret. It is a depressing and emotional story, carried by some incredible performances from the entire cast. Brendan Fraser turns in a career defining performance that's heart wrenching and powerful and beautiful. You won't want to miss this movie for his performance alone!",

While the writing the was certainly great, this movie was carried on the shoulders of Brendan Fraser. He kept you watching every scene. The suit and makeup for his obesity was great. His scenes almost make you want to cry. These character all suffer from past and present sins. Even if you don't deal with the same sins, these characters feel very real, and you are sympathetic towards each of them although they are messed up in different ways. This movie is full of small heartfelt moments that make the movie. Fraser's breakdown in front of his ex-wife, his depressed eating spree, and the last minute of the movie were standouts for me. The depressed eating stood out because it showed how a complete stranger and small interactions can have a huge impact on people. This is very real and happens in the workplace. But this pizza guy who should've known that Charlie was fat by all the pizza he brings, looks as if he saw bigfoot when he sees Charlie for the first time. And this is what tips Charlie into full suicidal again after trying hard to make some connection with his daughter. While Simpkins and Chau did very solid in their roles, Sadie Sink was the other standout performance. What seems like an unrealistically naive teenager feels real with her performance. Yes, I realize I keep saying real, but that is what drove this movie: emotions. All her evil acts that would sound over the top on paper, worked with her performance. And the breakdown in the last scene was the best climax. People do care.",

Sadie Sink, Ty Simpkins and Samantha Morton are top notch, though Hong Chau is a cut above that trio - brilliant stuff from her!There are some powerful scenes in there. I'm not one to cry with fictional works (my brain automatically knows it's 'fake', I can't help it) but man even I got major goosebumps and gut punches (pardon the pun?) from what's portrayed onscreen.

Here, it was borne out of sadness. When people drink themselves to alcoholism, society accepts it even when it was borne out of pain management. With obesity however the perspective is generally one of disgust, lack of self discipline, gluttony, laziness and so on. These people equally need help.

            "content": "There are few filmmakers like Darron Aronofsky. His early work is sublime, his aughts work is interesting and unconventional, but his recent work has been disappointing. Noah and Mother! Are cleverly visceral and anarchic, but they're also bogged down in religious symbolism and shallow metaphor, lacking the substance of the filmmaker's greatest films. The Whale is a nice return to form, even if missing Aronofsky's trademark frenetic hysteria. Written by Samuel D. Hunter, and adapted from his play, the script is not spectacular, but it is dense, thought-provoking, and well-paced.The film follows Charlie, a morbidly obese man who teaches English for an online college. Having recently come to terms with his own mortality, Charlie tries to reconnect with his daughter, volatile and callously apathetic Ellie. The entire story takes place within Charlie's apartment; nurse Liz and proselytizer Thomas also visit, and the film's drama is drawn from each character's unique interactions with the others.Chamber pieces are in vogue, most likely because of the limitations presented by the pandemic. At least five films in the last three months (The Menu, Glass Onion, Skinamarink, Knock at the Cabin, and The Whale) have taken place in one primary venue. The technique is usually a mark of miniscule budgets or ambitious screenwriters, but these films (sans Skinamarink) are at least relatively expensive and reasonably conventional.Of these five films, The Whale feels most purposeful in its use of a single location, most likely because it's adapted from a stage play, and written by a playwright. The film is an intimate story with refreshingly small but impactful stakes; it's focused and thematically dense enough to hold attention throughout, implicitly justifying its economical narrative and construction.The Whale feels and watches like a play, for better or worse, sometimes simultaneously. Much of the early dialogue is clunkily expositional and characterizations are lean. However, there is deceptive depth to characters' conflict and relationships, leading to provocative questions posed throughout, both subtly and explicitly.Although The Whale's plot doesn't usually unfold organically - much of its movement is spurred by someone entering or exiting a room, much like a sitcom - its scenes are impressively balanced between brevity and elongated elegance. Plotting is clunky but expedient, and the sum result has an impressive sense of internal rhythm and timing. The Whale is eventually too lumbering and overstuffed, but this is the result of an overaccumulation of sharp observations, rather than a confused, non-committal slog.The Whale is sharp and thoughtful, but it's also abjectly miserable. It's a type of story where every character is melodramatically \"broken\" and searching for a new light to guide their spiritual redemption. Directors who miscalculate this type of drama churn out Noel and Simon Birch, but Aronofsky is obviously too skilled to produce such pablum.Instead of a lighter sense of emotional misery, The Whale is dark: the apartment is dark, the script is dark, the characters are dark; any optimism springs from either regret or misplaced nostalgia. Aronofsky is often cynical, but he abandons all hope before entering The Whale's worldview, falling into cold misanthropy, even blunt nihilism. Whether or not the film's dramatic integrity is deep or focused enough to warrant such hopelessness is up to the viewer.The general depression of the film does not overshadow its characters but springs from them. For all of The Whale's thematic probing, twisting, and questioning, there's a surprising and disappointing lack of agency to the entire affair. Charlie and friends continuously, and drearily, wallow in their own circumstances, never attempting to overcome or improve on life's knockdowns.Admittedly, this lack of self-ownership may be the point, as all involved are either battling addictions or too young, arrogant, or na\u00efve to broaden their perspectives, but The Whale's overwhelming feeling is one of self-pity and helplessness, both learned and innate. The film tries to abruptly reverse course in its final moments, but this mismatched contortion is not enough to wash the taste of pathetic failure out of one's mouth.The drama of the film is solidly elevated by Aronofsky and his cast. The director restrains himself throughout, creating space and time for Hunter's dialogue to breathe. Although his technique is consistently successful, I couldn't help but wish the script allowed for greater and more frequent Aronofskyesque flourishes.There is a point wherein The Whale seems to be lifting off, to finally be careening off its meticulously placid railing, but the attempt fizzles; in seconds, the story is back on track and its repetition resumes, as if the potential for deviation never existed. Like its story, the film's camerawork is stark and dry, a decidedly serious attempt to chisel high drama and court sophisticated audiences. Those who consider themselves highbrow will probably swoon, but I gravitate toward the raw, kinetic verve of Aronofsky's earlier work - I prefer my senses engulfed.As mentioned, The Whale is greatly elevated by its performances, most notably Fraser's. His transformation into a 600 pound man (made possible by heavy prosthetics) is striking and absorbing, but his performance is impactful mostly because of the pain and remorse in his eyes and heart.Fraser plays into the misery porn well, eliciting true sympathy and genuine care from the characters and audience. He's soft spoken and understands the overbearing pathos of the material, presenting vulnerabilities not typically seen from a past action hero. Aronofsky presents the material deftly, but Fraser makes it work. The rest of the cast - Sadie Sink, Ty Simpkins, Hong Chau, and Samantha Morton - play dutifully into the melodrama, portraying their corrosive sad sacks with palpable humanity.The Whale is so stuffed with drama that it has a little something for everybody, at least those who can overlook its general misery and dour outlook. There are soulful themes of past mistakes, parental absence, and potential redemption; characters are outlined well, if not too deeply felt or particularly relatable.The film is a nice showcase of Aronofsky's talents as a minimalist and a magnificent showcase for Fraser's maturation as an actor, but it's just too enamored with its characters' misery to give viewers the catharsis of their redemption. Fans of adult filmmaking should see it for the talent both behind and in front of the camera, but I can't pretend the average moviegoer will come away whistling and satisfied.",

They maintained the theme of confinement and isolation in an inspired way. My only complaint is the ending was a bit goofy and kind of cut the tone short. However, the performances were so fantastic that I can forgive that flaw. I am not the biggest of of this director, but this film is easily one of the best I've seen in a while, and I will be rewatching it soon. There's the common themes of religion and spirituality he seems to like using in all of his films, however here I think it was handled well without being overly crude or on the nose.",

Yes, some are obese by their own doing, but others might be obese due to a medical condition. Whatever the reason, I sympathize with them after seeing this movie.The film is highlighted by a magnificent performance by Brendan Fraser. He stars as a gay, obese man, Charlie, who teaches online and never leaves his apartment. His good friend, and the sister of his deceased lover, Liz (Hong Chau) looks after him. Also a fantastic performance by Hong Chau. Charlie was married once and has a daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), with whom he wants to reconcile, and offer to write her school essays for her.Ellie is foul-mouthed and rude, and sees Charlie as \"disgusting\". She agrees to visit him when Charlie says he'll give her all his money. Ty Simpkins stars as Thomas, a missionary from New Life Church, who wants \"to save\" Charlie. I didn't really fully understand this character - especially during the third act when secrets about him are revealed.Almost the entire film is set in Charlie's living room, but despite the confined space I never found the film claustrophobic or boring. On the contrary, I was infested in this movie and rooted for Charlie all the way. I never expected the film to have so many reveals, which was rather interesting.As mentioned, this film will offend some viewers, and I'm sure some will hate it. I was spellbound by Brendan Fraser's performance. This is a touching film with an emotional ending. This was actually so good!",

I'm taking a page out of Charlie's book and mentioning my honest take.Charlie is not meant to be a sympathetic person. I think the point is he's just...human, and humans make mistakes and have flaws and are incredibly contradictory.He's incredibly loving and empathetic, yet he left his wife and child without thinking how it'd affect them. He has incredible positive thinking, yet he thinks so negatively and destructively about himself.He's not meant to be sympathetic, just human.The film itself is incredible. I haven't cried like that over a movie in quite a while. The theme seems to me to be how brilliant people are and how incredulous it should be that Charlie believes that in the first place.It was devastating to me to see the pizza delivery guy look at Charlie in that way. It's like he stopped seeing him as human as soon as he laid eyes on him. Up until that point he was checking in on him and offered his name. This was where Charlie believed for a little while that people might not be inherently good.Brendan Fraser deserves the Oscar for this. No question. The acting of everyone else involved was top-notch too.",

Despite the great acting by the cast, the writing and execution were weak and just lame, full of so many cliches and overdone themes.

            "review_title": "Suicidal quest a'la MOBY DICK",
            "content": "Loved this film. Uncontrollable sobbing overtook me, even 10 minutes after the credits were finished. Fraser brought to life such a believable and sympathetic character, that throughout the entire movie I kept randomly crying over how touching and real his performance was as the morbidly obese shut-in English teacher, battling his demons.I know many people see this movie mainly as being one that centers around addiction and the far-reaching consequences of them. However, the real message of this film seems to be a more subtle lesson of \"man's search for meaning in a world of deceptive appearances and fatal delusions,\" which is how Laurie Robertson-Lorant described MOBY DICK, a novel which the movie heavily references.Throughout the movie we are shown all of the characters' strengths and contradicting flaws. Charlie believes that everyone is good and worthy of love, except himself. Liz is forgiving of Charlie and empathizes with his illness, yet also enables it, perhaps even in a passive-aggressive manner as subconscious revenge for her brother's death. Ellie is called \"evil\" by her own mother and is considered the social pariah in high school, however she ends up saving Thomas and reuniting him with his family. All Thomas wants to do is \"help,\" but ends up hurting Charlie in the worst way, insinuating that God punished him and Alan for being gay. Mary is an overprotective mother who wants the best for her daughter, yet denies her access to the only thing which would bring her normalcy, that being her father. And even the pizza guy Dan is a person who wants to reach out and befriend his repeat customer, but upon seeing Charlie's physical appearance, Dan is disgusted and immediately regrets breaking their unspoken privacy pact.Aronofsky does an excellent job, too, using misdirection to fool us into focusing on the characters' flaws when their strengths are actually being shown, and vice versa. For example, Charlie tells Ellie that he keeps his webcam off so his students won't see what he looks like. Aronofsky utilizes subtle camera angles and tense situations to make us suspect that Ellie will secretly change the webcam settings on his camera in order to accidentally expose his appearance to his students. Ellie also takes candid photos of people without their permission, records their private confessions, and even drugs them with Ambien. However, Ellie never does anything malicious to her father while he is asleep (we are led to believe in some way she drugged him in an act of compassion), even though the laptop is right in plain view. And her candid photos and recording of Thomas only serve as his liberation later on.It is also interesting to watch how each character has their own successful path, even though what's right for one character isn't necessarily right or deemed appropriate by another. For example, Charlie believes that giving his life savings to his daughter and accepting death is his path. He does not want nor need God or anyone else to save him. Thomas believes that God is the reason for all things, and that through God's power Ellie saved Thomas and reunited him with his family. Both of Charlie and Thomas truly believe in their individual paths with resounding conviction, and if we would try to interchange their paths, we would produce utter failure. Even though religion is what indirectly led Charlie to his demise (ie his partner committing suicide because he wasn't accepted by his family and the church for being gay), religion is what ends up saving Thomas. Even though Thomas wasn't very honest with himself and his life's desires, honesty is what saved Charlie's relationship with his daughter and let him die with peace and contentment. It is also important to note that Thomas possessed wisdom that Charlie lacked (ie \"It's only money!\"), while Charlie knew all too well that \"no one can save anyone.\"I also loved so many of the references and symbolism that tied into MOBY DICK. From focusing on various similar themes such as fate and free will, defiance, appearance vs reality, and religion, to the ending scene with the harpoon effect of pulling Charlie closer to Ellie and his own demise while she reads her essay, the movie does an excellent job with paralleling the novel in various ways.Overall, this was an extremely powerful and moving film. The acting performances and writing were deeply moving, and the direction was well paced and carefully constructed. Also, the special effects and makeup were incredible, which made me smile, remembering back to earlier times when CGI wasn't the answer for \"trompe l'oeil.\"",

Directed by Darren Aronofsky & starring Brendan Fraser in the lead role of Charlie, this movie explores the theme of human connection, love, & the redemption that comes with forgiveness.Charlie is a man who weighs over 600 pounds & is confined to his apartment, where he spends his days watching TV and talking to his online friends. But behind this facade lies a man who is struggling to come to terms with the loss of his partner, & who yearns for the love and acceptance of his teenage daughter Ellie, played by Sadie Sink who already proved she knows what acting actually is in popular Netflix TV series Stranger Things.What makes The Whale such a powerful film is the empathy & compassion with which it portrays its characters. Charlie is never reduced to a caricature or a punchline; instead, we see him as a complex & fully realized human being, with all the joys and sorrows that come with that. Brendan Fraser performance as Charlie is nothing short of remarkable, capturing the character's humor, vulnerability, and pain with equal skill & it is definitely a strong come back from Brenden Fraser to the silver screen.Sink is equally impressive as Ellie, bringing a raw emotional intensity to her role as a young woman struggling with her own demons. As the story unfolds, we see her begin to soften towards her father, as she comes to understand the depth of his love for her & the pain he's been through. It's a powerful and moving journey that will leave you feeling deeply moved & touched.The Whale is beautifully shot, with the cinematography capturing both the bleakness & the beauty of Charlie's world. The pacing is expertly handled, drawing the viewer in & keeping them engaged throughout. This is a film that is both tragic & hopeful, showing that even in the darkest of circumstances, there is still room for love & forgiveness.Overall, The Whale is a must-see film that will leave you with a lasting impression. It's a story about the power of human connection & the importance of forgiveness, even in the most difficult of circumstances. Aronofsky has crafted a beautiful & heartfelt film that's not to be missed.",

Sadie is doing an even more irrationally mean version of her Stranger Things character. I don't understand why Hong got an Oscar nod at all; her performance is also fine but, c'mon. The best piece of acting in the film is Samantha Morton- she's convincingly playing a different person, but everyone is acting like they're in a play instead of a movie. The pizza delivery driver's interest in his customer makes no sense. The missionary's presence and lying makes no sense. Just because she's your daughter doesn't mean she's soooo amazing and perfect; she *was* trying to hurt the missionary.

The haunting and devastating apartment complex to the disturbingly realistic suit that he wears really draws you into this foreboding atmosphere.

That was the nice reveal that left me in a lot tears, that the daughter was just lonely and sad vs the label of evil that the mother had boxed her in with. The movie also gave me a lot to think about such as how the different characters struggled with their inability to stop caring, even with the various distractions they hid in.

Not to mention that he added his personal touch while he was at it, so I was bawling my eyes out the entire time!To me, he didn't seem to be trying to imitate a self-loathing soul who has given up all hope for redemption; rather, he seemed to be reconciling with his own flawed past, as if he's scouring through his mistakes, his own life, in the hope of finding something meaningful, something that would liberate him from his shackles, something that would ease his burden, and make him whole again!His portrayal felt incredibly personal to me; he wasn't just reading words from a petty paper; he was feeling it, enduring it all, and I couldn't be happier with the news of his Oscar nomination.

She really stood out even in scenes with Fraser she was able to own the screen and that is something to really point out, given how amazing Fraser was.

I dont think she understood her character's depth and played it like a spoiled brat. Which it was. But Sink didnt allow us to look beneath the surface and thats a shame. I also think thats where Darren Aronofsky failed a bit in his direction. As great as he developed Fraser and Chau, it seemed he did not care for his other supporting characters that much. Especially Sink.

It's about WHY he's fat. It's about self destruction, about how one person's fall from grace causes others to fall, and ultimately it's about trying to end that cycle. It's also about the importance of having someone who cares enough to be honest. I really thought it was a beautiful movie and a lot of people completely missed the point because they couldn't get over a guy in a fat suit.I will say that Fraser's acting was a little overhyped. He was great, but I'm not sure it was my favorite performance of the year. I think some of the problem was his character had a tendency to be disingenuous, so his acting came off that way. I wasn't overly impressed by anyone in this movie, Hong Chau probably gave the most genuine performance.Definitely worth watching, it's good to have Aronofsky back. I thought we'd lost him.",

Not only does he carry this film he gives a powerful, deep and heart felt performance. You believe and almost feel everything you see. His agony, pain and struggle is very real. He knows he does not have much time left so he wants to reconnect with his badly behaved daughter. Sadie Sink gives a great performance and shows how much potential and depth she has as a young actress. This is a tough film at times to watch but it also feels like a very real one. Nothing is glossed over and exaggerated and it feels like a relatable performance from Fraser. If he does win the Oscar for best actor, it is well deserved.",

Although Brendan Fraser may not be everyone's favorite actor, he is someone that most people know and love from their childhood, including myself, through The Mummy movie series. I read what happened to him. Too bad. He also did a great job in this movie. He should definitely win the Best Actor Oscar, and he must take part in more dramatic roles. I 'm happy that he is back. Actually, I think it's a very simple and well-described movie. Judging by the Darren Aronofsky filmography, this movie looks a bit weak, but it's still a good movie. The best thing in this movie were the acting performances and the makeup. The movie is already a single location movie. The script was also good. Sadie Sink, Hong Chau, Samantha Morton performed very well. I didn't like Ty Simpkins' acting in this movie, but he tried to do his best. There is no need to talk much about the movie. Brendan Fraser was excellent. Also, congratulations to the make-up team, they did a great job, you can't tell if it's fake.",

            "content": "The old saying about glass houses and not throwing stones seems fittingly apropos here, both for the characters in this story and the ever-so-cynical critics who have so unfairly and recklessly flung their condescending bile-laden assessments toward this offering. Director Darren Aronofsky's latest tells the heartbreaking and heartwarming tale of a 600-pound gay man (Brendan Fraser) whose health is quickly failing and struggles to make up for past misgivings and to work out long-lingering self-worth issues during what time he has left, neither of which come easily and often seem insurmountable. At the same time, however, we also see a character who frequently and genuinely manages to see the best in people, despite having often been the object of cruel, unapologetic ridicule and needlessly hard on himself. It's an outlook that few of us are able to imagine, let alone sustain, but, having been on the receiving end of both the good and the bad in others, he chooses to look for the best and to believe that such a benevolent attitude is our natural tendency, despite seeming evidence to the contrary. Now if he could only come to embrace the same view for himself. This thoughtful, insightful picture gives us much to contemplate (something many mercilessly ignorant, shallow-minded reviewers seem to have failed to grasp), reminding us to make the most of our beliefs during the short time we have in our lives. Admittedly, there are some segments in which the dialogue is somewhat awkward and stilted (even though the rationale behind this is ultimately revealed, even if a bit odd when initially introduced). But this modest shortcoming is more than made up for by the film's superb ensemble cast (arguably the best I've seen thus year), with stellar performances by Fraser (truly deserving of this year's best actor honors) and a fine crew of supporting players, including Sadie Sink, Hong Chau, Samantha Morton and Ty Simpkins. I truly feel sorry for those who have missed the message behind this excellent offering, but, then, if they've never walked in the shoes of someone like the protagonist, I suppose that's understandable. For those who have been there, though (like myself), this is a moving tale that easily draws out the compassion in others - provided they have it to give in the first place (something I have to wonder about given some of the reviews I've read). If it's something that the cynics have never had to contend with before, then maybe they'll learn something from watching this release.",

Hong Chau is amazing, with a warmth and kindness that makes her scenes with Fraser so beautiful to watch and Ty Simpkins' enjoyably awkward character develops into someone's much more complex.Darren Aronofsky's direction is great, whilst it can be heavy handed at times it's still suitably claustrophobic with a firm grasp of the required tone.

The movie is a character-driven piece that explores the complexity of relationships, the power of forgiveness, and the struggles of addiction. While the story itself is not groundbreaking, the movie is elevated by excellent performances, particularly the support actors.One of the standout performances in The Whale comes from Sadie Sink, who plays Charlie's teenage daughter, Ellie. Her' portrayal of a young girl struggling to come to terms with her father's leaving, and subsequent self-destructive behaviour is both nuanced and moving. She is able to convey a range of emotions, from anger and frustration to sadness and desperation, in a way that feels authentic and relatable.Another standout performance comes from the ever reliable Samantha Morton, who plays Charlie's ex-wife. She brings a depth and complexity to his character that makes him much more than just a stereotypical \"deserted wife.\" She is able to convey the pain and hurt that Charlie has caused her, while also showing compassion and understanding for the man he once loved.The supporting cast in The Whale is rounded out by a talented group of actors, including Hong Chau as Charlie's nurse, who provides Charlie with a sounding board for his thoughts and feelings. While these characters may not have as much screen time as the main characters, they are able to make a significant impact on the story and the audience.The Whale is a movie that relies heavily on its performances to carry the weight (sorry!) of the story, and fortunately, the actors do not disappoint. Fraser gives a powerful and moving performance as Charlie, bringing a vulnerability and authenticity to the character that makes him both sympathetic and relatable. He is able to convey the pain and suffering that Charlie is experiencing, while also showing the love and compassion that he has for his daughter.The Whale is a movie that is sure to tug at the heartstrings of anyone who watches it. While the story itself may not be groundbreaking, the performances of the actors, particularly the support actors, elevate the movie to a level that makes it worth watching. It is a moving and emotional film that explores the complexities of the human experience in a way that is both poignant and powerful.",

Even Charlie's situation is the result of many bad choices and an inability to deal with his own failings. Liz, virtually his only friend, enables Charlie's suicidal habit by bringing him the very thing that is killing him. And how often do we have to see the white, male, Christian who, despite his heartfelt desire to get someone saved, has no actual understanding of what that means and fails at the very moment he should be saying, yes, God loves you, Charlie. At least his family understood the basic Christian concept of forgiveness.Nothing uplifting and generally depressing. I want more than this from a movie.",

            "content": "The best way I can describe what watching \"The Whale\" is like is if you stared at a black tv screen or mirror showing your reflection for so long that it makes you uncomfortable. Even if you don't have an eating disorder or addiction of any kind it still creates this feeling. When you think something about yourself is disgusting and get it in your head that it's all others see when they look at you.This movie is about the consequences that trauma and addiction (frequently paired together) have on both the human mind and body. Fraser gives one of the best movie performances I've ever seen as Charlie, a man who has a food addiction and as a result is morbidly obese. Immediately some may hear this and assume it picks at the fat guy, a trope that Hollywood shamefully frequents. However, here you feel nothing but empathy for Charlie. Fraser's Hollywood hiatus is completely forgotten about as he seems like he never stopped acting. His performance is probably the best I've seen since Heath Ledger's in \"The Dark Knight\". Anything less than an Oscar nomination, and possible win would be shocking to say the least.Without getting into spoilers I will say this is the most emotionally provoking movie I've ever seen. Also one of the better movies in general that I've ever seen. I haven't cried to a movie in 15 years, and \"The Whale\" came dangerously close to breaking that streak. I cannot say the same for others in the theatre however. I could hear sniffling from some and bawling from others.Finally, there was a negative thing I noticed about the movie. It is a screenplay adapted from a play which is immediately noticeable. Characters pause at the door or exaggerate their movements, common ways of portraying emotions on stage to an audience sitting hundreds of feet away. This was the only negative however and does not deter me from giving a solid 10/10.",

Made me feel all the possible emotions: empathy, sadness, affection, everything. Happiness? In the ending. What a marvelous ending.The script isn't necessarily trying to make you feel that there's a completely happy ending there, but for Charlie, he achieved what he really wanted: bring out the bright inner side on his daughter, the side of her that was capable to love him as a father, despite his flaws. This moment has shown that he was capable of the last thing he wanted for his life: to make his daughter understand she is a good person that he always thought she was, indeed. Now he's completely happy, he gave his daughter everything he wanted to give (so she wouldn't treat herself as badly as he treated himself), and now he can go nd rest in peace. I've seen this a happy ending. A very happy, real and human ending.Charlie cared so much about the others, even though he lost every important person in his life, that he left himself completely behind, since when he was gaining weight and locked himself inside an apartment to when he refused to pay for a health insurance to leave the money for his daughter. He still had an immensive amount of affection for the people that passed through his life. And I couldn't help but feel sorry for him, and have such a huge empathy for him.It's not about only obesity, not at all.

His attempt to reconnect with his estranged daughter is something that hits home for me. I'm spite of how horrible she treats him, no one can convince him out of how he feels.

This is clearly the strong point of the film.But we have to be honest and recognize that not even a very competent performance by Darren Aronofsky in direction can transform the script into something it is not: a coherent story with multiple facets of interest, which intertwine harmoniously. Furthermore, this film is a rather easy exercise in building a story based on ingredients that are especially popular with contemporary audiences: the social dilemmas of gay people; the fallibility of the religious message; the roots of the dissatisfaction of the adolescent attitude; etc. Worse, by wanting to articulate in the same story such disparate elements, it ends up presenting us with a disperse narrative that doesn't really add up at the end.In any case, this is a worthwhile film that will not fall into oblivion like the vast majority of what is produced in Hollywood today.",

Still, the director's approach & execution isn't going to strike the right chord with everyone, for some will find it a tad mawkish & problematic.Unfolding entirely inside the protagonist's apartment, the drama is gripping throughout and is expertly shot & interestingly told. But it's the first-rate work from the ensemble here that does the heavy lifting. Brendan Fraser returns with a tour-de-force act to steal the show but strong support from Hong Chau, Sadie Sink & Samantha Morton are also notable, each bringing more depth to their roles.Overall, The Whale manages to be as hopeful & heartfelt as it is haunting & harrowing at times and marks yet another polarising entry in Aronofksy's oeuvre despite being his warmest film to date. Featuring one of the most accurate depictions of binge eating episode, anchored by top-notch acting and complemented by an evocative score, Darren Aronofksy's latest is one of the better films of 2022.

I feel like we more or less ingested what was given and the experience of what we were able to feel is what we liked. We did not really speak until we were halfway home because we were digesting what we had seen. I am in love with movies, she on the other hand likes them but never goes to a movie.

            "review_title": "A Devestating, Emotionally Draining Film With Award Worthy Performances",
            "content": "Going in, I knew two things: The Whale would probably make me shed some tears and that Brendan Fraser's performance was hailed as Oscar worthy. Both turned out to be true. This is a devastating movie that turns even the simplest of tasks into heart break. It's easy to call this emotionally manipulative and I could understand the feeling.The film is almost entirely focused on Charlie, a man so obese he can't stand without the support of a walker, his breathing is labored, and he can't even laugh without nearly having a heart attack. We are seeing a man very clearly at the end of his life who has eaten himself to death. As we learn more about him and supporting characters, it's easy to see how this happened to him as it has so many others who have become negligibly obese. He has tragedy in his past, has made mistakes that haunt him, and it's clear that he probably doesn't even really want to live anymore. What makes it more devastating is that he's a genuinely good guy who sees a lot of good in the world and loves people.The almost suffocating tragedy of the film makes it come across as something so dour, so purposefully written with overwhelming sadness that you can't help but feel that it's meant to pull at the heartstrings and tears of it's audience. But it's also very reflective and considerate. Fraser's Charlie is not unrealistic or a caricature. He feels genuinely human and it's easy to relate to him. This is primarily due to the fact that he's not crafted as a monster or a depressive. He's portrayed as someone who laughs, smiles, takes joy in aspects of life, who regrets, but most of all, loves. It's clear that it is love that put him on the road that is killing him and it is love that ultimately keeps him on this road, despite pleas to go to the hospital and save himself from his one friend, his caretaker played in what is almost as good a job as Fraser by Hong Chau. She has my vote for a best supporting actress nom.The film takes place entirely in one location and Aronofsky makes the most of it, whether it's the dramatic scenes wonderfully acted or the focus on things with deeper meaning to the Charlie. Even the lighting has wonderfully dramatic variation, from moody darkness to bright, hopeful light. This singular location requires much of it's audience, a tolerance for the kind of pain we see on screen. As mentioned, everything that might typically be taken for granted, that we might not notice, gets a spotlight here. Whether it's watching Charlie gut wrenchingly continue to devour what is killing him, like two large pizzas and a bucket of fried chicken, or watching him struggle to get into bed, it all feels like an invisible timer ticking down. It feels like every aspect of the location, every movement within, every sound, is done with purpose.Supporting performances beyond Chau, though limited, are also fantastic, namely Sadie Sink as Charlie's daughter. Her cruelty and anger are played up here, and it's easy to dismiss her as almost villainous, but she's also relatable. She no doubt does and says things that might anger us, but it's also easy to recognize where it comes from and what's driven her to become this person, and to also see who she really is underneath. Sadie, coming fresh off her head turning performance in season 4 of Stranger Things, once again shows just how powerful of an actress she can be and how, if given the chance, she will become a star in her own right. She manages to balance out the emotional range of her character, making it look easy and if her character doesn't break your heart as much as watching Charlie has, I don't know that you can consider yourself human.The Whale may be a movie that is too tough for people to get through. It's rarely ever joyful and moments of levity, if the exist, are brief. This is a story about a man who has missed a chance to pull back from the cliff he's brought himself too and we're on a journey of, essentially, watching him try to fulfill his final desires for those few people in his life that he loves. He's clearly a good man people want to save, but who we all realize that it would take a miracle to bring him back. I certainly cried a few times and never once felt manipulated to do so. If anything, this is a movie worth seeing for what is arguably Brendan Fraser's best performance ever.",

I always felt his acting chops were underutilized in some of the movies he did, but this was just...it's hard to come up with the words. This was the most emotionally dedicated performance I've seen from an actor in many, many years and showcases Fraser's immense and expansive acting abilities.I know he was rejected from Hollywood because of accusations he made against someone, and I find that shameful. To see him come back like this...in this role...the way he did makes my heart incredibly happy! Not many actors could pull of a roll like this, but Brendan Fraser managed it...and managed it beautifully!I am very in touch with people who are bullied and people who feel hopeless/helpless, so needless to say, this movie tore my heart and I left the theater in tears.Fraser's emotionally charged scenes with the actress who played his daughter...his vulnerability and willingness to go so far as to pay her to spend time with him was incredible. It was raw, open, and painful. Charlie possess something few people have these days...humanity. He made mistakes in his relationship with his daughter and was completely forgiving of her terrible behavior...even when she drugged him. The scenes with his helper and his ex-wife were explicitly and painfully executed. The pain that this family felt at the disintegration of their relationships was raw and it was real. Fraser's facial expressions and delivery of his lines only heightened the emotional pull.Over all, it was absolutely fantastic. Welcome back, Brendan Fraser!!",

            "review_title": "Brendan Fraser Swims Like A Whale In The Ocean Of Emotions",
            "content": "The Whale (2022) :\nMovie Review -Darren Aronofsky takes handsome hunk Brendan Fraser to portray a 600-pound obese man in his psychological emotional drama, \"The Whale\". Based on the 2012 play of the same name, The Whale is a family drama that is conquered by its premises, emotions, and characters. You don't have to just watch it, but feel it. We have been getting films about man/woman in trouble with some disease, obscenity, or something like that since the talkies began in the 1930s. First it was a woman or man with cancer, then it became a tumour, then an abnormal character, then a mute/deaf or blind person, and finally it became euthanasia. The Whale brings an overweight man's life to the screen, but unlike other emotional dramas, it does not try to emphasise his character. It keeps him like a normal man, who is stubborn and has so many faults in him, but still, you are carried away by him in the end.The Whale is about Charlie (Brendan Fraser), a reclusive Idaho-based English teacher who never leaves his apartment due to severe obesity. He has online teaching classes but keeps his webcam off to hide his morbidity. He is taken care of by his friend, Liz (Hong Chau), who is a nurse and his only friend at the moment. Liz tells him to visit a hospital for a severe risk of congestive heart failure, which Charlie refuses. Even when she tells him that he is soon going to die, Charlie refuses to go to the hospital. He is visited by Thomas (Ty Simpkins), who claims that he is a missionary and that reading the Bible might help Charlie in his last moments. Charlie then decides to reconnect with his estranged daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), by offering her the sum of $120, 000 from his bank account. Ellie starts visiting her father, but she is not a decent girl at all. Will Charlie manage to make her good, and will she accept her father, who left her at the age of 8?The Whale has a funny title for the kind of emotional and psychological narrative it has. You'll learn the reasons behind that in the film, though. The Whale proves how an essay could be used so well and so metaphorically. One more thing is that it doesn't try to be a film full of positivity and good people. We actually love such surroundings, but here they make us realise that not all problematic people have to be helpless and sympathetic. Charlie's homosexuality, Liz's abusive nature and words, Thomas' true colors, and Ellie's evil persona-these are the things that make you believe in the negativity that we have around us. You might hate the characters and the film for that (even I did), but to be honest, it's hard to always find good people around you. They must be cruel in order for us to feel reality. The screenplay is a little slow in the middle, and all those not-so-nice people make you lose interest for a while, but The Whale covers the loss in the climax.The handsome Brandan Fraser of The Mummy (1999) will always remain a part of my childhood memories, but his best performances came in \"Still Breathing\" and \"Crash,\" which aren't that popular. Now, he has won the most number of awards of any film in his career with \"The Whale,\" and I don't wonder why. It's not just about the prosthetics and physical challenges he might have faced or even the kind of dedication he showed, but it's about getting everything right in one of the most challenging portrayals ever. He is just superb in every scene, but then there is that conversation scene in the climax that takes it to another level. Keep the Best Actor trophies coming. Hong Chau is equally good in the best supporting role in this film. Sadie Sink is beautiful yet brutal and raw, Ty Simpkins is decent, and Samantha Marton shines brightly in that one single long scene.The Whale has a heart-touching background score and fantastic cinematography. The dialogues are vulgar and scurrilous as per the situations. I hated some of them for being overly abusive, but what to do if the anger and nature of the characters demanded that they be so? Charlie is a complex character; actually, all of them are. Everyone has some issues with their lives; nobody is just plain happy. Moreover, things like homosexuality, religious guilt, and marijuana make it more unfriendly, but that's what defined The Whale to its core. However weird that ending looked, it's just about your perspective on looking at it. Darren Aronofsky navigates this emotional ocean without disturbing the other sleeping fish. We all have brains, so it's obvious and easy to find out the mistakes, and it's necessary too, but then, we all have hearts too, which is where this film wins. Wetting a couple of tissues at the end of the film is always an engrossing experience, and The Whale gives you that, along with the best performance of Brandan Fraser's career so far.RATING - 7/10*",

            "content": "It is not at all surprising to see this movie opening with mention of an essay about Moby Dick, considering the title of the movie. A metaphor? Probably, you think, but it does not matter too much at this point. It isn't until at the end that you see the beauty of the marvelous closure, circling back to the opening moments, with something that is far more than just a metaphor.Those who would like to watch this movie but has reservations about its being too depressing need not worry. \"The whale\" is easy to watch, thanks to the good writing (originally a stage play) and the excellent acting. Throughout the movie, we see the 4 brilliant supporting actors' captivating interacting with the protagonist played by Brendan Fraser, whose achievement in this movie has already been recognized by two guild awards, Critics as well as Screen Actors (his peers, that is).While the story unfolds from these various scenes (within a duration of one week), I'll try a recap in a linear manner, just to set the background. It would appear that it started as a rather normal, happy family of three, Charlie (Brendan Fraser), Mary (Samantha Morton) and a little daughter Ellie (later portrayed by Sadie Sink as a teenager), until he left his family when he fell in love with a student Alan at the evening class he taught for mature students. Mary fought successfully for sole custody of Ellie who was 8 at the time. Both mother and daughter were understandably embittered. Later, Alan's suicide was so devastating to Charlie that he became a hopeless victim of obesity, with blood pressure hitting a more-than-alarming 238/134.Now, he continues his teaching career, but only on-line, with his own screen darkened so that the students only hear his voice. Then, at 17, Ellie comes back into his life, quite unexpectedly. Mary appears too, close to the end of the movie. The other two key members of the support cast are his nurse Liz (Hong Chau, with an Oscar nomination) and a young New Life Church member Thomas (Ty Simpsins).I'll introduce the four supports in the order they appear in the movie's one-week duration.Technically, the first one is Thomas Ty Simpsins's Thomas, who knocks on the door in a cold call to try to save Charlie's soul. His first appearance is very brief but he is back, again and again, appearing opposite not only Fraser, but also Chau and Sink. His best scene is with Sink, to which I'll come back. If the name Ty Simpsins is unfamiliar, as it most likely will be, he is the child star who shines acting opposite Robert Downey Jr in \"Iron Man 3\" (2013), as Harley Keener. Six years later in Avengers: End game (2019), he is noted by observant fans as the same character in his teens, in a massive gathering of MCU characters at beloved Tony Stark's funeral. Simpsins can act. While the character Thomas is not particularly challenging, he has his own back-story. Simpsins delivers.Next comes Hong Chau, a talented and versatile actor who, before her Oscar nomination this year, already had a Golden Globe nomination for \"Downsizing\" (2017). Her versatility is evidenced in her impressive performances, in both TV series and movies: Treme, Downsizing, Driveways, Watchman, The Whale, The Menu, Poker Face. Most notable among those is \"Driveways\" (2019), the last major work of the great Brian Dennehy. Back to \"The Whale\", Chau appears as Charlie's caring nurse, with all her emotions clearly written on her face during the scene he is choking from attacking a submarine sandwich too savagely. Gradually, we realize that she is also an old and loyal friend who supports him through thick and thin. In a way, she is also his conscience and protector, from intruders like Thomas and from his own daughter whose reappearance back in his life seems suspicious. Chau's Oscar nomination testifies to her riveting performance.I am most delighted to see Sink given such a meaty role, after watching her joining in Season 2 of \"Stranger Things\" as \"Max\" and, after 3 seasons, maturing to the point of occasionally outshining the lead Millie Bobby Brown (who is really good). As the embittered daughter Ellie, Sink is perfectly cast in \"The Whale\", a natural teenage rebel and described by her mother to Charlie as \"evil\" (which she isn't). In her scene alternatingly intimidating and enticing Thomas, Sink is pitch-perfect. While generally coming across as world-wearied and angry, Ellie has her tender moments which Sink delivers lovingly.To movie fans, two-time Oscar nominee veteran Samantha Morton should need no introduction. Here, she plays Mary the ex-wife, appearing late in the movie charged with aggressiveness. But then she also share some tender, reminiscent moments with Charlie, where they agree that her natural cynicism.perfectly balanced his natural positivity. Mary is not an attractive character. Morton is the sort of actor that can play anything you throw at her to perfection.At the end of the day, it is of course Fraser to watch, a real contender for Oscar. It is easy for the audience to be distracted by the Oscar-nominated makeup that turns him into a whatever-pounds enormous existence. Fraser's brilliance is to draw their attention back to the failure of a human being (Charlie's own assessment), a tortured soul. But he has not entirely lost hope, and his only hope is connection with Ellie through literature. That eventual connection defines this movie, through the heart-felt delivery of Fraser and Sink, in the culminating closure.",

He does give an award-winning performance -- and I hope he wins the Oscar -- but this film isn't for everyone. Like Joker, it's bleak, depressing, and lavishly sprinkled with heavy doses of darkness on top of darkness, misery for misery sake. And think about it: even if Charlie had found another lover who gave him a reason to live, would the lover have wanted to search for Charlie's weenie buried under all that fat? I think not.I would have given The Whale a higher rating if not for the bratty, self-pitying daughter who needs to grow up and get over herself.

            "content": "\"The Whale\" is a drama film directed by Darren Aronofsky (\"Requiem for a Dream\", \"The Wrestler\", \"Black Swan\") based on the play of the same name by Samuel D. Hunter. Starring Brendan Fraser, Hong Chau, and Sadie Sink, it is a harrowing, depressing, yet highly involving story of one man's attempt to fix most of the problems in his life.In New York state, the morbidly obese Charlie (Brendan Fraser) lives in a small, dingy apartment where he works as a college English professor teaching his students online via Zoom. Charlie's only proper friend is his nurse Liz (Hong Chau), who frequently urges him to seek medical attention but her pleas always fall on deaf ears due to his fear of being unable to afford health insurance. As his physical and mental state worsens, Charlie decides to reconnect with his estranged teenaged daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink), which proves difficult because the two have not interacted in over eight years. After some convincing, Ellie reluctantly agrees to spend time with her father, on the condition that he helps her write an essay for high school.It's common knowledge that the increasing rate of obesity is a serious issue in almost every country in the developed world. To discuss all the factors that contribute to this epidemic would take far too long but the best-known ones include a poor diet and/or lack of exercise. As a formerly overweight person myself, I can say first hand that it is not a pleasant experience to live this way, which is why I found it necessary to work towards becoming a healthier person. Here in Darren Aronofksy's film \"The Whale\", we are shown the devastating consequences of a man's obese lifestyle and how it has affected everyone around him.What surprised me the most about this film was how much effort was put into developing Charlie as a human being rather than a cheap caricature of an obese person. We are shown that beyond his large, shapely exterior is actually a highly articulate intellectual whose past choices and insecurities are what led him down this dark path of poor health. In spite of his condition, Charlie is still able to give competent online lectures about world literature, albeit, with his webcam turned off out of fear for what the students might think of his appearance. If it weren't for his sedentary lifestyle, Charlie could easily be seen lecturing at a university on a podium like a regular scholar, sharing his vast knowledge with anyone fortunate enough to listen.There are also many opportunities where the film could have made us want to straight up hate Charlie for all his misdeeds, but instead it takes a more balanced approach. For all the bad things he has done, we see that Charlie deeply regrets the pain he has inflicted on others and tries his best to correct it. However, when it comes to himself, he uses a much more self-destructive method. Almost as a twisted means of punishing himself, Charlie continues to binge-eat and reject all hospital care to the point where his physical state can only get worse. It is here where the tragic element of Charlie's character works in the film's favour, because if we never saw this sad side of his personality, it would be near impossible to feel any sympathy towards him at all.Returning after a five-year hiatus, Darren Aronofsky injects most of his directorial trademarks into nearly every frame. His creative use of close-ups at times where you may not expect it certainly helps emphasise the world in which Charlie lives. For example, in one scene set during an online class, the camera slowly zooms into the dark square in the middle of the screen where Charlie's icon is located, which is intended to represent a deep descent into the depths of Charlie's sub conscience and the mystery of how he must look to his students. This can also be viewed as like diving deep into the ocean where a whale may finds its home, which is as dark and mysterious as Charlie himself.Additionally, Aronofsky illustrates the terrible state of America's healthcare system by showing that it is essentially cheaper for Charlie to continue living an obese lifestyle at home rather than seeking external medical help. To show this, he uses muted colours to illuminate the inside of Charlie's apartment. Despite being shown to have adequate lighting, Charlie's living quarters never look bright or vibrant, except whenever the front door is opened. At no point do we ever feel like Charlie enjoys living here, but considering his physical condition, it's not like he has much other choice as to where else he can go aside from the hospital. I interpret this as Aronofsky showing the audience that no matter where Charlie ends up, he will always be in a dark place, both literally and metaphorically.After dropping off the radar for sometime, it is wonderful to see Brendan Fraser return to the big screen in what can only be described as the greatest performance he will likely ever give. There wasn't a single moment where I didn't feel utterly absorbed by the way Fraser played into everything about Charlie as a character, from his intelligent side to his remorseful nature. Fraser essentially depicts Charlie as an addict, not to drugs but to unhealthy foods. Scenes where he is conflicted over devouring an entire chocolate bar are conveyed with so much emotion that it is comparable to watching heroin addicts try to resist the urge to inject themselves with another shot. I honestly cannot imagine any other actor playing this role except for Fraser, and to say he simply did a great job feels like I'm underselling it.The film also benefits from its supporting cast, in particular Hong Chau as Liz and Sadie Sink as Ellie. Liz is shown to be Charlie's only real connection to the outside world, providing him with the food he requests as well as someone to talk to. Chau succeeds at making the audience feel sympathetic towards Liz for everything she puts up with to take care of her friend, but at the same time it is somewhat annoying to see that she is doing little else to stop him from potentially eating himself to death. Charlie's daughter Ellie harbours nothing but contempt for her father, which is understandable considering he was the one who abandoned her at a time when she needed him the most. Sadie Sink was a solid choice for this role, because she has proven to be good at playing characters who are conflicted over where her allegiance lies, and this one is no exception.In this world full of leering eyes and judgemental attitudes, a film like \"The Whale\" shows that while it's easy to judge someone by their appearance, it never hurts to show a little empathy from time to time. Everyone is fighting their own battles and not everyone is at a point where it looks like they'll win out in the end. Though this is far from a happy story, I believe that it is still necessary for us to properly understand somebody's pain from their perspective in order to become a better person as a result. For those reasons alone, this film leaves its desired impact.I rate it a solid 9/10.",

This draws you in to a film, maybe more than other people, let's you immerse yourself into it, and on that basis enjoy it more, because you understand what the author/writer is trying to do. I'm sure you can interpret the \"meaning\" in a few ways , but for me, it was the guilt of a father who felt he'd betrayed his daughter, and the daughter, who thought her dad didn't lover her which wasn't true! And which made her behaviour like it was. They found their common ground in the essays, and realised that they both understood each other, loved each other, and that things could of been different.. sadly too late.And yes I'm also saying that people who mark this film low .. sub 6 or 7 are unintelligent morons!",

            "content": "Brendan Fraser and Hong Chau deliver truly outstanding performances in the 2022 movie \"The Whale\". Their portrayal of complex and deeply troubled characters is nothing short of remarkable.Fraser plays Charlie, a 600-pound man who is trapped both physically and emotionally by his own body. Despite his immense size, Fraser manages to imbue Charlie with a sense of vulnerability and tenderness that makes him a deeply sympathetic character. Throughout the film, Fraser skillfully conveys the agony of Charlie's physical pain and the depths of his despair, while also infusing the character with moments of humor and warmth.Hong Chau, meanwhile, delivers an equally impressive performance as the young and somewhat mysterious Liz. Chau brings a quiet intensity to the role, playing Liz as someone who is simultaneously guarded and deeply compassionate. She has a natural chemistry with Fraser, and the two actors play off each other beautifully, creating a sense of intimacy and connection that is both heartbreaking and uplifting.Together, Fraser and Chau make \"The Whale\" an emotionally rich and profoundly moving film. Their performances are not only masterful but also deeply affecting, making the audience feel every moment of their characters' pain and struggle. They truly embody the essence of what it means to be an actor, and their work in this film is nothing short of extraordinary.In short, Brendan Fraser and Hong Chau are both incredible in \"The Whale\". Their performances are powerful, nuanced, and deeply moving, and they make the film an unforgettable cinematic experience. Anyone who loves great acting and compelling storytelling will not want to miss this masterpiece.",

            "content": "First off, credit where it's fittingly due.. I DID NOT see Brendan Fraser in this film. I could only see a severely obese man named Charlie. What a comeback performance! Gut-wrenching, heartfelt, and so internally painful. The man deserves all the accolades he's getting (and more!). The Whale also features some of the best prosthetic work you'll see, at least in recent times. Playwright Samuel D. Hunter pens a script that instantly sucks you into the reclusive world of Charlie, an online English tutor with a wrecked personal life. Not only does the Academy ratio catch your eye from the very first shot (of an ongoing online class), but it also metaphorically shrinks the world of Charlie into something more confined.Charlie's obesity struggles are poignantly portrayed, and director Darren Aronofsky paints his surroundings in dark tones, accentuated by the non-stop rains, unkempt bedrooms, and carb-saturated cabinets. The only person who honestly cares for Charlie is Liz (a terrific Hong Chau), and while she repeatedly tells him to secure better treatment, Charlie has no absolutely no such intention. The reason for this is elaborated over the week's proceedings, with his estranged daughter and wife showing up at his place in hauntingly dramatic scenes. The daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink) occupies a more prominent presence, visiting him with motives that slowly get revealed. Samantha Morton plays the wife, and she delivers a memorable performance in those few scenes.The eating disorder scenes, clearly meant to turn you off, make you want to stay off that pepperoni pizza for a while. But at the core, it's also upsetting as hell, when you cannot help but think whether Charlie will drop dead any second. The constant wheezing and struggle to get off the couch are heavily punctuated by Rob Simonsen's evocative score - only Charlie's eyes remain optimistic throughout. The themes of guilt, loss, and religion are brought to the forefront, and Aronofsky as expected, is instrumental in executing the misery of it all to disconcerting effect. From a storytelling standpoint, I did wish the relationship between Charlie and his dead lover was charted out better, especially since that's pinned as the root cause for the former's suffering. The Whale will simultaneously leave you dismayed and relieved by its climax, even though it's predictable.",

            "content": "I always liked Brendan Fraser, and always thought he was not getting the recognition he deserved for his talent. It was probably due to the ease in which he seemed to carry his roles, and the fact he never looked like he was taking himself seriously (or anything else). In fact, for me that was his most endearing quality. Most of all I missed his lighthearted action comedies and I always thought there was a sharp brain behind all his charm. So obviously I had to check this movie out:You can check me out on this page - I don't rate movies 10 stars often. Even 9 stars don't come so easily from me, even though I mainly go to movies I believe I'm going to like, and I do research them before I decide to watch any. The reason I rated this movie 10 stars is because for me it's a perfect combination of all the components of movie making. The acting is superb, and Brendan Fraser is topping the list with the performance of his life. But none in this movie is missing a single note they're all like a well-trained orchestra. Sadie Sink is amazing as the daughter who can't forget or forgive. Hong Chau is impressive as the nurse who tries to atone for the sins of her father. And I could go on without a single bad word.But that doesn't sum up this movie. The camera works wonders, Matthew Libatique, Aronofsky's regular cinematographer deserves the credit in this case. The lighting is simply mesmerizing, think about the suffocating feel you get from the dark claustrophobic house in which this movie takes place - almost theatrical, maintaining the three unities, almost to the letter. Think about how every outdoor shot is there just so the inside of the house feels more tomb like. And think about the script or more precisely - the plot. A story about an obsessive search for redemption that leads to destruction as part of the redemption Charlie is so desperately looking for and about the weird role religion plays in this search for redemption. In fact, it's here only so we can see that it's not the road to redemption. It's here just so we can see what road Charlie chooses, when he could've taken the religious road.One more point - think about Moby Dick, think about Ahab's final scene and think about the reason this movie got this name. It's not just because of Charlie's size.I don't often find such a perfect combination of what I think should make a movie, I found it all in this movie. It wasn't an easy watch, but it was worth every single second.",

            "content": "Actor showcases can come in many forms, but, none as basic as a filmed play. Even more so when it's all staged on one set as in Darren Aronofsky's THE WHALE (adapted by Samuel D. Hunter himself).Charlie (Brendan Fraser) is a teacher who has essentially given up on living a productive life. He's shut himself off inside a dank and cluttered Idaho apartment and eaten himself into morbid obesity. He teaches an online writing course and has all his food delivered. Conscious of his appearance, he doesn't allow his students or delivery man to see him. His only friend is a nurse, Liz (Hong Chau) who tries her best to check on his health, but it's more of a tough-love relationship. Charlie is bitterly divorced and estranged from his wife (Samantha Morton) and daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink). The only other visitor is Thomas (Ty Simpkins), a Missionary who takes it upon himself to \"save\" Charlie with God.Aronofsky is known for his visuals, so it is interesting that he would take on a project where those powers are so minimized. Matthew Libatique frames his cinematography in the classic 1:33 aspect ratio to emphasize the claustrophobic nature of Charlie's existence. He gets up from the couch only a couple of times, and Aronofsky gives full prominence to the convincing latex prosthetics that Adrien Morot and his team created.Hunter's screenplay isn't truly interested in Charlie's obesity per se. It's treated more as a symptom of his mental state than as the cause. Melville's Moby Dick is cited as a symbol of how the characters interact (and every high school English student knows what the alternate title of the novel is, of course). It's a dark and depressing tale, which does fit the Aronofsky mold. Rob Simonsen's score wouldn't be out of place in a Blumhouse horror film. It would all be an unbearable wallow if it were not for Fraser.Despite the funereal atmosphere, the actor manages to make Charlie fully human. He gives the sense that he really was a functioning man at one point. There is a glimmer of life somewhere deep inside. A sparkle in his eyes when something touches his soul. It's a remarkable performance. Chau brings a few moments of dark humor to the proceedings and Sink and Simpkins do what they can with highly stagy roles; even the usually exemplary Morton gets saddled with a thankless ex-wife part. In Aronofsky's vision there truly can be only room for Fraser to shine, and he certainly does; Whether that is enough will be up to the individual viewer.",

            "content": "There is so much here to \"unpack\".Sorry, this movie is not a 10, it is not a \"masterpiece\". It is not about a morbidly obese guy trying to make a change in his life. If you are looking for those things, you will be disappointed.Brendan Frasier plays Charley, a morbidly obese college instructor who teaches college English classes online. He covers his camera so the kids don't see what he looks like. He is in extremely bad shape, but will not go to see expensive doctors. He has one friend, Liz, who takes care of him and likely keeps him alive. But she also feeds him terrible food as she feels sorry for him.His health is rapidly deteriorating, and the movie is like a countdown to his end. In the meantime, we discover he was always heavy, but went way over the top once his gay lover killed himself.A daughter he hasn't seen in years comes back into his life, via an awkward payment and homework \"help\" plan, as well as his ex-wife, and a missionary, and the sparks between all parties fly. There is plenty of good dialog and some truly moving moments. Great acting from all parties, particularly Frasier.What loses the movie for me is the script. Not only do the characters act in ways that make no sense, the REASONS behind their actions are preposterous.Second, the entire movie has a big, FAT thread of anti-Christianity running through it. To the point of absurdity. Everyone's parents seem to be obnoxious born-agains that absolutely ruin their kids' lives. The movie takes cheap shots at the Bible, including the dusty old premise of \"how could a God do this\" and, \"I can't believe a God would populate the world and then send almost everyone to Hell\". The only time Charlie gets angry in the whole film is when he is encouraged by the missionary to think about these concepts, and the idea of being saved.As the movie goes on, the worst person in this little ensemble is elevated by Charlie as \"amazing\", his daughter, who is a sociopath. Charlie's ex wife is the ONLY character that makes sense. She is, with good reason, bitter that Charlie left her for another man. She is the only one that thinks her daughter is evil, which, sorry to say, she freaking is. Lots of kids are a bitter because a parent walked out. But this kid is a freak. The mom mentions horrific things she has done in school. She posts awful pictures of her dad online, and has done the same to her mom. We are supposed to accept the outrageous idea that she \"helped\" the missionary by reintroducing him to pot, recording his heartfelt comments about his life, and then sending awful pictures and personal thoughts to his parents--somehow she was so brilliant in doing that knowing that the parents would forgive him and want him to come home. Charlie babbles on through his hacking about this, so it must be so.And let's talk about this missionary, Thomas. He's a white Christian, of course. The movie is \"brave\" for crapping on Christians, but not brave enough to make the character a black Baptist, or a soul-searching re-incarnationist, or heaven forbid, a Muslim. The only time Charlie gets truly passionate, beyond him going on and on how \"amazing\" his daughter is, is when he angrily assaults Thomas about gay sex to \"gross him out\" and expose his hypocrisy.Charlie himself makes no sense. He is an enormously smart, kind, sweet person who genuinely cares about others. He truly loves his daughter with his whole heart. (One might believe he refuses to see her sociopathy because of how much he misses her, but the movie never presents that possibility). But how could a guy like that leave his family, because of \"love\"? He is never portrayed as selfish or bad in any other way. The movie may have done something to show his true character--beyond his demeaning of Thomas--but we don't get that. But he sure does love that 8th grade essay of his daughter!The cheap Christian-bashing is only upstaged by the ending, when apparently Charlie reaches his end. Is his spirit pulled to heaven, even against his belief system? What's with all the lights, even on his daughter? And her sudden \"Daddy\" exclamation....Of course, this \"brave\" movie isn't brave enough to tell us that, it just ends.What I find so absolutely true is that if you have a movie with some good acting in it, a few good speeches, some scenes to make people come to tears, and some maudlin music, people will rate it a 10, without even thinking about it.",

So sad and horrifying was Brendan Fraser's Charlie, particularly when attempting to raise his six hundred pounds from a chair, or walk, or shower, or use his toilet. Despite my personal discomfort with the character, the picture has much to say about our society, and says it excellently. Whether or not the viewer has suffered the kind of physical or emotional distress suffered by Charlie, there is much to relate to, much about which to say 'Yes, I know'.Charlie is a complex man. He fathered a child whom he left when she was eight. He had a gay love affair with a young man whose death has contributed mightily to Charlie's obesity. Charlie has secrets that he has kept from both family and friends, some of which, during the course of his week, will test those relationships. Early on we are told that Charlie is in need of hospitalization or we will die. And when Charlie turns down that treatment (several times) we realize that for this film a happy ending is not in the cards. And, more important, Charlie knows it.And knowing his time is limited Charlie spends much of his week looking back on his life, trying to come to terms with the bad he has done, the losses he has suffered. Looking, searching for something of value that he might have contributed to this world. And it is during this week that he is visited by the wife and child he abandoned, the sister of the young man he loved, and a young man - like Charlie's dead lover - who has joined a Christian Cult and claims to have the life-answers for Charlie.Brendan Fraser is extraordinary as Charlie. The doleful eyes, the straining of his body to move, the stress bottled-up and ready to combust. As his daughter, Sadie Sink is hateful and, as such, perfect. She is the daughter from hell, the character for whom nothing is too hurtful to be voiced. Samantha Morton as her mother - and Charlie's ex - is wonderful as a woman struggling between hate for this man who deserted her, and pity for his current state. Equally important is that the viewer easily believes that their daughter is, in fact, the offspring that the two of them have produced.I saw the film in order to view Fraser's (likely) Award Winning Performance. But it was the film as a whole that grabbed me, that held me in its grip. Though, again, easy it was not.",

This film took me through many emotions, it made me feel for every character, and brought me both anger and sadness as well as love.Charlie is such a strong person, the way he never showed hate to anyone and remained positive even when you could clearly see he was struggling. The love he had for his daughter, friend, partner and ex. The love he had for random people, whether it be because he wanted them to expand their talents, or to show them a different view of life and beliefs.This is by far one of the greatest films I have seen, and there aren't many. I mean there are great movies through comedy, romance etc. But nothing like this. This film depicts the love and loss of a partner, the troubles of a broken family, the challenges of living as an obese person, a queer person, a person who's beliefs don't make room for who they are as a person. It follows the story of not just Charlie, but also; Ellie and her struggles, Liz and her ability to continue to love someone who would remind her of her brother and both their ED struggles. A woman who is trying to understand where she went wrong with raising a daughter, and a boy who's beliefs, troubles and incidents led him to meet such an incredible person who (hopefully) taught him that not everyone can be helped by god.This movie is deep, and is not for everyone but I highly recommend watching it.

After his \"leading man\" good looks faded Hollywood threw him away, because that's what Hollywood does. I watched this because I liked every actor in it, even the guy who played the pizza delivery guy. As a fan of \"Stranger Things,\" I was excited to see Sadie Sink, but her character is just awful...but played well by Sadie.The story had a lot of potential, but sort of got confusing about the Charlie character and his internal feeling about his daughter. It may have translated well in the written word, but doesn't make it all the way in the movie. I wasn't entertained by the story, nothing done was redemptive, except maybe the daughter character but it wasn't with the tone of the rest of the movie. The backstory about the relationship between Charlie and his X wife isn't fleshed out, (but Samatha Morton breathed life into an otherwise earful character) the relationship between Charlie and his dead ex isn't fully fleshed out although we got to see the acting chops of Hong Chau who carried the character into interesting territory (the story did not.)\nSadie Sink's character is just terrible. She clearly did the best she could with mushy materiel. I didn't get why the father kept gushing over her, she was awful to him and everyone else. She continued to be a terrible, pissy teen, and I think at that age I general, she may have hit the mail on the head but it didn't cause the story to merge like I wanted it to. The story I like 7 different stories that don't quite fit together nicely or at all. The missionary character could have been left completely out and the pizza delivery guy could have been explored with far more interest.Bottom line, watch this movie, make your own conclusion as that others really had an emotional response to it.

Basically showing his character trying to redeem himself for previous mistakes before the inevitable finally catches up with him. I didn't like the overall message of the movie though, and wasn't sure about some of the grosser scenes, or how to take the arc of his daughter. Who was way too much of an annoying brat throughout.Still, its all set in one flat and showcases great acting all round if that's your thing, and the ending is as emotional as you'd imagine.",

            "review_title": "An Ugly Thing with Flecks of Gold: My interpretation",
            "content": "First off, I'll address the quality of the acting: as many have already said, the quality of acting in this film is phenomenal. I am of the camp that the quality of the acting greatly exceeds the story or material.The Whale is an ugly story, a diorama of self-destruction presented in claustrophobic and relentlessly uncomfortable form. In short, it is about a man who after suffering great personal loss has eaten himself to death. If you have seen TLC's My 600 lb Life, you are familiar with the source material. The Whale is largely a dark two-hour drama version of My 600 lb Life, except there is no hope of a happy ending.As someone who has a long history of dealing with health anxiety, as well as having personally known multiple morbidly-obese individuals who have died from their lifestyles, this movie was extremely personal and very uncomfortable for me. Many scenes are disturbingly and disgustingly voyeuristic in their showing of the main character's habits, labored breathing, and sweaty, failing body. In fact, the film opens with him masturbating and suffering a health emergency from the strain. The Whale is wholly unapologetic and unsympathetic in this regard, and many times feels akin to a slasher film in its fleshy, disgusting indulgence.The whale-ish accoutrements of the film are so on the nose that they are almost to be ignored. I adore Moby Dick, it is one of my favorite books, and was highly interested in how its themes might be woven into the movie. They are, but it is rather shallow in its presentation. The main character is a whale, ha ha. The essay written by the main character's daughter characterizing the whale description chapters of Moby Dick as simply distractions from the sad story are where the meat is. Clearly, the disgusting voyeuristic portions of The Whale are viewed as distracting by the director, and the real point of the story lies beneath. Indulgent and disgusting, but okay. There are also tacked on themes of authenticity, so surface level as to largely be ignored.What we see inside of this oily and multi-layered tale that takes place wholly inside a disgusting apartment is one of broad human tragedy. I ultimately decided that the real point of the story is one of community. The theme that comes up over and over is one of people relying on one single point of support, and failing from that.The enabling caretaker nurse who says that only she can save the main character, even as she has been killing him with her enabling of his habits.The main character himself, who was unable to save his boyfriend from suicide after estrangement from his family; telling his boyfriend that the boyfriend does not need God, he only needs their relationship.The missionary who tells the main character that he doesn't need anyone, only God.The mother who is drinking herself into ruin, who blames the dissolution of her family and rebellion of her daughter on the MCs faults.The only happy ending we have in the whole movie is informed, as the missionary boy who ran away after stealing money from his mission. After being ratted out by the MC's daughter, he is forgiven by his family and church, and welcomed with open arms back into his community. He has all of the elements wrapped together that the other characters only have in pieces: friendship, family, community, spirituality. I think ultimately this is the point of the movie, or at least the one I was able to glean after thinking it over for a few days. Every single main character in the film is a tragic one. Supporting cast members only show up either to gawk, or to be a warm source of community support.Nobody is an island, everyone needs a community of support and love, and substance abuse cannot fill the gaps left in this. To me, this is the story that was left unstated and implied. It is difficult to take the fragments of this gestalt from the dense and unpleasant presentation, but it is of course masterfully acted and presented.I do not like the indulgent nature of the film, and find it to be unnecessarily ugly. If the director actually did have good intentions with the direction of the film, then the ugliness that constitutes 80% of the screen time is as the film's essay says: a mere distraction.",

            "content": "Hey, Streamers! I hope you had a good holiday and you're ready for some more awards hopefuls. I was able to get to a theater to catch The Whale. I've been hearing a lot about an awards-worthy performance and comeback from everyone's favorite man from Encino, Brendan Fraser. Here's whether the performance and the movie around it live up to the hype. (Spoiler Alert: It doesn't)Darren Aronofsky (Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream) directed the The Whale, which is based on a play by the same person who wrote the screenplay, Samuel D. Hunter. Brendan Fraser plays Charlie, a 600-pound man who is attempting to reconnect with his estranged daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), in his final week of life. Charlie has one friend, Liz (Hong Chau), who provides some care for him but she also enables his worst impulses at times. Other characters pop in and out of Charlie's cloistered apartment as he fumbles through teaching an online writing course while binge-eating himself to death. A barrel of laughs ensues, he said sarcastically.The Whale desperately wants to be a tearjerker. Charlie is set up as a tragic figure, and the movie tells the audience that Charlie knocking on deaths door. Everything about this character says pity this man. The problem is that the movie is so overwrought that it leads towards the comical. The worst offense is the poor makeup job and fat suit that Brendan Fraser is encased it. On top of that, Brendan Fraser is doing the absolute most - and not in a good way - with his performance. He desperately wants that Oscar with the way he screams and cries throughout this melodramatic bore. Also, there is a bad performance by Sadie Sink as the angsty teenager. She is the worst person in the world, and Sink does nothing to humanize her. Both Charlie and Ellie become caricatures, which is ultimately very tiresome and off-putting.There really isn't much else to The Whale. It is a movie that is very obviously based on a play since it is stuck in one location and characters come in and out of the scene. This material may work better on the stage than on the big screen, but the screenplay is pretty bad. The obvious metaphor with Moby Dick, which Charlie references constantly throughout, is so annoying that if you are not rolling your eyes by the end then you are better than me.The one saving grace is that Hong Chau shows up every now and then and does her best to bring some real life to the film. In the scenes with Chau and Fraser, there is good chemistry, and there is a glimpse of the heartfelt and sensitive film that could have been.Ultimately, The Whale is extremely melodramatic. Fraser goes for every Oscar clip he can and only lands a few when Chau is around. The fat suit is off-putting and Sadie Sink is bad throughout the movie. There is a small speck of a decent idea here, but not enough to make a trip to the theater worthwhile. Stream if bored, at best. One popped kernel.",

I quit cigarettes, hard drinking and cocaine, but escaping obesity was by far the hardest struggle of my life, and keeping my weight in the lower end of overweight is a constant life struggle.This film is quite simply a masterpiece, and Brenda Fraser absolutely stunned me with his portrayal. I am not ashamed to admit that I broke down with chest heaving crying at this movie. For anyone who has battled the addiction of food in response to trauma, this movie resonates in a deep level.It took me at least 30 mins to emotionally recover from this movie, such was the impact it had.For those viewing it who have never battled with additiction, let this masterpiece be a window into a traumatic world.Fraser fully deserves an Oscar for this portrayal.

He gives a phenomenal performance as Charlie that shows the grief, pain and yet the positivity of his morbidly obese character that makes him more complex. Hong Chau is also terrific as the nurse Liz. She gives a performance that illustrates the struggle and pain of someone watching their friend self-destruct.I love the use of a 4:3 aspect ratio to really capture the claustrophobic nature of the apartment and to illustrate the obesity as Charlie takes much of the screen. The music score by Rob Simonsen is great and the makeup for the fat suit is stunning. This movie isn't for everyone as it is depressing and quite melodramatic. It also has some issues in the writing and story, especially considering one character who appears throughout but didn't add much to the plot in the end. Nevertheless, the movie is a hauntingly and heartbreakingly beautiful experience.",

            "content": "There is something that doesn't quite hit the mark in THE WHALE, but it is still a worthwhile movie to watch. Charlie, a reclusive English teacher suffering from severe obesity, attempts to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter in a desperate bid for redemption. With his time running out and his health failing, Charlie must fight his way through his self-imposed isolation and the walls he's built up around him to find the courage to open up to his daughter and to find a way to make amends.Brendan Fraser, who plays Charlie, does an incredible job of conveying the complex emotions and struggles of being overweight. His performance is convincing and heartbreaking as he battles his physical limitations while attempting to build a bridge between himself and his daughter. Fraser's portrayal of Charlie is believable, allowing us to empathise with him despite his flaws.THE WHALE also features impressive performances from young actor Sadie Sink (Charlie's daughter, Ellie) and Hong Chau (Liz, Charlie's best and only friend). Sink does an excellent job of portraying the tension between Ellie and her father, as well as conveying the emotions of an adolescent trying to cope with an absent parent. Chau is also excellent in her role, providing much-needed comedic relief while still being able to convey genuine emotion and concern for Charlie.THE WHALE occurs almost entirely in Charlie's apartment. This setting allows the film to focus on the personal drama between Charlie and Ellie and provides a claustrophobic atmosphere that enhances the sense of desperation and isolation. Director Darren Aronofsky uses this limited space to significant effect, creating an intimate portrait of two people struggling with their issues while trying to bridge the gap between them.The cinematography in THE WHALE is also noteworthy. The camera often lingers on Fraser's face or body for extended periods, allowing us to fully appreciate the physical and emotional toll that Charlie's condition has taken on him.Unfortunately, THE WHALE suffers a few shortcomings that prevent it from being genuinely great. The pacing is sometimes slow, with some scenes dragging on longer than necessary. The film also lacks much plot development or character growth, leaving some characters feeling one-dimensional and underdeveloped. It also seems, at times, to have the feel of a stage production rather than a fully-fledged cinematic experience.Despite these issues, THE WHALE is an emotionally resonant film worth watching for its performances alone. It may not be perfect, but it is a thought-provoking and poignant film that will leave you with much to ponder.",

Before that, it was quite a riveting story about our characters reconciling with each other and facing their own demons. But soon after, comes a disturbing scene where Charlie binge eats all of his stack of junk food. What I figured is that the film can't quite escape its thin knowledge of obesity. It can't quite achieve its intended effect without one or two of these uncomfortable sceneries.What I also figured, pretty early on, is that the film is based on a play. The characteristics are thoroughly clear, from the single location setting to the direction of Darren Aronofsky, to how each line of dialogue follows one another so precisely. The conversations here never strive to be authentic, but rather transparently dramatic.The title of this film is \"The Whale,\" which is quite obviously a metaphor. Poems and essays are repetitively recited all through, discussing and dissecting this subject of a \"whale.\" And thus it makes this one of the least subtle metaphors I've seen on film.Once again, nothing is to be faulted except for the writing, which puts our characters, who all are broken people, in paper-thin scenarios and attempts to fix them with heavy-handed literature. Our actors carry this one all the way.",

With all the takeaways he eats and the cost of living crisis, I wonder how he has saved that much money.Ellie is not perfect in any way at all, she is a bully at school and comes across like a spoilt brat at home. The common thread with her, is to refuse everything her dad asks but ten seconds later she changes her mind and listens to him.The ending is so melodramatic that it could quite easily belong in a Bollywood movie.This is not the best movie ever made like people are claiming, it doesn't even come close to The Shawshank Redemption, which is way more moving and uplifting and actually has a point.Overall I think it should really have been left as a play, it's a bit too ambitious for a movie but I wouldn't begrudge BF if he wins an Oscar from it.",

But the whale is very significant as it was the original title of Moby Dick when first published in london and the fact that Ishmael shared a bed with another man before setting sail on the whaling boat is more significant than you realise the better biblical metaphors continue throughout the plot with questions of morality and realisation that what's in the foreground is purely a camouflage for what's really happening in the background .The themes here are about loss , death , love of a father for his daughter , divorce , infidelity, parental infighting over paternal access , friendship , family , fulfilment , hate and most of all hurtActing was top notch praise goes to all three main characters. Hong chau was amazing , Sadie Sink outstanding and Brendan Fraser in the role of his acting career .Probably the most powerful ending I have ever witnessed to a filmOutstanding dramaPad. A 10/10.",

It's worth mentioning in advance that I was waiting to see this movie for months and had very high expectations which I think is a disadvantage to any film.All in all I think I agree with most of the people who said something along the lines of \"Fraser is fantastic, the film is a bit lacklustre\". It is a GOOD film. Moving, interesting, engaging. Can't really find a real fault in it. It's just missing that little something that makes it exceptionally great.But what cannot be denied is that Brendan Fraser delivered the performance of the century. After just a few minutes I felt like crying. Nothing much has happened yet, he just... existed on the screen. And already he was magnificent. With all the masking, fat suit, cramped space, very few other characters to interact with he had such a limited toolkit at his disposal, and still, he did something breathtaking. He just morphed into this character and lived it in front of our eyes, uncovered, unafraid. It was awesome in the original meaning of the word.I really hope that this was not just a final shine, that he will finally get lots of roles worthy of his talent. I have to admit that I just love George of the Jungle with all its silliness, and quite liked The Mummy. But I was always more fond of Fraser's more obscure, \"smaller\" movies, like School Ties and especially With Honors, where he could show more of his talent and less of his abs. So here's to hoping to see him more and more often, in movies with challenging and complex characters.",

For a movie who praise so much at the core of the story to be honest (also used repetitive as an add filter for their Trojan horse story) only at the end have a moment of honesty. I couldn't believe Fraser nor the motives for Charlie. He was good but not that good. Doesn't deserve an Oscar for this, in my opinion. Sandler did a few years ago. Sadly not Fraser.

The thing I've found with movies based on plays - at least the good ones - is that they have exquisite dialogue. 'The Whale' was no exception.I have to give some love to Brendan Fraser. I always thought of him as the prototypical \"movie star\". A guy who could lead a movie and carry it with charm and charisma and good looks, but who would never be in contention come awards season. Boy, did he prove me wrong.He's incredible in this film. The transformation is one thing, but what really blew me away was the character he created. The emotions this man has to convey in this movie cover the full spectrum. And the toughest thing is that he often has to portray them at the same time. He has to have his soul crushed into a thousand pieces and in the same moment just be happy that his daughter is in his presence. It's heart-breaking to watch, but it's also mesmerising to see it portrayed so well.There are so many great moments in this film it can be hard to appreciate them all on the first watch. I suspect a second viewing would give an entirely new perspective again. On first watch though it was pretty amazing and definitely one of the best 2023 Oscar season has to offer. 9.5/10.",

Financial security or saving your family the awful grief of seeing you, a loved one, slowly commit suicide?Anyway, a powerful film, well written with three outstanding performances from Fraser, Samantha Horton and Hong Chau.",

            "content": "Wow. I saw \"The Whale\" in theaters yesterday, and what a ride. It's rumored to be one of Brendan Fraser's best projects to date, and I can see why. The buzz surrounding this one has been great, and it's well deserved, IMO.The movie is absolutely worth watching. However, it's very intense throughout. Brendan Fraser's character (Charlie) struggles with compulsive eating. As a result, Charlie has gained a tremendous amount of weight over the last few years. When we meet him in his apartment, we quickly learn that he is housebound due to his size, and going downhill. More than that, he has battled obesity for years, and now faces certain death due to untreated congestive heart failure.That said, the movie is not actually about Charlie's weight. Numbers are never mentioned, though we do see adaptations Charlie is using: a walker, a handle above his bed, etc. It's really about 'the whale' his root problem has ballooned into: compulsive food addiction. Viewers can very obviously see he is a man of size, but Charlie is not concerned with his health. Instead, we see him use food as comfort. When it stops comforting him, he uses it to cause himself more physical and mental pain, going on extreme binges. He is a man full of self-loathing, and on some level, he knows his habits are \"disgusting\". Yet, Charlie is, sadly, past the point of return.Having pushed almost everyone in his life away as he put on more weight, Charlie is a lonely and reclusive character. Sadie Sink gives an incredible performance as his daughter, whom he attempts to connect with before his death. (Her breakout character on \"Stranger Things\" is not my favorite, but I do think she's given one of the most complex character arcs as Max.)Now. The plot of \"The Whale\" itself is beautiful. It is raw, and visceral all the way around. Charlie is a very good, intelligent person who has simply given up on himself. I found the movie to have a very somber tone overall, but Charlie is earnest. He intends to help others, and evoke true honesty from them in the process. The last bit of his life journey takes place over the course of a week, and his increasing desperation to just get on with dying, is plain. He wants so badly for his daughter to have a better life, and regrets the fact that he left her, after divorcing her mom. (I won't spoil the plot further.) Charlie hates himself for eating so much, truly HATES what he's become. And in fact, he's eaten himself to this state, so what's two large pizzas for dinner? A package of candy, tortilla chips, donuts...goddammit, why can't he just kill himself with food already???I try to be an open-minded and reasonable person, especially when it comes to movies. But \"The Whale\" is really a tough watch, in parts. It's 'just a movie', but it's really so painful to watch Charlie's binges get worse by the week's end...I had to close my eyes and/or look away at times. It's these moments of severe binging that are so intense...I actually found them grotesque and slightly disturbing, honestly. It's unfair, but that's the reason I'm rating as I am.However, \"The Whale\" is a stark depiction of addiction, and all the ugliness and struggle that accompany it (really any kind of it).Did I mention Charlie is an accomplished teacher? Melville's \"Moby Dick\" plays a meaningful role in this movie, which is very apropos.",

This film has been picked up on the hype train by Brendan Frasers triumphant return and his brilliant performance however for me I was most excited to see a new Darren Aronofsky film. I enjoy how his films make us think about the world around us and the bleak reality of certain situations. My personal favourite film of his is without a doubt requiem for a dream, it's a film that although you want to watch again you can't always bring yourself to do it because of how bleak it leaves you feeling in the end. I didn't get that with this film, Brendan Fraser plays a morbidly obese man called Charlie who we watch as he pieces his past together as people come and go from his apartment. Fraser himself is the best thing about this film, he makes you really care about Charlie and has this infectious positivity about him. That being said the rest of the film wasn't nearly as engaging for me, I felt the themes of homosexuality vs religious weren't very unique or conveyed in a unique way and I felt the drama at times bordered on the melodramatic. I think this is one more for the actors amongst us than the directors/ironically writers.",

Not only is he believable in his role as a morbidly obese homosexual, but if anything the film needs more of him in and less focus on the auxiliary cast who are mediocre at best in both acting and intrigue.To be brief, the films problems are numerous- for one, its uninteresting. Not enough happens throughout the course of the movie and the characters feel like they are missing an arc. Secondly, I failed to root for any of them. The daughter is an irredeemable mess, and Charlie is both physically and mentally immovable from his current predicament. I didn't have enough reason to be invested or care about the outcome once the credits began to roll. The movie isn't that long, but it really felt like the last third dragged itself over the finish.To conclude, watch this movie if you really really like Brendan Fraser, but don't bother watching it if you actually want to see a good film.",

            "content": "The first thing you notice is the 4:3 aspect ratio. I honestly didn't expect it and have to say that it fits perfectly. Brendan Fraser's Charlie seems even larger and more obese. The ceilings seemed that they were quite high but shrank when he strenuously stood up from his couch. Fraser's height of almost 1,9m definitely helped, because other actors looked tiny compared to him. Not to forget the admirable work of Adrien Morot who created the 600lb costume, which filled most of the screen on the nowadays not so often used aspect ratio.I liked the lighting. It was dim and melancholic. Just the kind I'd imagine a person who's locked up in his apartment all the time would have. The feeling of imprisonment was emphasized through the whole movie - most of it took place in Charlies living room.The acting was top class and induced goosebumps. Even though I sometimes felt that the screenplay was a little too much at some points, it didn't take away from the quality of all performances. In the first half the music was not remarkable but in the second half promoted anxiety and sadness. Some scenes were hard to watch - probably because they depicted the reality of things so accurately.The Whale touches topics such as addiction, loss, gluttony, self-destruction, faith, honesty, beauty of art, shame, and sexuality. That is quite a lot for one movie, and I felt drained at the end. However, I believe that Darren Aronofsky achieved what I value most about his work - to arouse all kinds of feelings and emotions.

            "review_title": "Too Majestic to Fit the Screens",
            "content": "This review is for those who are serious in learning the symbols, meaning and cinematic beauties of this workThere are a lot of things that needs to be mentioned and I don't know where to begin!1. Aronofsky very cleverly decided to take the movie in 4:3, it is a very important indication. It is trying to capture Brendan Fraser in his giant appearance in the smallest medium (aspect ratio) possible, it is trying to send a message to us: This man is far too big (read majestic) to fit into the limits of cinema (read the world)!2. The color palette of the movie is of course the muted tones and shades of blue/gray to convey a sense of dullness and sadness to the abysmal situation the main character is in.3. The movie smartly avoids getting tangles up in flashbacks and the background story, it was a wise decision since the background story leading to the present situation isn't in particular genuine and it is somewhat trite and repetitive even. I won't say what it was to keep this spoiler-free.4. The rooms at the back of the house, connected by a narrow corridor to the living room are the \"lair of the whale\", somewhere tiny and disgusting, they represent the most intimate parts of Charlie's life, where he shamefully goes to bed and washes himself, where he gets completely isolated from the rest of the world, disconnected. At the beginning when the daughter enters the play (I say play because it is more like watching a play than a movie, the same feeling I had when watching the amazing masterpiece (Father)), she is intimated to go wander around the house, as if a magical curtain forbids her to get close to the father who has abandoned her. However as the plot develops, the girl ventures into the lair, and a certain room gets unlocked by another character which I will now discuss.5. The locked room, that Charlie keeps the key to somewhere out of reach (for himself) is of course the symbol of all the bad cherished memories, a room that he hold so dear, remnant of the love he once had (again not going into details); in this period another character enters the play, a young preacher boy who want to convert Charlie and as he says to save his soul and give him redemption. In one scene he helps him to unlock the door after he has had a futile attempt to retrieve the key and then we realize what the room is. It is a sacred space, everything is intact, pristine, and in stark contrast to the mess of the rest of the house. In a great scene Charlie even smells the room, the room that once belonged to his lover, also smells great.In another scene he tries to enter the room, but he doesn't fit-both literary and figuratively- another important point that the director is telling us, he is telling us that he has let go of himself so much that doesn't belong neither to his memories and to the normal man he was before getting obese nor does he belong to the world he is living in now!6. After the daughter enters the story also a bird enters the story who seeks shelter behind his window for food, he puts food to lure the bird to come back the same method he uses to convince his daughter who he had abandoned to spend time with him (though with another motive), this bird at the same time is a mirroring of the daughter and a symbol of freedom and hope, it's light body a contrast to his heavy body and it's ability to fly and roam freely a forgotten wish for Charlie.7. Now I discuss the connection of the movie with the book \"Moby-Dick\". One may think that Charlie is the white whale, but he is captain Ahab, trying to right the wrongs in his life trying to mend the fractures, and at the same time he IS the white whale as he is trying to kill himself by obesity! By reaching his white whale he is trying to do \"just one right thing\" is he heartbreakingly says at the final scenes.8. This movie is based on a play so it is normal that we don't see a scene change and it also has a deep meaning that Charlie is confined to the confines of both his body and his house.9. The director never shows us the Charlie from before, even in the flashbacks we only see his feet, even when some old photos of he and his lover are found the camera doesn't let us see the man he was before, it is very smart, it is consolidating the fact I mentioned earlier, he has reached a no-turning point, he is only a memory a remnant of what once was and is no more. Of course we are not allowed to see him except for the form he has assumed (the giant whale).10. The musical score is fantastic, it is magnificent and it elicit the deepest emotion in the audience.11. The final thing I want to analyze is the last scene, when he is dying and the daughter comes back, and we find out that the essay was hers all along and she gets emotional. In this scene we again hear the waves, the sea. The same thing we saw for a very brief moment of flashback few scenes before, a perfect memory for Charlie forever preserved with his first family when his daughter was playing in the sands near the sea and he could feel the sea on his feet. Now as he is passing away, the daughter, distressed and emotional, suddenly opens the door and after days of rain, the sun (in its most beautiful form) shines on Charlie's face, as if he has found the salvation he was looking for, and we again start to hear the waves and the sea that is calling him, to take him to his perfect memory. Then he stands up with no help, giant and illuminated by light, majestic and he puts a step forward the bloated ugly foot and the scene cuts immediately showing his normal feet from before, going into the water (what beautiful transition) he stands big and majestic like The Whale in front of his daughter and then he is free from his shackles, the music soars and the movie end.Finally, another beautiful thing is that Charlie has become the Whale (read obese) by consuming not just food, but all the guilt, all the shortcomings and all the heartbreaks the life has imposed upon him, it has crippled him and still he has a very complex and interesting character, and more importantly at the end HE is the one who ties all the loose ends and becomes the symbol of redemption.There are so many more things I want to add but I have already written a lot so enjoy.",

Brendan Fraser deserves all the praise he's been getting for this role. He poignantly shows the pain of a broken man who's aware of his fate and wants to use the little time he knows is left to reconnect with his estranged daughter (played by Sadie Sink).Hong Chau also does a magnificent job as Liz, his friend, nurse, caregiver-and enabler. She portrays the challenges of taking care of someone who refuses to take care of themselves. As someone who had to take care of a disabled mom, I relate to this character.The movie has several issues. It looks more like a filmed play instead of a movie. Even the set looks like it belongs on a stage. Also, the connections between characters are too neat, especially with the \"New Life Church.\" A few twists seem contrived.The movie is worth seeing for Brendan Fraser's performance. He compels us to look beyond his outward appearance to see the humanity within.",

Fraser on the other hand contributes enormously to the director with an impeccable performance, very real and very heartfelt. Why then did I lower the rating?

            "content": "The whale was ever so slightly underwhelming to me. Don't get me wrong this is an excellent film, very well written for the most part, acted superbly, and has characters who are not only believable but also likeable/loavable. However I went in with high expectations of this film, mainly hearing how it was going to win lots of awards but more than that the plotline really intrigued me. This is my issue more than The Whales issue because getting over excited about a film only leads to being let down and I just felt there was a little something missing from making this one of the best films I've seen.The first third of the film plays out exactly like I expected, we are introduced to our setting (Charlies home) where we spend the entire film, with only brief glances outside. I particularly like this because we as the audience get to see exactly what he saw. This is made evident when the camera pans past the darkened window as people leave and arrive at his apartment. We see the excellent Brendan Fraser taking on the role of a morbidly obese man and without doubt it's one of the best performances from any actor you'll ever see.The emotions he shows, the expressions he portrays even with this massive bodysuit surrounding him is profound and it's quite an adjustment to try to understand how someone like this lives, or should I say survives on a daily basis.Next we get introduced to his friend, a nurse who happens to be his deceased lovers sister. We see his aggressive and somewhat broken daughter, and more importantly a young man who claims to be offering help through religion. This is where the film begins to veer off track to what the main story is about and begin to explore what god means or doesn't mean to the characters. At first this boy seems to only want to help Charlie but as we see, and this is almost always true for every person, he has an ulterior motive behind helping. The film then starts to explore homosexuality and how that relates to god and heaven, with a particular scene near the end where charlie argues with the boy about thinking he wouldn't get into heaven if he was gay. This subject is something that is deeply divisive and everybody will have their own opinions on that matter but to roll out this storyline throughout did seem like The Whale was forgetting what the main plot point was. The daughter takes a back seat for awhile and Charlie's weight is nudged aside for a brief moment to look at this issue and for me this just wasn't as cohesive or as blended in to the overall story as I would have liked. It felt like the two stories were always contrasting with each other rather than working in harmony, a bit like two magnets trying to join but ending up in opposite directions. It does seem like the past 5 or so years almost every film tries to make a point or advocate on a certain topic, when almost always the best course of action is to simply tell the raw story, no side tales of oppression or dictation about how we should live our lives.Throughout the rest of film the reactions from people to seeing Charlie was a eye opening experience, and those of who he was close to were able to look past it, where as others like the pizza delivery man, or some of the students were shocked and somewhat disgusted by his appearance and condition.The Whale is a very grounded in reality film but the ending almost opposes that completely as we see Charlie basically get lifted into heaven. A somewhat strange but \"happy\" end to what was a rather stark and bare look at how someone of excessive weight lives.Overall a direct and poignant film that invokes certain emotions, if however not as strongly as I expected and a story that does sometimes get lost in the weeds when tackling subjects like God and homosexuality, however The Whale does come back around to finish on what the film was always meant to be about, A morbidly obese father trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter. If nothing else it's worth watching just to see a truly special performance by Brendan Fraser, who has dealt with his own share of obstacles and challenges but returns in truly great form.",

None of the characters are likable, and pose as one-note characters with little to no character arc. Sadie Sink's character is just an edgy annoying teenager throughout the whole movie. Secondly, they TELL us too much of the story of how Charlie became obese instead of SHOWING the process of how he ended up obese.Cinematography: The entire movie is basically shot in one room, but this in my opinion was a bad directing choice. They should've shown more character arc, and shown more backstory to make the characters more real and grounded, instead of one-note characters. To be honest, the scene at the end where the whole family comes together is probably the best scene in the entire movie.A positive thing that I would like to say aside from Brandon's performance is that they tackled obesity in a very realistic way, although they could've went deeper. This may be the first movie to remotely tackle obesity in a serious manner that wasn't way too over the top or disrespectful towards people suffering from obesity.",

I don't know what was more unsettling in this film, the mawkishness or the cynicism. It's the perfect piece for our postmodern times, characters who are depressed, bitter, and completely incapable of achieving that dated Hollywood value of transcendence.A sweaty Charlie opens the movie with a disgusting masturbation session, and fills the next few hours stuffing his face with greasy pizza and oozing meatball subs. Then there's the in-your-face vomiting scene, which has become as common in recent productions as the fart joke. Is this really what qualifies as film making excellence?No doubt Brendon Frazier - and the makeup - carry the film. Sadie Sink was also strong as Ellie, but her character was so irredeemably toxic and malevolent it was repulsive. It made no sense to me that Liz, the nurse and sister of the deceased lover, wilfully ignored Charlie's pending demise and his his mental trauma, but dutifully enabled his food addiction. Why did she carefully measure his blood pressure each day, while failing to dial 911 and get him some help? The ex-wife was a bitter alcoholic unable to move beyond losing Charlie to another man. Her life's work was to stoke hatred for Charlie in their daughter, and here she succeeds in spades. Both Hong Chau and Samantha Morton could benefit from a few acting workshops.I'm not sure why critics love to laud \"complex\"and \"flawed\" personalities. The vision here the same old same old. Cynical, embittered characters, unable to move beyond their personal tragedies. The world is full of wounded people stuck in the past, and five minutes ago, the movies entertained and captivated us with stories of how sometimes, we could rise above it. Today instead, we get a close shot of a character vomiting in a toilet bowl. We've thrown in the towel on challenging people to rise up; but if we shed a tear or two for these unfortunate folks, please, feel free to gawk.If this movie made me cry, it would be for the two hours I wasted.",

Then it was history, I cried the whole movie and at some point I thought I'd had to go out from the cinema cs I was sobbing.The mix of feelings this movie makes you feel is indescriptible, I went from pity to anger to sadness and then happiness, just to end with this sensation of emptiness and impotence because the only thing I wanted was to cross that screen and hug Charlie.Usually I choose one character that \"stole the movie\" and of course in this case Brendan is the chosen one; but the women just left me speechless, the way they go through different phases with Charlie and the development of their relationship with him is so deep that I felt a connection with every one of them.I've seen a lot of movies in my life, believe me, A LOT; but this one went directly to my heart, I don't think I can watch it again but I won't forget it, never.",

But at the end, it all kinda makes sense, brought out the plot line and brings the message of how people care.All the characters are so complex and that's what so great about the movie. I was so moved by Liz and his ex wife's selflessness, and how they managed to still care for Charlie despite his sometimes selfish act. It's so sad to watch Charlie's condition but I like how he sees the good in everyone. Instinctively, i didn't like the missionary and Ellie.

While his performance in \"The Whale\" was certainly one to watch, the plotline deserved equal praise for its honest approach to storytelling and the elegant way it bottled a deep and human message.Story Analysis:Regardless of your personal preferences, Brendan Fraser's performance will be relatable on so many levels. It was for me. The full power of his acting capability was showcased in \"The Whale\" and it was magnificent to watch.The supporting artists balanced the entire production and helped convey the message at the core of the plot, that everyone's fighting their own demons and we should all just be a little kinder to one another.\"The Whale\" featured a closeted homosexual man named Charlie suffering from obesity and self-acceptance. He had a daughter (Ellie) with a woman (Mary) from whom he was long-divorced.Charlie worked as a college essay writing teacher. Albeit his courses were taken online, he communicated deep empathy and sharp observations to his students.Now, I don't believe they made the lead character gay just to get audience approval, let alone their pity. It was relevant to the plot in so many ways and connected exceptionally well with real-life situations that affect the same-sex community.Aside from living with a congestive heart condition, Charlie was also depressed, owing in large part to his boyfriend and life-partner Alan's suicide. A while after that, Charlie started to put on weight and didn't quite stop.Adapted from Samuel D. Hunter's stage play, and written by the man himself for the screen, \"The Whale\" has to be seen by as many people as possible. It was a story about acceptance, most especially the lack of it.Musical scoring was extraordinary. Hair-makeup and costume design were excellent, particularly for Charlie. Art direction and set decoration were noteworthy. Editing and VFX were superb. Cinematography was ingenious. Screenplay was brilliant. Direction was outstanding.Final Notes:Charlie's interactions with his daughter Ellie, nurse Liz, and ex-wife Mary were gripping and meaningful. Brendan Fraser's performance was heartbreaking and brilliant. The dialogues were carefully written for all characters in the movie. Not a line felt like it didn't belong.As the story progressed, the importance of unconditional love, honesty, and truthful expression became some of the most significant messages to be found in \"The Whale\".",

I was surprised by how much this film affected me and how it kept in my head for days afterwards. This is really solid film making. The acting is fantastic all round, particularly Fraser, whose performance raises the entire film a couple of notches.The Whale misses out on a higher score due to it being (like just about every film this year) 10-15 minutes too long, and also because I found some of the blocking of scenes too stagey, where characters would go to leave then pause at the door, back to camera, before finally (and dramatically) turning and reentering the scene - people just don't do that in real life and it drives me nuts, very surprising from Aronofsky.",

Brendan Fraser pulls in a triumphant return to big screen acting in one of the most emotionally demanding roles I've seen in a long time. He really was the perfect choice for this kind of character; loveable, forever positive, vulnerable, and capable. And also Hong Chau who seems to be the only cast member that can keep pace with the sheer depth Fraser can bring. Not a lot actually happens in The Whale, and yet the themes it touches upon and the characters it explores culminate in an overwhelming experience that's hard to describe. This isn't my favourite Aronofsky movie, far from it, but it's definitely his most emotionally complex. I need to see it again to properly process my feelings, but at the same time I'm scared of living that experience again. Just like mother!, I find myself in deep praise of The Whale, yet at the same time resistant to ever going back to it. I give it a high 8/10, tickling the underbelly of true greatness, really only let down by its miniscule scope, resulting in it feeling like just a filming of the play it's based on, rather than a movie in its own right. But the emotions are still raw and I'm still in a state of processing.QyrosMovies.",

And it's easy to understand why the director chose this play to adapt. The first element that catches the eye is Brendan Fraser's performance, he is brilliant, at the same time that he is a suffering and charismatic performance we feel an anger at the character for his lack of combativeness due to guilt, his intonation and body performance are also incredible , another highlight of the performance is that of her friend and carer Liz, played by Hong Chau, who is great in an interpretation of a tough and friendly character, on the other hand, one of the pillars of the story, the young Ellie played by Sadie Sink makes a poorer and weaker performance. The script is very good, all well put together, full of morality and allegories, with dialogues and an almost personal text talking about writing with passion and not with technique, these passages are beautiful and touching, I really like this personality in the text of \"A Baleia \". The photography is dark and sad, as is the composition of the dirty, sunless scenery, it is always a depressing and hostile atmosphere, the make-up is a separate element and should arrive strong for the Oscars. Darren Aronofskyi brings harrowing scenes, it seems that we are always breathless watching his film and the protagonist's life being held by a thread. One point that takes me away from the film is the same thing that takes me away from Aronofskyi's previous film, the feature \"mother\", from 2016, both go too deep in their religious and poetic metaphors in addition to having a slow montage, I didn't like it either the use of the camera and the soundtrack although the sound mix is great. 8/10.",

It's about his moral and emotional condition as a result of his physical condition. Brendan Fraser throws himself physically and mentally into Charlie's journey to self-destruction. His character is not negative, on the contrary, he is positive about life: when he feeds the birds, when he teaches his students to be sincere and honest with their lives, and when he sees his daughter's evil actions as good intentions. Charlie is just tired of suffering from the loss of his partner and the absence of his daughter in his life. He just doesn't see a purpose in life.\"The Whale\" is based on the play of the same name and mixes themes related to religion, family, relationships, loss, the meaning of life, and true self-identity.Darren Aronofsky makes an excellent direction but chooses to have some scenes or dialogues as if they were a theater play and not a movie, and it breaks the rhythm of the story, i.e. All scenes where the characters stop and stare in front of the door.The film has an impressive emotional charge and Brendan Fraser is the main culprit for bringing all these pains to the surface.

            "content": "This movie is about honesty and reflection of own self or actually refusal of that reflection.This movie finds us searching for the honesty we all want, but often can't either get or can't bear to hear even if deep down we want to.The obese Charlie is dealing with trauma by distancing from it, at the same time he is refusing to self reflect on his own health and habits. He is demanding honesty from everybody around him, but fails to be honest about himself. Charlie is willing to dig down the honesty and truth of others by taking the social tolls on himself. This is partly, because he is dying and is more interested finding redemption for his life through his daughter.His daughter Ellie on the other hand is dealing with her trauma by trying to avoid it completely. She is being mean and hurtful so she wouldn't attach to anybody so she couldn't be left again. She is probably also trying to make others feel as bad as she is feeling.Her dad however doesn't believe in it, he feels she is good and decent. Partly, because he needs her to be good for his redemption, but also for allegorical reasons (Jesus). She however doesn't want to hear anything positive about herself from his dad, who she hates. All this is also signaled when she tried to do bad, but it still had positive outcome. She is deep down not like the surface is.Okay that is what this movie is about in core. Let see something else \"boring\" stuff here. Acting is amazing, the look of the makeup/costume/hairstyle, production design and the cinematography just the cherry on top of it. Everything blends so well into the narrative and it is just not that it \"looks the part\". It feels the part. The camera finds all the right angles for the maximum effect either \"physically\" or emotionally. The camera can find amazing composition for the dialogue and drama going on.Dialogue is mostly where this movie shows cracks. It is in few scenes at times pretentious, repetitive (not referring to the essay) and overtly edgy with what is either commenting at \"today's liberalism\" or weirdly being it. I am not sure what was the point of some of it. Well I understand the effect it wants it is about the the trauma again, but the actual content of it. (the character is in that scene edgy, because she wants people to not like her and also she wants others to be miserable as she is).Also at few times I think the dialogue is just plain impossible to be delivered in a tone that fits the movie so it artificially might seem \"bad\" acting, but really stems from the content not being fitting for the tone of the movie. These mostly are minor scenes so not really big things.So yes very powerful movie in acting, in technical aspects and I would say in theme. Why it isn't 10 really comes down to the fact that it isn't really ground breaking in its themes and message. I also find it bit too convoluted in its attempt to insert these \"snippets\" of commentary on certain things. They are just snippets, they don't really communicate anything meaningful. It is like listing topics, but visually.Briefly about the \"fat-shaming\". I mean anybody who thinks being this overweight is normal just don't watch this movie. He is literally killing himself by eating. All the parts where the eating is consider by many critics \"gross\" is actually your own projection about those parts being \"gross\". They are emphasizing the act, because he is already dying, but keeps eating and usually after trauma surfacing or him not accepting his own reflection. He is suppressing the feelings. You could find parallel in other movies where the director is giving close up on razor blade and veins and the blood in suicide scene. It is giving detailed frame on the act that is taking the life away. It forces viewer to look there rather than it happening behind some closed doors.",

            "content": "WHAT'S GOOD. Definitely an outstanding performance by Brendan Fraser playing Charlie an acutely obese man restricted to a wheelchair. Done up with prosthetics, looking grotesque and projecting bitterness, agony superbly, Brendan slays it with some mind boggling acting. If this doesn't get him the Oscar, I don't know what will. He is a prisoner in his apartment, unable to get up, bitter about life but he is soft natured also as he keeps apologizing. He has some kind of a death wish and eats like a glutton. He had abandoned his wife and daughter ( 8 years old ) to continue his gay relationship. Now much older, filled with remorse and guilt he wants to build fences with teenaged estranged daughter. He is looked after by a medical attendant Liz who offes him help, food, solace and succour. As Liz, Hong Chau gives an amazing performance which is endearing. She also deserves the supporting actress award. The climax is done extremely well and will sadden many. ( That could be the reason for the 6 minutes standing ovation Brendan received at a film festival some time back )\nWHAT'S NOT SO GOOD. Director Darren Aronofsky has adapted it from a stage play and it shows from the way the movie presented. The camera remains in the apartment and actors strut about shouting in anger. This sub narrative isn't focussed and the subplots are a distraction. The characters of daughter Ellie ( Sadie Sink) and wife Mary ( Samantha Morton) are ill defined and lack conviction. Both have also overacted in their roles needlessly and some restraint in their interpretation was necessary. To make things worse, another character of a Christian missionary who keeps popping in and out doesn't appear convincing despite quite a bit of screen time. His scenes with Ellie look redundant and don't add to the main plot.CONCLUSION. A must watch for the acting of Brendan Fraser and Hong Chau. Though the movie deserves a 6 due to the not so good points, I am going for with 8 due to the overwhelming first rate acting of Brendan Fraser.",

The part was a role that could also tap his current situation and utilize it to connect with the audience: a man that was agonizing for validation and redemption in a collision course of self-destructiveness.The scenes in the film pulled no punches: raw unpleasant emotion, exploiting unaesthetic shock, deep meaningful emotions in a last decade of predominantly super hero films. The movie is in some portions of the film a deep dive into the ruthless bias that humans have for both aesthetically and psychologically unpleasant events: the abandonment, emotional abuse for Charlie's obesity, unabashed manifestations of disgust targeted towards him. We follow him in his self-destructive journey and hopefully understand and come to terms with his ultimate decision, without judgment and empathetic acceptance.Brendan's performance accomplishes evoking care, concern, sadness, disgust; a multitude of emotions that are surprisingly intense for a film that takes place in its entirety in the confinements of his apartment, gives credence to the complexity of the performance. Sadie Sink performance was impactful, hateful but, frequently, in little micro-actions, giving that sign of hope that redemption was attainable. The film was able to accomplish its goal and didn't stray too much with some subpar cameos or loosely tied appearances.Invigorating to see that the realness of the movie was not betrayed with a feel-good ending. The ending was sober and serious, a movie that exposes and educates on the complexity and tragedy of abandonment, trauma, dogmatism, identity issues, and our mortality.

We get it. Moreover, how many times do we need to underscore the resentment behind him leaving his family? Its the same resentment which is articulated the same way every time. His teenage daughter is rebellious and misunderstood because she plays a rebellious and misunderstood teenager - but also, that is what her mother said. The boy, I dont even know why he was written in at all. He had an obstacle that had nothing to do with the overall story. The film seemed like a stageplay where every word aims to reassert what we see so that we are especially sure what's happening. It's not necessary for anything that I can pause and rewind.The apogee of the film is the discussion between Fraser and the young man (who could have been anyone), and that's where I think the film finally comes together after nearly 2 hrs.

And don't get me wrong, I like works that use this resource well in favor of a good story. Simply, most of the time, these emotions simply don't cause real reactions, due to many factors, almost all related to the way in which they are carried out. With The Whale, you can start forgetting about everything I just wrote. This is a film that builds itself, over low heat, slowly consumed to finally react violently in a gale of feelings that are impossible to avoid.And this is why one can love cinema. In addition to the entertainment that is often obvious, there are also human and realistic stories like these, where everything comes together so that a well-written script and a memorable performance are capable of breaking anyone. There are many topics touched on in this film that can be the source of a genuine debate, and even when they can be enriching conversations, Brendan Fraser's performance rises to silence everyone and deliver a high dose of emotions that unbalances any cold and calculating analysis. Both subjectively and objectively, Brendan Fraser should win all of the season's awards. The organization that thinks differently will be branded as criminal for eternity.In the technical aspects of the movie, the soundtrack has many moments of silence that are appreciated and others where it enters with a frenzy to complement the emotional package of images. The direction is austere, but efficient, with some very interesting shots to highlight every detail. The editing is impeccable. I am obsessed with good transitions, neat continuity and good cuts, and this is one of the few films that delivers a very high level of editing. And of course it is impossible not to notice the wonderful work of practical effects and makeup, where the protagonist of the film is transformed into a morbidly obese person.Watch this film with an open mind and eager to receive emotional, sharp, critical and humane drama, for this film offers all of that and more.",

I suspect he also suffers from\nSevere depression. Was. It's hard to watch him struggle when he's trying to things that we mostly take for pgranted. At times it's hard to watch it but mostly it's fascinating and gives you the feels. He definitely earned his Oscar Nomination.",

I mean, he not only has big moments, Oscar bait moments, but where he shines are the little subtle emotions, the ones that are caught when we think he is not in focus...but no, Darren really underlines every frame where Brendan is in...so this is practically his film.The story however is a bit divisive. You love it or hate it. I didn't hate it. You can replace the eating with any other addiction and you have the same movie. This is just the way he wanted to go...via pizza overdose. I get that fat shaming is a big thing in certain communities but I can assure you, any gastroenterology or cardiology doctor will not recommend that life style, the same doctor will also say that he will not stop you if you want to pursue it...it's definitely your choice. Fat shaming is the reason he did all this, as I gather, anyway. But to say that that is healthy...uff, he knew that already. I hate to tip-toe around this topic because LB might block my review but I soldier on.Behind the story and acting, this is a film that is done alright, ticking all the boxes that can be ticked in a single room kind of drama. The only other setting that we have is at a beach. It's a good film that tackles obesity, religion, family, addiction...but I don't think its Darren's best work.",

The implication that fat people are only fat because they eat fried chicken and candy, when obesity is a socioeconomic problem, is incredibly fat phobic and irresponsible. The suggestion that this man would have a gross, sad, pathetic life just because he is obese is horrible. This movie is damaging. All that aside though, it's just a bad movie. The dialogue is campy and cheap, the theme is so muddled, the cinematography is boring, and the acting is subpar. Hung Chao tries her best, but her acting is just laughably bad. Brenden Fraser is okay but he can't save this horribly written of a character. Sadie Sink has no depth. I am not exaggerating when I say this is absolutely the most awful movie I've ever seen.",

I can't believe he was able to give such an emotional, heartfelt performance to the likes I've ever seen. I think this is not only the best acting role I've seen this year, but also the best acting role of the 2020s so far. Additionally, Hong Chau was amazing as well. During her and Fraser's one-on-one scenes, I forgot I was even watching a film.Also, absolute shout out to the makeup, cosmetic, or whatever other teams that made Fraser look so authentic on the screen. I have absolutely no idea how they made him look so realistic. Unbelievable.With this said, the ensemble of other roles was made made this film hard to watch at times. 8 hours after watching in the theatre and I can't even remember what purpose was the Thomas character necessary for. It didn't help that Sadie Sink pretty much played the exact same character as Max from Stranger Things.All-in-all, this film will always be Fraser's masterpiece to me.",

Btw Mishima was bisexual and 3 time Nobel Literature nominee so I'm surprised there was no mention of him from this character who truly is a phenomenal English writing teacher btw, a solid direction from Darren Aronofsky and a jaw dropping performance from Brendan Fraser who truly deserves the Best Actor Oscar and a stellar performance from Sadie Sink who plays his daughter.I would've cried if the ending was different, I wasn't so angry at the nurse for feeding him chicken in the opening scene, and at myself that it took this long and this movie to finally shock me into action. You CAN end up like this.Btw some truly revolting scenes so be warned I was holding my hand in front of my face and staring away at points verbally exclaiming WTF at points. Most of the audience was sobbing in tears at the end and I could see reflections of parts of my own psyche in this film.If you have weight to lose or know someone who is obese which is 2/3rds TWO THIRDS of America then go see this and drag them with you.Ttyl I'm gonna go see Everything Everywhere All At Once to recover from this and enjoy myself 2 days into this dry fast.

Everyone is made out to be both to an extent and it's heart-wrenching to come to know these people throughout the film and watch them seek redemption.Some have criticised the screenplay as melodramatic-I didn't find this to be the case. I found it largely authentic, tragic, and full of intrigue that compounds as more information is revealed.My only glaring issue with the film is that one of the characters starts out as complex and with a singular nature, only to have that completely altered, oversimplified, and abandoned in his final scene. It seemed to me that this was done for the sake of the desired themes but at the expense of the character.But Brendan Fraser's performance alone marks this film as a colossal triumph, and there is much excellence to be seen throughout its entirety.",

            "content": "Brendan Fraser marks his long-awaited return to the big screen with an unexpected performance in Darren Aronofsky's The Whale.Based on a play with the same name, Aronofsky's unconventional drama tackles a broadly unexplored topic in cinema, morbid obesity. It's a brave challenge and one that in some scenes hits the mark almost too bluntly, taking a (excuse the pun) somewhat ham-fisted approach to exploring the topic.Aronofsky has an uncanny knack of creating a dream-like space in almost all of his back catalogue, helped in part by his long-running director of photography: Matthew Libatique. The duo took the decision to present The Whale in a 4:3 format helping to create a feeling of claustrophobia and desperation throughout its nearly 2 hour runtime.There is plenty to appreciate about the film, the performances being a major highlight. Sadie sink in particular is a commanding presence, stealing attention in her scenes whilst managing to still be unwelcome within the context of the story. Fraser's performance has rightly received wide reaching plaudits and an Oscar nomination, thanks chiefly to a heroic dedication to the role. I did however expect just a little bit more after hearing all the praise before watching the film.There are some moments of real devastation interspersed with very little positivity, making the film somewhat difficult viewing which clearly was Aronofsky's intentions from the get go.It's hard to compare The Whale to anything currently in theatres, instead it's much easier to compare to Aronofsky's back catalogue in which I'd say the film somewhat falls short. Though to be fair there are some real heavy hitters to follow.I thoroughly enjoyed the film but would be sparing with my recommendations as it's clearly not for everyone, never has the term 'viewer discretion is advised' been more apt.",

It seems that there are some good reasons to criticize this movie, but also some extremely bad reasons that are emerging as the consensus among mainstream critics.First off, let's address the elephant in the room, or should we say the whale? The film's repetitive structure and melodramatic tone have been causing some dead patches for viewers. But wait, that's not all! Apparently, some critics have been so dead set on the idea that this movie is about a \"big fat guy\" that they have completely missed the point. This film is about addiction, grief, and regret, but apparently, the only thing people can see is a person gorging themselves on food.And let's talk about Brendan Fraser's performance. It's brilliant, according to one fan who has been following the actor since \"Encino Man\". It's about time Hollywood gave him another chance, and this film proved successful because of Fraser's dedicated and emotional performance. But wait, there's more! There have been preconceived outraged overreactions about the fact that Fraser wears a fat suit to appear as a morbidly obese person. But let's be real, this is a film made to entertain, and sometimes you wear things or makeup to alter looks. It's not like they could just cast a real-life obese person off the street and have them pour their real emotions out on screen.Overall, this film is less pretentious and more honest than most A24 films, and it relies on pure emotion and struggle, which is shown masterfully by Fraser. But is it exploitative? Perhaps. Is it phobic? It's not impossible to think so. But who cares about that when we have raw and moving performances from Fraser, Sadie Sink, and Hong Chau to focus on? They show us that everyone is flawed, but authenticity should matter more than anything else.In conclusion, \"The Whale\" is a flawed but often marvelous character piece that deserves our deepest empathy, despite some valid criticisms. And if you don't like it, well, that's just your opinion, man.",

But I found the story very compelling, and if you ask me, the story is nearly always the most important part of a movie's construction. The acting of Brendan Fraser might be overblown as the key or best part about this film. He did a fine job. But I thought the entire cast was fine and that Brendan has received a lot of love because he was so visually transformed for the role and his character is so central to the storytelling and is given so many opportunities to demonstrate deep emotions over the course of the runtime.There are a few interesting story reveals which I thought were disguised pretty well so the typical audience member might not predict the outcome. The directing choice as well to have the movie in a 4 to 3 aspect ratio seemed to support the movie effectively. Not only did it help with the framing for certain closeup shots. It also helped envelop the viewer into the narrow world in which this story takes place and keeps focus on the characters within the narrative as opposed to providing a lot of background space to distract from the characters.One other note for the film. The sound and score were typically subtle and a good supportive part to the storytelling. A lot of times brash and garish music is applauded by reviewers when IMO it's too much and a distraction and detriment. This film probably doesn't have a lot of people commenting on the music and sound. But that doesn't mean that it wasn't good and effective for the movie. I felt it fit really well. Overall the movie is great. You just might not want to watch it if you're in the mood for something cheerful, light or fun.

It is, for sure, a sad narrative but still it is really enjoyable. I personally find it hard to write an essay about the movie that is as great as the one written about moby dick.The narrative is so well written. The fact that you can't know how Alan died until the very end of the movie is really engaging. Not only that, the same thing Liz says to Thomas when they go for a little chat in the beginning-ish is said in the end when Charlie talks about Alan and how he didn't need God and Charlie was the only one that could help him. Anyways, cinematic parallels.It's a really great movie, so well done and performed. It doesn't make the film ordinary or uninteresting the fact that the main character dies at the end. Nonetheless, it would probable be a pretty bad ending if he would have actually survived. I believe that the last scene is open for interpretation, since you can't know if he died in the couch and he imagined he managed to walk towards the light and Ellie, or if he actually did that and just died literally in front of her. Both ways, it's a great ending, because I think it made her realize how much life wasn't easy for him and even if he messed up, which he did, he never stopped caring about her.",

            "review_title": "'The Whale' Review- Aronofsky's Show Stolen By Brendan Fraser's Once-in-a-Lifetime Performance",
            "content": "'The Whale', the latest offering from the ace director Darren Aronofsky is a gloomy, poignant and moving saga of a reclusive, atrociously overweight teacher's last days of life. The movie will be forever remembered for Brendon Fraser's stellar performance. The same Brendan Fraser who was known for the cheap 'George of the Jungle', unimaginative 'Bedazzled' or the gaudy 'Mummy' in our growing years has undoubtedly delivered his career best performance. Without an iota of doubt, this is one of the finest performances in recent years.The movie is almost entirely shot inside the living room of the protagonist Charlie where his life is recounted through his conversations with his caregiver, estranged family members, an outsider young kid and at times with the food delivery boy. The milieu is gloomy, dark and at times ominous, a signature style of Aronofsky. There is hardly any sunshine shown except in the climax, brilliantly in sync with the bleak life story of Charlie. The story follows a simple and linear pattern , quite a deviation from Aronofsky's earlier creations like 'The Requiem for a Dream', 'The Fountain', 'Black Swan' or even the less remembered 'Mother!'. But as always, the master craftsman never fails to give his audience a chance to cerebrate, introspect and believe.I have been pining for watching 'The Whale' since the day I saw the poster of the movie with an extremely obese Brendan Fraser's photo and the director's name on it. Even Jim Carrey, the master of comedy has given us underrated yet extremely nuanced performance in 'The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. Adam Sandler, the man behind all those cheap, slapstick comedies gave us 'Punch drunk Love' or the brilliant 'Uncut Gems'. Was it now Brendon's turn to shift his priorities and excel like them? As the movie ended, I had one opinion which I believe most of the readers will agree with. Brendan Fraser embarked on a journey hitherto uncharted by any of the actors of the genre where he belonged and this new version of him has surely given us something deserving a standing ovation. Acting with that much of prosthetics was a monumental challenge. Emoting with that countenance layered with so much of obesity was a herculean task to say the least. But when an actor sacrifices everything in his life in three years just to portray a character perfectly, even the constellations conspire to make the silver screen sizzle with his brilliance. This movie belongs to him. Every scene of the movie belongs to the morbid Charlie, his emotions, his mistakes, his pathos. There are scenes where it is rather difficult to keep your eyes dry as you feel for the misfortunes of Charlie. Other actors do perfect justice to their roles. Hong Chau has bagged an Oscar nomination for her role as Liz, the caregiver friend of Charlie. Sadie Sink as the estranged daughter did a fine job, though she was a bit irritating in a few scenes. Samantha Morton shines as Charlie's ex-wife. But in the end, it is Brendan Fraser who leaves you awestruck. Budding actors may follow this movie as a manual of perfect acting. Sheer class!This is not your regular family drama. This is not an escapist tale of a cosmetic world. This is real. This is hard-hitting and this is a movie made with pure heart. Aronofsky even though did not bag any nominations, his work has been a revelation and if 'Black Swan' is his best creation till date in my humble opinion and 'Requiem for a Dream' is a close second, this can be easily rated third in the list of the unforgettable movies of the illustrious director. His non-manipulative works have never ceased to fascinate me ever since I watched 'Pi' in the college days. And my serenade for his works continues. 'The Whale' is a must watch. If you believe the name of the movie is just based on the physical appearance of the protagonist, you are wrong. And that is the only twist in the movie. You are seriously missing something if you have not watched 'The Whale'. Happy watching!9 out of 10.",

            "content": "In fact I have found a connection between the two films. Both the main characters in those movies were homosexuals. Gods And Monsters was about the homosexual director James Whale whereas this movie is called The Whale. The themes are the same in both films.The film portrays homosexuality as a guilty conscience perceived by the main character(Charlie portrayed by Brendan Fraser). He plays a closet homosexual even though he was in a straight marriage at the time. His lover, Alan, committed suicide due to religious guilt. This causes a remorseful Charlie to start binge-eating, the result of which causes him to become overweight to a point that it causes a terminal illness whereby he has a short time to live.Because of this fact, Charlie wants to make amends with his teenage daughter and find peace.I first saw Brendan Fraser in The Scout(1994). After that I saw many of his good films: George Of The Jungle(1997), The Mummy(1999) and The Mummy Returns(2001). He has a special place in my heart as a charismatic actor that can make you laugh. It's a great tragedy that this actor was not cast alongside Macaulay Culkin in a comedy movie during the early 1990's.Verdict: a decent drama movie about redeeming oneself.",

Well, another compliment I would give is that beside Brendan, the other actors did decent jobs too and the sad score, especially at the end, really teared me up, and I rarely cry at movies. Then there was the story with Brendan's character trying to catch up with his daughter whom he hadn't seen in many years and the plot just rolls from there, which was pretty enjoyable to me. There's just ONE negative thing I got about this movie and that is that, no matter what, he refused to do the obvious thing helping him from a certain doom. I wont say what that obvious thing is without spoiling but people that has watched it will know what i'm talking about.

            "review_title": "Fantastic comeback by Fraser",
            "content": "Seems like Mr. Aronofsky is a sucker for comeback stories. After giving Mickey Rourke a place back in the spotlights in \"The Wrestler\", he does the same for Brendan Fraser in his latest film \"The Whale\" which Fraser repays in full.This is not the only similarity between the films though. Both deal with similar themes of deep personal issues with protagonists who are trying to reconcile and reconnect with their respective daughters. This for me represents the biggest flaw since it feels like the director already did a similar picture.Nevertheless, The Whale does have plenty of good things about it so let's focus on this one solely from now on.And the rain fell upon the earth for four days and four nights. Aronofsky makes the point to show that for each day that passes, we the audience can clearly see it's raining outside and thus ties part of the setting to the biblical themes that are threaded throughout the picture. The Bible quote is from the part about Noah, which was also one of his last three films that could now be well considered a somewhat thematic trilogy. The atmosphere in the film is gripping, greatly aided by the very good setting. It's constantly pouring, Charlie's (Brendan Fraser) apartment is dimly lit and all of the doors and windows are shut. You can almost smell the stale air, mixed with the leftovers from whichever food Charlie was eating on a particular day. Altogether, the atmosphere gives off a drab feeling which in turn helps to convincingly paint a picture about the main character whose physical appearance mirrors his many insecurities inside. Brendan does a brilliant job showcasing all of them in a manner that makes you sympathize with his on screen persona and while all of the actors' performances were convincing, his is tying the whole film beautifully, and is head and shoulders above the rest. In addition, all of the emotions coming out of the movie are mainly coming through his character as well and he transfers them to the audience impeccably.If you decide on seeing the movie be prepared that you're not going to be watching pretty scenes on a number of occasions. In a few instances, it felt like I was watching a horror film where the food was a victim. It is all done deliberately by the director of course and serves the purpose of portraying a person disgusted by themselves and vividly showing it. Fraser and Aronofsky make for a great team and together make Hunter's script come alive.",

The story is extremely similar to one of Aronofsky's previous films The Wrestler. And the last being that the ending did not really work for me on an emotional level. The Whale is a well acted, written and directed drama. But the unsatisfying ending and familiar story are huge drawbacks. I'd highly recommend it just for Fraser's performance alone.",

            "review_title": "Fatso redux",
            "content": "Forty-three years ago, Ann Bancroft wrote and directed a surprisingly good film with a somewhat offensive title \"Fatso.\" It starred the usually under-appreciated Don DeLuise, a gifted movie and television comic who was never self-loathing in his humor, as comics with body-image shtick tend to be. Fat wasn't a liability for him, yet it wasn't quite an asset either. He was an actor--a good one--by trade, making his movie debut in Sidney Lumet's \"Fail Safe,\" not Stanley Kubrick's comic satire of the same novel. An H-bomb falling on New York City is nothing to laugh at. Sixteen years later he debuted again in a dramatic role as Dominick, a lonely, forty-year-old with a food addition. Although not strictly a drama, like Darren Aronofsky's \"The Whale\" pretends to be, it does place a fat actor front and center, not a supporting or minor character. Bancroft's light touch with humor raises her material from maudlin to poignant. Consequently, DeLuise's Dominick is not just a tragic fat man, or an object of pity, but a man like any other, looking for love.\"The Whale,\" despite seeming less offensive than fatso, is a pretentious drama whose substance is mostly water weight. Aronofsky, it may not come as a shock to anyone, is not a director of subtlety and nuance--one need only view his body of work to come to that obvious conclusion. So his attraction to Samuel D. Hunter's blubbering, theater project is understandable, given the playwright's manipulative, get-out-your-handkerchiefs approach to telling a simple tale of a 600-pound man resigned to dying. It tugs and jerks so much at the audience, they might leave the theater feeling assaulted. However, on second thought, they might also feel they've been hoodwinked by a clever con artist, and Mr. Aronofsky's slight of hand.His ballast in this confidence game is the once amiable actor Brendan Fraser. His fat suit, the latex prosthetics, and sad Barney Google eyes work over time to win audiences' hearts, as their minds turn to mush. Fraser throws himself into the suit, surrenders to the role, in an effort to revive his derelict career and connect with his newly obese self, but fights a losing battle with believability. Needless to say, this is all very Oscar worthy--there's nothing the Academy loves more than an actor who transforms himself for his craft. The makeup department ought to get a nomination, too.Movies--great ones--have a way of transforming audiences. Weepies and tearjerkers do this well, the best without being distasteful. But after contemplating this one, audiences might reason that a movie about food addiction, obesity, and death is pandering, even offensive. What challenging role might Fraser tackle next, they wonder? Perhaps John Falstaff, Friar Tuck, or Fatty Arbuckle.",

But to me, i can look passed a lot of things if the movie can change me. Not many movies I've seen where I left a theater a changed person. This had the biggest impact on me out of any movie I've seen. It's a must watch for anyone who wants to be a better person. It's up there with the greats (Shawshank, The Fundamentals Of Caring, etc).Every character was somehow woven into the movie perfectly like I've never seen before. Even the delivery guy was memorable and had meaning. Every scene, every comment, every action, all seemed to have a purpose. That's an impossible task as a director/writer. I'm\nNot sure how the heck the director did this movie but it was dam near perfect in my eyes.My gf passed away Feb 2nd 2023 and I saw this in theaters a week later. It really moved me and has helped me cope. It's a must watch for anyone who enjoys movies with deep meaning. Those who don't like it are probably younger folks or very religious. It's definitely not for everyone but the greatest movies imo are movies you have to think about deeply. I still think about it! I feel this movie will never be topped for me.I rarely write reviews but I had to for this one. I wanted to thank the director for making this into a beautiful movie that moved me in a way that made me a better human being after seeing it. I can't say that about many movies. It was pure art. I can't wait to buy it and rewatch it to understand more. The acting as unbelievable. Everyone did such a good job.10/10 A+ Perfection in my eyes because it shows all the flaws of humans. Every emotion was triggered somehow. That's art. Loved it. Thanks to all who created it. Extreme talent <3.",

The whole thing shot in the confines of a small apartment...doesn't translate to the big screen. A play is what it is. Fraser was great as were the other performers. They were just doing it in a not too great movie. The opening scene was so unsettling and in that instance my doubts were already setting in.

            "content": "Darren Aronofsky's cinema tends to divide critics and viewers in the same way because he is a director who always likes to give us films that generate debate, discomfort or rejection among those who receive each proposal that the filmmaker gives us.This time he is no exception to the rule and once again we face the discord of loving or rejecting his new film.The fact is that we have before us a film quite different from what the director has accustomed us to, especially if we go to his previous film Mother!. On this occasion, the director takes us through a much more conventional film, but one that does not stop having that feeling of love and hate on the part of the critics and the viewer towards what the good Darren Aronofsky proposes to us.The film adaptation of the play by playwright Samuel D. Hunter, who also writes the film's script, is its great strength for us to face a film that manages to become a wonderful work to watch and enjoy, despite the fact that We clearly have an exploitation on the part of its director to look for that sentimentality and that position of compassion or perhaps hatred for the character of Charlie.If we have to talk about the sensations that Charlie generates in us as spectators, we must start by mentioning how brutal it is to see an impressive performance by Brendan Fraser. What the actor does is insane, it is without the slightest doubt the best performance of the actor throughout his entire career and possibly the best performance of the year. What the actor does is transmit with just his eyes and with his expressions, years of suffering and regrets for Charlie, and if we add to that what he does physically with his character is simply hypnotic, you forget that it is Brendan Fraser who acts and you see Charlie at all times.It is also thanks to the actor that the film manages to reach that step of almost perfect work. If The Whale will be remembered for something, it is for what the actor does, it is his film, it is his moment of consecration.Going back to what its director gives us, I can certainly agree with the vision that he gives us a totally manipulative film in terms of managing our emotions and our feelings about obesity or the guilt of a certain character that the story addresses, but we must Give the director that it is a film that makes you participate in a moral questioning and also a capacity for tolerance on the issues that the film addresses.We are facing a film that makes us question several things and that also bombards us with millions of allegories and metaphors taken to the cinema in maximum expression and that is one of the great points that the director always has, always making his films with a full cinematographic language. Of details that make you reflect.It is a really distressing and really heavy film when the time comes for the credits you end up with a really distressing load on your shoulders and the intensity that The Whale transmits is really a slow process to digest, however, this is a great film that It can be manipulative or condescending, but no one can dispute that this is a truly impressive and brutal film with a heart-breaking lead and supporting performances just as impressive as its lead.A film that is worth every second of its viewing and its internal and external debate about what we end up seeing.It is cinema and The Whale is an impressive work.",

I couldn't wait until she was back on screen with Charlie to watch this private and painful relationship, I found myself feeling saddest for Liz.

The overall film was solid in terms of music, lighting, etc. The thing that stood out the most was the amazing performances that tell such a compelling and heartbreaking story.Brendan Frasier did an amazing job portraying Charlie and you could tell so much about him. He's a man who is in pain, emotionally and physically. Physically, he's overweight and struggles to do even the slightest of things. Even laughing can cause him to go into a coughing fit. Emotionally, he's lonely and only wants to reconnect with his daughter before he dies. He knows he has an issue with his weight but even when he feels like he should stop overeating, there's something that makes him realize he's too late. It is here where we see him torture himself in eating, stuffing his face with anything and it's clear to see he does it out of anger and frustration with himself. He knows the damage he's done to himself and knows he's close to death every moment. His interactions with Ellie (Sadie Sink) were the most entertaining to see. Sadie Sink's amazing performances recently show that she will be an absolutely amazing actor to see for the years to come. Hong Chau also gives a great performance as she produces some comedic relief but also gives moments of sadness. These three actors did an amazing job in their roles and were the biggest stars of the movie.The story was one that almost had me crying a few times throughout the movie, but once I reached the ending, tears came streaming down. Hearing the connection between Moby Dick, Charlie, and Ellie was sad and heartwarming. Seeing him walk up to his daughter with his final breaths. And the way they portrayed his death was beautiful. Rather than seeing him go limp and struggle to breathe, we see him being strong and having a final connection to his daughter before he ascends to the light. This makes the death one worth crying to but also happy about.One negative I do have is Thomas (Ty Simpkins). Not necessarily the performance or actor, but rather what his importance was. I don't feel like he has an incredible amount of impact in the story and yet he's given a lot of screen time. These were the times it went dull a bit and had me wondering why he was even on screen for so long. I understand that he was meant to show that Ellie wasn't all bad and that not everyone needs saving. But still, his significance wasn't worth all the time he spent on screen.Other than that, this is the movie to watch if you want to watch a moving story with incredible performances.",

Fraisers characters overwhelming optimism helped him find perfection in the most simple seemingly imperfect things. He wanted honesty from his students in their essays and from his daughter in her writing and what we also got from every character intertwined in his story was their own personal honesty in the end, imperfect and messy as it was. Imperfect and messy is life, in our main characters life especially, but he didn't care as long as he did one very important thing right and that's what mattered to him.",

            "content": "Firstly I would just note that all the so called christians in this comment section are disgusting.Now that I said it, I'm going to say something about the movie.I've seen many reviews by now and watched the movie myself. First scene surprised me because I did not expect it but it was welcoming to introduce the main character.Now, the main character Charlie who suffers from obesity and depression after losing his boyfriend Alan, is an english teacher and you can tell he loves his job. He likes the creativity behind it, behind writing and loves when people are able to express themselves. I personally enjoyed his character as I also felt sad along with him as well as I could compare him to me, being a depressed person myself.The plot Isn't exactly a thriller, as I seen many people comment on it, so I never expected it to be thrilling or to have any action. It depicts a man who, through sadness, loneliness and broken heart also became obese and have fallen into ruin...becoming a shell of his former self. Thought it seems at times he finds joy in little things like reading an essay written by his daughter, teaching online english courses and food, he is still miserable and sad and only really has one friend.Now, I again saw many comments and i don't see the problem with him being gay. It's a story about a man who doesn't need god to save him and who misses someone he lost and who he loved dearly. Being gay has almost nothing to do with it apart from the fact we know he had a boyfriend.Moving on, the whole plot that revolves around him being in his flat people find boring, but I think many fail to see that this man struggles with anxiety, depression, self-confidence and obesity and thus does not want to leave the comfort of his own space he has created and where he feels most safe. It shows us how depression and anxiety and self-confidence can have a huge impact on someones social life and how, even if people might act all happy, could be dying inside.The ending, where he dies isnt sad or at least it shouldn't be. He was happy at the end. He knew he was going to die and he wasn't gonna deny it. He was happy because right there, right before he passed, he walked again and he heard his own daughter read her essay to him one last time. The essay he held most dear and would help him through a lot of hard times.The missionary kid was not needed. No matter how hard he tried, he should have realized that Charlie decided long ago what he wants in life and who he wants/doesnt want to follow/believe in. He tried helping sure, but by forcing HIS religion onto someone who DID NOT want it.Overall the movie was great. I cried from almost the beginning to the end. It touched me deeply and I never felt so sad and empty and lonely at the same time. It made me realize that the time we have is a short one. We better live it gratefully, without hate(how many ppl in comments do) and realize that life is so much more.Brendan is an amazing actor and I salute him for this role. The comeback he made, the acting, everything about this role is something that we usually would not expect to see take on, yet he did and he did it well.Well done Brendan <3.",

            "content": "Held together by a killer Brendan Fraser (don't worry sir, we will get you that Oscar), this film is a sweet poem of empathy that will leave most viewers blubbering. This film makes me feel awful inside and not necessarily, in a bad way. Aronofsky's films have always been known to make one feel empty, not in a dissatisfied way but in a way that someone just took everything that makes me feel warm and cozy and ripped it out of me. This film broke me.This film is based off of a stage play written by Samuel D. Hunter which is about an obese man hiding from the world, staying in his apartment to the detriment of everyone around him, including his young and estranged daughter whom he left along with his wife to be with a man named Alan with whom he fell in love. When Alan commits suicide, Charlie's only remaining purpose in life is to make sure that his daughter Ellie is going to be okay even when he's not going to be around.I knew I was not going to be able to hold back my tears when I first saw the trailer which gave me this impression of the film being dark and depressing and although it is dark and depressing with its undertones of guilt, remorse and religion; what essentially makes this film great is that in the end, it gives you a feeling that even though everything that has transpired throughout, Charlie's daughter Ellie is going to be okay, she is going to have a decent life. Making sure of this will atleast be the one thing that he, by heart knows, did right in his life.Even if this film polarizes you in its approach of guilt or its treatment of fat people (which a lot of people online are discussing about), there is one thing that you and everyone who watches this film will agree in unison that Brendan Fraser has given a performance of his lifetime. That too at a time when everyone least expected it. This is one of those performances where either the most suitable actor (Brendan in this case) does it best or it does not happen at all. Brendan's grounded approach to becoming Charlie is what makes his performance seem so organic and makes you sympathize with all he's going through and even if you know deep down that he's not exactly doing the right thing but, from his perspective, it's the only thing that matters to him and you want him to succeed at that. Sadie Sink also gives a razor-sharp performance as Ellie which I think might be her best role to date which just further proves why she was the highlight of the incredibly mediocre Stranger Things Season 4. Hong Chau is also the one who delivers the character perfectly. Her performance is basically us as the audience reacting to all of Charlie's doings. There is not really any complaints at all, in the acting department at least because, Aronofsky really knows how to pull performances. There is always that one actor in his films that absolutely kills it in their roles and we've seen it all the way from Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan, Mother! And now this. I don't know how he does that but it's just incredible. He has always been one of those directors (with the likes of Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, Ridley Scott, James Mangold, David Fincher and many more) who whenever come up with something new, it's like an event to me. A celebration of the seventh artform and what it truly stands for.This film's production design, camera work and lighting is also something that should be taken into notice. It really gives you that claustrophobic feel of being in one house all the time. The set lighting makes sure you feel that dark/depressed state of Charlie's mind and body and how tired he is of his own life committing one mistake after the other and just wants it to end.The one thing I can't really contemplate is that some parts of the film didn't really make much sense to me except for them just being there for plot progression and pulled me out of the film's other more organic approaches. For instance, there is this scene with Charlie and is wife which doesn't really make much sense only until the very end which just makes the film's runtime 10 minutes longer and I wanted them to get to the point already.I can't really recommend this to you because you might either find this film beautiful and cathartic (like I did) or you might find it empty and having no point to it. The latter can happen because the film wants you to empathize with Charlie after making him seem disgusting in the beginning by showing him masturbating to gay porn. It's either a hard hit or a complete miss and only you can decide it for yourself.",

Perhaps this is because of special screenings? Anyhow, I didn't know what to expect except for some award-worthy performances (from what I had read online). I certainly wasn't lied to.Every single performer knocked it out of the park on this one - Brendan Fraser as much as his co-stars Sadie Sink, Hong Chau and the others. I felt awkward crying in the cinema so I tried to hold it in, but it was an impossible task - though I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one. I was very moved by their extremely human acting prestations.I absolutely adored the lenses this film was shot thru as well as the pretty 4:3 aspect ratio. For me, the cinematography captured very well the feeling of being stuck in this house which feels like a 'home' but simultaneously like a garbage dump. I don't know how to describe it, but sometimes I felt genuine horror. I don't know exactly what was so scary; the claustrophobic feeling, the inevitability of death or Charlie's lifestyle. Maybe a combination of it all.Furthermore, the soundtrack was just as heartbreakingly beautiful as the scenes it played along with. I also love it when certain parts of a story that might seem 'meaningless' or otherwise at random, eventually get called back to and mold together with the rest of the plot as one beautifully sorrowful story. All of it worked.The humanity of the characters is what makes this film so interesting to me. Though to be quite honest, I don't know what this film is trying to tell me. Perhaps it doesn't want to convey a deep message, but instead just show us how nobody is perfect because they're simply human. I don't know, but I loved it. Can't wait for the next A24 project!",

I know he fell off the face of the Earth for several years due to some personal issues, but that's how I remembered Brendan. Good actor, but nothing extraordinary. Then I've seen that standing ovation clip in some auditorium for his role in The Whale and I thought to myself \"It has to be some body positivity thing, right?\". I mean, how good can it be.By all means I'm not a connoisseur. I watch everything remotely good, sometimes in the background. But I'll watch a musical, cheesy rom com, avengers-type popcorn stuff, occassional drama. I stay away from niche stuff, because I want to be entertained, not research \"what author meant\" and how does it relate to his childhood or whatever. None of that pretencious stuff. But I do appreciate a good story, good acting, solid camera work, music, costumes and how the movie makes me feel in the end.Here comes \"The Whale\". And this movie is heavy. Really heavy. It has my heart racing, my palms sweating and I find myself sniffling like a little child and bawling my eyes out at the end. I don't remember any movie hitting me as hard as this one in a very long while. I could maybe compare it to the first time I've seen \"Requiem for a dream\" as a teenager. I remember sitting in my chair watching the credits rolling and not being able to move. Like it all didn't sink in just yet and I needed another moment. That movie wasn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. And years have passed, I've seen and experienced many hardships, so rarely anything moves me like it used to move me when I was young(er) and more innocent.\"The Whale\" didn't move me. It hit me like a brick to the face. I really can't say if it was Charlie's struggle, his kindness and how people took advatage, his loss, or anything in particular that resonated with me so much. The only thing I know for sure that Brendan Fraser delivered such a powerful performance it ripped the heart out of my chest.I underestimated you, Brendan. I'm sorry and thank you.",

This man didn't leave his appartement for a long time because of his condition. All the actors are amazing and implicated in their role. Even though this film is filled with sadness, Charlie is filled with positivity beyond his problems.Also, it can be hard to see him deteriorate and destroy himself. It can really make you think about life and the problems others have. The film is almost completely filmed in the apartment of this sick man. This full-length feature also talks about literature and has some interesting critic of the famous novel Mobby Dick. The main character is an English teacher who teaches college students online. He turns off is camera because he is ashamed of being fat. He is intellectual, demanding and passionate\nFor conclusion, I recommend going see this film with someone that is close to your family so you can experience their problem and see that yours may not be that bad compared to others.

            "content": "The performance of Mr. Fraser as Charlie was masterful and deserving of an award with the other performances average at best. The special effects were first class. Beyond these 2 elements which were clear from the beginning there was no reason to sit through this grotesque portrait of the slow and ugly suicide of a human being. The reason is because I felt nothing for him or for his family. I did not detect a shred of anything in his character as revealed on the screen that prompted an emotional response other than disgust.I am totally perplexed as to why this pretentious film was made and ask the director and writer what were they trying to achieve other than provide the opportunity for Mr. Fraser to win an Oscar. On this point I suspect the worst and it concerns the possibility that this is some kind of weird effort to normalize ugly mediocrity in the extreme...in itself not such an unusual thing in today's distorted world where pursuit of excellence and nobility is openly discouraged.Let's consider some of the ludicrous themes perhaps intended as redemptive. Firstly, Charlie is an incognito online writing instructor whose greatest wisdom is to utter...you gotta write what you really feel ....big deal... there is nothing interesting about this man. Secondly, he is trying to reconnect with his daughter Ellie, promising her money all the while with a kind of absurd, smirking optimism, subjecting this young person to watching his disgusting protracted suicide. Had he instead offed himself quickly and efficiently leaving his family the money after writing a heartfelt apology, I just may have felt something for him. Thirdly, he struggles to move his body mass into the bedroom shrine of his gay relationship which destroyed his family... this along with with the white light deification at the end and the Contact like other worldly beach scene is sheer nonsense. Lastly, the annoying whale metaphor referencing Melville's great classical work of Moby Dick serves only as a contrast with the failed writing behind this film.The side plots in the film including the inexplicable behavior of his medical helper who for some time has been complicit in his suicide, the young man Thomas who achieves reconnection with his family in some perverse way due to Charlie's daughter pursuit of \"truth\"...and of course the poor suffering wife who at the end falls into his hulking mass....all of these including the ever present unnecessary gay sex intonations do nothing to remedy the central flaws of this film.If all of this is about the evils of shaming and how this man achieves a religious epiphany at the end, I suggest the real truth is that what he is and what he is doing is in fact largely disgusting and shameful and any hope of redemption for him can only come, if there is reincarnation, in the next life.At an early point in the film I wondered if suddenly Charlie will really see the light and at least try to live by getting serious medical attention as a first step.... he could still die at the end but with a last gasp of do the right thing. After all, there are actual cases where his amount of weight has been substantially reduced. Alas, such a truly redemptive plot is not in the mind of the writer. Instead, the torture continued with my increasing regret in coming to the theatre on a rainy night to watch this debacle.",

It just has to do with the way we are brought up. Been told to be someone, to do something, but more frequently, to not be someone and to not do something, often not understanding that 'What we do is who we are' and not the other way around.This film is astoundingly resonant with my thoughts on being honest with oneself.The Whale is the journey of a man who is not what the society wants or wanted him to be. Likewise for most other characters in the story; the people are just so real.I feel like this script is exactly what the audience of 2023 needs, in a world full of 'who to be' ideas. The film is quite well written, though the idea deserves more cake than the pages themselves. While the flow is tight, some dialogues could be slightly more refined. I adore the undertone that an unhealthy relationship with food was given a psychological relevance, that is to cope up with a predicament. On a personal note as well, that is how it usually happens with myself. You feel stressed, and the first thing you want to do is either run away from food or eat too much of it, obesity inducing mostly.Darren Aronofsky, as always, nails the job. It is indeed tough for a director to set and play the entire story in a confined space, and yet reveal something new each time about the same. Subtle camera movements, dark color tone, and Aronofsky's archetypical eerie music all add to the character's ticking time bomb situation.An extra shoutout to the Sound Design and Music. Both of these elements put the audience in that anxiety inducing zone where 'any moment could be the last.'\nAlso a Brilliant play with inserts and set design.Fraser has done an electric job, from his eating mannerisms to his voice; everything is the character.I think we do need more films like these, focussing not on loud action sequences, but on the individual story and moral dilemmas of life and who we are.Definitely worth a watch in cinemas.",

Hunter. Directed by Darren Aronofsky, this film is a visually intense and reflective work that makes us question the meaning of life from the perspective of an enclosed character. Like a good \"chef\", Aronofsky constructs a complex and unusual narrative that offers the viewer the possibility to \"appreciate\" the film rather than simply \"devouring\" it.With the help of a \"heavyweight\" actor, Brendan Fraser, Aronofsky creates a stunning cinematic work that makes us reflect on universal issues of the human condition, such as the excesses and denial that we often commit in our society. Fraser surprises with a warm and expressive performance that manages to convey many emotions without the need for words.Some scenes may be a bit intense and uncomfortable, but that's what makes the film so realistic and exciting. Ultimately, \"The Whale\" is a feast for cinema lovers, a complete menu with different flavors that together form a harmonious and enriching whole, the \"umami\" (as the experts would say). Aronofsky manages to create a cinematographic work of art that deserves a thunderous round of \"flippers\" (applause).",

That it is too late for change.The use of the daughter is done masterfully, you truly do gain an understanding for why he is the way he is, throughout the film it becomes somewhat haunting as his state seems to be caused by addiction and trauma, which feeds in the use of the poem entailing this films narrative beautifully to make a well rounded narrative in an otherwise uncertain character.Not to mention this films harmonious score that excels the brilliance of the cinematography, which only compliments the script even more, making those hard scenes even harder to digest and those bitter sweet ones ever so much more bitter, leaving you with a constant lump in your throat, out of pity, out of sorrow and out of disgust.Yet the films unexpected display of optimism doesn't leave you with a undesired swell of anguish, the film leaves you feeling rather hopeful, and wanting to bite back down on the twisted brilliance and beauty of aronofskys craft.",

I couldn't blame that only on the actors, there was some sloppy directing, and a screenplay too closely adapted from a stage play didn't help either.I'm not a Brenden Fraser fanboy - I had absolutely no opinion about him before seeing this movie. I've never seen any of his previous films, or at least if I have, I don't recall.Aronofsky likes to create uncomfortable situations in his movies, so the subject matter and the characters didn't concern me - I was ready for it. What bothered me, though, was at no time did I ever care about any of these characters. Ultimately, there was no character arc, no redemption. The dramatic music swelled, then the film just kinda ended.Disappointing would not be strong enough to describe this movie. If the director's intention was to create another polarizing film, he certainly has achieved that here. Reviews seems to be either 10/10 or 1/10, only in this case I've ended up on the 1/10 camp.I am flabbergasted by the 10/10 reviews though - did we all watch the same movie??",

            "content": "Darren Aronofsky's \"The Whale\" is a profoundly moving, tragic, yet authentic look at a dying man's deepest regrets. The Whale's true-to-life reflection of family relationships, personal guilts, dreams, and their inherent affinity allows the film's continual setting in a cramped apartment to be worth its simplicity.\"The Whale\" focuses on Charlie's (Brendan Fraser) last week alive as a morbidly obese man dying from congestive heart failure. The film cleverly employs a 1.33:1 cinematic ratio that exposes Charlie's massive stature and size on the screen. With a profoundly resonating score, beautiful cinematography and atmospheric setting, \"The Whale\" is technically excellent.The film examines Charlie's last attempts to reconnect with his daughter Ellie played well by Sadie Sink, who has been absent for many years. The film excels in the thoroughly complex and authentic relationships between each character. Such relationships are full of anger and hate, yet used as a medium to demonstrate deep love between them.The Whale is about the lifelong remorses of a dying father and his aim to reconcile with those he has grown distant. Although able to go to the hospital to help his condition, Charlie desires his remaining money to go to his daughter's future.Honesty is a motif employed in \"The Whale\". Charlie's last fragment of his daughter is from an essay she wrote in year 8, which analyses \"Moby Dick\". He cherishes this essay as it is an honest and beautiful reflection of the novel. The film alludes to the convention of hiding behind mundanity to hide true feelings of sadness in the form of literature, but it also can transcend social media today. The appreciation of his daughter's honesty in her writings is a fragment of his daughter that he holds onto deeply.\"The Whale\" concentrates on Charlie's anguish that his oncoming death was the sole reason for reaching out to his lost family, an act that he could never do before and now is too late. Fraser's performance is tear-jerking and oscar worthy. Sink and Chau are profound supporting members who ensure the cohesion and ultimate authenticity of the relations of their story.",

Fraser portrays the character of Charlie, a morbidly obese man who is grieving the loss of his partner and trying to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter. Fraser's portrayal of Charlie is nothing short of remarkable, as he brings depth and authenticity to the character's struggles and pain.Fraser's performance in \"The Whale\" is undeniably one of the best of the year, making him an obvious candidate for the Best Actor award. He embodies Charlie's physical and emotional challenges with such conviction that it's hard not to be moved by his performance. The chemistry between Fraser and his co-star, Zosia Mamet, who plays Charlie's daughter, also deserves recognition for its authenticity and rawness.The movie's poignant storyline left me sobbing as it tackled themes of grief, loss, and family relationships. The film does an excellent job of balancing moments of levity with moments of heart-wrenching sadness, creating a rollercoaster of emotions that kept me engaged from start to finish.However, one issue I had with the film was its length. At times, the pacing felt slow, and the film could have been edited down to make it more concise. Nonetheless, the emotional impact of the story and the outstanding performances from the cast more than make up for this minor drawback.Overall, The Whale is a powerful and moving film that showcases Brendan Fraser's impressive talent and acting range. It's a must-watch for anyone who appreciates a well-crafted and emotionally resonant story.",

It is a film that it is impossible not to generate some kind of feeling in the viewer from the moment the film begins, sometimes it is difficult to watch because of all these feelings that they generate or even prejudices, like those seen in Charlie's class in which, out of shame, he never allowed his students to see him (however, you have to see the expressions that many had, as well as the pizza delivery man). Charlie prefers to die in a painful way, since it is his way of punishing himself for his \"mistakes\", especially with his daughter.

            "content": "Crumpled and with a lot of grammatical and punctuation errors.I would like to start with a comparison with previous paintings\nA small remark: the opinion is subjective and is based more on an emotional response during viewing. Factors such as budget and scope of events are secondary.So. Taking into account the fact that the film receives the highest rating from me, namely 10 \\ 10 points, questions should be asked by type: the better this film is than the author's previous works and the more so the better it is +-1450 of the other films viewed with a lower rating. I will try to briefly justify such a high rating below.I'll start with something in common, namely the emotions that this movie caused while watching.Weeping.. lots of tears.. haahahha okay not much. There were 3 moments, 2 of which just made me cry, but the third... This is the final picture, its culmination. Digression: as far as I remember, the first words spoken in the film are the reading of a certain essay (about the author of which we learn only at the end) and the film ends with the same essay, only this time it is not the main character who reads it, but its author himself. It would be nice to draw some kind of parallel and analysis here. I want to write about the looping of the work ( this technique was used in the author 's last picture , but more directly or something ) is it more abstract here?! I've lost the essence of what I've written... Oh, yes, emotions! The finale of the picture shows the development of the character, the achievement of the final result. He becomes as happy as on the best (okay, not on the best day of his life. There is a gluing showing a moment of rest with his family when he was happy being with them before he decided to leave them. After his relationship after marriage, after a short communication with his daughter in the last week of his life, he finds happiness and is literally able to soar above the ground ( of course, these frames are an artistic technique and only part of the final scene, but even without them, the hero makes efforts and only at the end becomes capable of actions that he did not commit for a long period of time. How badly it's all written, well, as it is))) these are closed brackets and not closed brackets, like funny.Comparison with past works can still write?!Neither the Requiem for a dream, nor the Wrestler, nor the Black Swan, with all its advantages in the form of music by the actors of editing and locations, did not knock out so many emotions from me. The film Kit, though stingy on characters and locations (there is only 1 location in the film, not counting one flashback), but he wins with emotions and characters. Since they are related to each other and their interaction.To write more... Okay, this is not a review. I don't know how to write them, this is the second one in 19 years.In principle, everything that I wrote about comparing with the best works of the director is also suitable for other films. If the picture is capable of evoking strong emotions, this is an excellent picture that should be recommended to everyone. Whether it's comedy or horror (the simplest films in terms of emotions. If the comedy is funny, it's a good comedy, if the horrors are scary, it's a good horror movie. There's drama right there. A drama about people, and to be quite precise, a drama of one person and in a drama (well, again, to write that it is more difficult for a drama to evoke emotions is stupid. A clarification is needed: a feeling of fear or fun, as for me, is easier than sympathy and experience for a character who should cause disgust or something like that, therefore, since the film Whale (about which it can be read in the annotation) causes strong emotions with all its simplicity of the plot and unpleasant (at first glance) main thing hero = the movie is great\n( I lost the essence of the sentence, so the ending is so-so)\nI would like to end this text with a call to watch this movie. This is definitely the best film of 2022 (it's good that you don't have to choose between him and Pinocchio Guillermo del Toro, because the latter is a cartoon)\nTo watch strictly in the original with subtitles !!!It would be nice to reread what was written, but I'm afraid there will be a desire to erase everything, so let it be as it will be.",

The acting (minus Sadie Sink aka the daughter) was absolutely amazing. Not that I don't think she can act but rather her character isn't developed enough to get over her awfulness. I wasn't big on the character in Stranger Things and it's pretty much the same thing here with more foul language. That said, Brendan Frazer was absolutely amazing. Deserves all the accolades he's been getting. I also think the Liz character was so well done as well as Thomas. This all suffers from bad writing unfortunately. With this level of acting and cast they could have hit a home run and possibly made one of the best films of all time but there were little things here and there that just sucked like why the heck is there a pizza guy (Thomas). It's like they wrote him in with all kinds of foreshadowing and then did nothing but look at 'the whale' and then run off. It could have easily been done without the setup like some salesman comes to the door. That said, there are some religious overtones but it doesn't get preachy and it doesn't force it down your throat. I think there's something to be said about that. I'm not religious and hate when people use the generic route of \"welp, it's god\" so it is refreshing to have sort of a weird take on that piece. Again, all of these people deserve any award they get.. From super hero movies to reboots of everything, it's nice to see something original and well acted. Bravo.",

            "content": "With the seemingly creatively bankrupt content Hollywood and big studios have been spewing out over the years I was incredibly surprised to see a movie that actually made me feel anything.Based on a stage play The Whale is filmed almost entirely in an apartment over the course of a week. It's total cast of characters is 6 people.The plot is literally the most basic thing you can get. A dying man trying to reconnect with his angry 16/17 year old daughter. Interestingly while this is the main plot it doesn't smother the side stories. At it's core it's a story of redemption and there is no antagonist, no protagonist, no good, no bad. Just hurt people trying to feel less hurt.Fraser does an amazing job of Charlie. He manages to make him feel simultaneously repulsive and sympathetic. He goes from gorging on a meatball sub, slobbering and chomping to tearfully telling his daughter she's a wonderful person as she tells him to hurry up and die. It shows his difficulty doing simple things like getting up. His shame is particular apparent he teaches without a webcam, he has Dan the pizza boy leave pizza at the door and leaves cash in the mail box so he doesn't see him. His only friend and link to the outside world is Liz, a nurse who is his late boyfriends sister and his enabler.I wasn't too enthusiastic about Sadie Sink as Ellie, Charlie's estranged daughter but she nailed it. Sadie has the raw anger and hurt of an abandoned and humiliated girl nailed. She's chaotic and acid tongued doing what she can to try and make the person who hurt her feel the pain she felt.A lot of this movie can be translated into our own lives. One particular scene after Dan finally see's Charlie, Charlie suffers a terrible binge eating episode. It sent chills through my blood because I know the place he was in that dark empty void. Replace food with whatever your 'crutch' is: sex, drinking, cutting, gambling, shopping, whatever it is we've all been to that dark place, we've all gorged ourselves to try to stop the pain and we've suffered the consequences afterwards. In Charlie's case vomiting everything up.I've already mentioned that the film is shot almost entirely in one apartment to enthasise Charlie's isolation but it's also shot in almost entire gloom and rain except for the last scene which I have to give props because the contrast is very noticeable and I didn't appreciate by how much.All in all The Whale is a very human movie. It's not escapism as such but a homage to honesty, vulnerability, hurt, love and forgiveness. It gives us the chance to recognise these traits in ourselves and in a world where we seem to get less honest and less vulnerable behind our filters that is something worth remembering: We're all human and we all hurt.",

It is depressing, emotionally tense and painful. Watching Charlie struggle with his addiction, being hurled abuse by his estranged daughter (although not without reason), his ailing body slowly trapping him and killing him - and his appearance treated by others with shock and disgust, it's tragic to witness what Charlie goes through in the one week of his life we see on film.The film wasn't perfect - although the cast did an amazing job, there were little moments of overacting that sometimes disrupted the film's pulse.But just for that last scene, I'd watch the film again.The raw emotion of the last scene - the music, the emotional and superb delivery by Fraser and Sink just blasts you into this state of being where you're just overcome by the vulnerabilities spilled out by the two characters in their shared moment of honesty.We can't save ourselves, or the people we love, but we'll always try.",

I couldn't understand Charlie til the end of the movie. He got what he got coming in his life. I'm sorry. You can't move on to another relationship without getting a closure in the relationship that you were before. I don't care if you have fallen in love, you have to say goodbye to your last lover. If you don't, you can't pretend you're not gonna have karma as soon as your new relationship fails. And if your last relationship came with a daughter, you NEED to put an end to that relationship, if you want to start a new one. Charlie didn't, It's selfish and narcissistic. Typical men behaviour. You can cry and play the victim now when you were seeing another person and being unloyal to your lover with another person... you had a daughter... say goodbye to that lover, then start a new relationship.

Although you feel sorry for the main character, you see he doesn't feel sorry for himself and only cares about helping others especially his estranged daughter. As someone that has been disabled for the past 9 months, I definitely understood the struggle of performing even basic daily activities.

Not with each person, with the person and themselves. For example, Charlie hates being fat, but loves food which makes him fat. His friend Liz hates the church for what it did to her brother, but loves Charlie for being the ultimate reason for the church hurting her brother. This is evident in each character and makes for a fascinating study of human emotions. Yea, yea, yea. But the story, though, the story? It moves through the characters and keeps you in the edge of your seat without frustrating you waiting for answers and resolutions. You live in each moment with the characters. Their stories are so intricate that you want to dwell on each one, chew it slowly, and enjoy the feeling. Like eating the best chocolate you've ever hate. (However, Fraser's 100 pound prosthetics suit definitely inspires one to put down the nachos.) The script is from a play and you can see that which is disappointing because a movie should bring more if a cinematic experience. The story has to stay in one physical place in the play, but here they could've included seeing the characters in their own environments. That's minor, though. At the end of the movie, the entire audience just sat there for several minutes. We couldn't move. We didn't know if we should be happy or sad at the ending. But it doesn't matter. If you like analysing the characters, peeling back the layers, looking for the double meanings in every single thing, this should be on your list of things to do, immediately. Fraser definitely deserves an Oscar, even if he doesn't win. 10/10 for entertainment value. 10/10 for the acting. 10/10 for the story.",

And the hype that accompanied the film gave me dizzying expectations.Instead of a grandiose follow up to \"requiem\", we get a very intimate, adaption of a self-obsessed play by Samuel D Hunter (the play is semi auto-biographical).The scriptwriter doesn't just tell us about his troubles about being accepted as a gay man, he SHOUTS then at us. And it has nothing to do with obesity or the challenges of raising children, with both arcs ending up as 'excuses' to bring up 'the impossible love story' over and over and over and over again.Aronofsky clever use of mathematical references echoing 'Pi', biblical allegories and even the 4:3 format do not allow it to break the confines of a script that's teasing the viewer with great promise but no actual delivery.The 'litterally' arc was promising, a kauffmanesque approach to raw emotion put on paper.

This works perfectly as Charlie's interactions are only with: his estranged teenage daughter, his carer/friend (who has a major connection that explains her relationship with Charlie) and the delivery guy, who visits the front door so often, without actually meeting Charlie f2f, he becomes concerned and tries to slowly befriend him, through maybe curiosity or concern. The story plays out subtly and slowly with a pace that allows you to feel and empathise with all of the characters who interact with Charlie. They themselves have their moments and issues, but it is Charlie you really feel for as you begin to see inside his life and his mind, his regret and despair, his pain and ultimate despondence whilst also wishing to fulfil his wish to reconnect with Ellie and let her know how important she and the essay written by her 8 year old self is to him and finally him being able to be at peace. I would have really liked some flashbacks or some insight into his life with Ellie and her Mom, and the transition from that life to his life with Alan, and how Alan made the decision to end it. The background to Charlie's life would maybe make a great prequel to this beautiful yet uncomfortable movie which brought tears to me at the end. Wonderful performance from Brendan.

This is the first time I enjoy being in the theater watching one of his movies, I was too young when Black Swan and Requiem for a Dream came out to see them in the big screen but nevertheless those two movies have been in my favorite since I first saw them.\"Noe\" and \"Mother!\" were the first experiences I had of finally being old enough to see a Darren Aronofsky's film on the big screen but nothing like today, today I went to see \"The Whale\" and it is a beautiful movie.Breaks my heart how real this movie feels, and it inspires me how many people this movie can touch and possibly help them get back on their feet.This movie hits different if we know the actor, Brendan Fraser, struggled with difficulties prior to doing this role, realism is brought to this film in a unique way and my empathy for this human left me with tears. Perfect told story and even better execution, it really shows how much caring was put into making this piece of art.",

It caused me to tear up a few times. I liked that it wasn't predictable, and I wasn't sure what I was getting into from the start. Fraser really makes you sympathize with the character and feel frustrated on his behalf for the way he is treated and the position he is in. As the plot unfolds, the reasons for his actions begin to make more sense, and it is beautifully sad. It makes you just want to give the character a big bear hug! His pain feels so real, and I'm sure people who have struggled with parenting and/or morbid obesity/health problems can relate. All the actors did a really good job in their roles!The only thing I'm taking off a star for is that I didn't like the way the ending was presented as open, but that's typical artsy/A24 films for you.",

            "content": "In my book, filming a play and calling it a film doesn't work. Film obeys different rules ro theatre and the successful transitions such as Virginia Woolf, 12 Angry Men and Streetcar all have one thing in common. They were all made for cinema, adding intimacy and closeness that theatre cannot give.The Whale is a play filmed as a play and apart from the central performance is acted out by the cast as a play. Melodramatic lines that may well work on stage are delivered here without any nuance or understanding and the camera emphasises it all as phony as it blows it all up a zillion fold. Reaching out to a crowd from a stage distance is not the same as cinema where every expression is underlined and picked up.There is also very little effort in characterisation from all the players here and though a few things are alluded to, some things don't add up. If Ellie is such a one note hater, I struggle that all of a sudden we have soft moments without warning only to revert to the one behaviour we seem to get. The mother is unbearable and very over the top acting doesn't help. Even the few tears seem fake, rolling silently as is now the fashion of any movie or series. There is a sentiment of fakeness for a film that talks so much about 'honesty' all the time.I also think that Charlie's destruction could have been with anything else (gambling, alcohol, etc) and that we are shown what we already know as part of an obese person perspective far too many times in an effort to add gravitas and/or titillating revulsion.The conclusion, when it finally comes, ain't nothing that was a surprise and in a story that could have been so much better further weakens the movie adding a sort of Hollywood relative 'happy ending' that is simply not ringing true.I did not dislike it and I certainly did not like it either. It did not move me and I was glad when it's 2 hour screen time was finally up. As a piece of cinema it stands pretty worthless to me and I am guessing that in a few years time it will join the rank of those worthwhile movies everyone talked about for a while but no one remembers like Children Of A Lesser God...",

I am happy at least because the protagonist is. It is 9 and not 10 as to my opinion with about 10 minutes less the emotional volume would be higher. I also waiting a link berween obesity and repressed emotions. I am sad as some film critics are strict towards this film.

I love Aronofsky and has appreciated every bleak film he has made, but I felt like this one was much more hopeful. That's just my opinion, I know plenty of other people feel the opposite. I know that this film is meant to be a sappy drama but it worked for me, by the last scene I was drenched in tears lol. I went into the plot of this film pretty much blind and I'm so glad I did. I had seen some of the hype and was excited, but I was not going to go into this film with rose colored glasses. Noah was the last Aronofsky film that I saw in theaters. I have seen all of his feature length films and it was the only one that I just hated. So if it would have missed the mark it would have sucked. But it didn't at all in my opinion. I thought that the black of an advertising campaign was great. I highly recommend the Whale to anyone who wants to watch a slow burning, intense drama that deals with themes such as regret, shame, guilt, bad health, or anything similar to those topics.",

The same rules apply for directors and even film composers , actually I'd watch a terrible film just for the film score (Ennio Morricone's scored some stinkers).I have even been known to be swayed by some reviews. I know of a film buff who watches religiously films reviewed by Mark Kermode, in turn he does a Kermode and invariably writes a pretentious review in the vain attempt of getting a recognition from his hero Kermode.. any way on reading of the reviews on IMDB I followed the critics advice which I will quote in full to reference my reason for not watching this film.\"I'm by no means unemotional when it comes to watching films. I've cried buckets at loads of films recently, from Mrs Harris goes to Paris (yes, honest), to Till (no surprise there) and back to The Last Bus. But I cry when I'm moved. I cry when I'm angry. I cry when I'm happy. I don't cry when I feel I've been manipulated to cry\"so thanks to Michael Kerrigan who ever he maybe I decided not to watch this film.",

Now the movie is about a man who teaches classes online that left his wife and kid (Sadie sink) for one of his male members of one of his classes which wasn't done online. He fell for his pupil and left his family but his partner commits suicide leaving Charlie behind who Now wants to reconnect with his Now 16 year old daughter as he has grown obese with his loss and is dying. So the story takes through the last week of his life and him trying to connect with his daughter as he knows he was in love with his partner but also feels he had let his family at the time down. I felt so so emotional during the movie as you could see how much of a decent human being Charlie was and the regrets he has in life catch up with him at the end.

The film depicts this perfectly.Darren Aronofsky's direction is in a stage play format making you feel like you are in the scene with the characters. Very often it can be a hit or miss. But was a hit for me. He is a fearless veteran of film making. I have loved him since Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain.Brendan Fraser delivers brilliance. His heart wrenching performance stands out the most. His depiction of grief and helplessness is deeply relatable and you empathize him the most.Sadie Sink's character would have been easily despised and superficial, had she not delivered on the complexity of her conflicting emotions. An amazing portrayal of a daughter abandoned, yet having love and forgiveness deep within her for her dying father. An upcoming A+ actress of her generation.Hong Chau's subtle performance of a caretaker, her own grief, guilt and how that ties into her relationship with Charlie is beautiful. I have never scene her acting before but would sure watch out from now on.The last scene where Charlie walks towards his daughter, in his eyes finally doing something right, left me in tears.One of my favourites of all time.

The movie is made in such a way that I believe it is up to you to interpret the characters the way you want. Everyone is the movie does pretty much the exact opposite of what they should be doing because they think it's what's best for everyone.We do have to make some assumptions. Not everything is explained and outright said. You have to make inferences based on the dialogue and use context clues to understand each character's motivations. Charlie due to various life circumstances believed he was alone and that no one cared for so, so long. But when he started getting sick it was clear that his family, friend, heck even the pizza guy and his students cared about him and we're concerned.I think this movie is about so many different things. But mostly it's about how living our lives as authentically and as honestly as possible is the only important and worth while thing we can do. It's also about how human beings cannot help but care about others no matter how hard they might try not to. It's about how loving and caring about other can sometimes make us act in selfish and enabling ways.It's a beautiful movie that left me stunned and speechless.

The wife forgives the man who left her with a child and ruined her life because he \"fell in love\". He didn't give her the money he squirrelled away. The sister of his partner gives up her life to nurse the man who reacted to loss by eating himself to death. Oh and the young man who stole and lied is saved by the daughter, who benefits nothing and is misunderstood and hates by her mother. So all the women give and suffer and save all the men.Of course that's reductivist and there is complexity and much sensitive layering in this film of human frailty.

Secondly, some random guy comes in trying to preach to Brandon and honestly I didn't like how the Bible was misinterpreted throughout the movie. As a Christian, I'm not perfect but some of the Bible verses I thought was wrongfully used in the movie-It just didn't sit right with me. Lastly, having to watch a fat person shove food in his mouth was stomach upsetting for me. I mean I literally could not eat after watching this movie, definitely spoiled my appetite. Great actors but terrible nasty film. I would have liked to see Brandon F. Make a comeback in another movie with a more masculine character. In my opinion the movie script was disturbing and awful.

Like I said, slow or talky movies aren't really my cup of tea so there were moments where I was a little bored as I have a very short attention span. The only reason I didn't give this movie a 9/10 was for that reason. My brother (who I saw this with) absolutely loved it. He didn't stop talking about it all the way home. This sort of movie is his favourite and he thought it was amazing. I would definitely give this movie a watch if it's your thing or even if it's not.

            "content": "The Whale is a movie that I went in with many expectations, many of which where very high, and that were certainly met. And I think the best way to start is by looking at the narrative and some of the symbolic gestures that you can see in them. So let's start with the good ones:One of course is the aspect of shame. \"The Whale\" portrays shame in a way that is somewhat unique. The protagonist, played by Brendan Frazier, is a character that is ashamed of himself. It is a shame that probably everyone of us knows- the loathing of the self and the own body. But, of course, taken to an extreme. As Charlies character is morbily, borderline disgustingly obese, the point of connection between the viewer and the protagonist shrink. I would say that most of us begin to distance our own sense of shame for what WE are with the shame that Charlie feels. Because most people have problems with their social lives, with their bodies, with their loved ones and their sexual lives probably as well. But not in the sense of being so obese that even the easiest things become a literal obsticle.And oh, there are many obsticles that we as a viewer didn't even think of and that contribute to the shame. Charlie cannot stand up. Not in any way- not for himself, not physically, not even against his own daughter to whom he has a very distanced and unpersonal relationship with. Things that fall on the floor become unreachable to him, because of his obivous problems (first and foremost being the metonymical \"whale\" in the story) getting the best of him.The Whale mixes the emoitons of shame perfectly with the emotion of disgust. Disgust comes in form of looking at a man refusing to get help- an easy answer to a huge problem- being overweight. It's actually the crux of every issue that the character Charlie has- he suffers from strokes, heart attacks etc. These are the obvious causes of his extremely incontrollable livestyle.But- as with the key that fell to the floor- the easy solution becomes unreachable and thus frustrating and disgusting to look at. Disgusting as in that we SEE how Charlie copes with his emotional issues- mainly his family issues with his extremely disgustingly behaving daughter. The coping mechanism (food) is what drives the movie. But there is more to it.The last aspect is, as mentioned, the daughter. Here is what makes the movie so great. Her actions are, truly and whole-heartedly, the ones that ARE disgusting. Not the.binge eating and gorging of Frazier, but the little and/or obvious intollerable acts of the daughter, who abuses the unconditional love of her father, is the thing that we should feel ashamed and disgusted about.So where does the movie leave us? Again: the \"easy\" things in live become unreachable. The easy things for so many, as having a more or less ok relationship with our loved ones, having more or less bodies that we can \"work\" and live with and the relationship with the aspect of mortility become a burden for Charlie.And thus, Charlie deteriorates before our eyes. And we cannot help but see, and feel helpless, ashamed and appalled. Disgust comes in many ways and in many shapes and sizes.",

            "review_title": "I Want To Talk About The Whale",
            "content": "It's very rare that a film is able to pierce deep inside of me and bring out emotions I'd forgotten I had. The Whale is simply a work of art. It's not perfect by any means. There are portions that are very slow and mundane, there are many grotesque scenes, and ultimately if you can't handle depression and mental health disorder then this movie is probably not for you. However, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for one reason and one reason alone.....IT WAS REAL.I didn't feel like I was watching a Hollywood movie with actors pretending to be regular people. I felt like I was just a fly on the wall of man suffering from tremendous guilt, anxiety, and depression. Things like this happen everyday to each of us. We all struggle with issues that we are ashamed of and don't want to the world to know about. We all have things in our life that we have done wrong that has left us full of regret just like Charlie. And if you cannot find one thing in this film that you can relate to then I question your existence as a human on this planet.The life of Charlie is a life that very few would want to live. He was morbidly obese and in consistent pain day in and day out. He had chronic medical conditions and could barely even stand up on his own. He lost his partner to self deletion. And worse of all he had a daughter that he had not seen in 9 years who hated and despised him. But despite all of that Charlie did have one thing that we all have, Charlie had a heart.While his physical heart was on it's final stages his real heart, or rather who he was still shined through. Charlie was authentic because he knew he was wrong and he knew he messed up....big time. He chose to be romantically involved with one of his students over his own family. This makes Charlie unredeemable in the eyes of many, and rightfully so. How dare he leave his wife and 8 year old daughter to be with some young hot fling, who is the same sex as him by the way?The amount of hurt that Charlie cause not only his wife, but most importantly his daughter is immense. His daughter clearly loved him for who he was. She didn't hate him when she was 8 and he was around. She didn't wish for him to die when they spent time together as a family. It's only when he abandoned his responsibilities as a husband and a father that she developed a deep resentment for him. No matter how much money Charlie saved, or sent, no amount of money could replace him actually being there and present in his child's life. Any kid who grew up with one parent, or as an orphan, will tell you that. Money doesn't replace time spent together.And Charlie recognized this. That is what made him special. Charlie was deeply conflicted because he let his flesh pull him away from his family, which he knew was not right. However, he still did not want to completely abdicate his will to ensure that his daughter had what she needed. Once Charlie's partner died Charlie then began to sink slowly into the depths. Yet, before he let go from this world he decided the last thing he would do is try to reach out to his daughter one final time and see if he can reform a bond, or rekindle any kind of love that had been lost between them.Ellie being rude, abrasive, arrogant, and blunt initially wanted nothing to do with Charlie. And could you blame her? She put him away from her mind a long time ago. For nine years she had no father to help her, guide her, and be there for her. Why should she all of a sudden be open to hearing from him now just because his life is coming to an end? Why should she allow him to try and right his wrongs with her now that he is dying when he had years to do that before, yet he chose to be with his partner, Alan, instead?This is where the beauty of the whale comes in to play. In my opinion this movie gracefully incorporates Christianity (which is heavily discussed in the film) into it's entire premise because what is The Whale ultimately about? It's about forgiveness. Charlie realizes that he is a fallen soul and that he has not done right by his ex wife, his friend who cares for him, and most important his daughter, Ellie. He knows this to be true. Yet, all Charlie can do in the span of a week is simply, in his own way, ask Ellie to forgive him. She longed for a father and he was no where to be found. This lead her to turn into the troubled teen that she was, but Ellie was NOT a bad person.Just because she was rude and abrasive does not make her a bad person. Her mother even thought she was evil, but Charlie could see through her. Ellie had a good heart, but she was just heart broken that her father left her and her mom. It made her feel like she wasn't good enough for him. And although it took some unorthodox methods of convincing Ellie to forgive him, despite everything she'd been through she eventually opened up her heart and forgave her father for his iniquities. That's what makes The Whale beautiful. Ellie does not owe this forgiveness to her father. She is well within her right to walk away and never speak to him again. She would not be wrong to let him die in his misery. But she doesn't do this.She realizes that even though her dad made horrid life choices and is a big bag of mistakes he still loves her and cares about her. He did check up on her and got what little information he could about her through his ex-wife. And Ellie realizes this in time. She sees how much Charlie loved her review of Moby Dick and how he cherished what she had written. She saw that he truly thought the world of her and she was more than good enough for him as a daughter. She decided to re-open her heart to him in his final moments and when she called him Daddy it was then in his final stage that he new she had forgiven him and that she does love him. And although his life was over, he was able to be at peace and atone to Ellie for his sins. This is what makes The Whale beautiful.",

Not through flashbacks or other cheap story telling devices, but through some excellent acting and dialogue. All of the characters here feel fully realized and tangible. You'll probably hate some of them, some will make you angry and some might make you cry.Ultimately, to me, this was a film about the way mental health issues can ravage and destroy a life.To see someone who has been consumed and distorted by their mental state, to the detriment of everything and everyone around them, is something I found relatable and moving.The difference here though, is within the protagonist, there is a glimmer of hope.It's beautiful and moving.The soundtrack deserves commendation too.

December 2010. Something I should never do again, because the film still occupied me all night into the new year. But this experience had paid off like no other, before that I really had no comparable mood when visiting the cinema ( it was a preliminary premiere in Berlin before Black Swan on the 20th. January 2011 officially launched in German cinemas ). In recent years, this cinematic trip with Natalie Portman's acting performance, which is still unforgettable, has hardly been able to offer any other psychological drama to the water -, not Darren Aronofsky's last two filmsAbout Darren Aronofsky's latest directorial work The Whale was not too well known before today's world premiere in Venice and only two central information got through to me in advance: First, it is a film adaptation of the celebrated, Broadway of the same name - Plays written by Samuel D. Hunter ( of whom I had never heard of ). Secondly, so far there was only a portrait photo of the rather overweight Brendan Fraser (The mummy- Triloge ) penetrated to me. This worried me more, when for almost all other competitive films, significantly more eddies are held in advance, mostly with a first trailer.I am all the more pleased that The Whale the biggest surprise of the festival so far is and not only left me emotionally overwhelmed. Like back then Black Swan, the minimalist, theatrical drama caught me and everyone around me with a flood of feelings that I have had difficulty expressing since last night. The atmosphere in the cinema was extremely impressive, long after the end credits began. The undeniable star of the evening even got a round of special applause to show his name.Darren Aronofsky has taken on a physical topic again. It is about the English teacher Charlie ( Brendan Fraser ), who only offers anonymously online writing courses because he suffers from a pathological overweightness. When his days are numbered, he tries his 17-year-old daughter Ellie (Stranger Things-Star Sadie Sink ), who has not been part of his life for eight years now. When he left his wife ( Samantha Morton ) for his new love, she also completely broke off the contact between father and daughter. ( from here the lag starts, but can be avoided depending up on your mood)Darren Aronofsky himself is said to have said that he was concerned with people who are struggling with obesity and are therefore often condemned and rejected, to give a stage for your outer and inner world. So Hunter's play came just right. And it almost sounds a little too humble, because The Whale is fortunately so much more than just a film about the everyday life of a obese, makes you think so many times and releases your audience with a multifaceted redemption, that moves to tears.",

As someone that's worked with mental illness, (eating disorders not my speciality) I felt the film really glossed over the complexities that the character should have embodied.As someone who was raised on the horror genre (something Aaronofsky's touched upon historically), I felt like I could see the joins in the fat suit and whilst Fraser's more/less convincing, I didn't feel his physicality was. Maybe I would have believed John Goodman?What I felt was maybe, the strongest part of the film, that genuinely surprised me and I'm beating around the bush here, but... I came away from this, kind of despising obese people. Like the christian character - they do it to themselves and others enable them and frankly both Fraser and the christian child in it really filled me with revulsion. I'll generally cry at most \"emotional\" films, but for some reason this really \"triggered\" me and I can't put it down to any personal experience either. Maybe it was \"too hyped\", to much pre-press, but 10 minutes in and I'm annoyed at Fraser, then the enabling nurse/helper/rag on a stick wielder - that's probably what annoyed me the most, seeing a medical or \"caring\" professional taking such a dreadful and destructive part in this man's life - she's more like Ahab than anyone else in the film, both at least fall under the \"gross misconduct\" banner and if that's the best metaphor the film summons from me, I'll call it a failure.Disappointing.",

The coloring, the score, the weather, the apartment, Brendan's character, Charlie, all are deeply depressing with only subtle cracks of light peeking through and those - in my opinion - have the most tear-jerking reactions of all. Try to avoid the deep reviews before you watch as they'll probably force you to experience the movie differently. The only thing I'll let you know ahead of time is that this is remastered from a play of the same name so the whole knock-at-the-door and the \"who's there?!\" trope is a bit overdone and is hard to appreciate offstage but still worth a watch despite that. Final Verdict: Brandon needs an Oscar for this role (Sorry, George of the Jungle). The movie? A little too much sensationalizing of obesity and not enough beefiness in the plot but Aronofsky provides something undoubtedly worth watching.",

The taunts,the name calling,being told to look in the mirror and being made to feel like you are less than you are,It helps to portray that weight is not just a case of \"eat less,move more\" a phrase that i have personally heard too many times but in fact that eating is connected to the emotional state of the mind also. Part of the movie shocked me as we don't really think of someone that weighs that much as having thoughts of a sexual nature the same as anyone else but well. Why wouldn't they? It's normal. I was also struck by how much our appearance can be judged, I mean when you are just a voice people tend to listen to you without prejudice but when they get the full picture, your words don't seem to have the same impact. There are not many movies that can keep your attention for the whole movie with only a handful of characters, but the acting from Brendan Fraser and indeed all the characters was so good and so pure,it is hard not to get engrossed in the storyline even though as i said it does at times make you feel uneasy. This movies deserves every award that is coming to it and hopefully it will make some people think about how they treat others.",

He was the embodiment of the worst of mankind, the apex of selfishness. How could anyone care for him on any level?The daughter was way over the top, the character was over acted, and nonsensical. The whole plot thread with her and the bible salesman was an ugly add on.I would've liked the movie to end with Fraser's character alone and showing that he was the villian in this story.

He didn't want to continue living in this world, but he wanted to make sure that his daughter was well.

A man who has been in that condition for so many years is deeply depressed and has no desire to go on.I also thought it was an exceptional detail when Charlie tells his daughter that he was in love and that it was not her fault.

            "review_title": "The Whale: An Honest Review",
            "content": "I heard about the controversy surrounding the film and I have read many of the polarized reactions around it. Before we get into the narrative, it needs to be said: Charlie is not \"fat.\" He is a bariatric patient. This isn't mocking someone for being a few pounds overweight, this is a human being suffering from a serious medical condition. The film portrays this suffering honestly. If someone feels \"disgust\" with this film, it says more of their predisposition than what's on screen.This story is not about being fat. This could just as well of been someone drinking themselves to death or taking hard narcotics.The Whale isn't asking us to be disgusted by it's characters or even to pity them. It is honest. Brutally so. Aronofsky is trying to get you to feel with them, not for them. To try to truly empathize not just sympathize.This a powerfully empathetic study of how someone can devastate and eventually destroy themselves trying to fill the hole inside. The hole left by loss and grief that all of the players in The Whale (Fraser, Chau and Sink especially) portray so beautifully, painfully and honestly.Brandan Fraser's Charlie loses his family and his job. A choice he made, true, but an honest choice done not out of selfishness but out of love. Then he loses him too.Sadie Sink lost her father. She acts out angrily and spitefully at the world trying to get someone, Anyone to acknowledge her. Someone that will acknowledge her pain and her loneliness. She's lost in plain sight and the people in her life don't truly see her until she reconnects with her father.Ty Simpkins and Samantha Morton give understated but strong performances of lonely, suffering characters in their own rights. Simpkins is losing his faith and desperately clinging on to it. He is hoping and praying for a miracle, a purpose, a higher calling; for something, anything to have meaning. Morton has lost her husband and lost connection with her only child. She fills this with the more cinematically traditonal (and critically palatable) flaw of alcoholism. If this was like most films, Charlie wouldn't be a bariatric patient. He would more likely be an alcoholic or a drug addict. Maybe that would be less controversial or polarizing.Hong Chau (in yet another strong performance from her) has lost the only true family she has. As an adopted child she doesn't know her biological parents and she despises her adoptive parents for reasons laid out in the film. Her adoptive brother is gone and she is now losing his lover, her last connection to him, in front of her eyes. How she fills that hole is by caring for others. Disassociating from her own needs so that she doesn't have to feel that pain. I personally empathize with Chau the most. I'm a medic and have dealt with many bariatric patients. It is difficult for me at the moment to think of anything more personally painful than trying to save someone and watch them fade away.Charlie isn't \"fat.\" This is not a fat shaming film. The reviewers who claim that the film \"leeringly treats Charlie as an unsightly object of pity throughout\"\u00b9 and is \"fatphobic\"\u00b9 are speaking of their own discomfort more than the quality of the film itself. The Whale is also not saying that \"the abused should love and forgive their abusers,\"\u00b2 as some other critics have stated. It merely proposes that we see them as human.Aronofsky has never been a terribly empathetic filmmaker before. What he has always been brilliant at is his study with obsession. Obsession with order (Pi 1998) with fame (The Wrestler 2008) with perfection (Black Swan 2010.) This is a welcome emotional shift for him as an artist. While his previous work looked at the choices we make for oursleves out of obsession and (let's be honest) a certain degree of selfishness, The Whale explores the ramifications of those choices. It shows the deep guilt and shame that can come from that for us along with the accompanying pain and hurt inflicted on those our decisions affect, whether intentional or not.I don't believe \"that the film's empathy was only superficial\" or \"reinforced anti-fat stereotypes and preconceptions.\"\u00b3 This film to me, more than anything else, felt honest. The Whale shows all of its characters to be flawed. However none of them are evil or disgusting. They are human.\u00b9Mark Hanson, Slant Magazine\n\u00b2Katie Rife, Polygon\n\u00b3Roxanne Gay, The New York Times.",

I think the movie could have greatly benefited from more use of the medium it was using. By showing us instead of telling us everything this movie could have invoked much more emotion out of me. Instead it presents itself in a stiff manner, which I understand it might be trying to make me feel stuck in one place such as he literally is.

            "content": "I just saw this movie with my Dad and we both loved it. It's a movie whereby you're still trying to puzzle everything out hours after. I've looked at certain reviews whereby they called brendan and his daughter one dimensional and I honestly couldn't think this is further from the case. We see a key aspect of the film is honesty. That's what Brendan seeks from others and what his daughter tries to present to the world through her random posts on her facebook page of others when they least expect (or want it) presented. You could also say at this point it's a skewed honesty, a cynical one, showing her obese father and Thomas' smoking, of course as the angsty daughter who \"hates everyone\" (in her own words) it makes perfect sense. Then for Brendan, who asks honesty of both his daughter and his students, but of course only presents that honesty (by turning on his camera) in his final moments. He remains optimistic throughout the movie and it might seem questinoable, but for him life is still beautiful, just not his. He wishes to wallow in his self-loathing alone, he sees it as an issue unto himself and blames himself for it. Hence why he doesn't resent the world. I don't see this as a movie where it demands you have great sympathy for him through cheapt means, it's a movie that demands you accept him for who he is, the good and the bad. You accept that the eating disorder truly is disgusting and damaging in the worst way possible but you also see that he tries in his little ways to help others. He chooses not to get treatment and pretends the reason is because he wants more money for his daughter, though the reality is really that a \"helpful\" by-product of withholding treatment is that he no longer has to continue suffering in this life. It indicates the selfishness of his actions but simultaneously his desire to give to his daughter. One could make the case that the really caring thing for his daughter would've been to get the treatment he needed and make the changes in his life, much before it got to his point so that he could be in his daughter's life. Because really the money is irrelevant in the grands scheme. What matters is a Father showing love for his daughter. And that's why the final moments shine. Because for once in the last 9 years of his life he got up and \"fought\" in his own way for his daughter. He showed how much he cared and that that gift (showing he cares) will be much more beneficial than the windfall she will receive upon his death. There's so much to unpack in this movie. For example, he feeds the birds. And your initial impression of this is that he is a kind person who still cares for life in his own way. You later ssee, after his daughter notices this, and so does he, that the plate where the birds eat from has been broken. My interpretation is that the daughter broke it. And if you work from the assumption that she isn't really a bad person (she does things that may be an affront though still have a moral or impetus behind them) then you wonder why she did it. I believe the bird feeding is a metaphor, for feeding others unhealthy habits. It iss not good for a bird to rely on food from humans to survive, but of course it appears to be a nice thing to do in many cases upon shallow inspection. You could draw parallels to brendan and the nurse and whether it is a similar relationship, I'm not convinced that that relationship was so damaging however, it is true that in 9 years of the \"help\" his situation only deteriorated. The case could be made either way. And I love that about this movie. I truly don't think any of these characters are shallow at all. I found the Whale so incredibly captivating despite the movie confined physically to a single apartment and indeed that it gave the intentions and meaning behind the movie that much more room to flourish.",

Who knows?The religious kid \"Thomas\" keeps coming around. Why? Because Charlie needs help! Spiritual help? So he says.Charlie's nurse or Doctor friend \"Liz\" checks on him everyday (I think), watching him eat himself to death. Charlie won't go to the hospital even when his blood pressure is literally as high as a Whales because he knows a visit will undoubtedly cost him 10's of 1000's of dollars, minimum (good ole US health care).Painfully slow and boring and set in Charlies house, because everyone seems to just drop in on him and he can't really leave.All this talk of Oscars is laughable. But we know the Oscars are a joke and always pushing a narrative. With all these gargantuan \"plus size\" models being pushed down our throats of late (some as big as Charlie).

Then gems like Bedazelled and the Mummy trilogy. I can honestly say the guy is a really likeable hero of the big screen. But this movie... What can I say, they subtracted everything the man was known for? His good looks, incredible physic, and his goofy comedy. What I witnessed is another or perhaps the highest level an actor can ever achieve. I was in awe at how he portrayed the main character and really appreciate how he transformed himself not just physically. This is acting at it's finest and I really feel he should take major awards for this.But it's not just him. The co-stars are all well casted and well directed. I also have to remark on how Sadie Sink carried the role of a rebellious teenager. Her performance is simply stunning and I'm looking forward to her next projects. Of course the other performers were also amazing and I have to mention Hong Chau's remarkable portrayal.The story was compelling and relatable specially to people like myself and it will take a long time for the images from this movie to fade from my memory. This movie is one in a million and will touch you on many levels. I urge you to watch this with a box of tissue.",

            "content": "I never write reviews, but this movie blew me away. Brendan Fraser played Charlie perfectly, like a tribute to vulnerability. Sadie Sink's, Ellie echoed, the power of unexpressed feelings gone haywire with total sincerity. Rounded off by a great cast, I did not want to miss a word of dialogue or look away. Aronofsky found the magic of his best films like Requiem and The Wrestler. A perfect 10!!Apparently you have to share 600 words in order submit your review. Now I understand why most of the reviews trail off or annoyingly re-tell the story. Is it this same sense of urging expression beyond one's ability that causes so many of the newer movies to last so long and say so little. When did our Attention Deficit community decide it needed more. Do they make more money for more words or more time on the screen? Of course the answer's, yes, inappropriately yesss!!This all speaks to what makes The Whale great, if anything, it left me wanting more...more of the... no spoilers here, nothing to worry about. Aronofsky, clearly has a grasp of the damage of holding our secrets, too deep, for too long. He also makes it clear that he knows the masses can relate. While the revealed secrets of his characters always payoff, it's the familiar tension that leads to the kind of pain that connects us all that will have me watching again (with a new box of Kleenex). Thank you for the experience!!",

            "content": "The acting in \"The Whale\" is exceptional, with Brendan Fraser delivering a powerful and moving performance as Charlie. His portrayal of the character is both vulnerable and authentic, capturing the pain and suffering of a man struggling with his own demons. The chemistry between Fraser and his co-star, Julia Rehwald, who plays Becca, is also remarkable. Their on-screen relationship is heartwarming and inspiring, as they both learn from each other and find a way to heal.The movie's direction and cinematography are also top-notch, with director Darren Aronofsky delivering a visually stunning and emotionally impactful film. The use of close-up shots and slow-motion scenes add depth and nuance to the storytelling, capturing the inner turmoil of the characters and the beauty of the natural surroundings.One of the standout elements of the film is the way it addresses issues of weight and body image. Charlie's struggle with obesity is portrayed with sensitivity and respect, and the movie shows how society's obsession with appearance and weight can have a profound impact on a person's mental and emotional well-being. The film encourages viewers to look beyond surface-level appearances and see the humanity in others, regardless of their physical shape or size.\"The Whale\" also explores themes of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of human connection. It shows how even in the darkest moments of our lives, there is always hope for healing and growth. The movie's message is a powerful reminder that no one is perfect, and we all have the ability to learn, grow, and change.In conclusion, \"The Whale\" is a must-see film that deserves a 10/10 rating. It is a touching and emotional journey that will leave viewers inspired and moved. The movie's exceptional acting, direction, and cinematography, along with its powerful message, make it a standout film that is sure to leave a lasting impression.",

Brendan Fraser performs the role of Charlie with such passion, Grace and emotion that you can't help yourself but hope all the best for Charlie but his acceptance of his lifestyle grasps the viewers with so much power that you don't know if you should feel sad or happy due to him being happy and accepting. Sadie Sink plays her role as Ellie perfectly and shows true character arc and change when she gives in being bratty and means towards Charlie and then helps him relax as he smiles and admires her approach to people as he discovers in the film. The most powerful line in the entire masterpiece is \" People are amazing\" by Charlie as he never lets his struggles surpass his love for people who care and also his love for his family. To end it all off The Whale is a must watch and Brendan is very deserving of the awards he's won and the rest he most likely will receive as A24 studios show that they know how to make meaningful films in all types of genres .",

The movie basically never moves outside of the living room and it gets old fast.Firstly why does every single movie have to be about non straight people. Straight people are still 95% of the population. I don't have a care in the world with what you do with your own life. But if I'm not into that,then I'm not into that and I lose intreast in a movie the moment I get forced to partake. The fact that the characters is gay adds nothing to the film except that we have to constantly hear about another gay mans struggles.But even with me finiding zero interest in the sexual preference of the lead characters, the movie itself is just boring and kinda predictable.Overhyped because of good acting in my book and that's because films in general have become so bad that when you see a good performance people believed the film is automatically also good.It's like with The Joker great acting horrbley boring movie.

It was though I personally felt every ache and strain he experienced just moving his massive body short distances to the bathroom and beyond. The even truer suffering was the horribly sad and doomed look in Charlie's eyes knowing his life was soon coming to an end and has yet made any progress in trying to repair his relationship with his estranged daughter. I would have rated the movie a 10 but for the weak ending when Charlie finally reconciles with his daughter and then is sublimely lifted up to a heavenly scene from a previous memory of a better time in his life. I think a simple ray of sunshine on his peaceful face would have done the job. As I told my wife when I got home: it was a great movie but so hard to watchDan Rademeyer.",

It's obviously adapted from a play, and takes advantage of the mobility of the camera to give us an intimacy that we could never have with the stage. The story is intriguing and reveals itself slowly, with tantalising threads coming together at the end. The only thing that seemed incongruous to me was Ellie asking a question with \"whom\" in it - I asked myself, would an American teenager, who hates writing essays, care to make the right choice between subject and object forms of pronouns? Did the writer do that deliberately, or did they inadvertently reveal themself...?The cast is superb and the performances are completely believable. I cheered Liz's gutsiness and felt Mary's pain. I don't assume I understood Charlie's reasoning, but I never questioned Brendan's portrayal.

            "review_title": "Pretty weak script and performances (apart from Fraser)",
            "content": "I was going into the movie with high expectations and unfortunatelly was severly dissapointed. I see this movie has a great reviews and great score on IMDB, it also received some awards I believe but I have hard time understanding why. I gave this movie 3 out of 10 and all the stars went to Fraser, who played the part really well and I think he's the only reason to watch this movie at all. I felt like the script was very weak, we don't really know much about the characters, they make very substantial and big statements throughout the movie but they don't really back them up which makes this movie look very preachy at times.All the characters (maybe apart from the mother) are awful and very shallow, for example Liz is this controlling person that creates this appearance of care but in reality she's very self centered and she doesn't do what's best for Charlie, but what will make her feel good. It's very easy to tell Charlie to go hospital, it's much harder not to give him a bucket with chicken wings when he asks. Also she's very bossy and looks down and everyone. She feels like a snake in human form.Ellie is this angsty teenager that hates everyone and we learn it's because she thinks she's worthless because her father left her and while this might be realistic, the way she's portrayed is also awful. And here lies another problem with the movie - sometimes it's hard to say if this immature behavior from Ellie is just her being a teenager and having problems with her emotional self (as we all did, can't fool the hormones) or if what's she's saying and doing is supposed to carry some meaning for us. Really, what she does is awful, we understand in this movie that she didn't have easy life, but objectively she's an awful person. Also, Charlie knows nothing about her, he constantly repeats the mother tells him nothing about her and he's got one essay from four years before to base his whole opinion of her on, and yet he claims she's an amazing person and I believe we are supposed to feel the same way, but his opinion is based on nothing and from what we've heard from the mother and from what we see she's done in the movie, there is really nothing to corroborate this opinion.That missionary guy seems interesting at start, although he comes across very artificial, almost a carricature of a human being. He's pushed around and has no conviction and as soon as he learns his parents won't send him to jail, he forgets everything about his mission and just goes home. It feels like he's just a backdrop for other characters to preach their convictions without giving any argument for their opinions, as this character is not pushing back at any point in the movie. The scene through the closed door with Ellie and the guy (i forgot his name) felt very forced and unnatural and it was basically her stating his belief doesn't make any sense and that's it. No discussion, no arguments, nothing, he's just a backdrop. Very dissapointing.As for the mother character, she was surprisingly interesting - she came across flat at some points, but at others she had some bone in her body, which makes her the most human like character in this movie.Charlie, now let's talk about the elephant in the room, or should I say, whale. Fraser was great, he was very convincing in his role, although the writers seem to be very confused. At the end, I'm not sure if his final intentions were pure or if he was self absorbed to the very end. You would think that all he wanted was this honesty, but it didn't feel that strongly and it was mixed with the other message, that he wanted to feel that his life wasn't for nothing and he did something good and those two thoughts didn't play very well toghether. There were some very strong points to his character, like when he tried to destroy himself by eating but then sometimes it feels like he's doing it to spite himself and sometimes to spite other people (Dan in particular).The direction was decent in general, although I'm not sure about this whole counting of days. I understand it was to show that all the action is taking place day after day, as it's not that obvious from what's happening in the movie (you could very well suspect the action is stretched across few weeks). I think if they maybe stretched the action to seven days, to wrap it up in a full week, it would feel more at the right place, and as for how it is in the movie, it just kind of breaks the fourth wall.I'd say Fraser was great as an actor, the script was bad, the direction was decent. Charlie was a confused 2,5 dimensional character, the mother was also almost 3d, the daughter was 2 dimensional and the rest were one dimensional. The characters were mostly superficial, preachy (again) and closed minded. There were some strong points and interesting developments, but in general it felt preachy, without a real bone in it and a bit confused. I didn't like the movie very much.",

            "content": "This movie was a gorgeous exploration of the isolation and desperation in human suffering. Aronofsky's movies frequently revolve around these themes, and this is one of his easiest to absorb and one of his best. Due to a lot of high profile backlash against Brendon Fraser playing the role of a morbidly obese man rather than a real obese person being cast in the role, I was prepared to be potentially offended, but upon seeing the movie I was actually astonished that anyone would cast fault upon such a sincere and loving portray as Fraser offered. This is an exceedingly sensitive and beautiful acting, and I actually wonder if the detractors even saw the film, or just reacted in unthinking \"wokeness\" to word of its existence. This is as good as anything  released by a major studio in the last 10 years, which might be called the Marvel and Reboot Era. It's no longer even a debate that Hollywood has for years sacrificed its relevance and vitality on a pyre of lowest-common-denominator audience pandering, and I had begun to wonder, I think fairly, if movies of real quality and meaning would ever be made again. Aronofsky's career nicely tracks the rise and fall of the indie cinema over the past 30 years, beginning with the supremely underground surprise pop hit of Pi, made of $60k in 1998, which grossed $3 million. It was then closely followed by a wave of big studio support which resulted in Requiem for a Dream two years later, made for $4.5M and distributed by Artisan Entertainment two years later, which succeeded in expanding his range of audience appeal without sacrificing a drop of artistic cred. The Whale makes a strong case for Aronofsky as one of the very few filmmakers working today with nearly the same artistic integrity as was regularly present in the mid to late 90's indie wave. Is it every bit as daring and bold as Requiem, Black Swan, or Pi? My sense is that those movies had more grit to them, they had a greater capacity to disturb, that The Whale is perhaps more smoothed-out, less alienating, and more ready for a broader audience. This does not really bother me, although I can understand why indie cool kids might consider it \"soft\" by comparison, even if it will still prove too challenging for many viewers. I'll disclose that I feel this sort of film student thinking is much ado about nothing. But whatever one's position on the position of grit in relation to authenticity, in terms of the ability to speak and make meaning from film, The Whale is surely the equal of Aronofsky's best work. Really a surprising, moving, and ultimately uplifting movie that broadens our capacity to be human and boldly confirms that great film is not dead.",

There is no real amazing cinnamontography or interesting visuals like his other movies have had a little bit of. It's really just a great character study, and it was very thought-provoking. I love food and even though I've never been morbidly obese, I've had binge eating issues and weight control issues in life. Critics said the binge eating scenes were distasteful but how could they ever say that if they never tried the food? Those scenes are so shocking and graphic that I dunno how anyone could be triggered to binge eat from seeing this movie. Fraser deserved the Oscar gold and the surrounding cast was great.",

The young adult child who is still spinning in a loop of anger that her dad abandoned her for his lover when she was eight. Foaming at the mouth with self-pity. The angry ex, who turned to drink when she discovered her husband was bi-sexual. The exasperated nurse who scolds, then cries, scolds then cries. And here we go again with another teacher, who just wants his students to break out in some way and be 'honest' - be honest and the world will open up to them, he tells them. Haven't we had enough of this sort of thing in Good Will Hunting and other, lesser movies? \n\nThe redemptive angle was also far too on-the-nose, what with this doubting young man who appears out of nowhere like a doubting angel claiming he wants to 'save' Charlie. It's almost hilarious, but where's the irony? And then the ending, with Charlie making these elephantine, yet triumphant steps towards his daughter hanging by the open doorway, launches us into opera, an almost narcotic experience, which, admittedly, is perhaps not surprising when you remember director Aronofsky's brilliant early film, Requiem For A Dream, that takes us inside the heads of heroin addicts for 90 minutes or so. \n\nI enjoyed The Whale, for sure, even as it made me nearly gag at times, (Charlie stuffing his face with pizza, for instance), but this was an opportunity to say something more about a health system and a culture that allows people to gorge themselves for so long they can't even bend over to pick up something they dropped on the floor. And it was a missed opportunity, to my mind. Too many moments of sappy tears and raised voices, not enough grit and irony.",

            "content": "I watched the movie for the first time last night, and it dawned on me it's one of the most misunderstood movies that many of the critics missed the point of even when it's literally right in your face. Maybe critics need to read more books than just watch movies.\n\nTo start I saw the rotten tomatoes score of 66% by critics and was almost not going to watch it I read reviews of it being overhyped, but then Brendan Fraser won the Oscar and 91% audience score I said now I have to watch it! And it was one of the best movies I have ever seen.\n\nThe film is all about Moby Dick (another title for Moby Dick is The Whale) and Ellie's interpretation of it. The movie starts off with Thomas reading the essay and it saying \"and I felt saddest of all when I read the boring chapters that were only descriptions of whales, because I knew that the author was just trying to save us from his own sad story, just for a little while.\" Which is a bit of a foreshadowing of the the rest of the film. But the film is about Thomas being Captain Ahab trying to kill the whale (save Charlie from damnation) and Charlie is Moby Dick. But because Charlie is so fat we of course associate him with Moby Dick but Charlie is also Captain Ahab and he tries to kill his whale (get to know Ellie). Ellie is also Captain Ahab as she literally wishes Charlie would die just as Ahab wishes Moby Dick would die. The saddest and boring chapters would be only a description of Charlie, him by himself and him eating himself to death, and Thomas, Liz and Ellie comes in to save you from the sad story for a while. At one point Ellie even tells Thomas he finally feels he's interesting once she gives him the opportunity to tell his story, just like Charlie told her if you give reading a chance he felt she would actually like it, just like he feels if Ellie gives people a chance she could actually like them. Captain Ahab only sees Moby Dick as a whale he wants to kill and forgets animals can have feelings and be complex characters that would be better off left alone, just like Thomas forgets Charlie is an older man who has lived a long life and has his own story, in the end Thomas admits he finds him disgusting and just wants to save him for his own benefit and doesn't have Charlie's best interest in mind, seeing him as just an animal, just a whale. Ellie also sees Charlie as disgusting as just an animal but not because of his weight but because he left her for someone else. But when Charlie tells Ellie about why he left, she remembers he's human and not Moby Dick not just a whale but a human with feelings. Charlie tells Thomas he's already read his book which refers to the Bible but also Moby Dick and he feels that Ellie's essay of her interpretation of Moby Dick is the best writing he's ever read because it's just so honest. Ellie then confronts Thomas, just as she confronts Captain Ahab with her essay, she is honest with Ahab and with Thomas and by doing so releases Thomas from his own feeling he can't go home without killing the whale. Thomas then becomes Ishmael just as Ellie and Charlie become Queequeg, since Thomas and Ellie no longer see Charlie as an animal he is no longer Moby Dick, and becomes a human character. Just as Ishmael in Moby Dick is someone who sees Queequeg at the beginning of the story as basically a heathen or an animal, then by the end of the story sees them as the most caring and kind people they've ever know, just as he saw Charlie as someone who is disgusting and Ellie as a problem child but there is so much more to them than meets the eye. Charlie always sees Ellie as Queequeg, a caring person, even when her mom or Thomas didn't see her that way because Charlie always sees the best in people. In the end Ellie's writing released Thomas to go home, her writing releases Charlie as well, the ending she reads her essay and says \"This book made me think about my own life, and then it made me feel glad for my--\" this is left for interpretation of the viewer, whether she says she is glad for \"myself\" would make Charlie happy that she does love herself, or whether she says she is glad for her \"dad\" either way he knows he did something right with his life, and that's all he wanted.\n\nAlso I saw some people write that if you movies that are just in one room then you'll like this movie, well Moby Dick is just set in one place also, the sea. There is also a point where Ishmael finally sees Captain Ahab who was locked in his quarters and is scared of him, like when Dan finally sees Charlie.",

Very classic Aronofsky ending. I wouldn't say it's as gross as others seem to think, but it is pretty loud on the bickering side, and his daughter is especially difficult to listen to. There's no deeper meaning to this than say Mother, another film criticizing religion and taking the all too obvious path of saying the same ol things at the enormous cost of film production. Frankly, I am disappointed so many people choose to address this subject with film as some flimsy art form cover up for their disliking of an ancient practice that has more than sunk itself with its own actions. But yet, here we are again. Another film pointing out our own faults and personal salvation or ruin. Highlighting the faults and idiocy of religion while also reflecting on its surface value for those who need it. The whole existence of the daughter in the film is a reflection of that. We're all her. But we don't have to be... It's not my thing, but it is well done. I don't particularly suggest watching it, but if you are one of those people who like obvious messages convolutedly buried in grim films, then this is probably right up your alley. If that's not you, you should probably ignore this one. And don't read the comments. You'll just get angry.",

Unfortunately, it includes an ingredient that is both tasteless and (appearently) non negotiable in Hollywood culture these days. It includes an element of Christianity that starts off innocent, even convincing, only to subvert you by having the message of the movie come against it in order to villainize it. \nInterestingly in this film, it took away from the power it could have otherwise had the potential to have. Not only did they miss an opportunity for him to find peace with God as part of his redemption, but Charlie held onto his bitterness toward him until the end, and in turn, diminishing the message of his story. Additionally, the characters spend so much runtime fighting God, despite how they feel about him, that you can feel the precious hours slipping away from Charlie's life, while they alL continue to indulge in their contempt. They try to give the characters some context by giving them an in depth history with the church, but these characters' attitudes for people who have \"read every pamphlet\" or the entire Bible multiple times are outlying at best.\nIn other words, the shoehorned anti-christian message is inaccurate, unecessary, and the reason why this film was good, but not great, and certainly not a masterpiece.\n...Which is a shame, because other than that, all the other elements, the characters, the acting, writing, editing, pacing, score, are all excellent.",

            "content": "This movie was truly a rollercoaster that kept spiraling downwards, in the best of ways.  I was shocked by the state that Charlie was in and every single character was easy to empathize with.  This movie made me cry multiple times because I knew what would happen, but it was the painful journey that was most important.  This movie is a wonderful tragedy about the sickness of food addiction and it left me speechless throughout.  The writing was phenomenal and the acting made everything realistic.  With how common obesity is in America, it was easy to relate to in some way, and I think everyone will think \"I know someone whose obese,\" when they see this film.  I think this was one of the best movies I've seen this year because it made me feel and care about what was happening.  Now, the reason I gave this film 4.5 stars is because there was one incredibly important moment that quite literally shut my waterworks down.  This was the very ending.  Charlie had just succeeding in reconnecting with his daughter and helping her realize just how precious she is, all while on the verge of death and walking without help for the first time in a long time.  The music swells, the moment intensifies as Ellie and Charlie stare at each other, and right when I'm about to cry, his feet lift from the ground in a symbolic death and salvation from his tragic life.  Charlie ends up on the beach, in the moment he loves so much, in heaven.  And then the movie ends.  It is when the spiritualistic death took place, where he is literally lifted from the ground, that I stopped crying.  The movie has been so real, so solid, so down to Earth, that it felt supernatural and preachy when Charlie goes to heaven.  If the music cut and his heart went flat or he exhaled his last breath and the screen went white with credits, I would have started sobbing.  Charlie said he didn't want there to be an afterlife, he stated his opinions over and over again, so in a way, the film goes against his characters wishes by giving him the after life.  And if the moment at the beach isn't his heaven, but him reliving his life as it flashes over his eyes, then that would be too repetitive.  After all, the entire movie is spent exploring his life, the choices he's made, and how he lives in his last few days.  This should have ended tragically, very much like how Shakespeare ends his tragedies.  It should have been devastating to see or hear Charlie die, but instead, it seemed the producers wanted to give him a happy ending.  When a story is purely tragic, I do not want to see a happy ending.  I want the bittersweet ending of him finally making amends for his mistakes only to die a moment later, unable to ever see how his daughter will grow or see her smile.  I do not think he ever saw her smile as a teenager.  And that would have added another layer to his tragic life and death.",

The fat gay teacher is by no stretch a hero and he himself seems not to be full of hate, but there was a lot of hate swirling around. \nI'd like to say that Christian's who hate gays or fat people are not Christian.  We are not hateful. We are not to judge. I for one...being Christian and standing on faith, would have no problem calling out anyone who think basing guys or any group should be treated with disdain.  \nI rented it twice, because I had a hard time with the moving targets of hate. \nLove each other where we are.

Other than that, ignore every single bad review for this movie, they miss the entire point and don't see this masterpiece for what it truly is. Brendan Fraser acts so well (along with the entire supporting cast) and the emotional drama and character archs from everyone in the movie are spectacles. It sends a profoundly powerful message and I think that this is the kind of movie that needs to exist, especially for individuals who have a hard time finding their place in life or who struggle from trauma. I liked that this movie took a big risk casting a non-obese person as an obese person. It still worked and some of the people who criticize the production for that never even checked out the movie to begin with or gave it a chance! It is so much more than an actor who portrays someone struggling with obesity, but instead struggling with the legacy of his turbulent and draining life in his final days, and what an incredible and original direction the movie went in with that! I liked this even better than Requiem for a Dream!",

The viewer watches him spiral hopeless to help him, only able to observe as he eats himself to death and this helplessness can be fustrating for some who view Charlie's problem as an easy fix - stopping eating.

This film reminded me of it so much of it. Secondly, if knowing the end was not motivation enough to stop watching, the film forces the audience to see how this man hurt himself and others in an unending orgy of passive-aggressive self-pity. He lies, he cheats. He is beyond redemption but we should like him and be empathic and still watch him kill himself hated by everyone around him.\n\nRegarding the award-winning performance of Mr. Fraser, it reminded me of Madonna's Evita - it was difficult to know where the Evita character began and Madonna's persona ended. I don't know Mr. Fraser, I have liked some of his films and always considered his different characters one-note. This character is different in that beauty is taken away from him and there is a defined attempt to bring real depth to Charlie. However,  I don't think is achieved. I am left with the distinct impression that what we saw was not Charly but Frase's deep, unfiltered, and untreated resentment toward his life. \n\nBest luck next time.",

I feel the movie poorly executed that and seemed to focus more on an unrealistic version of morbid obesity, showing morbid obesity as something grotesque as in a horror movie instead of focusing more on the suffering and grief the characters experienced as a result of abandonment, religion, challenges surrounding sexuality, mental health challenges, and death. The enabling nurse and Jehovah witnesses characters are all difficult to relate to as well. I would have liked to see more character development, and seen more sides of his life to help connect the story and envoke a connection to his character and suffering. It fell flat in so many areas. I would watch it just to watch it, maybe when it's late at night or when you're bored and you can't find anything to watch.",

With the time stamp being close to two hours the movie develops the plot nicely and has great pacing. This movie took me on various roller coaster rides and had me very emotional which is rare to say the least. Brendan Fraser does an amazing job as the lead actor in this film and especially considering it  is a change of pace from his normal appearances on our screens, but I will not single him out every actor played their parts well and even the production studio (A24) out did themselves. Director Darren Aronofsky has released yet another great movie and if you like \"the whale\" I recommend checking out some of his other work like \"requiem for a dream\" or \"the good nurse\" etc.\nAll in all this was a great watch and it had me invested the whole movie I recommend anyone reading this also watch or if they have already they share their opinions as well.",

The plight of his character Charlie engenders sympathy, and while the depictions of the consequences of his eating disorder can be quite graphic, at no point does the film attempt to portray Charlie as anything less than human for suffering from it.\n\nOverall, I would say that this movie is worth your time.",

The fact that it is about somebody struggling with weight is a hard thing to take on, and is bound to be controversial especially as we continue to reckon with body image as a society, but for me that faded into the background.\n\nI didn't watch it as somebody who was at a carnival trying to get a voyeuristic view of an obesely overweight person.

Pity, relief, repulsion, grief or just a lot of sadness: when you leave the theather after watching \"The Whale\", at least one of these feelings has hit your stomach and remains there until you go to sleep. It's difficult to talk about this film without mention the terrific interpretation of Charlie, an overweight and dying (over 250kg) online teacher, by Brendan Fraser (awarded at the Oscars with Adrien Morot, the head between his makeup), for the first time in years acting in a leading role poignant and challenging to bring on screen. His character becomes more and more disgusting frame after frame until the dreamlike last sceen, where the white explodes and swallows every other color, completely opposite to the opening one, where a progressive zoom in the black reveals the title and his face. Director Darren Aronofsky though doesn't limit the script to a documentary about a week in the life of a morbidly obese and explores his story since he left his family (his wife and his son, Ellie, when she was 8) for one of his student, Alan, which died short after in misterious circumstances. Alan's sister, Liz, a nurse, is the only one left for him until Ellie starts visiting him (she is now 16 years old). Except the appeareance oh his former wife, there's only one other character on stage: it's Thomas, a missionary of New Life church that tries to save him before the end of times. Aronofsky deserves the credits for creating a very complex character (and this is the proper case to say it) behind his fatness, managing to keep us from falling into total pity. But, on the other hand, I think this movie is too smart, like if it was made at 90% for the Oscars, to go without doubts on best actor (see Di Caprio's Revenant). Extremely significant the theme of Moby Dick.",

He shows faith in people where others were not so kind, even through an uneasy watch of his last few days he shows positivity and strength where most give up.\n\nMy honest opinion is that this movie needs to be looked at with an emotional response, it's not meant for everyone but it's truly a great movie.",

The almost irredeemably savage nature of the supporting characters is relentless, and it compounds the sense of alienation and claustrophobia of being trapped in the belly of the whale. Depending on your emotional response, this can be a challenging film to watch, but it all draws to a thoroughly cathartic conclusion at the end, leaving nothing to be desired.\n\nI don't like the idea of describing this film from a technical aspect, as it's more of an existential experience, but: the directing is excellent. The script is so-so; likely owing to it being largely the same as the play, which can lead to a sense of goof at times.

However, it did offer some valuable tips on how better to enjoy consuming pizza by the slice(s). But the film sorely needed a thematic song with a hook, and I would have recommended that the principals adopt the song from the 1960's TV show Batman for the opening and closing scenes; just change the letter B to an F.

Frazier is doing such a great job, and his scene partner is not in more than one case. \n\nI'ts 2 hour runtime never felt boring to me, and even tho this story has been done before, albeit different addictions than food, i liked how they kept you interested with the mystery of figuring out what happened to Charlie's partner, and trying to figure out who's essay it was. \n\nI remember when this movie was getting debuted, people were saying they should have cast someone actually that size instead of frazier lol. So fucking stupid now that i've seen the movie. He was so large that he could barely move around his apartment, and couldn't stand up on his own without assistance.

The protagonist of this story is Charlie, a dangerously overweight individual who has suffered in isolation from the world after a tragic loss of the love of his life.\nWhile attempting to be a bright light to those around him and make up for lost time with his estranged daughter, Charlie ignores his own health concerns.\nWe follow an impactful journey that leads us to an extremely dark place in the mind of someone who is truly wrestling with demons that many of us could not understand, an obesity that lies in self hatred and punishment as well as a way to cope with the pains of his past. Sadie Sink one could say is the antagonist of this story, Her Character Ellie gives a very dark reminder of the sins of Charlie's past and shows the true pain caused and an everlasting effect that his choices made. A confused and resentful character who appears throughout the story to have a deep rooted hatred for her father and who wants to torment him for abandoning her as a young child. Ellie is a very misunderstood teenager who is in her own way crying out to be rescued from herself and it appears that her father may be the only key to this. \nA movie that is shadowed in pity, anger, confusion yet somehow delivers a truly peaceful ending that allows a sense of completion to Charlie's initial goal. \nThe whale is one that should be experienced, however tragic and confronting it may be.",

Many of them seem incapable of recognizing that the theme of the movie isn't about empathy, compassion, and understanding. It is rather a tale of love, mistakes, honesty, and most of all acceptance. \n\nLooking at the ratings from critics and viewers it's very clear who was placing expectations and judgement before the film was even over. The critics have so much to say about the audacity of displaying a very big fat man in the state of living as a very big fat man. As if this is some crime to shine a light on the reality of someone living in this way. 'Charlie\" near the end of the film mentions the rashes, fungus, and infections that any body in this state does actually experience. But him hogging out on a pizza is too much for the critics. What a reprehensible view of being a morbidly obese!\n\nThis is a good movie and it is easy to spot it's adaptation from a theatrical play, and I actually enjoyed that. There is a quick pace lunacy of entry and exit that happens. The plot was precise and to the point. It's a bottle movie, and it makes sense with the main character having a hard time getting 20ft to  his own bed.\n\nI felt a connection to the aspects of almost every character that I could identify within my own habits and past choices. It said something about my problems and my issues and how I can better deal with them: faith, fear, anger, blame, shame, silence  and love to name a few. \n\nThis is a good movie even if it's not about an actual whale.

Brendan Fraser gives the performance of a Lifetime.\n\nBrendan plays a very obsese Reclusive man named Charlie who teaches College students via web cam. Although Charlie keeps his web cam off for fear of embarrassment due to his size and predicament. Charlie only has one friend and that's co star Hong who plays Liz Charlie's only friend who helps him with his daily tasks, basically a on stand by Nurse. Charlie is on the last week of his life as he is going into Congestive Heart failure due to his massive size. On his last week of his life he speaks with his daughter whom he abandoned 8 years prior. \n\nThis film is about redemption, Brendan also won a few awards and has given multiple speeches since this film's release.

I'm not a crier when it comes to film and there's only been a handful of films that have made me just a little teary eyed. This film made me go all the way. This film brought me to my knees, I cried like a baby as I can relate, I'm a big guy NOT as big of course as charlie, I'm 302 and that's only because it's winter and I always gain 20 pounds in the winter due to not doing much so I'll be down to 270 280 by summer but man this will bring the strongest of persons to their knees. Brandon gives it his all, such a beautiful film, Don't get me started on M.s Sadie oh my word she is a rising star, She is going places, she is lighting up our screens, can't wait to see what she does next",

The performances of the others, perhaps caused by their cluncky over-explanatory scripts, detracted from the storyline, and world that the film was trying to depict. \n\nIn each case, I could feel good performances from the fine cast of support actors were bursting to get out, but they were stilted by a directorial style exemplified by the number of times actors went to leave the house and then stopped to turn around at the front door - presumably a lever to indicate a change in the relevant character's viewpoint.\n\nThe whole thing felt like a filmed stage play.\n\nBut the director and crew are to be congratulated for attempting the subject matter, it can't have been an easy sell to backers - at no point did I want to stop watching..",

I empathise with those responsible for Brendan Frasers Oscar nomination as I felt his acting was outstanding throughout. The characters in the film revolve Charlie, who is played by Brendan, and introduces 5 other characters who revolve around his story. I wouldn't say Brendan exactly carried the performance though as the whole cast were top notch. However, the film has received some negative feedback, and this may be the reason this film has not acquired the rotten tomatoes score one would assume it deserves. That is because it touches on the 'stigmatising reflection of thin peoples assumptions of fat bodies'. I don't buy into this as a criticism myself. I would agree that the film was emotionally provoking and made me feel uncomfortable or at at least uneasy at times. However, I do not think that the film was shallow in this sense. It is a fictional character, with a fictional storyline and with a over-fantasised and extremely animated displays of Charlies resignation in self-help and abandonment of aspirations as a consequence of his life choices and circumstances. I would say that if you are genuinely getting offended by this film and the topic therein then I would suggest creating a masterpiece like this one, exercise your own freedom of expression by shining a light on the issues, systematic or otherwise inferred in the criticisms. The film is supposed to make you feel uncomfortable, invite you to empathise, detest and sympathise for the characters. It's cinema, and cinema at its finest, the choice of how you respond to the movie will be personal and individual and I think that's what makes it so great. No one will watch this film and take away the same message as the person watching it with you. that's the point of it. It's a must see. Enjoy it.",

The Whale is a feature film directed by Darren Aronofsky (Mother, Black Swan), as part of the cast we have Brendan Fraser (Charlie), Hong Chau (Liz) and Ty Simpkins (Thomas) and Sadie Sink (Ellie). The feature film shows the daily life of a writing/English teacher living in prison due to severe obesity who tries to reconcile with his teenage daughter in a single chance of redemption.\n\nA Baleia is an adaptation of a play, I believe that is why people enter and leave the scene as if they were on a theater stage for everyone to connect with Charlie, right at the beginning of the project we are presented with our protagonist's routine, and issues controversies are already shown here regarding Charlie's health, how his self-esteem and sexuality are presented, the critics get heavy trying to accuse the director of portraying the character as if he were a circus character, however, the Obesity Action Coalition (OAC) disagreed and told Franser to keep doing what he's doing.\n\nThis film shows practically everything I studied in the Physical Exercise Prescription discipline for special groups, the feature film shows joint/biomechanical difficulties, cardiovascular complications, psychological and aesthetic issues and with all this Brendan manages to deliver an extremely memorable and captivating performance, not no wonder he's running for an Oscar with his co-star Hong Chau, and Frase's choice for the role was spot on, anyone who knows a bit about the actor's history should agree.\n\nAnd finally, it is important to say that the name of the film A Baleia is not just because of Charlie's condition, and for you to understand the title, watch the film, because, I will not be the one to explain.",

I've seen it all before.\n\nI think it over emphasised his physical weight in order to try to depict disgust to the point of him feeling like a caricature. His acting was decent but lacked subtlety. It didn't properly touch on why he has given up on himself when he seemingly is intelligent, somewhat positive and wants to get to know his daughter more. There could have been flashbacks to some more foundational moments of his life to really humanise how he has become the way he is.

The film struggles however with its lack of subtlety- offering a fairly predictable and coerced storyline and a flair for the dramatic, especially on Charlie's obesity. Charlie's obesity is a prominent component to the imagery of the film, but does not contribute much to the underlying message. The film tries to tackle too many tough topics (eating disorders, broken parent-child relationships, religion and homosexuality) while not fleshing them all out. Also, the films overt desire for drama (akin to a soap opera at times, and especially Sink's role) takes away from some of these deeper topics under the surface - not allowing the viewer to think critically of all viewpoints. The human condition is preposterous to behold - but the Whale tries to feed it to us on single-view, silver spoon.",

Hong Chau played the shit out of her role, the strength and vulnerability she was able to put into the role was just great.\nSadie Sink was top notch as well, the animosity and fragility she showed broke me at the end. I hope she gets to play a more different character in her future projects because while it was a great performance I couldn't help but look at her character as a shitty (personality wise, not performance wise) version of Max.\nNow, Brendan Fraser, thank you Darren for giving this man the space to remind people the acting chops Brendan possesses. The way Brendan was able to give Charlie's character so much light and darkness was amazing. The way Charlie used food as his vice and accelerator felt incredibly authentic. \nThe last 10 minutes of this movie had me in pieces, I couldn't ask for a better ending to such a greatly performed and written film.

Very human and uplighting besides one or two moments that are difficult to watch. The story deals with real life and overcoming  human failure..and love.  The backdrop of the movie is about the main character's obesity, but the story doesn't focus on this. The story shows a complex and contemporary reality that shouldn't be hidden, secret, negated or denied as if we were young Buddha living an isolated life pretending that death doesn't exist. Not all movies are about puppies, but a movie about a real and difficult life can still have a positive message without being preachy. You'll feel wonderful, hopeful after watching.   Good for the family to watch with kids that are not too young for it's content. I think everyone should watch this movie that feels like theater (it's based on a play on Broadway from 2012).",

But don't be fooled by the lack of scenery changes, because the performances are outstanding, especially Brendan Fraser's portrayal of Charlie. He brings a sincerity to the role that is both open and gentle, and will leave you rooting for him despite his flaws.\n\nDirector Darren Aronofsky's obsession with the grotesque is alive and well in this film, but he manages to skirt the edge of exploitation and instead presents us with a splayed-open tragedy that is weirdly romantic. The film's rawness and wall-to-wall woe will leave you devastated, but also moved and practicing sympathy and forgiveness. And while the film doesn't add up to much in the end, the performances are top-notch, especially when Fraser, Chau, and Sink verbally bounce off of each other.

Rotten Tomatoes critics can kick rocks.\n\nI appreciate the realism of this movie. Charlie's health looms heavy on the lives of even those who don't know him but should encounter the gravity of his existence (take or leave the pun). But through this very encumbered life, one might expect Charlie to be more humiliated, more panicked, more called-to-action... but like many of life's mortal traps, that is not often the case. Early in the movie, it becomes obvious that Charlie has in a way transcended these feelings (not a healthy way). He has literally become numb to the sense of failure, worthlessness, loneliness, and desperation.\n \nDon't get me wrong, Charlie understands these things. He thinks himself to be a failure... alone... desperate... worthless, etc... but he has found a way to turn all of this into just a general state of aloof shame. \"Sorry\" just rolls off his tongue, and he doesn't even have the energy to resent people's disgust or pity anymore. Almost like he is bored of the indignity he has become accustomed to.\n \nYou can see it, particularly with his daughter. He's willing to bribe her with his life's accumulated wealth and without condition. He's simply a dead person who hasn't died yet... to himself.\n \nAs a person who has dealt with mental health issues in my family as well as drug problems, it's so refreshing to see a director take this candid angle... where the elephant in the room is not made the spectacle it should be. People expect problems of addiction to be reckless, but more times than not, it's very patient. It's mundane. It's a slow-moving train wreck... and once you find yourself there, you've been there for quite a while.\n \nAny story of addiction is in and of itself an extremely potent and important cautionary tale, but to see Charlie's story expressed as a more tedious than emergent circumstance... that's a very important character point of view to truly understanding what is and has been going on in that room for the last decade.\n \nThis movie is built on that foundation... and that foundation is strong. I'll say it now, this movie will save lives. The humanity in this movie is palpable, relatable, and most importantly, actionable. While it is technically a work of fiction, it's simply more than that. It might not teach you your neighbor's circumstances, but it WILL teach you the shape of such circumstances.\n \nWatch this movie with your family, friends, and neighbors in mind... and maybe yourself too. We're all in this thing together. Be good to yourself and others.",

He gives a phenomenal performance as Charlie that shows the grief, pain and yet the positivity of his morbidly obese character that makes him more complex. Hong Chau is also terrific as the nurse Liz. She gives a performance that illustrates the struggle and pain of someone watching their friend self-destruct. \n\nI love the use of a 4:3 aspect ratio to really capture the claustrophobic nature of the apartment and to illustrate the obesity as Charlie takes much of the screen. The music score by Rob Simonsen is great and the makeup for the fat suit is stunning. This movie isn't for everyone as it is depressing and quite melodramatic. It also has some issues in the writing and story, especially considering one character who appears throughout but didn't add much to the plot in the end. Nevertheless, the movie is a hauntingly and heartbreakingly beautiful experience.",

What was surprising were the negative reviews from movie critics (like the one from my favorite critic's posthumous confab RogerEbert.com.) I disagree with critics who gripe about the movie's stereotyping fat people. At least I didn't take the movie that way. \n\nI garner that the themes of the movie are a cookie cutter assemblage of grief, mourning, depression, pain, self loathing, and moments of brilliance and wit that are in any good film. It's just that the poison of choice was a fat person\u2014no morbidly obese person. \n\nI will admit that I gawked at the cabinet of curiosity. I did feel disgust as he choked on a piece of food he wolfed down. But that's not because of pity or disdain for the character it's actually a swig of self loathing because I could be there. I think those critics might feel guilt for all those feelings And at some levels self pity because we've ALL been in Charlie's place. Maybe food is not your drug of choice  but certainly overindulgence in social media, wine, fillers, surgery, or fill in the blank with your vice. \n\nThe consequences of those vices are usually hidden\u2014no one can look at you and tell you're addicted to social media or a budding alcoholic etc. With obesity, it's very much visual display of what can be the cause of an addiction to food. So it's funny or pitiful or cabinet-of-curiosity fun to look at. \n\nWhatever the consequent stereotypes to being obese is\u2014they are real reactions people have to seeing a man not only eat himself to death but witnessing a downward spiral. Getting up and being soo big that you knock over stuff is sad and comically embarrassing. It's the reason why \"Yo mama so fat\" jokes exist. It's an insult to be called fat. That's real cultural phenomenon that happens in America. The portrayal of fat shaming\u2014however cruel it may be in this film is a real thing that happens in society. Why should the film maker not capture that?\n\nI didn't give it all the stars Because I wish the director strayed away from the play format a little bit and gave an insight to outside of the apartment and the ending\u2014though predicted\u2014didn't feel like a contrasting crescendo this film needed.",

With this knowledge, Charlie decides to spend his last few days getting to know his estranged 17-year-old daughter. During this time, he's also visited by a young missionary from a local evangelical, end-times focused church who wants to lead him to salvation.\n\nLiz is accustomed to being Charlie's only visitor and does not want guests coming by while Charlie is in this fragile state. Over the few days, the missionary grows in his belief that God led him to Charlie, and Charlie doubles down on his desire to reconcile with his daughter, offering her money and asking her to share her thoughts and be honest with him so that he can know her.\n\nThere are no heroes in this movie. Liz is overbearing and sometimes enabling to Charlie. Charlie's daughter Ellie is mean and full of fury. Her own mom calls her \"evil\". His ex-wife is a bitter alcoholic. The missionary is a liar. Charlie abandoned his family and deals with his pain through self-harm and self-pity.\n\nBut that's kind of the point. All of these people are broken and imperfect. They are all human. Like it or not, they all need to be saved.\n\nBut as Liz points out, you can't save another person, not really.\n\nCharlie knows he can't save himself, but he's on a quest to find redemption before he dies, and it's all tied up in his daughter. He wants her to know she is special, that she can care about other people and be cared for - a message that's tough for her to hear from a dad who abandoned her and closed himself off from the world. He tries nonetheless, and there's something brave about that.\n\nThe movie grapples with faith in a way that provides a lot of theories and no answers, but feels incredibly sincere, something that's tough to do well onscreen.\n\nCharlie is a complex character, a very human character, and Brendan Fraser will likely win an Oscar for embodying these contradictions so well. Sadie Sink gives a performance wise beyond her years and Hong Chau (who seems to be in everything these days) gives us another performance of strong, quiet toughness.",

That said, I didn't actually like the film. \n\nThe Whale really doesn't actually say much, it's repetitively beating you over the head with notes on acceptance, forgiveness, and empathy but the story doesn't evolve nor does it convey anything particularly powerful, it's just told through a lot of strained breaths and sobbing that try to trick you into thinking that the writing is good. The script is awfully heavy-handed and that's a nightmare for a film that deals with not only family dynamics but religious belief, plus all the exposition makes it feel clunky. Subtlety is not a word that this filmmaker has ever heard in his life, and the 'revelations' that the protagonist undergoes as well as the ridiculously over-the-top behaviour of Sadie Sink's Ellie are a testament to that. The ending was silly and noncommittal, and it seems more like the writers just didn't know how to put the period to the script after a supposedly emotional final reconciliation.\n\nThe only real saving grace for this film is the performances, both from Fraser and Hong Chau. Everything else is poisoned by Aronofsky's painful use of allegory and lack of nuance. Brendan can collect his trophies and move on to all-around better projects. (2.5/5)",

This film is one of the most heart-melting and rewarding movies I have ever seen. There's dramatic character development, stimulative dialogue and phenomenal performances. The cast, especially Brendan Fraser, took the film's inspiring synopsis and made it better, if not emotional, on so many levels. Fraser returns to the screen with a big bang in a career-best performance; it's great to see him back. As much as I love this film, I did run into its imperfections. No film is perfect though, right? The only conflict I came across with The Whale was finding out how Ellie's character is extremely unlikable, it's mildly exhausting. Usually, I try to avoid giving attention to my least favorite characters, but Ellie really stood out to me. It seems that everything she does is toxic, manipulative and vastly disrespectful, to the point where it's life-threatening. Ellie has a devastating, yet very strong impact on other characters and blackmails them to be rebellious as her. For instance, Ellie dares a devoted young Christian, Thomas, to take a hit of her pot and says that she'll call 911 and tell the cops that he raped her if he did not comply. We find out shortly after that she was \"joking\". Extremely disgusting and unprofessional. Ellie also takes pictures of her father and cyberbullies him on Facebook, which turns out she does that to the vast majority of the characters in the film. Did I mention she drugs her father too? It seems that all the other characters mature, but she just stays where she is. I honestly don't understand why Charlie gives her the chance. Look, I love Sadie Sink as an actress, but seeing her, or any other actress follow the same script Ellie did, I would find them annoying. But despite my criticism, this unique movie shows rare compassion, and long-lasting friendships that are in the sequence of healing. I love how Darren Aronofsky managed to blend in Christianity too. The ending melted my heart and made my eyes water. The Whale is a must-watch and believe me, the hype about it is real. My personal rating: 9/10",

However, his main focus seems to be saving his daughter from being labeled a lost cause as a student and human being. While I can't blame the daughter Ella for having anger issues for being abandoned, it would have been nice if she had known the truth about her father distancing himself from her. I do have a problem with people using God as a crutch to explain away their misery, I also have problem with certain religions misusing the gospel to punish people and make them feel worse about their life choices than they already do. But that is a personal observation of how I'm interpreting the church that is central to the story. Charlie finding salvation in telling his daughter how wonderful she is, in the end helps him to find salvation and he ascends to heaven through believing in his daughter and telling so. Ultimately, the movie made me incredibly uncomfortable (the opening sequence of his masturbating to gay porn) and depressing because this man could have saved himself and chose not to. He literally gives up and dies I guess in an effort to save his daughter. I'm not sure if we're supposed to draw some religious parallel from this or not. It left me feeling helpless and hopeless.",

On the flipside, I wasn't happy with Aronofsky's choice to give us a film sized inside a square - 1970's tube TV's aspect ratio, when many of us paid a lot of money for wide-screen TV's. That was constantly annoying throughout the entire film.\n\nBut I did enjoy the fact this film had many layers to it, but I'm not sure that all those layers were executed properly. For example, the end result of how Thomas' family responded to Ellie's actions is a coin toss, and either result would've not defined Ellie's true intentions or her character. For that matter, Thomas' relevance in the film was also in question, and felt more like an unnecessary distraction instead of complimenting the narrative.\n\nThe same goes for Ellie's character and her true feelings about her dad, and questioning her true character; was she a hateful troubled teenager, or did she actually have a caring and loving side. The filmmakers didn't leave that too much in question, and had me convinced she actually was that terrible teenager, which ultimately detracts from the final scene.\n\nI've never seen the play, but as a film, just those few issues needed more exploration and cohesion with the films narrative, and I feel the filmmakers could've done a better job with Ellie and Thomas' characters. The rest of the characters, especially Liz, were portrayed properly, especially Fraser's character.\n\nNevertheless, it's a well done film, and an outstanding award winning-worthy performance by Fraser.

Plus, I'm a big fan of Darren Aronofsky, and so I was happy to see him back too. The film's play roots are evident, from the dialogue and character driven story, to the limited locations, to the staging of most of the scenes and lack of flashy editing or effects. It's a pretty simple story about a father trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter, with the twist being that the father weighs several hundred pounds and is borderline immobile. Fraser brings a lot of humanity and believability to the role, and its smart that his weight isn't what defines him, he has an actual personality. With such a small cast of characters, its easier to make everyone feel 3 dimensional, and that's what the movie does, with the exception of the daughter character. The ways she's written and played is so over the top nasty and spiteful, and with virtually no redeeming features, that'll you'll grow tired of her very quickly. It's such a shame that this individual is so key to the central conflict, because we have to endure her rants, insults, abuse and constant belittlement to the point that Charlie's adoration of her, even by the standards of someone starved for company and compassion, makes no sense, and the film becomes a drag whenever she's onscreen. It's a hugely melodramatic film, with the 3rd act feeling like one long crying scene, but if you're wrapped up in Fraser performance and character you'll likely be shedding tears yourself when the credits roll. It's another well-crafted and highly divisive film from Aronofsky, a man who's made a living enthralling and shocking his audience, and while I can't see myself watching it again, the story and characters make one watch more than worth your time.",

As a man currently struggling with dietary issues and obesity, this hits me in a whole different world. Acting is described in one word: beautiful. Characters with personalities that can hit ones soul. A man who sits with guilt for having an affair while being married and having Ellie. A nurse who tries so desperately to help the only person that is close to her. A troubled girl who, in my opinion, just seems dangerously confused. So many hard hitters and this is without talking about people like Thomas and, the best character with the least dialogue, Dan. The Whale is one of the modern pinnacles of film and I am very VERY satisfied to be a part of the journey. \n\nTop 5 movie of all time\n\n10/10. Remarkable.",

            "content": "Brendan Fraser delivers a triumphant comeback performance in Darren Aronofsky's most recent feature \"The Whale\". Samuel D. Hunter adapts his own award-winning play for the big screen, telling a devastating story about one man's last shot at redemption. Aronofsky's decade-long quest to get the film made has finally come to fruition in the form of a haunting drama that takes place entirely in one apartment in Idaho during the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nCharlie (Brendan Fraser) is a reclusive college professor who teaches online writing classes from the comfort of his couch and behind the fa\u00e7ade of a broken laptop camera. He has no friends, apart from his nurse Liz (Hong Chau), and the only visitors he gets are a pizza delivery guy and a Mormon missionary called Thomas (Ty Simpkins). Charlie's obesity is causing detrimental damage to his health and his steadfast refusal to go to the hospital doesn't help, but when Liz tells him he's at risk of heart failure, the grave reality of his situation dawns on Charlie. With only weeks, if not days left, he decides to attempt to reconnect with his daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink).\n\n\"The Whale\" is fuelled by sensational turns from the entire cast, but Brendan Fraser's portrayal of Charlie stands out as one of the best performances of 2022. Fraser captures heart-breaking emotion in his performance, effortlessly bringing Charlie's vulnerability to the screen. The various prosthetic pieces Fraser donned to transform into Charlie elevated his performance to another level, balancing impactful emotion with an impressive physical performance also. The film allows Fraser to deliver the best performance of his career that will hopefully garner the actor his first Oscar nomination. \"Stranger Things\" star Sadie Sink appears alongside Fraser taking on the role of Ellie, Charlie's estranged teenage daughter. Sink delivers a powerful performance that immediately lets audiences know just how spiteful the 17-year-old highschooler can be, spitting venomous words taken straight from the pages of Hunter's play. Hong Chau adds to her already impressive year, appearing in Kelly Reichardt's \"Showing Up\" and Mark Mylod's \"The Menu\", delivering a stunning performance, shining in every scene she's in.\n\n\"The Whale\" is a stellar adaptation of Hunter's play, it flawlessly brings the characters and the story to the screen through a layered, thematic screenplay that forms the foundation for an impactful drama. The film balances a handful of emotions including guilt, shame, and anger, and themes like grief and religion. \"Insidious\" star Ty Simpkins, through a strong performance, embodies the film's themes of religion by portraying a Mormon missionary who tries to convert Charlie to Mormonism in order to \u2018save him', but as the film progresses it's revealed that both Charlie and Liz already have a connection to the religion, bringing up painful memories and opening old wounds. The film also weaves in references to the Herman Melville's novel \"Moby Dick\" and other marine-themed components including the recurring sound of waves which was taken directly from Hunter's play.\n\nOscar-nominee and long-time Aronofsky collaborator Matthew Libatique once again gets to show off his immense talent for creating stunning visuals. Libatique uses the fact that the film takes place entirely in one location (Charlie's apartment), except for one scene at the start, to craft stunning visuals that emphasises the isolation Charlie feels because he's unable to leave his apartment. This puts the audience in his shoes, allowing them to feel the same isolation he does, only seeing other people when they come to visit. Libatique's work compliments the other technical aspects of the film, from Andrew Weisblum's editing to the remarkaPble special effects makeup, courtesy of Adrien Morot (\"Barney's Version\"), that reinforces Fraser's performance. Composer Rob Simonsen (\"Foxcatcher\") produces a haunting score that excellently matches the film's empathy and aching sadness.\n\n\"The Whale\" is a film lead by an outstanding performance from Brendan Fraser and is bolstered by marvellous supporting turns from Sadie Sink, Hong Chau and Ty Simpkins. Darren Aronofsky directs a sensational adaptation of Samuel D. Hunter's play, and fingers crossed he directs Fraser to a very well-deserved Oscar nomination. This is by far one of 2022's most powerful films, full to the brim with gut-wrenching emotion that will leave you teary eyed. \"The Whale\" sticks with you long after the credits have rolled, from the performances (especially Fraser's and Sink's) to the complex themes covered throughout the neat two-hour runtime.",

His only visitors are his nurse, his embittered daughter, a religious missionary boy hoping to convert him, his ex-wife, and his pizza delivery man who has come to know him by name. Fraser is buried under a fat suit simulating a 600-pound man. Many have praised Fraser's performance, and it is very good, but I don't think it is Oscar worthy. Working under heavy makeup is not an automatic Oscar nod IMHO. I was actually more impressed with the supporting players' performances, especially Sadie Sink as his daughter and Hong Chau as his long suffering but devoted nurse. I cannot give the movie my highest rating, but it is still recommended for fans of a well-acted drama in a confined setting. 7/10.",

Truly outstanding from the first scene (yes, even with that... ha) to the very last. It's great to see the dude that I first saw as a kid in 'George of the Jungle' well and truly back in the game.\n\nOne thing about Fraser getting all the (undoubtedly merited) plaudits from this Darren Aronofsky flick is that I didn't know what to expect from the support cast, and man are there some absolutely stellar performances behind Fraser. Sadie Sink, Ty Simpkins and Samantha Morton are top notch, though Hong Chau is a cut above that trio - brilliant stuff from her!\n\nThere are some powerful scenes in there. I'm not one to cry with fictional works (my brain automatically knows it's 'fake', I can't help it) but man even I got major goosebumps and gut punches (pardon the pun?) from what's portrayed onscreen.

Then one day out of the blue, Charlie us visited by Ellie, his estranged daughter who is now a HS senior...\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest from director Darren Aronofsky (Requiem For a Dream\", \"The Wrestler\"). Here he brings the theater play of the same name by Samuel Hunter to the big screen. The movie doesn't betray its theater roots and in fact the entire film plays out in Charlie's apartment. There are a lot of heavy duty discussions in this film, a sizeable portion on religion, of all things. The cast is outstanding, including Hong Chau (as Liz) and. Sadie Sink (as Ellie). But the film will be mostly remembered for the towering performance by Brandon Fraser as the obese Charlie. I read that it took 4 hours each day to get the prosthetics arranged. Of course none of this would've mattered if it weren't for the high quality script by Samuel Hunter (who also wrote the stage play). In all, I didn't know how I would react to this film, obvious Oscar-baiting material. Turns out this is solid film starring a staggering performance by Fraser. He rightly got a Best Actor Oscar nod and he is probably a strong favorite to win it. Hollywood just loves a good comeback story like this one,\n\n\"The Whale\" premiered at Venice film festival in September yo immediate critical acclaim. It opened in US theaters some 2-3 weeks ago.

I was honestly blown away. The progression/pacing, plot, acting, themes tied together for an extremely emotional, yet beautiful film. I may be biased as a lot of themes really hit home (not even just the deep dive on coping mechanisms, trauma, addiction, religion, discrimination etc. the movie explores, but family themes). I was left shattered, waiting in my seat wiping uncontrollable tears long after the movie finished. There were small portions of humour (particularly dark) sprinkled throughout, and genuinely beautiful moments shrouded in the overarching plot. At the same time, it was quite uplifting, beautiful and thoughtful. I definitely recommend this film, however think in a critical or objective sense (or that of someone not so sympathetic or empathic) it's nothing too ground-breaking. I think the \"message\" of the movie will resonate and mean a lot to those that can connect, along with the other positives and amazing performances I described.",

Based on a play the action all takes place in the house of Charlie, an English professor who teaches all of his classes online. He is also extremely obese, to the point where his health is failing badly and he is near death because of this. He is cared for by Liz, his nurse and only friend. She wants him to go to a hospital but he refuses. Two other people enter this world in the film. Ellie, his long estranged daughter from a failed marriage. And Thomas, a New Life missionary who tries to convert him. As the film progresses we learn the tragic circumstances behind Charlie's current state. This is a very confined film and I think that sometimes works against it. And even though the acting is generally fine I thought the characters tended to be a bit one onte and not fully realised. Brendan Fraser is great though as Charlie, it's a hard role and I think he pulls it off mostly. And Hong Chau is great as Liz, probably the most fleshed out character in the film. This is a very worthy film and one that has a strong emotional core. But I feel it could have been executed a little better.",

Trauma exists and it's not always dealt with properly. Or in such a detrimental way. But these things happen to us all in one way or another and it's important that it's seen. This film is incredible for tackling so much pure pain and love at once. It's humanity in its most natural form.

            "content": "There is something that doesn't quite hit the mark in THE WHALE, but it is still a worthwhile movie to watch. Charlie, a reclusive English teacher suffering from severe obesity, attempts to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter in a desperate bid for redemption. With his time running out and his health failing, Charlie must fight his way through his self-imposed isolation and the walls he's built up around him to find the courage to open up to his daughter and to find a way to make amends.\n\nBrendan Fraser, who plays Charlie, does an incredible job of conveying the complex emotions and struggles of being overweight. His performance is convincing and heartbreaking as he battles his physical limitations while attempting to build a bridge between himself and his daughter. Fraser's portrayal of Charlie is believable, allowing us to empathise with him despite his flaws.\n\nTHE WHALE also features impressive performances from young actor Sadie Sink (Charlie's daughter, Ellie) and Hong Chau (Liz, Charlie's best and only friend). Sink does an excellent job of portraying the tension between Ellie and her father, as well as conveying the emotions of an adolescent trying to cope with an absent parent. Chau is also excellent in her role, providing much-needed comedic relief while still being able to convey genuine emotion and concern for Charlie.\n\nTHE WHALE occurs almost entirely in Charlie's apartment. This setting allows the film to focus on the personal drama between Charlie and Ellie and provides a claustrophobic atmosphere that enhances the sense of desperation and isolation. Director Darren Aronofsky uses this limited space to significant effect, creating an intimate portrait of two people struggling with their issues while trying to bridge the gap between them.\n\nThe cinematography in THE WHALE is also noteworthy. The camera often lingers on Fraser's face or body for extended periods, allowing us to fully appreciate the physical and emotional toll that Charlie's condition has taken on him.\n\nUnfortunately, THE WHALE suffers a few shortcomings that prevent it from being genuinely great. The pacing is sometimes slow, with some scenes dragging on longer than necessary. The film also lacks much plot development or character growth, leaving some characters feeling one-dimensional and underdeveloped. It also seems, at times, to have the feel of a stage production rather than a fully-fledged cinematic experience.\n\nDespite these issues, THE WHALE is an emotionally resonant film worth watching for its performances alone. It may not be perfect, but it is a thought-provoking and poignant film that will leave you with much to ponder.",

It's a total tear fest and we sobbed our hearts out for so many reasons. My son cried from 20 mins in all the way to the end and only stopped about 40 after it finished. He was completely overwhelmed by both performance and narrative - really powerful stuff. This is a film about human's inability to manage grief and emotion and is pretty profound- this is not about obesity at all but far more about how we all manage unspent grief in our own ways. Every character is driven by an inability to manage their own emotions and the paths they choose to avoid confronting how they manage their reactions to significant events. Not for the faint hearted but just amazing. Brendan Fraser totally deserves the Oscar nod \u2764\ufe0f",

So talky with endless annoying exposition being thrown at us in a very unnaturalistic way. Nearly all of the characters were deeply unlikeable, apart from his Asian friend/dead ex's sister. The entire film just set in one room, it really isn't very visually stimulating for a film. I found the acting OTT, more suited for the stage.

Charlie is obese, an ailment that has manifested itself as a coping mechanism for a life of regret. In every scene and interaction this regret is worn by Charlie as a cloak of his past that will stay with him until his dying breath. This character is an immense undertaking and Brendon Fraser plays him perfectly. The emotion he delivers is palpable, which lends itself so seamlessly to scenes of raw sadness and despair. Not only is Fraser a highlight, but the entire supporting cast does an excellent job. Hong Chau is superb, and despite her tough, no nonsense, science focused exterior hides a deep and genuine connection with Charlie. She is incredibly hurt by the way he is treating his body, but is defenseless to his desires, resulting in her to continually feed his addiction. It is a brutal back and forth that is tackled with immense care. Sadie Sink is great as well, she is delivers a brutal performance that leaves the character of Ellie easily hatable with very little redeemable qualities. I understand that this was the point of her character, and by no means is this a knock on Sink's performance, but it felt like a bit much. She was too cruel, to the point of unbelievability, which took a bit away from the message that was trying to be delivered. The pace was a bit slow for my liking. I felt as if the Thomas subplot was a bit pointless and could have been cut from the movie with no ill effects. But despite my minor complaints, the movie is carried by fantastic performances, amazing cinematography and intense emotions that will leave many viewers pleased with their experience, but will not be for everyone.\n\nScore: 82%\nVerdict: Great",

The roles of the supporting actors very well could represent individuals who have been victims of misunderstandings.  The results were portrayed well as frustrations trying to comprehend what happened in the past and what was really happening in the present with a known final outcome.\n\nSome audience members will be disgusted with the excessive eating habits presented throughout the movie, but it goes to show in extreme cases what mental disorders can do to a person over time.  I wonder if the case of being extremely overweight were presented in the opposite direction where the main character is starving to death, would those who found this aspect of the movie disgusting be more sympathetic to the main character. Our culture in the US is obsessed with being skinny and admonishes those for being overweight. \n\nIn this movie it clearly shows that depression is the result of regretting the past and anxiety is the result of worrying about the future.  When you have both it presents itself to victims as a prison where there is no escape and making life a living hell.",

Charlie (Brendan Fraser), an obese English professor, lives in the shrouded darkness of his home, unable to come to terms with the death of his partner and the guilt surrounding his relationship with his estranged teenage daughter, seemingly content with the fact that he will soon die from his condition.  While the first half of the film is a riveting examination of Charlie's psychological and physical condition, the second half feels like it becomes a bit mawkish and soap opera-like as his wife and daughter are introduced, resulting in conflict that becomes a distraction from Charlie's situation.  Regardless, The Whale is worth seeing for, primarily, one reason \u2013 Fraser's remarkable performance as the flawed protagonist.",

The poignant scenes where Charly speaks so calmly, eloquently and intelligently to his group of students, yet while all the students faces are shown on the internet zoom screen, a blank space (for the teacher) is all that the students see is so profound. They are completely unaware of the desperately sad, emotional,  lonely & grossly overweight figure behind the screen. until the last moments of the movie. \n\nThere are scenes in this movie that will leave you emotionally wrecked as you can't help but be deeply moved by many of the heart-wrenching scenes as he valiantly tries to reconnect with the teenage  daughter he abandoned when she was just 8 yrs old. His daughter, Ellie, (played by Sadie Sink), is however full of hate and disgust for her father and she treats with with absolute distain.\n\nAnd that stare \u2026 OMG, Charly reaches into the belly of the big screen with the saddest, loneliest, grief stricken and heartbroken expressive eyes that seriously will have you reaching for the tissues. You see the desperately torn man who through grief, love and loss of his male partner years before led him to spiral out of control and end up the in the grossly disturbing physical & mental state that the viewers see as he literally eats himself to death.  It is real, raw, heartbreaking and emotional as you see lives and relationships ruined as a result of Charly's despair.   It is something that I feel could so easily resonate with any other \"regular\" family. \n\nThe binge eating scenes I tell you will shock and sadden you to your core and just wanna make you throw your arms around this mountain of a man as he devours everything in sight while googling congestive heart failure.\n\nBrendan Fraser delivers a portrayal of a broken man full of regret, a prisoner in his own body who can't leave his apartment.  He shocks us and saddens us with his grossness, yet is also disarmingly graceful and full of sensitivity. \n\nThis is a movie so disturbingly honest &  it will piece your spirit in very unexpected ways. It's not an easy watch, but a necessary one & I guarantee it will leave you changed. \n\nThe whole movie is shot from his apartment, much like a stage play yet this in no way detracts. It is portrayed over a one week timetable in which Charly gets visits from other cast members including Thomas, a missionary who wants to save Charly's soul, his long-suffering carer (Liz) played by Hong Chau, his daughter Ellie & her embittered mother, Mary. \n\nA powerful, and very moving film that you MUST go & see.   I cannot recommend it highly enough.",

            "content": "In \"The Whale,\" actor Brendan Fraser (\"Crash,\" \"The Mummy\" series) is transformed by prosthetics into a character so morbidly obese that simply rising from a chair represents superhuman effort.  Director Darren Aronofsky (\"The Wrestler,\" \"Black Swan\") confronts us with this spectacle, then dares us to look away.  Aronofsky also injects a few familiar elements into the proceedings \u2013 an anguished protagonist, surrealism and a general sense of melodrama.\nIn this chamber piece, Charlie (Fraser) has congestive heart failure.  He's literally eating himself to death.  In Idaho.  He's unable to leave his claustrophobic, poorly-lit apartment.  He spends his time teaching online classes in creative writing and receiving caretaker visits from Liz (a fantastic Hong Chau \u2013 \"The Watchmen TV series).  Realizing that he is in his last days, Charlie makes a final effort to reconnect with his daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink \u2013 TV's \"Stranger Things\").  As they story unfolds, the moviegoer learns that Charlie abandoned Ellie when she was eight because he fell in love with a male student.  Unsurprisingly, Ellie has some anger and abandonment issues.\nOne of the fascinating elements of this film is Charlie's steadfast optimism.  When Ellie's mother describes her as evil, Charlie rises, metaphorically, to her defense.  It's an intended irony that Charlie is able to offer powerful grace and absolution (there are a fair number of theological themes here) to nearly everyone but himself.\nThroughout, \"The Whale\" feels much more like a play than a movie.  It was originally a stage production, with playwright Samuel D. Hunter acting here as the screenwriter.  Some of the \"action,\" dialogue and staging are never translated effectively to this different medium.  It becomes a distraction when the actors sometimes seem restricted to broad movements and loud voices, mannerisms that don't work well with Aronofsky's camera inches from their faces.\nIt's hard to know how to react honestly to Fraser's performance.  It's a long Hollywood tradition to respect, even revere, actors who go through dramatic physical transformations.  Think Christian Bale in \"The Fighter,\" Charlize Theron in \"Monster,\" Joaquin Phoenix in \"The Joker,\" or most recently Glenn Close in \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" Here, Fraser does a wonderful job of showing the humanity and humor of a character who could easily be singularly unappealing.  But I'm not sure it's worth the Oscar buzz generated by many professional critics.\nUltimately, \"The Whale\" is a study in inconsistency.  Its paradoxes can be summed up by one of the key scenes where Charlie earnestly applauds and encourages the members of his online class who have made the effort to reveal themselves by expressing their own hard-earned truths.  It's ironic that this exhortation comes from a character whose enormous bulk is clearly used to keep everyone away.",

The whole movie seemed like the plot of the movie, was to make the main character be seen as a victim. The main character was constantly victimizing himself and burrowing in his self hatred and sorrows; when he could've formed a relationship with his daughter.

Hunter whose play he has himself adapted for Darren Aronofsky's new film. Charlie is a morbidly obese, sweaty and balding online English tutor who's so grief-stricken and ashamed, he never leaves his house and over the course of 5 days, the film charts the visits made by Hong Chau's nurse friend, Liz, Ty Simpkins' eager missionary, Thomas and Sadie Sink's angry daughter, Ellie, whom Charlie has abandoned years ago and is now trying to reconnect with. Manifesting his disgust for himself physically through his overeating and obesity, it requires an equally fearless actor to take on the role and a particularly ego-free Brendan Fraser, making his cinematic comeback after perfecting a similar role on Doom Patrol, literally disappears into the heavy and grotesque prosthetic suit to become Charlie in an affecting and incredibly nuanced and complex turn that makes him the man to beat comes this year's Oscars. Whilst this film is admittedly stagy and perhaps sentimental even, these criticisms pale into insignificance in the face of such a strong, moving and emotionally powerful screenplay that uses Melville's Moby Dick as a springboard to illustrate the state of mind of its main characters, not to mention also allusions to Charlie's physical size. Initially sketchy characters develop surprising depth and layers as they are gradually fleshed out and their backstories revealed, while Charlie searches for redemption with the erratic Ellie. This is that rare beast of a film where an intricately constructed screenplay meets a tremendous cast that delivers with aplomb, producing something that grabbed me immediately from the beginning and never let up until it arrives at its gloriously humane and empathetic conclusion.",

And it definitely created some emotions -- particularly really leaning into revulsion or disgust or sadness around Branden Frasier's character's condition.  \n\nBut I didn't feel strong emotions around the relationships.  Sadie Sink, the girl who plays the daughter, nearly steals the show at times with a really strong performance but then disappears from the plot for a little while.\n\nOverall I would put this in the solidly good and maybe even very good category but not great.

I loved it.\n\nSomething better happened for me. As a race, human beings are all about looks. If you see an obese person, that may be all you see, but that's not who we are supposed to be to one another. \n\nThis movie went to the heart of Fraser's character, and let the audience see the struggle of obesity and the addiction to food. \n\nPerhaps some people will walk away with more than they bargained for, perhaps they will see people beyond flesh and bone, for what their soul is trying to say. Perhaps the jokes that we say out loud for a quick laugh will someday end.\n\nFinally, when this movie ended, when the screen turned white and the credits rolled, no one, including myself, got up from their seats. We sat there, almost frozen. \n\nThis is the type of film, although adapted from a play, is what we all need more of when we sit down to enjoy something on the big screen.",

Reading the negative reviews, critics seems to dwell most on Brendan Fraser's prosthetics, as if Aronofsky just wanted to turn him into a freakshow so we could marvel at his grotesquerie. Some critics say the film's premise is \"inherently dehumanizing.\" I didn't get that at all. Fraser's performance was amazing and all-too-human. But Aronofsky has always been polarizing, so there's that. Anyway .... 9 out of 10 stars for me.",

Pace is slow, but it's a drama, it's meant to be fleshed out. It doesn't wow or thrill or inspire awe, but it does hit you square in the heart. Brendan gave his all to that role and you can see it from the very beginning. I couldn't help but want an after credit scene, something to let the audience know what happens with the characters next. The final hour of the film, give or take, is the most moving as the history behind each character is revealed. It's a touching story that makes you long for reconciliation. The sad truth of the film is this: dying is no fairytale. We want to think there's going to be a chance to make everything right before the end, that this mortal coil can somehow be made whole through forgiveness. It's a poor substitute. When all is said and done, no one goes with you when your time comes, and you likely won't know when that will be. There's no more goodbyes after that, no more second chances. All that's left is what you've left behind, and something that The Whale teaches us - which it teaches us several things - is that you shouldn't hide, shouldn't wait for those moments you've been wishing for or missing. Because a day will come that will be your last and all that's left will be the love you left behind. If you can, give all of the love you have. That's what people will want the most.",

Written by Samuel D. Hunter. Directed by Darren Aronofsky.  Staring Brendan Fraser, Sadie Sink, Hong Chau, Ty Simpkins, Samantha Morton, Sathya Sridharan, and Jacey Sink. \n\nThis powerful movie wrote on the slate of my soul.\n\nIt is possible that I felt its power so completely because of the circumstances and experiences I lived through this past year.\n\nBut if you imagine you will see it one day, see it now in the theaters.

Brendan Frasier will no doubt get an Oscar nod, but if he wins, it will be for portraying an outsider like Forrest Gump or Rainman. Oscar loves a freak.",

Many films depict addiction and invoke drugs and alcohol, there is food addiction here which is a very real issue, as is the many other addictions beyond drug abuse. And really the film is about the central relationship, which is told well.\n\nFraser is unbelievably talented and commits to this character so fervently. Hong Chau and Sadie Sink stand out as supporting characters as well, with commanding presence and chemistry.\n\nIf you ask what this film is about it would be hard to pin down one theme: addiction, death, grieving, relationships, generational trauma, even inspiration and hope.",

I thought I could handle it but I was a wreck by the end. I think a lot of people will be turned away from this movie because it's hard to watch, and I would agree. This is the hardest movie I've had to sit though but I loved every bit of it. But I honestly don't know if I could ever watch it again, at the very least not alone. I've never walked into a movie with my food and chose not to eat it because the movie made me feel self conscious but this definitely did. It pains me to admit how much I relate to Charlie and Brendan Fraser plays him with so much charisma and kindness. He truly deserves every last little millisecond of the standing ovation he got when this premiered. Sadie Sink however plays her character in the total opposite direction and does such a good job at making you dislike her and like Charlie even more. Hong Chau really killed it this year with two standout performances but I really really liked her here. Ty Simpkins probably gives one of the best performances of his career so far, his character ended up having a lot of depth and emotion to him. Samantha Morton has a great couple minutes very deep into the movie and delivers a great performance alongside Fraser. Sathya Sridharan has a good recurring bit that ends up adding a lot to the story and themes. Daren Aronofsky crafts a fantastic story on grief, eating disorders, speaking the truth and being true to yourself, and the dangers of religious indoctrination. He manages to make a movie stuck in this one apartment very interesting and engaging. I got out of the theater and just sat in my car with this one for a minute. Probably not the best New Years watch because now I'll be sad all night. I really liked this one but I can't recommend it to everyone because I don't think everyone will be able to sit through it, it's really not easy. But for those who do I imagine they'll enjoy it. I for one absolutely loved it and I can't give it anything but a 10/10. What do you all think? Was it just as hard for you to sit though it? -Tyler.",

            "content": "Ever since I saw \"A Bright New Boise\" on stage in the basement theatre on Ludlow Avenue, I've been a fan of Samuel D. Hunter's work. As a playwright - and now as a screenwriter - he knows how to keep the action moving; he writes snappy and realistic dialogue. His characters are always well-rounded and exciting; they always have something to do and say that is meaningful and advances the story. And most of all, he is a master of telling a straightforward tale while using symbolism, metaphor, and insight to move the audience.\n\n\"The Whale\" is another of Hunter's plays, and I've long been anticipating its release on film. I've been reading and hearing about how great Brendan Fraser is as \"Charlie,\" the 600-pound protagonist, and I finally saw it this afternoon. This script - like \"Boise\" - examines faith, spirituality, and religion respectfully but honestly. Still, it allows for so much character work that the entire cast shines brightly.\n\nFraser is the star of the movie, of course, and is as natural as one could be in that much makeup and prosthetics. But equally convincing is Hong Chau as \"Liz,\" Charlie's only friend, Sadie Sink (\"Ellie,\" Charlie's estranged teenage daughter), Ty Simpkins (\"Thomas,\" a young man on a Christian mission), and Samantha Morton (\"Mary,\" Charlie's ex-wife.)\n\nAll of these characters' stories are peeled back like onions throughout the film, guided by the very patient hand of Darren Aronofsky. Aronofsky (\"Black Swan,\" \"The Wrestler\") always guides the audience through a story without rushing while making sure the characters - and thus the actors - stay in the forefront. In this 117-minute piece, he explores the fascinating dynamics between best friends, ex-lovers, parents and children, not to mention humanity's relationship with God. It's really well done.\n\nThe friend who accompanied me did not particularly like the movie. And if one was to approach this from a straightforward movie-going experience, I could understand the disappointment. The characters are all flawed; however, none of them are unredeemable. And that's the beauty of Charlie - despite his miserable, lonely, and painful existence, he never loses sight of the light in the world and in others.\n\nWho would have thought such a broken, depressing character could be a role model for us all? I think that's the beauty of \"The Whale.\"",

The movie is very heavy, but Brandon Fraser performance is worth an Oscar. Litterally. It is one of the best acting I ever see. And I watch movies. A lot. \n\nI don't push back the acting of the entire crew. They are all amazing in their role, and we can see how much they were invested in this movie. \n\nBut Brandon deliver on an entire new level. He give 1000%, his all-in, in this role that is certainly (but I hope not) the apotheosis of his career. \n\nIt's a dark movie. Really really dark. It is not violent. The only violence his the main character attitude about himself. But the subject, and the realism with wich it is depicted, the dialogues, and the sadness that is present trought the story, this is what is dark. \n\nIt is not a cute story. It is not a nice story. But it is a beautiful essai, a love letter, to the beauty of the human soul trought the worst of the moments. \n\nThe way the motion picture is filmed around the house, in a huit-clos, is a fantastic way to constrain us to the world wich the main character live. His only world. And these toughts, this way of including so many details about the main character in that limited of a space, where the narrative is given by both the character and the environnement, make the story much more.\n\nI must admit I am kind of sensible, so I cried for a good amount of the last third of the movie. I smiled as some of the other people using portative kleenex bag in the room. \n\nI needed that. And I think only for this, it is a must see. But there is also a lot of other reasons why it is worth a watch. \n\n5 star on freaking 5 baby",

The many characters in this film felt real and visceral.  A tragedy painted in a flourish of hope.  I recognized many of the theater goers I watched this movie were young, skinny, and judgemental.  Snickering at me, as if I was the character Brendan Fraser played and with no empathy for this story.

            "content": "I'm not going to dive into the synopsis of the film because it is widely available online, and frankly, the film \"shows\" you the story so well that the brief synopsis wouldn't do the story any justice. I want to applaud every single actor who played roles in this movie. Though I'm sure some acting professors may find criticisms in each of their ability, I believe that they all poured their hearts out playing these characters, the characters who are all fully justified of their own positions. With the origin of the film being a stage play, the film does everything in its power to keep the story intact without feeling the need to show everything, which is difficult to come by in our modern society where everything is shown, rather than told.\n\nThe characters are symbolic to say the least. Even though Charlie (Brendan Fraser) and his obesity may seem like a fiction or a non-fiction, it ultimately does not matter. After all, obesity is simply one of the health outcomes that we witness in our lives. One could easily replace Charlie's obesity with something else and they would end up with the same results as far as the story goes. And Charlie's not the only character who carries this symbol. Not only is every character in this story symbolic, each one is absolutely justified AND self-righteous. It's an endless loop that the characters have entrapped themselves in and there is no room for escape. With the unconventional display ratio of the film (not the usual 16:9 ratio), it feels like watching a personal diary that's filled with self-deprecation, frustration, and sheer agony that is inside a tight box. It is a tough pill to swallow as an audience, but a necessary one as it tells the tale that everyone needs to listen and comprehend. The film is not preachy to motivate the audience members to be proactive, but rather simply feeds us different combinations of characters's stories and make us think. That is why I think it is completely pointless to finger at any flaws or imperfections as it only illustrates the humanity behind our perfect selfies and posts. \n\nAfter two hours of the film (and ugly-crying for an hour and 30 minutes of it), I started to think how I would describe this film through an analogy. Aesop's fable of the North Wind and the Sun encapsulates the totality of experience from watching The Whale: at the end of the day, it wasn't the powerful North Wind who led the individual to take off their cloak, but rather it was the calmly, yet intensely present Sun's ray. Instead of the fast dynamic of a storm, this film consistently kept on twisting our guts. It continued to linger with both of us long after the film was over, and dare I say that it will remain with us for a long time. Films like this are neither easy to watch, nor easy to come by. The ugliness of humanity shows up in many forms and shapes that we cannot ignore or escape from them. Maybe if we let go of our self-righteousness, and maybe if we stopped giving into the hubris that the characters in this film commit to, maybe, just maybe the potential of humanity might expand and shake the world a bit more. Salute to all the actors, the director, the writer, the creative professionals for bringing this film into our world!",

I loved the questions raised beyond the usual propaganda or virtual signaling we see in most mass media productions today. Is it truly helpful to point out another's flaws? Or attempt to push them into any given direction of their beliefs? In the end all that matters is honesty and knowing what it takes to be a real friend. Where I myself cant share Charlie's view to see good in everyone I do agree that deep down anyone with empathy can and will be incapable of not caring. I give this movie the full amount of stars possible because it moved me on a level I cannot put into words!",

Watching the film, I was struck by three predominating impressions: that the melodramatic story amounted to something between a heart-wrenching work of drama and an outrageously grotesque spectacle, that Brendan Fraser's soul-stirring performance might as well conclude this year's Oscar's ceremony prematurely with him simply being mailed the award, and that in the artistic battle between the realistic and the poetic, poetry sometimes has something more honest to say about human experience. While not a film for either the faint of heart or those who think that slice-of-life naturalism is the only ethical way to approach matters of controversy, it will surely be appreciated by those who relish strong performances and Aronofsky's penchant for passionate, unrestrained film-making.",

            "content": "THE WHALE \u2013 directed by Darren Aronofsky, written by Samuel D. Hunter (after his original play) with Brendan Fraser (Charlie), Sadie Sink (Ellie), Ty Simpkins (Thomas), Hong Chau (Liz)\n\nThere are several themes in THE WHALE: obesity, identity, same-gender relationships, abandonment, parenthood and writing \u2013 the honesty of writing. And all these interlocking subjects are contained in little more than one living room, where one orderly corner meets a chaotic one.\n\nI have read from those who feel offended by Daren Aronofsky's depiction of 600 lbs. Charlie, who  needs a walker to be able to move, who perspires with profusion, who, far from enjoying food, is an addict of it, and whose swallowing of pizzas and potato chips and jam and anything he finds in the fridge, is an emotional response to pain. His partner, unable to survive the judgment and rejection of his father, a pastor,  keeps losing weight and ends up committing suicide. This is the start of Charlie's bulging, and I wonder if the beginning of this disease is not his desire to bring back his lover, to feed him through his own distorted body. But I find no cruelty from director Darren Aronofsky in his portrayal. Neither cruelty nor disrespect. \n\nDoes that mean there is no cruelty in the film? Actually, cruelty is aplenty, and emanates from the judgement of others (not the director) and from Charlie himself, who left wife and child in favor of his male lover. And let's not read this as a condemnation of homosexuality; let's read this as a condemnation of abandonment.\n\nOne cruel character is Ellie, Charlie's teenage daughter, played brilliantly by Sadie Sink who, with the multiplicity  of contradicting emotions traveling through her glance in seconds, is the one who deserves an Oscar in this powerful cast. (While Brendar's Charlie is masterful, something must be said about the make-up artists who created obesity with such realism.)  It is within those glances that you see that Ellie's meanness is pain that she cannot always disguise when compassion and the need to get close to her father filter through. \n\nBut the cruelest of all is Thomas who claims his need to help with the message of God, but who ends up being a weak hypocrite who stole money from the church, who condemns Charlie's way of life, his love for another man, his \"disgusting\" appearance, and is all too happy to return to his parents and his selfishness. Writer Samuel Hunter's choice of Thomas is both ironic and symbolic, for it represents everyman's conflict between his need to believe and the proof that God exists. The Thomas of the film sees God as a faraway king, not as a force living in every being, and particularly by Charlie who sees the positive in everything and his conflicted daughter as \"amazing.\"\n\nRight away, Hunter tells us that we must look beyond the realism of the film. There is that constant motif of Moby Dick, of the whale (persecuted or persecutor), and the reminder that within the abandoned body of Charlie there the beautiful mind of a teacher who likes to share, embodied here by the computer English glass he teaches, where the videos of all students come across the screen, and where his image is replaced by a dark space that he refuses to fill with his appearance. Only his voice comes out, a warm baritone, the spirit of what he is.\n\nThe choice of the unity of place, at times suffocating, at times a womb, is a gutsy one, as well as the few characters that manage to create an entire universe with humanity's essential topics and worries. At times, when the voices rise and become so dramatic, I tell myself, this is more appropriate for the stage. And when I read the credits, I do find out that THE WHALE is originally a play by Samuel Hunter that he adapted for the big screen. But I wish he had gone further for this is cinema, I wish he had toned down those exclamations that make the movie less a piece of art than it could be. Sometimes murmurs are more powerful than shouts; sometimes sonatas are more powerful than symphonies. So when I read critics mention the lack of subtlety, I agree. For this is a film that needs subtlety.\n\nIt's still a film to watch. For all its themes. For the importance of addressing the disease of obesity. For opening a little wider our minds and our compassion.\n\n2.1.23",

            "content": "\"People are amazing.\"\n\nThe Whale is a film based on the play of the same name. This was easily my most anticipated film this entire year. The return of Brendan Fraser and another Darren Aronofsky film meant I would be seated on day one. After months of anticipation, I can say that The Whale provided an emotionally draining experience with brilliant, Oscar-winning performances all around. Brendan Fraser is as good if not better than you'd expect, he is brilliant here and if he doesn't win that Oscar I think I'll be sick. Charlie is a complex character that with the wrong actor and or performance, could've gone in a completely different direction. I can see why this film sat in developmental hell for years, as they really needed to find the perfect actor for this to work. But luckily Fraser wins you over as Charlie and you root for him the whole way through. The effects done to bring his body and character to life are nothing short of incredible either, it never feels over the top or unreasonable. Sadie Sink as Ellie was also incredible, she is a character you despise due to her attitude, but her character is redeemed once you learn more about her sympathetic situation. That character runs such a big risk of ruining the film, but luckily Sadie Sinks's performance and a strong script keep her character in check. Throughout this film, we are restricted to Charlie's apartment. Only ever seeing the outside in flashbacks or when Charlie enters his porch. His daily routines are the same each day and we watch Charlie follow these activities throughout the week. This makes the film feel shockingly real and very claustrophobic, which is exactly what Aronofsky wanted here. Hong Chau as Charlie's friend and nurse, Liz had a tough task presented towards her. She has to love and hate Charlie all the same, as she is his friend but wants to push him to get better when he stays stubborn about his life choices. I would not be surprised if she grabbed a nomination for best supporting actress. Where this film falls short is Ty Simpkins character, Thomas. He's a missionary who wants to help Charlie, his entire arc felt really out of place and most if not all scenes that focus purely on him felt dragged out and uninteresting. While I understand and actually liked the themes presented with his character being introduced here, it felt like his character was unnecessary majority of the time. The Whale falls flat in other areas too, such as some pacing issues, and the fact that at times it almost feels too much like a play, especially early on. While that may sound like the most extreme nitpick it made the film's structure feel extremely off at points. I don't mind if films feel like stage plays but only if it doesn't misconstrue their structure. Even with that said, by the end of this film, it really ties together nicely and provides one of the best endings to any film this entire year. Flaws and all, The Whale is another fantastic Aronofsky film that has me constantly thinking about it hours later. Bring your tissues, because The Whale is profoundly sad, yet inspiring. Go get that Oscar Brendan.",

            "content": "Brendan Fraser delivers a triumphant comeback performance in Darren Aronofsky's most recent feature \"The Whale\". Samuel D. Hunter adapts his own award-winning play for the big screen, telling a devastating story about one man's last shot at redemption. Aronofsky's decade-long quest to get the film made has finally come to fruition in the form of a haunting drama that takes place entirely in one apartment in Idaho during the 2016 U.S. election. \n\nCharlie (Brendan Fraser) is a reclusive college professor who teaches online writing classes from the comfort of his couch and behind the fa\u00e7ade of a broken laptop camera. He has no friends, apart from his nurse Liz (Hong Chau), and the only visitors he gets are a pizza delivery guy and a Mormon missionary called Thomas (Ty Simpkins). Charlie's obesity is causing detrimental damage to his health and his steadfast refusal to go to the hospital doesn't help, but when Liz tells him he's at risk of heart failure, the grave reality of his situation dawns on Charlie. With only weeks, if not days left, he decides to attempt to reconnect with his daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink). \n\n\"The Whale\" is fuelled by sensational turns from the entire cast, but Brendan Fraser's portrayal of Charlie stands out as one of the best performances of 2022. Fraser captures heart-breaking emotion in his performance, effortlessly bringing Charlie's vulnerability to the screen. The various prosthetic pieces Fraser donned to transform into Charlie elevated his performance to another level, balancing impactful emotion with an impressive physical performance also. The film allows Fraser to deliver the best performance of his career that will hopefully garner the actor his first Oscar nomination. \"Stranger Things\" star Sadie Sink appears alongside Fraser taking on the role of Ellie, Charlie's estranged teenage daughter. Sink delivers a powerful performance that immediately lets audiences know just how spiteful the 17-year-old highschooler can be, spitting venomous words taken straight from the pages of Hunter's play. Hong Chau adds to her already impressive year, appearing in Kelly Reichardt's \"Showing Up\" and Mark Mylod's \"The Menu\", delivering a stunning performance, shining in every scene she's in.\n\n\"The Whale\" is a stellar adaptation of Hunter's play, it flawlessly brings the characters and the story to the screen through a layered, thematic screenplay that forms the foundation for an impactful drama. The film balances a handful of emotions including guilt, shame, and anger, and themes like grief and religion. \"Insidious\" star Ty Simpkins, through a strong performance, embodies the film's themes of religion by portraying a Mormon missionary who tries to convert Charlie to Mormonism in order to \u2018save him', but as the film progresses it's revealed that both Charlie and Liz already have a connection to the religion, bringing up painful memories and opening old wounds. The film also weaves in references to the Herman Melville's novel \"Moby Dick\" and other marine-themed components including the recurring sound of waves which was taken directly from Hunter's play. \n\nOscar-nominee and long-time Aronofsky collaborator Matthew Libatique once again gets to show off his immense talent for creating stunning visuals. Libatique uses the fact that the film takes place entirely in one location (Charlie's apartment), except for one scene at the start, to craft stunning visuals that emphasises the isolation Charlie feels because he's unable to leave his apartment. This puts the audience in his shoes, allowing them to feel the same isolation he does, only seeing other people when they come to visit. Libatique's work compliments the other technical aspects of the film, from Andrew Weisblum's editing to the remarkaPble special effects makeup, courtesy of Adrien Morot (\"Barney's Version\"), that reinforces Fraser's performance. Composer Rob Simonsen (\"Foxcatcher\") produces a haunting score that excellently matches the film's empathy and aching sadness. \n\n\"The Whale\" is a film lead by an outstanding performance from Brendan Fraser and is bolstered by marvellous supporting turns from Sadie Sink, Hong Chau and Ty Simpkins. Darren Aronofsky directs a sensational adaptation of Samuel D. Hunter's play, and fingers crossed he directs Fraser to a very well-deserved Oscar nomination. This is by far one of 2022's most powerful films, full to the brim with gut-wrenching emotion that will leave you teary eyed. \"The Whale\" sticks with you long after the credits have rolled, from the performances (especially Fraser's and Sink's) to the complex themes covered throughout the neat two-hour runtime.",

It so beautifully leads you to empathize with Charlie's pain and I really felt for him, and grew to love him for his positivity and intelligence.  I loved the themes of how religion can ruin people's lives, and I think it's an important topic to explore and has not been done very often.  I do wish the daughter character had had more of an arc, but at the same time my frustration with her lack of change or empathy made me appreciate Charlie's unconditional love for her even more. That's a rare kind of love.",

It's a raw, heart-wrenching tale of familial drama, trauma, and grief. Every scene peels back a new layer from the incredibly cast of characters. There is no scene that is not dedicated to character development, and every scene propels the narrative to higher stakes and character depth. Full of subtle and admittedly not-so-subtle symbolism, many of our 21st century anxieties are depicted. Thought-provoking and moving, what may at first seem like gratuitous shock, or over-the-top characterization, is actually perfectly paced and only introduced when needed to both familiarize the audience with brutal reality and to bring us further into despair with our characters. The classic Aronofsky character study, critics will dislike this one for being bold enough to hold a mirror to society, even if it means portraying controversial subject matter. Audiences can dislike it if they take it on face value without wanting to take a deep dive into characterization, be it the ones on-screen or their own. There is much at work here and it may take a second watch for some to understand all the characters.\n\nIn regards to the accusations of \"fatphobia\", I would argue that the main character's weight is treated as secondary to the primary story of grief and despair, as a symptom and not the problem. The film has a few shocking moments, with most happening at the start of the film, only to get the audience accustomed with the physical state of the main character. I would also argue that if people accuse something of being fatphobic simply because they are disgusted by seeing fat people, then they themselves are the problematic ones.",

The prosthetics deserve a mention, of course.

He sees so much optimism in others, but so much disgust in himself. It was also great to see how he finds the importance of honesty from others, because deep down he knows he is not honest with himself. \n\nAs a previous pizza delivery driver myself, you grow to know your usual customers. There are definitely some that order all the time, but you don't get to know know much about them at all. But all you do know is that for how often they order, they cannot be that healthy.

A tour de force in embodying pain and joy through the simple gesture of eye contact through moments of both dialogue and solo shots. A story encapsulated in empathy and surrounded in sorrow, Aronofsky is able to recreate the intimacy of stage play through the blocking and committing to focus of the character Charlie and the week we spend with him, his family, and his environment. I do believe I had some hangups with the way the daughter character Ellie played by Sadie Sink, was handled towards the end of the movie. Without spoiling, I don't think the emotional pendulum is off based giving the story and the character, I did feel the grim reality was almost whisked away, in lue of conveying a bit more explicitly the underlying themes that parallel not only Moby Dick but the mystery student's book review essay critiquing Herman Melville's acclaimed novel. In such a fashion, that leans pessimistic yet honest and is the catalyst for what Charlie's desire is for all those around him, especially after the rising action of the first portion of the film. Again, my critiques are simply me acknowledging I didn't give it a 5 but that doesn't mean The Whale isn't a beautiful work of art, with some sad but true messaging throughout it.",

I can tell you that Brendan Fraser's \"Charlie\" is nothing I've ever seen or experienced before. The performance is so emotionally taxing. If, you've dealt with depression, guilt, grief, pain, self harm. This performance will haunt you. Charlie is a very complex man, one thing to note is his optimism, empathy and love for those that share his space. \n\nAdding, the supporting characters held their own too. Ho Chung's \"Liz\" who portrays Charlie's caregiver/friend is immaculate she rightfully deserves supporting actress Oscar nod. Through her story you see someone that has suffered a huge loss, and she's caring for someone who's given up and she's perilous to stop their self destructive behavior. However all she wants is to make Charlie comfortable. Her performance is on the nose but extremely nuanced as well. If, you've loved someone that has essentially given up on life and also witnessed these same behaviors in someone else you'll feel her performance. It is devastating to witness two people you love essentially suffer the same fate. And, there's nothing you can do about it. \n\nLastly, there's Sadie Sink's \"Ellie\" her performance is visceral. And, she'll surely be splitting the votes with Ho Chung. Her performance is harsh, unrelenting and punishing. She portrays Charlie's daughter, if you've ever felt abandoned by someone you loved, a parent you'll understand. She essentially is all what Charlie lives for however she never knew. But, as a kid it's not up to her to push for a relationship it was him, that should have fought for her. Despite his limited mobility and depression, him not being in her life affected her deeply, and he deserves her wrath. I've never been abandoned by a parent, however I have people in my life who have and I understand the pain that it causes, and scars that never heals.\n\nOverall this movie is masterful and is a character/case study on our humanity and empathy. I've viewed some hot takes and read some articles where critics gave negative reviews and claimed the movie was \"fatphobic\". Those folks just want to be derisive and surly for the sake of being an other. If, your takeaway is that. You are lacking in emotional intelligence. \n\nThis film's purpose is for the viewer at the end to feel as optimistic, as Charlie. And, if you can pick yourself up through despair and grab life by the reigns, you owe to yourself and those that love you to do so.",

I would be shocked if they gave the Oscar to anyone else as this is a performance that equally parts quietly beautiful and a stellar physical transformation. Sometimes the story feels a bit uneven or repetitive but the dialogue is pretty engaging and it all comes together in a meaningful way by the final act. I felt sometimes Sadie Sink's character was meaner than was actually believable, but her performance wasn't the issue, it's more of a script problem. Nonetheless, Fraser owns the screen every second he's on it and creates a character that is deeply empathetic and ultimately flawed yet lovable. In the end, it is looking like Darren Aronofsky will yet again get another actor an Oscar, and Brendan Fraser gives us one of the easiest to-root-for-comeback stories of the year in an unmissable film.",

Brendan Fraser plays his role as Charlie perfectly- he's the man who, even when he's being confronted with something he doesn't agree with or dislikes, still keeps himself composed enough and never really raises his voice in anger at anyone. It's more realistic than many other movies in a similar ilk. I also applaud the movie for tackling an issue you don't really see outside of TLC's My 600lb Life and etc. Most overweight people are played off either as comedy or as highly confrontational about their weight with reality being most fat people know they're fat, admit they're fat, and yet are still very much real living and feeling people who are just as much deserving of a protagonist role in a story as the chiseled hunk or shapely femme fatale.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with the movie was the fact that much of the exposition is through dialog rather than flashbacks or actions. I understand that this is a modern trend in movies and that it saves on budget, but I would have enjoyed a few more instances of, say, showing the deceased partner or glimpses of Charlie's life prior to his binge eating.\n\nAll-in-all, as a fat guy myself I connected with this movie and hope to see more movies like it in the future.",

It's all a lie, and also elevates the depravity of the fallen human race.  The living God of Jesus Christ is alive and personally experienced by millions of people across the earth for generations.  Those that are not exposed to truth, and deceived by lies and perversions from man; are missing out from a powerful experience with their creator who loves them and wants to save and heal them miraculously with the truth, and who is unwilling for anyone to be left out of His eternal kingdom.  Our creator knows you more deeply than you will ever know yourself, He heals the broken hearted. :)",

I sincerely hope Brendan Fraser wins an award for his heartfelt performance. I believe him to be the perfect actor for this role. His eyes alone are so expressive and kind and convey a sea of emotions, as does his voice. This movie deserves more of an audience. Sadly, there were perhaps ten of us in the theater (matinee), while avatar was sold out. That movie may sate ones need for entertainment, but this movie feeds one's soul.",

Charlie doesn't seem to get pity or disgust from anyone except true strangers. We the audience are strangers at the beginning of the film. The people who truly get to know him have a deep love for him. I think most of the audience will be included in that group by the end.\n\nThere is a lot to unpack, but overall I think the entire cast understood what this film was meant to do, and it's a masterpiece. Circumstance can put us in difficult places, and even good people can hurt us. But, we can still love them, even though our world has changed. \n\nIt's hard to grow, and learn lessons in modern cinema.

One thing that I noticed critics complaining about is how 'stagey' the film is.  Well, it *was* a stage play.  Not the first time an adaptation for screen doesn't play as we think it should.  ( it should be noted that Hunter, the playwright, said in an intrview with NBC \"Darren said on day one that we're a theater company, and we dug into it as you would dig into a text. He blocked it like you would block a play with the exception of like, we weren't playing everything to an audience.\"  So there you have it. \nI have to say that my main / only complaint was an aspect of Sadie Sink's performance.  And I don't mean to say her performance was bad in any way.  (although it was clear to me from the first minute that everyone in the cast could act their pants off - and no one was going to come close to Fraser, who pulled this off with a knowledgeable grace that perhaps no one else could).  Sink gave a fine performance.  What stuck with me after, though, was how, when she was raging (often) she many times resorted to the same ragin' spot.  A quote from W Magazine: 'To capture Ellie's pain, Sink and Aronofsky nerded out on acting fundamentals\u2014experimenting with blocking, the character's way of moving through the apartment, and the different forms in which her anger manifested.'  I submit they didn't perhaps, 'nerd-out' enough.   Granted, when almost all the action is inside the living room of the apartment, options are limited.  And granted, this is a 20-year-old actress, climbing a veritable mountain of a role.  I just would have liked to have seen something *more* come out of the 'nerd out'.  As for what many folks have noted (which maybe should be called 'squeamish factor'), as Charlie says.....it's honest.  Too honest?  Like Charlie, too large for comfort?  I can't speak to that.  I can only say that it was a huge dose of honest humanity.  And that dose was, in the main, due to Mr. Fraser.  Welcome back, dude.",

While he didn't actually gain all that weight to star in the film, his commitment to learning how to move in such a bulky and complex set of prosthetics his commendable. That isn't mentioning his engrossing portrayal of a man who has regrets and has fallen into a secluded life gorging himself to death in a dingy apartment. Yet despite all of his flaws Charlie wields an enormous empathy and recognition of positive attributes. This is apparent in his interactions with his students through the online course that he teaches and even more so in his relationship with his estranged daughter. Darren Aronofsky clearly spent a long time finding a lead that would work for the film and Brendan Fraser really REALLY works. \n\n        Speaking of Charlie's estranged daughter, Sadie Sink also brings her A game as Ellie in a portrayal of a daughter who his hurt by her father's mistakes and clearly wants nothing to do with him in the beginning of the movie. It is evident that her mother Mary (played by Samantha Morton) only sees Ellie's negative aspects but Charlie sees something more. When Mary shows Charlie how unflinchingly rude her daughter is online, the FIRST words out of Charlie's mouth are spoken in admiration of Ellie's honesty. Charlie knows that Ellie's outward behavior is indicative of a much deeper core that he wants to draw out of her, and it's so emotionally satisfying to watch. I know people will criticize the casting for grabbing at star power but I think the casting overall is really great. \n\n        The score is so menacing, yet ultimately triumphant, The story rides such an emotional wave that I forget it's all set in a dingy apartment. I somehow want to read Moby Dick now; I don't know what else to say about this movie except that more people should be going out to see this movie!",

Main character had a bad thing happen in their life and became just an awful person. He uses money to guilt his child into spending time with him instead of actually becoming someone worth spending time with! Worse - his fake optimism that exists for anything other than his own life or responsibilities. The missionary character was ridiculous and made no sense, neither did his caregivers story- trying to make you feel for them but the writing sucked. Overall, this needed a couple rewrites before ever being made and it's a shame because Fraser's acting was good for the most part. I don't think this paints a very good picture for those suffering with the kind of pain shown here- if anything, it says you're only worth something if you hoard money and time your outreach to those who should be loved ones perfectly. Further- as someone far removed from evangelicalism after growing up in it- if you're going to take that topic head on maybe consult some people on what it's actually like to be scorned by a church community. This didn't represent those people well either, and maybe that was the saddest part.",

They're telling a story about how a trauma and heartbreak caused someone who struggles with food addiction to descend into the depths of addiction... and in the face of death, reckon with what it is to be a father, lover, friend and human being.\n\nThere have been countless films on addiction that involved alcohol and drugs. This one involves food. These are very very very real things that people use as coping mechanisms. And they can, and do, destroy peoples lives. Body Positivity and Fat Acceptance do not have to discount the quality of storytelling that's happening with The Whale, but unfortunately, that seems to be what's happening with critics right now. \n\nThere wasn't a dry eye in the AMC theater I saw \"The Whale\" in this afternoon. Most of us stayed seated well past the credits, still stunned by the film and its performances. Employees had to ask us to leave so they could clean.\n\nI recommend seeing this film. Highly recommend. And should you have moments where you're perturbed by what you're seeing, I recommend taking a deep, deep look at why you're feeling what you're feeling. Chances are, you're about to learn something about your own relationship with trauma and coping.",
