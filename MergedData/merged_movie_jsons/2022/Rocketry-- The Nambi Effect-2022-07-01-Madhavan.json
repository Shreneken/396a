Many scenes will make you cry. And knowing this fact, that it happened to real person of the kind Nambi Narayanan ji. You will see a kind of shock passing through you. Last scene of scooter and car will make you realize, the problem with India's system, what happens with our brilliant minds, how the system rewards them for their talent and hard work. ALL TRUE INDIANS must watch and should think what can we do in our capacity to change our system, and those who can, who are actually in capacity should act on it, as well.",

We need to seriously look at what we have been learning at schools and academics.This movie is a must watch for all Indians to know how a true patriotic has been stripped off all the achievements just on the basis of fake case. Madhvan is absolute brilliant and honest with his performance and so does the supporting cast. They have tried to inculcate all the major happenings of his life and journey and the setback.Kudos to entire team who have a winner in their hand. This movie should be encouraged and youth should get inspired to serve the country. Had Nambi sir didn't face those fake cases he would have been enjoying the same reputation as Dr Kalam.A man who is no less than a James Bond and did all this for the country and its people. Hail Nambi Sir!",

            "content": "This film is based on Scientist Nambi Narayanan and his contributions to liquid fuel engines in India followed by the incidents where he was wrongly held guilty for betraying his nation. This film is presented in an interview way where our beloved SRK interviews Mr. Nambi.I must say the biopic has been made in a very interesting way. It keeps you hooked till the very end. Occasionally there are light humorous moments and go very well with the flow. It is also quite informative about the journey of liquid fuel engines in our country. Towards the end, the film does get really emotional and you feel bad for Mr. Nambi when SRK pleads him for apology for what he went through.R. Madhavan absolutely nails this role. It seems he put in a lot of effort in making this film. Not only does he ace the humorous scenes but also kills it in the emotional scenes with his wife towards the end. He has lived this role. I think all the brownie points of this film is scored by Madhavan thanks to his direction as well, he has managed to make a film that is very engaging and enjoyable and emotional at the same time.Nambi's friends too give a very good performance especially that one friend who started stammering when he tried speaking to a beautiful lady was hilarious \ud83d\ude02. Nambi's wife too does a very good job.SRK has an extended cameo as the interviewer and must say, for such a small not so significant role like this, only a man with a big heart and yet being a big superstar can accept this role and that is SRK. Only big actor other than SRK was Amir Khan who is known to play such small cameos in films otherwise normally you see superstars denying such small role. SRK's last act where he begs for apology on behalf of whole nation stole the show.Negatives - i still can't believe how poorly foreign people are showcases in films . Till date they are portrayed as stereotypical and caricaturish characters . High time they be portrayed as more matured..Overall, a film that you must invest your money in and i guarantee you it will be worth your time and money.",

            "content": "R Madhavan aka Rocketry Madhavan , what a great movie to Debut with, as a Director . The movie is on Mr. Nambi Narayanan , an ISRO scientist who underwent so much of physical and mental trauma after getting framed of being a spy and arrested by Indian govt only to be later released confirming he's guilt free . Nambi is one successful scientist who had worked along with Dr Kalam sir in 1990s . It was a pleasure to know about this actual SuperStar born on 12th Dec who aimed for stars from our mother land . A movie made on him is now nothing less than an Absolute Sensation, this might not be even the apt word to mention the class of the movie , it's beyond words , may be beyond the blue sky , the stars , the galaxies possible beyond several planets . Gone are those days when I used to think Biopic's are the easiest to make , but this movie proved it wrong . So much hardwork put in by the entire crew. But for once we should agree it's definitely a Rocket Science, for few of the conversations with reference to it was a bit of challenge to understand :) still it's very minimal and ignorable . R Madhavan, one of the finest actor we have in the world cinema features as Nambi and does an extremely brilliant performance and adding to it beyond acting through this movie he also proves himself as a man with great visionary working from the seats of a director. Paired with him is Simran, she's one impeccable actress who can steal everyone's heart anyday by appearing onscreen even if it happened for a millisecond . Beyond these two there are definitely more stars to mention for their remarkable performances. Surya adds some attraction in a cameo role. The screenplay was almost flawless, the BGM, the CGI and the re-recording needs a special mention here. Dialogues in Tamil was top notch , extremely enjoyable . However the director could have avoided making the foreign nationals speak in Tamil which sounded more like the language spoken Shim Chan cartoons :). Again ignore and start your countdown to fly towards the movie hall to witness this Indian wonder. Overall Rocketry, a Mission to Oscars ! .",

            "content": "Rocketry-the nambi effect is an action biography drama sci-fi film directed by madhavan.Madhavan, the actor has given a stellar performance in this film. Basically, the film revolves around him and his character only is purely fleshed out and he has justified it. Simran, as meena too gives an empathetic performance. The rest of the cast is good. The foreign actors seem to be good but i am not sure about it because someone took a conscious decision to dub their french and english and russian all into hindi and that takes out the gravity from the dialogues. I can say for me, that many a times i was disconnected becausd of the dubbing. There was no need to dub the foreign languages into hindi.The writing too is pretty good. The scientific terms about rocket science, the concepts are not oversimplified for the audience which i liked being a science student myself. I like mission mangal too but taking out the scientific approach from a science film does not justify it. Other characters apart from nambi are not really written well. Even we don't get to know much about his family members and that is the exact reason why we can connect with nambi but not with his family members so much. The screenplay is pretty much engaging specially the second half where the drama portion is built well. The first half feels a bit stretched because of the reason of dubbing etc. But it does not harm the film.The vfx used is pretty solid. It does not come across as amateurish so points for that as well. The set design and production design is also really good. The 1900s europe and USA was built really well. The hairstyles, the moustaches, the costumes make it look authentic. The cinematography is okayish nothing extraordinary.It feels really good to see SRK on the screen after so long though in an extended cameo. He too has given a solid performance.This is a solid film boasting of an earnest attempt by madhavan in showing the life of a person who was wronged by his nation. After all \"a country is called great only when the country respects those who make it great\". This is a film you should definitely watch. I rate it 7.8 out of 10.",

R Madhavan has turned director with this film and in his debut directorial he impressed everybody and handled the film very well. Hats off to Madhavan for picking this subject and not making it an overdramatized film. He deserves an applaud to show how Vikram Sarabhai, APJ Abdul Kalam, Neil Armstrong, and Cleaver Hughes were impressed by Nambi's achievements.The pace of the film in the first half is slow and a lot of rocket science jargon is used due to which it becomes difficult for some viewers to connect with the scenes. The second half is better and more engaging. It offers a few stirring & emotional moments of Nambi's interrogation, society's reaction on his family, and the climax showing Nambi Narayanan himself was the stand-out scene.This is an Award-winning performance by Madhavan, he surprises the audience with his look & body language and how he transforms into Nambi Narayanan. The makeup department does an impressive job. Simran was outstanding in the second half of the film. Shah Rukh Khan is excellent in a special appearance and his presence upraised the film. The supporting cast has done their job well with the limited written roles.Other highlights of the film are the cinematography and the background music which enhances the impact in several scenes. There was a large room for the crisp editing in the first of the film, with a runtime of 157 minutes, the film seems too lengthy.",

In fact he made us all emotional at the climax scene.Definitely the film u should watch with family and everyone specially the young teenagers growing up aspiring to work in ISRO.And one thing to say that those who loved Mission Mangal should abstain from watching since there is neither 'puri' making job in ISRO shown here nor any melodrama or over the top dialogue deliveries frm someone like Akshay.

Yes some chilling moments when VIKAS went beyond 135 secs but the superhero thing was completely uncalled for. The fundamental gap between the audience and the pace of the movie in the first half is like you run on a treadmill but the treadmill's and your speeds are different, so you will definitely meet the accident. The first half was just to show how great the rocket scientist was but with no continuity whatsoever. The 2nd half was the savior when the same scientist was jailed for being a traitor. The story calms down so does the screenplay and audience starts connecting and relating the marvelous yet irrelevant 1st half. Good acting, dialogue delivery in the 2nd half. Overall, a good watch but yes, the 9.1 is definitely too much. India needs to slow down in emotions and react to the right content instead of selling itself with biases.",

            "review_title": "R Madhavan Starrer 'Rocketry: The Nambi Effect' is a Perfection to Direction !!!",
            "content": "Rocketry: The Nambi Effect explores Narayanan's life as an arrogant but brilliant scientist who becomes the first person from ISRO to attend an Ivy League University (Princeton). He also manages to secure an unbelievable deal (worth 400 million pounds) from Colonel Cleaver (Ron Donachie), the CEO of Rolls Royce- armed with charm and aided by Cleaver's apparent \"Imperial Guilt\".Rocketry begins with an extended shot that suitably begins in space and travels down all the way to Earth, where we are introduced to Nambi's family. With just a few lines of conversation, Madhavan, who is also making his debut as a filmmaker, gives us a peek into the joyful family of his protagonist. When we meet them first, the family is joking around, unaware of the peril that is on their doorstep. And boom, their world turns upside down as Nambi is arrested on charges of spying.The film plays out in flashback as Nambi Narayanan (R Madhavan) narrates his life story to superstar Shah Rukh Khan in 2014. The crew filming this mammoth interview is cursing their luck for being stuck in the studio late at night for a 'long and boring' story of an old scientist. However, as Nambi begins talking, everyone including the host are riveted to his story.Madhavan dutifully covers every aspect of Nambi's journey, especially his professional feats and challenges. Nambi's mentor is none other than the prolific Vikram Sarabhai (Rajit Kapoor), who knows his prodigy only too well. When Nambi gets a full scholarship from Princeton University, he takes it up despite the obvious mismatch in what he is offered and what he wants to study. But not the one to toe the line, Nambi finds a way to not only learn what he wants but also be the best at it. So much so that he is offered a job by NASA but he chooses to work for ISRO instead and do whatever it takes to propel India's space mission.While Nambi's work life is exciting and fraught with challenges, it is also way too technical and Madhavan doesn't shy away from throwing complex astronomy terms and jargons at the audience. The entire first half is spent in showing various facets of Nambi's slightly eccentric personality and astral experiments where the very animated background score acts as a pointer for us to root for our protagonist. At times, the context is lost in technicalities and we're forced to focus on the big picture. The non-linear execution is exciting and generates anticipation but also adds to the confusion.R Madhavan relives Nambi Narayanan's real life in reel with full conviction. From his make-up to dialogue delivery and expression, Madhavan becomes the man whose story he tells. Shah Rukh Khan looks dapper as ever and uses his trademark charm to play the role of an interviewer with a heart. He mirrors the conscience of a nation for a man, who dedicated his life to a cause against all odds. Simran is a surprise package as the sensitive and dignified Meena Narayanan. Simran's portrayal goes a long way in humanising Nambi's passion for his work and the hardships he endures. Among the supporting actors, Sam Mohan stands out as Unni, whose character is a lot more fleshed out than others.The second half is much stronger and emotionally draining but the film's pace remains slow. It's no rocket science that this one's a niche film. It has an interesting subject and an untold story of a man, who was wronged for always being right for his nation. 'Rocketry' takes off well, hits some turbulence on the way, but eventually soars high with real characters and moving moments that make it worth your while.",

            "content": "Rocketry (2022) :\nMovie Review -One of the finest actors in the country, R. Madhavan, has finally shown the courage to bring the controversial life of Nambi Narayanan to the silver screen with Rockery: The Nambi Effect. This is quite like a biopic era for our generation, and frankly, it is getting too much nowadays. However, there are some biopics that are worthwhile. There are some stories that deserve to be told in cinematic aspects so that more and more people will know about them. R. Madhavan's film, Rocketry, is definitely one of those few films. The sensational story of the great Nambi Narayanan deserves your attention for sure.Rocketry is based on the life of Nambi Narayanan, a former scientist and aerospace engineer of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), who was falsely accused of espionage. The film shows us the great sacrifices he has made for the country, the great achievements that have helped the Indian Space Organisation to stand equally with global superpowers, the great torture he endured, and his great patriotism. Overall, it's all about his Greatness! At the same time, the film does not hesitate to show the ugly face of our system, which includes cops, politicians, and many faceless and unknown threats. R. Madhavan's writing tries to cover most of the events, and fortunately it succeeds in collecting most of them within 150 minutes. There are some fantastic scenes which will leave you with joy, tears and jitters, but there are a few scenes that will make you feel guilty for doing nothing. We have all been just mute spectators while Mr. Nambi Narayana was going through hell on earth. While we talk about pluses, we should not forget the flaws. Rockery has a few dull moments, a couple of overdramatic scenes, and some unnecessary masala which could have been avoided. The first half is a little complicated for the masses. I am sure those backbenchers would feel like going back to physics classes during those scenes, and unfortunately, there are no Hindi subtitles, either. The second half is much better, though, and it manages to cover the lost ground somehow.Rocketry is all about R. Madhavan's brilliance. The actor R. Madhavan. I was counting his finest performances, such as \"Alaipayuthey\" (2000), \"Anbe Sivam\" (2003), \"3 Idiots\" (2009) and \"Vikram Vedha\" (2017). Rocketry: The Nambi Effect is one more addition to this great list. Yes, he is that good here. There were a few scenes where I think he went wrong with the accent, but the rest of the time, he was truly flawless. Simran, backed by years of experience, excels in the role of Meena Narayanan. She may not have too many scenes, but whatever scenes she has, she is phenomenal in those. The small but important roles of Gulshan Grover as APJ Abdul Kalam and Rajit Kapur as Vikram Sarabhai are delightful. In the supporting roles, Misha Ghoshal, Muralidharan, Dinesh Prabhakar, Karthik Kumar, Phyllis Logan, Vincent Riotta, Shyam Renganathan, Sam Mohan, Sriram Parthasarathy, Rajeev Ravindranathan and Bijou Thaangjam are superb. Shah Rukh Khan has about 10-12 minutes of screentime, and he seduces you with his charm. He's not in that form in the beginning, but picks up later on. Watch out for the final scenes that have him in those highly emotional segments.Rocketry seems like a big-budget film when you see it on screen. Shot across multiple countries, this one is a lavish outing despite its moderate budget. Sirsha Ray's cinematography makes sure that you feel the locations, and more importantly, those rocket, equipment, and engine scenes. The background score is so good there that you literally feel like the earth is quaking right there under your seat. The music is situational and that was a really good move by Madhavan. He knew that there was already a lot of stuff to show in Nambi's life, so why waste time on songs? The VFX team has also done a nice job considering the limited budget and scope for it.R. Madhavan makes his debut with this film, and he certainly has a long way to go and a lot to learn. He was handling multiple responsibilities here. Direction, production, writing and acting. It's like rocketry is all about him. So if there's something good, then he is the only person who deserves appreciation, and if there's something wrong, then he is also the only person to be blamed. Nevertheless, it is a very nice attempt. Maybe too much responsibility has put too much pressure on him and that's why I misplaced a few things, but that's still okay. He hasn't dropped the cup down. It's just a little quivering, and then he grabs it. Rocketry could have been an even better product with the kind of sensational story it has, but somewhere something is less. But isn't that too much to ask for? Nobody else dared to pick this story, Madhavan at least tried and gave his honest efforts in making it. So, let's appreciate him for that and overlook small glitches. As a whole, Rockery makes for a worthwhile one-time watch with one of the most important stories coming out of the scientific department of our country. You have to watch to know the greatness of Nambi Narayanan and the superiority of R. Madhavan.RATING - 6/10*",

Of course he was unfairly treated by the system and he deserves a good compensation from the Indian govt and people. Thus, his acclaims are well deserved. Yet, the way the movie claimed that India is the first nation to go to Mars in the first attempt and Mr. NAMBI made it happen were blatant exaggeration. It seems Mr. Nambi is a brilliant scientist who kept looking for stealing ideas, data, and resources. He got everything from other countries and the movie made a big fuss about it by claiming he did it from scratch. The way the movie presented ISRO was saddening. There were other good scientists, including APJ Kamal, there as well but the movie kind of showed everyone incompetent. The movie showed big contracts with foreign countries were already negotiated by Mr. NAMBI while in reality these high level contracts could not be signed or negotiated without high level govt involvement. I think the movie overestimated Mr. Nambi and thus fictionalized many part of it.",

A person who rejected million dollar package of NASA and worked for India and in return what he got...

R Madhavan had given a true honor to Mr. Nambi Narayanan...If this story was untold, there would be many who still believe that Nambi Narayanan is a traitor...SRK cameo presence was noteworthy....Overall a must watch movie just not only to make the movie hit but also to realise that if our nation had achieved feats, its because of those patriots who selflessly lived their lives for the nation...",

            "review_title": "Interesting, but flawed biopic",
            "content": "Madhavan makes his directorial debut in Rocketry, a biopic based on the life of Nambi Narayanan. I don't need to write anything about the plot as it's already been covered by most of the reviewers.We need to understand that most if not all biopics have to take creative liberty with their subjects so that it engages us as a movie goer. Otherwise, we would be better off watching a documentary. In recent times, we have seen Indian movie biopics take major creative liberties to make their subject larger than life. Sometimes the makers have to change the characterization of their subject; for example, instead of portraying GR Gopinath as his original Brahmin identity in Sudha Kongara's Soorarai Pottru, it became a story about a downtrodden Non-Brahmin named Maara who rose up and became one of the most powerful Indian airline leaders because it needed to fit Tamil sensibilities and appease Suriya fans. On the other hand, you have hagiographies like NTR Kathanayakudu/Mahanayakudu where the protagonist is basically God and that can never go well.Here Madhavan veers between biopic and hagiography. We see Nambi Narayanan from his early days in ISRO to his elder days. His dedication towards science, space and to his country is commendable. He is so totally dedicated to his job that he will not stop until he's fully satisfied. But he is made to become as this all-knowing superhero genius who can solve everything. Nobody else has anything to contribute around him; they just surround him and applaud his ideas as brilliant. Despite a couple of scenes where his dedication and determination does cost him a slight bit of his human soul, he barely has any flaws. Maybe the real-life Nambi was like this, but the over glorification of the character is hammered hard in our skulls without any nuance.And that's the main reason why Rocketry fails to explore the human side of Nambi. We don't get to know more about him as a person, what made him tick, why he was like this, etc. We get some interesting James Bond espionage type scenes, but because the screenplay glorifies him so much, we don't feel the struggle and humiliation he went through; it just feels hollow. Nor do we get to know his family, his mentors or his friends. They are just satellites surrounding him.A lot of technical jargon is thrown at us and while I'll say that while it is indeed educative and important, you can't bore the audience with it. The pacing makes the movie feel longer than it is and there are a lot of emotional manipulation where the BGM just tries to overpower you with these loud moments that just don't stick, plus the editing is not slick enough to make you care.Having said the above, it is still a story that needed to be told and Madhavan is the sole reason you should watch it. Though he does not fit the role of a 27-year-old student in the beginning portions due to his age (despite still maintaining his good looks), he embodies Nambi Narayanan very well from his 30s all the way until his elderly days. He has put in a lot of hard work and love into this portrayal and despite the hagiographic nature as I earlier mentioned, he does make the character watchable. The real Nambi Narayanan makes an appearance towards the end, and it was good to see him speak in his own voice.On the other hand, the rest of the cast don't have any role to play and it's sad to see Simran, Misha Ghoshal (a talented actress), Karthik Kumar (who reminded me of Atul Kulkarni), Rajiv Kapur/Ravi Raghavendra and Sriram Parthasarathy wasted in underdeveloped roles. While there is some dignity given to the non-Indian actors where they speak their own languages instead of being dubbed in Tamil or Hindi, the less said about them the better. Neither Suriya (Tamil) or Shah Rukh Khan (Hindi) impress in their cameo.Sirsha Ray also deserves credit for the cinematography which helps engage the viewer somewhat and the CGI isn't so bad.Overall, while the majority of people may be inspired and wholly satisfied by this labor of love by Madhavan to Nambi Narayanan, others will feel disappointed that the making did not do justice to the human element of the man. Despite my problems with the movie, I'm glad it was told and it's strictly a one-time watch movie thanks to Madhavan. He is one of the rare actors who cares about his audience and wants to give them good concept and content-based movies. He doesn't fully succeed here, but he did at least engage me somewhat. Hope he improves in his next directorial feature and continues to give appealing content with better form throughout his career.6/10.",

I never saw him doing any big budget bollywood film till now which is saddening . But now it seems good to see him being a big name in South industry and the love he has been showered by their's audiences has brought him the position that he deserves. This time the topic he chose is quite sensitive and enlightening because the story is based on a scientist about whom hardly people know but I assure you that after watching this film, you are never going to forget the scientist because his life journey has been so struggling and inspiring. No where in school we were ever taught about this person but it seems good to know him now because no matter what the result is at the end, at the end of the day it's you who has it's own perception.",

All thanks to a falsified case, and a premeditated conspiracy against him to derail not just his progression as a pioneer in his field, but also to halt all the advancements in his research and the miraculous discoveries he might have made in the process.The damages that are done are irreversible, and the horrible things he and his family had to go through are disheartening to say the very least. No matter how many apologies he's got, the agonizing pain he endured won't ever get entirely eradicated. He would have to carry this burden until his last breath! The only thing we could do now is to watch this film, spread the word, and make people aware of all the things that transpired.Albeit the technical jargon and a flamboyant exhibition of scientific terminologies might get a bit overwhelming for some but I feel, this film should act as a lesson for every resident, every individual in our country who in comparable instances tend to victimize a person over the slightest skepticism, that too without concrete rationale, and without validating any of the allegations!

With a lot of scientific and technical jargons, the first half went with expected pace with not too many highs.It is the second half with Nambi Narayanan getting falsely accused as a traitor, the screenplay gets the emotional aspect right. Where the director R Madhavan stumbles, it is the actor R Madhavan who scores big time. Good thing is there is not much insertion of sermons here.

I was very hesitant to watch this movie after reading that review. According to them this movie is political and religious propoganda. After watching this movie i can confidently say its anything but. Its a biography and to stay true to real life its show Dr. Nambi praying and going to temple which is what he does in real life. How does that become propoganda. Its not just one review i read many more with same viewpoint. So what is real problem?

There were many directorial calls and technical quirks that should be appreciated in this film, the subtle Aspect Ratio change to state one, and the decent realism of the CG to state another.And I don't think anyone would question the performances of the talent involved in the film. Casting of a few important persons depicted could have been slightly better, however.Even if not the best film one could see in theatres, it truly is one you should watch.

He is perfect as the man who led India's foray into space exploration. Many of the significant events of his life are covered in this 2.5 hour long film. His short tenure at Princeton & NASA, at the France Space Agency and for the most part under the suspicious eyes of his fellow countrymen. Simran (his onscreen wife), Rajit Kapur, Dinesh Prabhakar co-star.Madhavan is a great actor but his filmmaking skills are still in the nascent stages. But given this is his directorial debut and the effort gone into making it, one must give the actor due credit. They could have done away with the TV interview with SRK/Suriya bit. A straight-forward storyline would have been absolutely fine.Madhavan's Rocketry, which he calls his biggest film till date lives upto to the expectations (for most part).

Madhavan has gone beyond his limit to shape Rocketry and there is no way he could have let anything go wrong from at least his end. The actor has to age back and forth and he manages to make us believe and invest through all of it. Rest everyone does their jobs earnestly and creates a world that is lived in and authentic. There are a lot of good actors involved for parts that are almost special appearances but crucial.Rocketry-The Nambi Effect is an emotional drama about how one of India's famous scientists went through turmoil after being called a traitor.It is about a man who gave this country big achievements but was compensated with brutality.

Madhavan deserves praise for picking a subject that not many people might be aware of, and more importantly, not diluting it by adding 'filmi' elements.The first half was all about the achievements of the said scientist depicted in a fashionable way and there were few hiccups with regards to direction and dialogue deliveries, overall being decent.It is in the second half that Rocketry feels more like a film, like a missile suddenly galvanised into action. The dialogues get sharper. Making up for the average directorial skills of Madhavan is actor Madhavan, who springs to life in the portions capturing Nambi's older days. The actor aces some of these sequences, especially the ones that follow his custodial torture. The film is also about choices, and one really wishes that it explored that in more detail.The story of Rocketry is, without doubt, something that audiences have to be told. But, behind that thought is a film that connects only in parts. The actor Madhavan was great, but the director Madhavan could have been better in his assignment.My Rating : 3.5/5.",

            "content": "This movie is a twin achievement for R Madhavan. One, as actor he has done an excellent job in bringing to life the trials and tribulations of an Indian aerospace scientist falsely accused of selling secret information to a foreign country. He is branded traitor, arrested and jailed for bringing shame and disgrace to the country. The movie is a one man show and his is an award winning performance. Two, as director he has made a gripping film which keeps you hooked till the end. After Nambi is thrown in jail, his family is ostracized , they are socially isolated, and considered outcasts. The movie is also a clear illustration to show that for anti nationals it is easy to bring down a patriotic and successful person using false charges. Arrest and torture will invariably follow and the court proceedings will continue at a snail's pace. The protagonist here is space scientist Nambi Narayan who is determined to bring India to the forefront in space exploration for which he goes to and seeks assistance from foreign nations like France, Scotland and Russia. He rises professionally due to sheer tenacity, grit and audacity coupled with a burning desire. There are some nicely filmed scenes of laboratory experiments on engines, the setbacks, the successes and the complications technical and otherwise. The airlift of engine components from Russia make for exciting viewing. Few scenes worth mentioning. When asked why no one from ISRO came to visit him in jail, Nambi says that \"scientists are strange people because when a rocket falls they react but when a person falls they don't know how to react\". Nambi's colleagues describe his eccentricity and audacity in asking for and planning the hardware for research work. Out on bail he continues doggedly on the Mars mission. The scenes where Nambi is boycotted by all and he gets thrown out of the autorickshaw in heavy rain is very touching. The movie unfolds on a flashback mode as Nambi is being interviewed on TV by Shahrukh Khan. Some poignant scenes there. A truly emotional moment at the end when the real Nambi sums up his aim in life and is shown receiving Padma award. One wishes however that the technical jargon could have been kept to the bare minimum, and the running time cropped by around 20 minutes.",

Also available in several other languages ) is a narration about reknowned scientist Dr Nambi Narayanan's eventful career, his implication in a spying case, his eventual redemption and Padma Shree award. The narrative unfolds through flashback while a star anchor (Surya) interviews Dr Nambi (Madhavan and Dr Nambi himself).This is a real life story that undoubtedly deserves to be told. The film though very watchable ... has some stilted dialogues stuck in here and there.The first part of the film, somewhat slow, is about Nambi's enthusiasm, his stints abroad and his rise in the organisation. Most of the characters are taken from real life though Im not sure about all the events. For instance, did Nambi really unforgivably withhold from Unni (Sam Mohan) the news of his child's sudden death which would be the most tragic, the most unbearable grief for any parent to endure? Was the film maker trying to imply that Unni's curses when he eventually came to know many days later, somehow lead to Nambi's subsequent ordeal? Did Unni really take the lead in trying to clear Nambi's name?Another question on how authentic the films depiction is comes from interesting news reports post film release including an item in The Hindu today 25/8/2022 reporting the statement released by several ISRO veterans challenging Dr Nambi Narayan's scientific achievement claims . I quote a brief extract from the news item: \"Many of the claims in the Madhavan starrer ... Rocketry ... and those made by Mr Narayanan in various forums are baseless and tend to mislead the public, the former scientists which included D. Sasikumar who (had) .. also been implicated in the spy case, .... told a meet-the-press programme ... Thiruvananthapuram Press Club...\"Nevertheless, the characters are effectively portrayed by the respective actors and the overall narration holds the viewers interest .. though something is missing that could have elevated this film a few notches.A last \"politically correct scene\" focussed on ..... seems to be a probable path to Best Film, Best Actor etc at the next National Awards ......

            "content": "Rocketry: The Nambi Effect is a biopic about famed rocket scientist Nambi Narayanan, chronicling his life from youth to present. Not knowing much about the man himself going into this movie, it most certainly proved to be an informative experience that presents all his hardships and establishes his undeniable contribution to space travel and rocket science.And while the movie succeeds at introducing Nambi to the audience for the truly remarkable man he is, it somewhat fails as a work of storytelling. Rocketry suffers a lot from not having an experienced writer handling the screenplay and that painfully shows throughout. The movie feels like you're reading a 157-minute long Wikipedia article and not a well crafted work of storytelling to truly bring out the emotions within. There just seems to be so much potential lost in its very lukewarm and bland writing approach. This extends also into its dialogues... which while ends up being more technical than it should, also ends up being overly expositional, emotionless and stale. Almost all of the English parts in the movie are as apparent as being written by a non-English speaker, as the choice of words, the string of sentences and the tone of communication seem too odd and too unnuanced to be realistic. It also needs to be said that there could have been more emphasis on casting as well, as all the foreign actors come across as amateur as could be. Be it their dialogue delivery, facial expressions, body language and overall performances... it just seems too artificial.That said, it's still a good movie for one to watch, as the pros outweigh the cons. It certainly took the right approach in trying to not succumb to usual Tamil cinema conventions and that should be commended. Plus, the contributions Nambi Narayanan has made to rocket science is one that most people should be aware of, and to communicate that as effectively as it did is the strongest part about this movie.",

First half , movie shows his major contribution to ISRO in rocket science , his strategies and hard work was impressive , same time there were too much physics that cannot be understood , so it will be bit difficult for common audience to follow . We can clearly see that team done good research work . Second half shows how his life turned tragic . It was literally heart breaking to watch . Madhavan performance was topnotch . In direction part , despite few flaws Maddy done a decent job in it . Major drawback was dialogues and dubbing , both parts were underwhelming . Technically , VFX and production design were good . Overall good Biography Drama to watch . Literally you should've some patience to watch .",

It has been a trend to present biopic of rags to riches, but this one has been so masterly written and narrated by Madhvan that you would start loving this comparatively less known scientist.The first half of the movie would take you to the brilliance of mind of Nambi, solid and liquid fuels , leaving his lucrative appointment at NASA for the sake of country and the second half encapsulates his struggles, due to petty politics, which ultimately delayed the Mangal Mission. Madhvan could have gone into the backstory of reasons of the conspiracy, which I found missing.Madhvan is effortless as an actor and his metamorphosis with the story is a treat to watch. Sharukh Khan in his cameo as interviewer adds the emotions. The best idea was to bring the real Hero Nambi himself at the end.A must see , whether you are a science student or not.#VootSelect #anwarsays #NambiNarayanan #RMadhvan #NASA #isroindia #movie2022 #MarsMission #ShahRukhKhan #pettypolitics #rocketfuel.",

So I always take time to validate the claims in the movie, so that I do not perpetuate incorrect facts. So for my disappointment I could not validate major events depicted in the movie in any other external sources other than movie promotion websites. Especially the 400 million deal from Colonel Cleaver the CEO of Rolls Royce, I would say watch it as a movie and not true facts.

Film also brings into light the politics involved in our elite Space programmes.Inspite of all the positives mentioned above, last 30 minutes could have been curtailed by 15 mins to make the film not dragging!Would like to watch this film one more time to understand the science behind Rockets a little more and catch the dialogues even better.",

But when he reaches for a cryogenic technology, in an attempt to buy the technology from Russia, he is attacked by local police and his career is ruined for almost a decade by Foreign interference.What many people might not understand is that this is a movie about corruption in India. India does not have a strong legal system. India's legal system cannot protect its best and brightest and most patriotic scientists. With a small bribe, India's greatest rocket scientist has his life ruined, and an entire industry of commercial satellite launches was so easily destroyed. I have many Indian friends who have \"escaped\" to North America. Let this movie be a lesson to everyone. Until you reform your legal system and clean up the corruption, you will be a puppet to foreign powers. If you don't produce these reforms, India will trail the rest of the world in technology, forever. Your best and brightest will leave India to gain the security that they deserve!

Instead they chose to take a path that would appeal to certain sections of the society instead of telling the whole truth.Apart from the fallacies in the story line, Madhavan's acting at best can be described as ordinary if not bad. For a star who was adored by our entire generation, this is pretty below his standards. What Madhavan is capable of as an actor can be seen in films like Yuva.

The story is in public domain but the justice to him was so delayed that, like the idiom goes, it was as good as denied. Kudos to R Madhavan for taking up his story and telling it to the world. However, while doing so, he has been remiss in many aspects.The movie is frequently extremely on-the-nose and, overall, crudely done. A woman who hasn't smiled in years smiled because of our leading man and we see a nagging mention of it even though we never saw how that equation developed. People around our leading man keep telling us how exceptional he is but we don't really get to witness his smartness until much later. Little factoids keep getting thrown around and the characters append \"most people in India don't know this\" after saying them in an obvious attempt to be didactic towards the audience.The film also frequently takes itself too seriously and whenever it does so it, to much disappointment, pulls focus away from its genuine attempts at storytelling. One subjective issue I take with the film is its act of glorifying the one thing that the lead character was indefensibly wrong about. It doesn't even try to put a spin on it to talk about the flip-side of it. And sadly it delivers this sore justification through Shah Rukh Khan.Shah Rukh Khan is fantastic in his cameo/supporting act. He has been given terrible dialogs and screenplay and yet he does his best to deliver it on his charm and screen presence. R Madhavan is as fantastic as ever. He carries the film on his shoulders with great expertise. Sadly, the same cannot be said about his direction and screenplay-writing, which leave much to be desired.I am going with a 6/10 with an extra star solely because this is a story that needs to be heard by all. We can't undo the wrong done to Nambi Narayanan but hopefully we don't commit this mistake against our future scientists.",

Everything and everyone was brilliant including Shah Rukh who although,he had a very short and unchallenging role was superb! Madhavan was absolutely amazing in his acting and his direction of this very well edited film was top notch!9/10.",

Madhavan was really great in portraying the character of the great scientist Nambi Narayanan. One scene i will never forget in my life , Simran , the veteran actor , going into depression and shouting on seeing her husband being released from 50 days of jail. That particular scene I felt goosebumps after a long long long time. What an effort made by the entire cast and crew of the movie. Kudos to the entire team which was involved in making this movie. The audience was left speechless and spell bounded after watching the movie . Very rarely do we get to see such an outstanding movie in the world of Hindi cinema.",

And then there are people who try to bring them down. Some insiders, some outsiders. And that not just affects the scientist, his family but also brings the nation down or takes it backwards.",

It does speak of rocket science every now and then. That espionage case part wasn't dragged or exaggerated, which was good move from filmmaking point of view. There were a few scenes that were slow but overall the movie was fabulous! There's no exaggeration, no politicizing matters, etc. I can understand the seriousness with which this film has been made. Hats off to the director, and each part of film crew, and of course, to our legend Nambi sir!Production Values seemed good on OTT. One issue is that some flashback scenes are shown very quickly and it takes time to understand what just happened. Apart from that the film was very good. One of those rare films (like TKF, 777 Charlie, Interstellar etc.) That I can give 9+/10. Loved the last message, Nambi sir is innocent but who was actually guilty?",

How senseless government and people treated him.

He is one man army in this movie . The foreign Actors are also well picked otherwise in indian movies white Actors acting is horrible but not in this case . The things I didn't like that some Dialogues in which he says \"we indians\" good at omelette , \"we indians\" known household works very well and etc. These\"we indians\" sounds good in 1-2 initial dialogues but after that again and again repetition of same \"we indians\" dialogues looks pseudo and not good . Glad they stopped those dialogues after 45 minutes of movie . Supporting indian cast could have been better but in this budget I think the visuals and cast he has chose his decent . Hoping for more these Type of movies in future which motivates us to study hard and inspire us in every sector .",

But better late than Never.What a show no over the top drama, crisp story amazing dialogues and brilliant performances. A true biography if so to say.To be honest, I was one of those illiterates who dint knew about Nambi sir and how we as a Nation failed him before the trailer. After trailer, I read about him and wanted to see how Madhavan sir had potrayed it on screen.It wouldn't be wrong to say I was blown over, it dint seem a lengthy film, character's very apt and happy to see a movie with no song breaks, just the story.In movies like these, songs actually break the flow rather than binding the script in commercial masala movies.",

As a Westerner, without pre-existing background knowledge, some parts were a bit hard to follow on the first viewing. I was wondering for half of the film why people were mad at this guy during the intro scenes, and even later on it takes a while to be explained. But there are many nice vignettes of key moments in the career of Mr. Nambi, with tough decisions, backdoor dealings, family drama, real-world science, and some of the most intense rocket test music I've ever heard in a movie! Solid performances from the entire cast.Some of the transitions between time periods were very abrupt and made the film feel less smooth and cohesive than it otherwise could. But for anyone wanting a good bio-pic of a determined individual overcoming adversity, or you are just obsessed with anything space-related like me, Rocketry is a good time at the movies.",

The first half of this movie had a crash course on Rocket Science or maybe that was required to set the context, but it could have been said differently.

The drama is to the point and does not lingerIt was a gut wrenching story something I was aware of as a teenager in India but the scale and magnitude of its tragedy only became apparent now.Indians should be aware that even so called friendly western countries may not be really friendly as competition heats up in globalisation.",

I never saw him doing any big budget bollywood film till now which is saddening .

This time the topic he chose is quite sensitive and enlightening because the story is based on a scientist about whom hardly people know but I assure you that after watching this film, you are never going to forget the scientist because his life journey has been so struggling and inspiring.

Fruits of whose hard-work we gladly ripe for years without even thinking for a second about that person. The film is made with a lot of caution and serious issues are delt very delicately. Making a biopic is always a very challenging task which R. Madhavan (The director, producer and writer) executed with a lot of responsibility. It is a must watch! These films don't get around easily.

I never saw him doing any big budget bollywood film till now which is saddening . But now it seems good to see him being a big name in South industry and the love he has been showered by their's audiences has brought him the position that he deserves. This time the topic he chose is quite sensitive and enlightening because the story is based on a scientist about whom hardly people know but I assure you that after watching this film, you are never going to forget the scientist because his life journey has been so struggling and inspiring. No where in school we were ever taught about this person but it seems good to know him now because no matter what the result is at the end, at the end of the day it's you who has it's own perception.",

Not only Nambi sir many of our great scientists didn't accept NASA's job ..the best example is Kalam Sir \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd This movie should be watched by everyone. Just like Narayan sir never got the position and respect he deserved, R Madhavan being an extremely talented actor, didn't get that much from bollywood and audience which he deserved good to see that south industry is giving justice to his talent Most Important thing With minimal technical terms, Madhavan makes 'Rocketry' movie intense and totally engaging and doesn't show Nambi as God but keeps things authentic. And of course Thanks to srk and surya for working for no money and giving great performance in the movieR madhavan should get national award such an impactful performance \ud83c\udfadMay no one be so much cruel to such a gem person who has sacrificed his life for humanity and didn't expect anything for his personal purpose. Please don't give this type treatment to this kind people. Seriously everyone should watch this movie and know who is the respected genius Nambi Narayan is.

A must watch masterpiece.Kudos to the entire team and crew members for all their hard work. Movie is very engaging. Directing is fantastic.Movie is well portrayed for the false implications alleged on great patriotic scientist and it took years to find the truth of allegations.This movie is a clear example of worst effect of early judging and how much worse one life of an innocent can get when public react without proven guilt. Requesting public please don't act before conclusion because damages like this can leave deep scars on innocents.",

We rush to the theatres with a sense of obligation to make it a success...\nBut it's sad to see that once in a Blue moon when someone decides to make an honest movie about a true hero and a patriot then we struggle to find reasons to watch it. So much so that there is a whole group of so called intellectuals who run a campaign about this one fact about the movie which I might now have even noticed hadn't so many reviewers pointed it out.Yes Nambi Narayan is shown to be a devout Hindu, religious man but this portrayal is only highlighted in times of extreme stress or in very critical moments I'm his life. Who doesn't like to look up to a higher power during such times no matter which God you believe in.It shows that even in his weakest moments when he had hit really rock bottom he his faith didn't waiver, he didn't become a recluse or resentful. He kept fighting to prove his innocence and to prove that he is a Patriot beyond doubt.This movie is not about religion. It's about a man who chose his country over money and a plush comfortable life as a Nasa Scientist. Majority of us working for Multinational conglomerate as glorified low cost labourers would find it difficult to accept the fact that people like Nambi Sir exist.Hats of to R Madhavan and Shah Rukh Khan for doing their part to give this man the respect he deserves.",

It is clearly an act of class, dedication and commitment that madhavan, it would rather say Maddy has put in to bring the story of the man at it's very best. Each instance covered, the way the story had been taken it is not less than a thrilling James Bond movie. Patriotism is not only just with people who are gauding us at the boarder, but people like Nambi sir who take us to the country's progress, sacrificing even there personal life. I would say such personalities should be taught to our young generation, who can be of great inspiration. The climax, literally set tears in my eyes but that will not give the man what he lost all these years after the sincerity and commitment he has shown for the nation. Alone with APJ, Nambi's effect should also be celebrated at national level. Maddy great work no words..... salute.",

And also the fellow scientist of the time - why they did not have the guts to stand with him when he needed them the most .why is media not getting people to the house of the police people and politicians involved and exposing them - because it seems they only want masala and destroy lives of innocent people . Irresponsible Journalism.I myself would have become a scientist in theoretical physics and I had the aptitude for it as had distinction in physics - but I choose not to become a scientist in 1994 when I saw how badly our Indian scientist are treated and what nonsense salaried they were being paid at the time by the stupid Congress government . This is a rot in the system . We throw bricks at our own brilliant people because we are so shallow and corrupt to the core . Why do you think brain drain is still happening . Also I still see Congress constantly still creating conspiracies to bring the nation down . Shame on Congress , the media , the state government of that state , the corrupt police . I hope those criminals who did this to Shri Nambi are hanged or at least they will answer for their misdeeds in hell .Shri Nambiji - if you are reading this .

I loved the testing part in France, and also feel proud and sad about a father lost his son during he was getting technology for India.Every engineer must watch this.",

This movie is being underestimated and is being overpowered by opponent movies produced by popular names, the playtime is longer than current average but still keeps you gripped.I don't just want to give any spoilers, so I think this is enough to just say that every Indian should watch this film and that too with their families as it is a film worth watching with family.A personal note, some of the scenes are so emotional that it makes you want to cry and you can't cry..Thanks and go watch it else there'll be the regret like we have from missing watching Tumbad in theatres..",

The movie is highly patriotic and emotional too.The cinema where I watched was half full. We were irritated when an idiot was laughing during an emotional scene. Another person had verbally abused him for laughing. THAT'S THE IMPACT OF THIS FILM!I watched the Tamil and can only review on Suriya's cameo. He plays his fictionalised version interviewing Nambi Narayanan.

            "content": "I have fallen in love with Madhavan 2.0 since Saala Khadoos. I always expected the nice trend to continue, and he did not disappoint me with this amazing movie, which in my opinion the first Indian movie that can be accounted as a very honest and detailed biography of a science man.The biggest highlight of the movie for me is about the detailing on the science through all the work and events that Padma Bhushan Nambi sir and his team are involved in. This is an area where the production is of the highest world class quality and I cannot remember even a second where there is a compromise on this area in the movie. The amount of detailing and research is a first, and clearly sits atop over several other works involving science or science fiction, and by a very big margin!The biggest aide to the above is the crisp and mean editing. I was hooked through out as the events in Nambi sir's life unfold and the editing really helps deliver the full impact of the amazing work and output Nambi sir and his teams delivered.The patriotism and sense of duty towards it are portrayed non-jingoistically and as natural traits of nationalists, which I totally expected from a work from Madhavan. Contrary to elitist, western physicality-oriented, and Indian pseudo-secular stereotypes around science and scientists. Well, anyone who has lived in South India and seen people easy with their simpleton dressing and lives does not have that stereotype anyway.The unbearable torture that Nambi sir faced and how he and his family coped with is shown without any political correctness or overzealous political affinity/opposition, too, which is another great point for me.Any patriotic son/daughter of land who thinks that Bose and others sacrificed their lives to give us this great freedom and future so that we can contribute back will definitely feel helpless, sitting in agony with tears rolling and closed fists, looking at the events unfold as they did for Nambi sir stopping him in his tracks. This is what the story telling of this part did to me.For me the only blemish, in the Hindi version that I watched, was the studio scenes. SRK hams. Hopefully, we'll get back the SRK of Kabhi Haan Kabhi Na, Chek De India, Fauji, and Circus.A can-not-miss-movie for all fellow Indians!",

His decision a sacrifice or an honour, is something that the film tries to build throughout its runtime. It never gives its judgement to the audience, nor does it take sides, it simply wants the audience to know the story of Nambi Narayan. Yes, there are biases though!",

            "content": "Obviously, most of the Indians might have hardly heard about Nambi Narayanan. The fact that he was a great scientific brain behind ISRO is not questionable however, since its a Nambi sir's narration so some scenes might have been exaggerated a bit, specially about every girl being glued towards his personality seems a bit over after a couple of times. Madhavan's acting has been beyond doubt a treat to watch, his real-life transformation pays dividend in his efforts to portray Nambi on reel. I was allured the way Simran played Mrs. Meena Narayanan, she put so many emotions in her comparatively smaller role that you can feel her pain.The movie is scientifically correct with every emphasis being put on keeping things theoretically reasonable unlike other Bollywood movies. However, it might be boring for some people in first half to process so much scientific information about rockets. The second half is emotional and forms the crux of the struggles that Nambi sir had to carry. Shahrukh Khan's role is not at all a guest appearance but stays from the beginning to the end although with a lesser screentime. SRK has been able to leave a mark in his small yet significant role. He offered a big sorry to Nambi sir at the end of the movie which really was long overdue considering Nambi sir's contribution during his career as a scientist and now as a rights activist.Since the movie presents a one-person perspective, therefore it might feel a bit heroic, exaggerated at times but has been able to spread knowledge in the youth about a great scientist of our nation and motivate them towards taking up space science as a career. I definitely would recommend this movie if you were moderately interested in space, science, and learning about greatness of our nation.",

To normalise being clean and subtle and not glamorise being corrupt and Rich.If we have more movies like these maybe people won't treat anyone like Mr. Nambi got treated. Movies make great impact and we all should learn to keep fighting what is right and taking stand with all who do the right thing.

Most of the so called cinema critics are criticising the movie for its technical details, but that is what makes the movie different and amazing.

R Madhavan seemed to have followed the standard straightforward screenplay without taking any risks.Madhavan justified the Nambi role, in fact, he looked precisely like Nambi Narayanan in the interview scenes. However, he could not convince in the younger Nambi role. He looked like a 40-year-old fat guy in 25 years young scientist role.For full review please do visit, wiralmovies_in.",

The whole of India asks you for forgiveness for those sufferings that you get from jail and society. We should be ashamed that we blamed the person whom NASA gave its life to keep and that man chose his country.

Other than that, this is a nice movie. It has a nice performance by Madhavan and pretty much nobody else gets a chance to shine a lot except maybe the guy playing 'Unni', who does a decent job.

In the age where patriotism is used as a veil to shield selfish agendas, this movie does a fantastic job of putting forward one truth that matters. We don't know about the whole truth, but the verdict of SC of India attests that the story portrayed has credibility to it.The anger and \"retribution\" they portray towards Nambi from the people doesn't just hit home for someone who is familiar with the volatility of heard mentality in India, but also points out one of the reasons behind the so called \"brain drain\" phenomenon often spoken about.The movie doesn't shy away from portraying Rocket Science for what it is. I didn't expect the movie to ever go into the details of combustion instability or the specific impulses of rocket motors, but as an aerospace engineer myself, I am proud to see that they didn't try to dumb it down assuming that the audience is incapable of understanding them. These scenes are shot incredibly well for anyone to understand the implications of these concepts if not the underlying theories.There have been a flurry of movies and shows that depict the achievements of ISRO and great Indian scientists, but I would put this movie at the top of the pecking order if you want a true sense of what these people had to go through to achieve their dreams and thus push India into the future.I would not want anyone to be biased by my perspective, but I say, give it a watch and build your own perspective!",

But every actor has played this role to his/her fullest. Such a simple and effective delivery by every single one of them. I wish that the story could have probed more on the CBI proceedings and the role of Dr. Nambi in the Mars mission. There was no doubt that it was a challenging task they decided to take on, but that could have been shown in the movie. However, I understand it might have been quite a long one.Much needed movie in this era! Sincere Thanks Madhavan Sir! You're always a versatile actor!",

A tight slap on those who just blame the brain drain from India, but don't try to introspect. The movie brilliantly but subtly makes you realize that this country stands on the immense sacrifices by thousands. What we've got is nothing short of privilege. Left me teary eyed as well as motivated. What's exceptional that Madhavan has superbly directed it, and hasn't let the movie go preachy anywhere; at the same time not diluting its scientific temper & appeal. His honesty towards the story is very evident from his treatment. A story that needed to be told.Hats off to Madhavan!! Shoutout to Nambi Narayanan's mettle.",
