            "content": "The Fabelmans\nI have been interested in this film since the moment I heard about it. As a kid whose first memorable movie theater experience was E. T., no filmmaker has more influenced the way I experience movies than Spielberg...and nothing influenced those movies more than his parents' divorce. So I was 100% ready for a personal tale, an origin story without capes or superpowers. No CGI. No motion capture. Just a movie about the power of families and stories through the eyes of a kid. It is just that... But it is more too. There's a generosity in the way that Spielberg makes sense of his own story after the fact. Nobody is a villain or hero. They are just people choosing between happiness and responsibility while realizing slowly and painfully that it may not have to be either/or. There were scenes that worked better than others (and I am still sorting through the third act), but it was fun to see him tell a story like this, whether it was his own or not.",

            "content": "This semi-autobiographical film centres around Sammy Fabelman who is transfixed by the first movie he sees at age 6 and develops a passion for film making. Other themes explored with variable depth and success include the fracturing marriage of his parents, bullying and anti-semitism at high school, young love and coming of age, and selfishness in general.The movie is way too long and felt a little boring in the first 45minutes. It's nicely shot and well directed as you would expect, but the script is patchy and while the acting is generally excellent, the performances of Paul Dano and in particular Michelle Williams as Sammy's parents felt too affected and a little contrived - at times I felt I was watching filming on the set of a TV sitcom. I wonder still if this was deliberately instructed by Spielberg, but for me it doesn't work.Gabriel Labelle is the best as the teenage Sammy and Judd Hirsch is superb in a cameo as Uncle Boris. John Williams as always provides a perfect score and the visuals are superb.Overall it's worth seeing for a little insight into Spielberg's childhood but there is an unsatisfactory feel to the film as a whole. I think it could have been so much better.",

            "content": "It's watching Steven Spielberg grow up from a child terrified by the train crash in THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH, to an adolescent film maker. He's pretty up front about the family issues and his parents' break up. I suspect he has realized that being an adult is a tough thing and is willing to forgive.At 150 minutes, it should feel self indulgent, but it never does, thanks to a terrific performance by Michelle Williams as the mother and Paul Dano as the father. No one seems to be acting, which is half the Spielberg magic. There are also great cameos by Judd Hirsch as the profane uncle who was a lion tamer, and David Lynch as John Ford.Some of the characters seem sketchily drawn, particularly the sisters, but that serves to emphasize Miss Williams, Dano, and Gabriel LaBelle as the Steven Spielberg character. Is she t that Spielberg and his frequent collaborator Tony K\u00fchner, have drawn a fine portrait of a Jewish post-war family, when things were supposed to be so very bland... but really, people were living their lives.",

            "content": "This felt more like a revenge film targeting \"Bennie\" and Spielberg's high school bully \"Logan\" - characters names that have been changed to protect the real identity of those who may otherwise had legal slander recourse, had their real names been used. I'm even willing to bet Spielberg specifically cast actors that looked like his nemesis, just to spite them even more. Then we get a story of those that deprived him of a normal childhood, instead of those that inspired him. I still have no further knowledge of what made Spielberg a great filmmaker. The entire first 90 mins was utter boredom of a typical dysfunctional family - all just shallow filler, and the remaining 1 hour was just another high school drama story playing out, with very little substance. What the heck are all these critics raving about... there was nothing brilliant in this dull, bland, self-indulgent shallow slog. I learned more about Spielberg's mom than him. This is literally the most boring Spielberg film I've ever seen, and for that matter, a film no one should care about. Even the screenplay was riddled with unnecessary subplots that had more plot holes than engaging narrative. Granted, the dated set pieces and wardrobe were on point, and all casting and performances spot-on, and the score was perfect. But none of that matters when you're forced to sit through a two and a half hour film that leaves you frustrated and unsatisfied. It's amusing how another great filmmaker, James Cameron, gives us Avatar 2, and Spielberg gives us this nonsense vanity project. You can tell one is falling from grace and the other rising past. It's a very generous 5/10 from me.",

            "content": "'The Fabelmans' is not good. Director and Co-Writer Steven Spielberg's heart was in the right place (the idea, the conceit, the structure is fine), but the execution fails to deliver. The film is too long by far, scenes run on forever, the story seems flabby and unfocused (and yes, that includes the hero's undying desire to become a film-maker).Here's what I believe Spielberg was attempting.(1) He is presenting the story of HIS life; how he (Spielberg) became the world famous film director.(2) In doing so, he portrays different periods of his life as though each were a different genre of movie. (a) The film's opening plays like a 50s family sitcom, complete with the goofy next-door neighbor. (b) A visit from an uncle plays like a horror film. (c) Adolescence is a 'Beach Blanket' movie with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, at other times a 'Blackboard Jungle' of bigoted and roughneck bullies. (d) We've got 'OZ's' Yellow Brick Road of a finale, preceded by 'OZ's' Dorothy / Spielberg meeting with the wizard himself and receiving his advice. (e) Add to this 'The Conversation' / 'Blow Out' / 'Blow Up' fascination with studying taped video and or audio, inch by inch, in order to fully understand what is actually taking place.(3) Now the use of film genres in this way could be a very satisfying. It would tell us that Spielberg always viewed his life, while living it, as a movie. And it might have worked were the film less talky, better written (the dialogue is awful), and faster paced. And perhaps better shot. There is something flat up there on the screen; nearly every scene feels like the one before and the one that follows. I can't say why. It just does.I wish I'd liked the film. As a big fan of Spielberg's earlier work, I had strong rooting interest for him to meet his usual high standard.And it's likely you do too. And as such you might well look past my criticisms of the film; might hold him to a less lofty standard.You might well enjoy it.I imagine that many viewers will.",

Perhaps if it had something new to say, portrayed a family more uniquely in their way, a novel circumstance, to catch your eye, a second glance, not monotony of people day to day. If you make it to the end you might just wonder, why fine actors chose to loot your time and plunder (I'll give you three guesses but you only need one), must be quite a fallow year, to want to make this and appear, in something that's so dull, it makes you want to slumber.",

            "content": "As \"The Fabelmans\" (2022 release; 150 min.) opens, it is \"January 10, 1952\" and 6 yo Steven, urrr I mean Sammy, needs some serious convincing by his parents to go see \"The Greatest Show On Earth\", but when he does, he is overwhelmed. He wants to recreate the train wreck from the movie, and it's his mom who suggests filming it on an 8mm camera... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is Steven Spielberg's long-awaited film of his youth. I love and respect Spielberg, but this is Spielberg at his worst: sentimental and self-indulgent. There isn't a single aspect of the movie that I found interesting or redeeming. Why did Spielberg assume that his family's comings and goings, including his parents' marital challenges, would be so unique and hence interesting, when in fact this is what happened to millions and millions of families in the 50s and early 60s. As a complete aside, as most of you know Spielberg lived in Cincinnati until age 11, then moved to Phoenix. A significant early part of the movie plays out in Cincinnati, but there is not a single reference, none, to Cincinnati. Why? In contrast, the second that the family is moving to Phoenix, Arizona, the area is mentioned multiple times in the film. I find it curious, to say the least.\"The Fabelmans\" premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to immediate critical acclaim and then was released in US theaters just before Thanksgiving. Since then it has significantly underperformed at the box office (a mere $12 million after 7 weeks). The matinee screening where I saw this at the day after New Year's at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was attended well (I counted roughly 30 people). I honestly cannot think of any movie by Spielberg that is worse than this, and I cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone. If you haven't seen this yet, please save yourself the time and money. You'll thank me later when you catch it streaming at some point.",

            "content": "When Kenneth Branagh made the semi autobiographical Belfast. His childhood nostalgia of happier times was punctured by the all too real bombs and the bullet.Civil war had broken out on his doorstep. The Branagh family eventually moved to England.Steven Spielberg seems to be clueless with the overlong semi autobiographical The Fablemans. So much so, I wondered why he decided that people would be interested in his life story.Technically well made, this is the worse performing Spielberg film at the box office.There is a good reason for it, this is a bad film and I'm a fan of Spielberg!Starting off in 1952, young Sammy goes to see his first movie with his parents. It is The Greatest Show on Earth. Shocked and dazed by the experience, he wants to recreate the train crash scene and starts his journey as a budding filmmaker.His father Burt (Paul Dano) a scientist thinks Sammy is just going through a phase of making movies that he will eventually grow out of. Mother Mitzi is an artistic free spirit. 'Uncle' Bennie Loewy (Seth Rogen) is a family friend and work colleague of Burt who keeps hanging around the house.Because of Burt's work in the developing tech industry. The family move around a lot. The teenage Sammy ends up in California. Where he encounters anti semitic, bullying and eventually finding romance with a devout Christian who dumps him at their prom night.The move to California also makes his mother unhappy and leads to a schism in family relationships.The Fablemans has no idea what it wants to be. Is is about the early life of one of the movie greats? A tribute to his parents despite them drifting apart?If the early part of the movie was cloying sentimentality. The Californian segment turns into a typical nerdy high school drama.The only jolting originality being the late appearance of David Lynch playing director John Ford.Spielberg co-wrote the movie and lost his sure touch as the project was just too personal. Even the audience would be ahead of Spielberg, when Mitzi insists that Burt gets Bennie a job as well when he is hired by another company.The Fablemans was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, an accolade denied to his film from 1987, Empire of the Sun. The latter was miles better.",

            "review_title": "the fascination of the camera",
            "content": "Hollywood likes to make movies about Hollywood. Several of the great directors (including\nSpielberg's friends and collaborators Truffaut and George Lucas) have made autobiographical films inspired by their own childhood and adolescence. In 'The Fabelmans' (2022), Steven Spielberg combines the two genres and the result can only be a film that pleases the public as well as the members of the Academy. In fact, it's the film that will have to be beaten in several important categories in this year's Academy Awards competition. But I don't think it was an easy film for Spielberg. It's not easy to make a film where the main characters are your parents and yourself at the ages of childhood and adolescence. Anyone who has read a biography of Spielberg will recognize the characters, years and dates of the main events depicted in the film as belonging to the first 19 years of Spielberg's life. Without being a masterpiece and even if it brings back to the screen some of the strengths and weaknesses of the director's previous films, 'The Fabelmans' is a film full of emotion and above all of love for cinema and fascination for the power of the image.The opening and closing scenes of 'The Fabelmans' are probably either fiction or much improved history (the screenplay is written by Spielberg in collaboration with Tony Kushner). In the first scene, a six-year-old boy is taken by his parents to the cinema for the first time. He is a bit afraid of the 'big people on the screen'. Father explaines to him scientifically how moving images are formed. Mother tells him about emotions. He will see a film by Cecil B. DeMille in which a spectacular catastrophe occurs - the collision between two trains and an automobile caught in the middle between them. The impression is strong: fear and fascination. In the final scene of 'The Fabelmans' the same character, now a 19-year-old who wants nothing else in life than to make films, has the privilege of chatting for a few minutes with 'the greatest director who ever lived', John Ford ( played brilliantly by David Lynch). In a few sentences he gives him a lesson that sums up the art of the visual and that also symbolizes a passing of the baton between generations and eras of American cinema. Between these two scenes we are dealing with the story of the childhood and adolescence of a boy who becomes fascinated by the camera and who gradually learns not only the secrets of its handling but also the power that the one who films and edits acquires - the power to tell stories , to create characters and embellish real characters, to envelop his viewers in dreams and nightmares, to document the truth or hide it by cutting at the editing table.What we have in the two and a half hours between these two scenes is the story of an American family after World War II. Father, mother, four children of whom Sam Fabelman is the oldest and only boy. It looks like a model family, but in reality it is an unhappy family in its own way ((C) Tolstoy). Mother, father and Sam are three strong characters with aspirations in different directions who cannot be all three happy at the same time. The father is presented as a brilliant scientist, one of those whose vision and technical talent ushered in the era of numerical computers. He is an extremely good man but absorbed in work. He supports his family and their ever-increasing standard of living, but to succeed everything must be sacrificed to his career - including marriage and family life. Mother had been a talented pianist, but the obligations of supporting a household with three or four children had forced her to give up her career as a professional musician. Finally, Sam becomes more and more overwhelmed by his passion for cinema, encouraged, sometimes secretly by his mother, while his father continues for a long time to consider it just a hobby. The camera was for Sam a moral support, a refuge, a way to express his feelings and to ward off the blows caused by the conflicts of the outside world: the changes of residence increasingly westward in the United States to California, following the father's career, the anti-Semitic violence he suffers from some of his new colleagues, and especially the breakup of his parents' marriage.We have in this film an updated version of that Spielberg of the films where he focuses on the characters with their dramas and melodramas and does not resort to spectacular effects. The casting is, as always, excellent, emphasizing the ability to create emotion. Paul Dano as the father is amazing, one of the best fleshed out characters I've seen in movies lately. Michelle Williams sometimes thickens and repeats features of the mother's character, but she, too, I think, will not avoid at least an Academy Award nomination. Seth Rogers (almost unrecognizable) and Judd Hirsch pencil two key supporting roles. Gabriel LaBelle is cast in the lead role of Sam, who I think I'm seeing for the first time. He is surrounded by a group of young and talented actors who play the hero's classmates, friends, sisters and girlfriend, all in their childhood and teenage years. Spielberg is, as always, excellent in casting and directing child, adolescent or young actors. There are some aspects that are covered in less depth - such as the Jewishness of the hero and his family. Perhaps Spielberg will address this theme in one of his future films. 'The Fabelmans' will remain in the memory of the viewers as a story of love and fascination between a teenager and the camera. A director is born before our eyes. The last frame, a la Chaplin or The Wizard of Oz, is actually just the beginning.",

It does not help that I first herd of this film after watching a documentary on HBO called Spielberg in which Steve and his family tell the same story as the Fabelmans. It's not like the movie Crooklyn which is a Spike Lee joint about Spike Lee and his family. I think it hits me as arrogant because we know from the jump Sammy Fabelman is Spielberg cause from the jump its all about Sammy making films.It's a great movie for artist because it's all about the love of the art and your wiliness to sacrifice for that art. It's also for those who are stuck or feel stuck because they feel unable to truly express themselves. A fantastic coming of Age story about a man who could not do anything else but follow his dreams.It makes you wonder weather Spielberg's upbringing was that interesting or is Spielberg soooo good at telling a story that he could make anyone's life look interesting? A little bit of both but with his streak of great stories including this one I have to lean or towards the latter.",

            "content": "After 50 years of making movies, Steven Spielberg is still, in the 2020s, finding new muscles to work. His semi-autobiopic, The Fabelmans, is different in style, reach, and aim, than anything Spielberg has ever made. The consummate ringmaster has never helmed a film so modest. And for a director whose personal attachments are spread all over his filmography, The Fabelmans may also be his most intimate.The story of Sam Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle) is the story of Steven Spielberg, Jewish kid from Small Town USA, lover and later maker of movies. Sam shares with Steven three younger sisters, an eccentric concert pianist mother, an electrical engineer father, and a nearly identical path to movie directing. The names might be different, but obviously The Fabelmans is a dramatization of Steven Spielberg's childhood. It's certainly not our first indication of what the director thinks of such things as his parents' divorce, his interpersonal relationships with his family, or the images, moments, and memories that inspired him to make movies. Spielberg has brilliantly disguised these themes within his genre films; in alien invasion movies, dinosaur pictures, science fiction noirs, and family fantasy adventures. But with The Fabelmans, here comes the full reveal. It is a movie directly about family. His family. One must assume The Fabelmans is Steven Spielberg's last word on the subjects that have bewitched him throughout his career.The Fabelmans is kitchen sink drama all the way; no bells, no whistles, no magic realism or distracting style. In other words, no distance from these characters. The ones we have here are all quite well-realized. Paul Dano as Burt, the Fableman patriarch, is a sweetheart; surprisingly real despite an affected subservient speech pattern. Dano's character could have been an embarrassing caricature of the \"no fun, get a job\" father, but he comes out well-intentioned and completely three dimensional in a thankless role. Michelle Williams has the showier job playing mother Mitzy. She doesn't fumble the challenge, and in fact carves out a memorable personality from the more artistically inclined of Sam's parents. In the middle is Gabriel LaBelle, the latest model of the square-jawed, brown-eyed, young male muse that Spielberg has been searching for for decades now. Like Ansel Elgort, Tye Sheridan, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jeremy Irvine, and Shia LaBeouf before him (the man has a type), he's good enough. LaBelle is a likeable personality, a truly important metric for a performance like this, and he anchors the film admirably. Will it be that elusive star-making performance Spielberg has clearly been wanting from one of his young proteges? No. But it's a nice one.A few supporting players stop in for extended cameos. Judd Hirsh's quick turn as Uncle Boris may very well earn him an Oscar nomination. Hirsch has the classic showpiece monologue-two of them to be exact-and the sort of built-up respect needed for such a role. Young Chloe East on the other hand is a real discovery as Sam's high school girlfriend. Just when the movie needs a little energy, she comes in with the good stuff. Her's is a bright and living performance that never feels put on. Seth Rogan is there as well. A risky, maybe inspired casting choice, he's not bad.The Fabelmans is practically structureless, even at times aimless. There is no agreed-upon thesis that the movie is working toward, nor is there a feeling Spielberg is coaxing us into experiencing. As a cinematic project, it does not play to its director's strengths whatsoever. But we've seen the resiliency of Steven Spielberg before. Desert animal he truly is; able to adapt to changing landscapes and external challenges. By his standards, this is a tiny movie. Not the first quiet, artistic coming-of-age movie (in one of the movie's few missteps, it trots out a clich\u00e9d bullying subplot that drags the quality of the production way down), but in experienced, versatile hands, one of the very best.The Fabelmans certainly won't blow the doors off the box office, and for many, its sincere love for the craft of filmmaking will go completely unregistered. That narrow appeal, however, is precisely why The Fabelmans is destined to become a very special movie for people like me. I had my own 'Greatest Show on Earth' experience at six years old, when I saw Sam Raimi's Spider-man in one of the great big theaters where my aunt lived. Later, after I had discovered more of my favorites, developed a taste for the movies, I made my own. My cousins starred in one Jurassic Park rip-off as a team of scientists pursued by dragons in Shanghai. I became a film snob in college, and made short films with the guiding help of a professor who thought I had potential. I got a job as a documentarian and later directed a commercial or two of my own. All the while, I had my own family, who happen to be a lot like The Fabelmans, there to support and sometimes to trivialize, but whom I love with everything I have. Oh, it is sappy to talk about how personal The Fabelmans feels to me. I'm sure mine will not be the only review emphasizing how relatable this film is to someone with the artistic itch. But I assume I'm much like Sam Fabelman, and Steven Spielberg too, when I say that movies are my therapy. Our careers may never compare, but at least we'll share that.Mazal Tov.87/100.",

Even better the 2nd time around and made me appreciate Steven Spielberg even more!

Michelle Williams over-performed Mitzi Fabelman, the matriarch, and Seth Rogen as Bennie Loewy seem like a robot reading a manuscript. Even the plot inspired by some facts from Spielberg's childhood is conventional: the boy who likes to film the family's activities, the boy who is bullied in school, and a secret in the family.If Spielberg wanted to pay homage to cinema, he failed miserably. The only scene that deserves attention is the final 10 minutes. If you want to experiment the influence cinema in someone's life watch \"Cinema Paradiso\" or \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\"",

He is mesmerized by the train crash scene and works to recreate it. It's the start of a filmmaking career. Friend Uncle Bennie Loewy (Seth Rogen) works under Burt and is a constant fixture around the family.This is a semi-autobiography by Steven Spielberg. It's fine as a childhood recollection. Spielberg has the cinematic skills to create another one of his childhood adventure. Except, the adventure is his life. It is elevated by Williams and Dano's performances. They don't miss a beat. There is a noticeable barrier to the material and his parents. The story is told from a child's point of view. His parents remain somewhat above him. At the end of the day, none of us can ever be more than a child to our parents.",

This is one of the legendary filmmaker trying to show us how he fell in love with cinema in the first place. Once i watched this movie I just wanted to take a camera, go out and just start filming something, that's how heartwarming it is. The movie mainly is a coming of age story. Any aspiring filmmaker or anyone who loves cinema for that matter will love this movie. There is some exceptionally staged and shot moments in the movie, for example there is this scene where sammy (the protagonist) realises his mom is having an affair with his dads best friend. The way they show that scene is just amazing. The scenes where he try to shoot a movie with his friends and the techniques he uses to show a gun firing Or shoot a war sequence were just amazing. The movie also tries to show a family drama, sammys relationship with his parents and sisters and how they deal with the divorce of their parents. Gabriel La Belle is just amazing as sammy. I really liked his performance. Michelle Williams, seth rogans, paul dano all gave amazing performance. The girls who came as sammys sisters were amazing. The movie is technically awsome. Kaminskis cinematography is so awsome, the retro effect, the nostalgia just hits you and gives such a nice vibe.",

I thought they are Nobel prized scientists on anything related to human minds and all for their extreme knowledge on psychology even though it was 1950s so it was like they are just an ordinary American family from 2022 but the mother was just a pianist and the father is a computer engineer LOL.I have no idea what would make sense about the tornado scene.

            "content": "Many years ago, Steven Spielberg conceived the idea of the movie based on the story of his family and growing up in various states, cities, and towns across the US. By his own admission, he has told the parts of the story in many of his films. For a long time, he could not come to terms with his parents' divorce when he was a teenager and for many years, he blamed his father and almost did not communicate with him. Over time, he learned details that he did not suspect, and in the last years of his parents' life, he was close to both. Both of his parents lived to a ripe old age. His mother died at 97 and his father at 103. While himself in his 70s he was blessed to be a son of two loving living parents. After their death, he finally decided to tell the story about them, about his childhood and adolescence, about the origins of his love for cinema, the love that became his calling, profession, and obsession for life.The Fabelmans is Steven Spielberg's most personal and touching film. It is his Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Amarcord, the New Paradiso Cinema, Radio Days, and The Mirror. While the themes of adolescence and becoming a creative person are similar in these very personal films of the great directors, The Fabelmans is unmistakably a film that only Spielberg, an artist at the peak of his talent and vision, could conceive, write, feel and stage. It is a dedication to the main tool of the filmmaker, his camera, to power and magic with which it entertains, delights, opens up new dimensions, stops moments, and highlights the unexpected essence of things, but can also break hearts and lives. Manipulating the camera shots and angles, Spielberg achieves in the best scenes of his semi-biographical movie the Rashomon's effect and opens his soul to the viewer in a way he has never done before. By the power of his talent, its creator captured the important, happy, and painful moments of the search for meaning and put them on screen as a compelling family portrait. Such sincerity and frankness will be appreciated by the viewer, who is ready to accept them. But the same sincerity and frankness can cause bewilderment, misunderstanding, and even rejection. Spielberg must have known about it, but he had to make the movie anyway. In my opinion, The Fabelmans is an honest, beautiful, and memorable film.",

This movie is Spielberg's attempt, and I can confirm that it's pretty well achieved. You can feel the \"true story\" in the ways in which this coming-of-age story avoids melodramatic teenage cliches and tropes. The protagonist is simply a good guy. There are no real antagonists except... I guess a couple of bullies...? It's a story that simply proves Spielberg's unmatched proficiency in the language of cinema: the pacing, the directing, is very refined and well-crafted, there's a lot of sentimentality that is efficiently conveyed and the visuals are always engaging in one way or another.Spielberg is a weird director, one that basically is simply very good at doing what he does, he talks the language of movies, Hollywood movies. He's one of those producers that turns every pop song into a hit. He doesn't have a strong sense of story, he lives and breaths in the Hollywood mainstream, and the movie portrays this very well, it shows how he is inspired by action movies, or epic movies, any entertaining story. His alter ego in the film is a very normal lead character, a very Hollywood-type of character. The best moments in the story are the interaction with his family, his complex relationship with his mother (really beautifully performed). I don't find a lot else to say, really. The only nitpick I have to offer is that the main character wears these extremely distracting brown contact lenses (I suppose to make his eyes look \"genetically accurate) and I don't understand how necessary that was. The movie is simply a very conventionally well told story. Also the Lynch cameo is admittedly a moving tribute both to him and to his character of John Ford. It's slow in parts but not grating, some moments are chuckle-worthy, some are moving. It's a testament to Spielberg's insane versatility and his ability to just serve the medium of Hollywood films. I'm probably going to forget this movie in a while, but I will gladly revisit it. It's a cute movie, very cozy and feel-good, a nice Christmas family watch.",

This two and a half hour marathon of a movie breaks almost every known rule of film-making, twisting story arcs, jumping tone, teasing out moments that should be quick, and quickening segments that should be drawn out. Yet Spielberg might be the only one in the industry that can get away with that, and still end up with a final reel that touches you in unexpected ways. The moment that Ali first put on a pair of boxing gloves clearly deserves some acknowledgement. Ditto for the moment that Bob Joyce first picked up a guitar. But the challenge in this movie for Spielberg was to share with the audience the intimate details of the moment he first picked up a camera, and somehow make that memorable. He succeeded. The movie, although challenging for the viewer at first, ultimately accomplishes the same thing as its cinematic hero. It earns your respect.

            "content": "The Fabelmans is both a coming-of-age story and a love letter to filmmaking; calling this movie a labor of love is an understatement. The Fabelman is Spielberg's most personal film ever as he shared how he developed his passion for filmmaking while demonstrating the power of escapism the movies brought to his life. Steven Spielberg understands that love for art is not just a hobby but also an expression of one's self and exploration of humankind. Steven Spielberg was able to articulate himself in a very raw yet profound way with his film, The Fabelmans. It is good to see him tell the story of his life while recognizing that his family is far from perfect and how a young man deals with one family crisis and overcoming it through the power of filmmaking. If you share the same love for film, like everyone here, you would certainly appreciate this movie. But, the movie is far from perfect as most of Spielberg's films.The movie focuses on Sammy, played wonderfully by Gabriel LaBelle, which sometimes comes off as a bit pretentious as a character. But, Gabriel LaBelle was great in this movie that he showed the emotional depth of the character, and his fascination with filmmaking translates to the audience. Gabriel LaBelle must have felt extreme pressure while playing this character, considering that he's playing one of the best filmmakers of all time, but he was able to give justice to the character at no fault. However, it was Michelle Williams that stood out in this film---to say her performance is phenomenal is diminishing---she was terrific and captivating as Mitzi, a free-spirited mother with an extreme love for art. Paul Dano was great in this film, as well as Seth Rogen. Also, Judd Hirsch is for sure a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination, only in the movie for less than 10 minutes, but his character is pivotal for Sammy's growth.During the third act of the film, it kinda lost its footing, the movie became dragging, cliche, and pretentious. But, The Fabelmans is far from Spielberg's best work, like Schindler's List or ET, but the movie works as a coming-of-age story that delivers more of the director's insights. The Fabelmans is a charming and poignant anecdote about life glimpsed through the camera and how those occasions shaped one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. Although the movie is predictable and does not come with surprises. The Fabelmans still works without depending on glitzy special effects, an excessive amount of violence, or shock value, but because of its great direction, performances, sincerity, and authenticity from the writing perspective, it resulted in The Fabelmans being one of this year's best films. We can see that it's personal, but it feels like the movie is made for us as well.",

This is a passion he soon pursued, and he would make movies and show them at school, to great praise from the audience. Does this sound like the life and times of Steven Spielberg?This is a very, very long movie, and a great deal of the movie's runtime is made up by Sammy making movies, and then showing them to family and friends. Why this takes up so much screen time is beyond reason, as this does not contribute to the film in any way. Cool, we understand, he's making movies at a young age, but do we actually want to see everything of what he does? Just a hint of it would have sufficed. We get the picture.Judd Hirsch stars as Mitzi's uncle, Boris, whom her deceased mother warned her against in a dream. I was expecting so much from this character - especially also since Judd Hirsch received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor - but he was in this long film for only about 10 minutes and all he did was talk to Sammy. That's it! When he left the next morning, he was never seen again. What was the point? The film would not have played out any differently had this character not been in the movie at all.When the family moved to California and Sam was being bullied at school, I completely lost interest. It felt like a completely different movie and even the narration transitioned from interesting drama to uninteresting comedy - complete with religious blasphemy. What the hell?The most interesting characters with the promise of intrigue, were Mitzi and Bennie. No offense, Mr Spielberg, but the film had the potential to take so many interesting turns. Instead, the final act was primarily aimed at a teen demographic, and an uninteresting one at that. The horizon was in the middle. (If you've seen the movie, you'll know what this means).Yes, the performances were very good, and 'The Fabelmans' is beautifully filmed. Unfortunately, it was just way overlong, and ultimately a bit boring towards the end.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. For most of us movie lovers, Steven Spielberg has been at the forefront of our cinema experiences since the mid-1970s. He has won 3 Oscars (along with 20 nominations) while delivering such classics and memorable films as: JAWS (1975), CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977), the \"Indiana Jones\" franchise (1981, 1984, 1989, 2008), E. T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (1982), THE COLOR PURPLE (1985), JURRASIC PARK (1993), SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993), SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998), MINORITY REPORT (2002), CATCH ME IF YOU CAN (2002), LINCOLN (2012), and WEST SIDE STORY (2021). Remarkably, that's a partial list of his films and doesn't take into account others that he's directed or produced, or his commitment to preserving film history. Despite (or perhaps because of) his diverse catalog of films, Spielberg always manages to find the human element while entertaining us. In fact, some have criticized him for putting too much emphasis on entertainment, as if that is somehow a problem.As you likely know, this latest (co-written with his frequent collaborator Tony Kushner), is Spielberg's look back at his own childhood, his family, and his early obsession with making movies. It's a semi-autobiographical case study of the early development of one of our most influential and prolific and popular filmmakers ... with some dramatic license taken for entertainment purposes, of course. Michelle Williams and Paul Dano star as Mitzi and Burt Fableman, parents to four children, including Sam Fableman (the stand-in for Steven). Mitzi is a former concert pianist who gave up her career to be a mom and wife, while Burt is an brilliant engineer working on the cusp of the computer age - this story begins just after WWII.Most of us remember our first movie in a theater. This film opens with parents Mitzi and Burt taking young Sam to his first: Cecil B DeMille's THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH (1952). This opening scene perfectly sets the stage. Engineer Dad details to his anxious son that movies are nothing more than lighting and still images being shown at 24 images per second, while artist mom assures him that movies are \"dreams\" (or as we interpret, \"the stuff that dreams are made of\"). It's this contrast between mom and dad that have such an impact on Sam and the family, as we see this as they follow Burt's career progression from New Jersey to Arizona to California. Mom encourages and supports Sam's interest in filmmaking, while dad continually belittles it as nothing more than a hobby.Gabriel LaBelle plays Sam as a teenager, and not only does he deliver a terrific performance, he also bears a striking resemblance to young Spielberg (the similarity startled me at first). Seth Rogen has a role as Bennie, a friend to the family - especially to Mitzi We see Sam's struggles as a high schooler facing bullies and antisemitism for being a nerdy, non-athletic Jew, as well as the challenges he faces with his own family, and in a touching sequence, with first love. Two scenes involving non-family members really stand out. Uncle Boris (an energetic Judd Hirsch) comes to visit and explains how his lion-taming is an art form that he felt compelled to pursue, and that he sees that same artistic streak in Sam ... while perfectly explaining how art and family ties can tug against each other, yet the artistic pursuit must never be forsaken. Another excellent scene occurs when Sam has a short meeting with a legendary director (a memorable cameo from director David Lynch) who offers a filmmaking tip that provides the film's final shot gag.As strong as LaBelle is as Sam, it's Michelle Williams who truly shines in a complex role that is easily one of the best of the year. She's an artist who knows she's trapped and struggles to make the best of thing. - right up until she can no longer do so. Brining a pet monkey home is usually a good indicator that someone has reached their limit. Her depression and internal chaos lead to a break in the family, but in a way, serves to drive Sam forward in his pursuit of filmmaking. The great John Williams provides the score (of course), while cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (delivers masterful images. It's rare for an (wildly successful) artist to open up about his family, his past, and his influences. Even though each scene and line of dialogue here has Spielberg's stamp of approval, there remains a vulnerability in pulling back the curtain for others. We do see how so much of life goes into the work of an artist, and how the pursuit of a passion may or may not lead to happiness. Spielberg proves yet again when it comes to history and legend, print the legend.***Note: the film leads us to believe that Spielberg stayed away from working in television, but in reality, he directed quite a few TV episodes, and his first movie was a made-for-TV movie entitled, DUEL ... one I highly recommend.",

Prior to this hit, the only movie of his I saw on release was Ready Player One (which I loved) but it didn't compete with his classics like ET or Jaws. This movie was different. Not only was it his best film in decades but it came from a different part of Spielberg we haven't seen before, being way more personal than his earlier films. Whether you like film or not, this movie is a must see. It is about passion, family, grief, and coming of age. It hits all of its marks with flying colors.",

            "content": "POSITIVES:1) Paul Dano floored me in this film. He completely steals the show for me. The fact he's pretty much the only adult actor in this film that isn't getting awards recognition is scandalous. He shows sides of himself here that I hadn't seen from him before and I loved him immensely. I also felt his character was by far the best written character and also the character that is in the right most of the time\n2) Spielberg's direction is masterful as always. The film looks beautiful and there were lots of long takes and impressive camera work\n3) By the end of the film, I did feel some warmth towards Sammy and like I'd been on a journey with him. It was the scene where he shows his Ditch Day film to his school that finally won me over and I gave in to the power of the filmNEGATIVES:1) Michelle Williams and Judd Hirsch both getting Oscar nominations here, what on Earth is going on? I hated Williams' performance, it was so over the top and badly theatrical. I also have to say that I despised her character and felt like she was in the wrong most of the time. Then with Hirsch, he's average and fine, but he's only in one scene and it's nothing special? I actually forgot about his character completely afterwards and my girlfriend had to remind me\n2) As the title of this review suggests, I found Spielberg to be being criminally self indulgent here. I understand that it's about his life, but a two and a half hour film about what seem like a fairly average family during the mid 20th century, who experience nothing that most regular families don't also experience, made this film a complete drag at times. I understand that we as an audience are meant to be interpreting this as being about Spielberg, who is arguably the best director of all time and therefore interesting, but that doesn't change the fact that nothing we see is really that eventful or noteworthy\n3) Sammy's three sisters are given no personality or character depth whatsoever. They all blended into one and I don't remember their names or distinct features about them. They may as well have not been there.",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg has been directing films for so many decades that it's actually a little surprising that the semi-autobiographical The Fabelmans (2022) took this long to materialize. Because of his years of success as a filmmaker, I already knew some details of Spielberg's rise to the successful director that he is today. Granted, I'm not sure how much of the family drama in The Fabelmans is a direct influence on Spielberg's life or if he manufactured it for the movie itself. Still, it is interesting to see the early budding talent presented in this movie and be able to extrapolate to movies like Jaws (1975), Saving Private Ryan (1998), and Schindler's List (1993).Perhaps my one qualm with this movie is that it's a bit too long. I understand the desire to show the entire life of Sammy Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle) to understand the context of the origins of his filmmaking passion, but there could have been much shorter ways to show these moments instead of dedicating almost the entire first act to something that was much less exciting than the rest of the film. Even if it started in the second act, The Fabelmans easily captures that struggle between family and living the life of a dedicated creative.I really appreciated the conversation about how pursuing a creative passion can really be a challenge for an individual's personal life. Similar to how the leads in La La Land (2016) had to choose between themselves and their dreams, The Fabelmans shows how having an additional way to communicate (in this case, via filmmaking) can sometimes break through barriers and expose hard truths. The unblinking eye of the camera often sees more than we want, whether the bipolar disorder and affair of a mother or how a bully sees themselves as the hero.A thoughtful if not slightly long autobiography of Steven Spielberg, I give The Fabelmans 4.0 stars out of 5.",

The movie was well-acted and I'm sure many of its characters (whom I walked out of the theater only remembering the name Sam) will receive Academy award nominations. Spielberg will get a best director nomination, and probably a Best Original Screenplay one too because the Academy loves Spielberg.If you want a good Spielberg movie, don't watch The Fablemans and instead watch some of his older work.",

            "content": "In the engaging and extremely personal drama \"The Fabelmans,\" Steven Spielberg reflects on his childhood and adolescence. As someone who has given us countless cinematic magic and wonder, patient and attentive film lovers will have much to appreciate here. The film's story centers around a young Spielberg, Sammy Fabelman, during his childhood and adolescence, covering a time period from about roughly age 7 to age 20. The film particularly focuses on his interest in filmmaking and how it related to obtaining his photography badge as a Boy Scout, his parents' relationship and eventual divorce, his time at school, and the early influences on him as a filmmaker. Spielberg's creative process is nodded to throughout in unique and engaging little details. This makes the film even more engaging for cinephiles, although more casual viewers may not find it--or these elements in and of themselves--to be as inherently compelling.It is no surprise that such a tender, heartfelt film has emotionally charged and engaging performances. Gabriel LaBelle does a compelling job playing an adolescent Fabelman, but arguably the standout of the cast is Michelle Williams' riveting performance as Mitzi Fabelman, Fabelman's mother. She is able to convey a full emotional range calibrated to an interpersonal scale unique for each scene--from how she engages with her husband Burt (Paul Dano,) to her son, and to others. Judd Hirsch also provides a fleeting but great performance as an older uncle who imparts words of wisdom into Fabelman. He's only in the movie for one scene about a third of the way into the movie, but his dialogue and mannerisms are extremely impactful. Tony Kushner's screenplay is able to come across as emotionally powerful yet authentic and human. You can tell he works incredibly well with Spielberg and understands the role a screenplay has in creating a compelling story for a film with emotionally powerful performances to boot. The film is leisurely paced and runs for over two and a half hours, but because its personal stakes and nature are compelling, it never feels lethargic nor overstaying its welcome. Some scenes still feel a bit saccharine, and other times the flow of its narrative can be a bit scattered. These elements hold back \"The Fabelmans\" from true greatness, but this potent memoir from a true cinematic luminary is still a generally strong film. Recommended. 7.5/10.",

I'm a huge Spielberg fan and \"Schindler's List\" is my all time favorite film and a brilliant one at that. \"The Fabelmans\" lacked a brilliant score, although it was scored by John Williams. Bland would be a word to describe the soundtrack, except for top 10 hits of the 1960s. The brilliance of a Janusz Kaminski cinematography was also lacking in this film.

The thread of the filmmaking was the only consistent thread throughout, but it is the story around it that missed its mark. The movie is too long.

You can't stay serious or not tear a bit whenever you watch movies like E. T., Jurassic Park, Schindler's list, Saving Private Ryan or any other movie of his to say the least.What Spielberg does is adding emotion to story and making the audience rejoice to whenever we re-watch his movies, or in case of The Fabelmans, get emotional and empathize with him, and his characters.Gabriel Labelle portrays a so called young version of Steven, passionate with cinema who wishes to make movies and enjoy them just like all of us. Great performance.Michelle Williams and Paul Dano are fantastic, loved their chemistry and also the fact their characters are so different from one another: one is more technical and the other is artistic.Judd Hirsch steals the show with just a few scenes (and one oscar winning sequence).Seeing David Linch as John Ford was not something I'd thought I'd see. But I'm glad I did. His role may be short but was very important and key moment for Sammy Fabelman (and perhaps young Steven) to make his own movies.In general, I really loved this movie and everything surrounding it, from dialogue to characters and homages to the legend who created this movie. Some people may not attach or empathize much with The Fabelmans, that's ok too, it's a very personal film to say the least. It's a film though for people who are passionate with cinema. People who are passionate about making movies like Spielberg, with drived emotion.In conclusion, people who want and love to make movies should go and make movies.",

Virtually all the reviews here make mention that this is the famed director's thinly veiled autobiographical film, and in some ways, I suppose it is, especially in the early scenes when young Sammy Fabelman (Mateo Zoryan) became fascinated with the train wreck in \"The Greatest Show on Earth\". His obsession with recreating the scene using a handheld camera of the era probably comes close to Spielberg's own experience. As a teenager, Sam (Gabriel LaBelle) became more ambitious and creative with the help of his boy scout troop's collaboration. Where the story took a downward turn for me was the caricature-like portrayal of Chloe East as Sam's first girlfriend, Monica Sherwood. Her devotion to Jesus just seemed too way over the top to be effective and felt more like parody. Maybe that was the point. But the most poignant part of the story dealt with the way Sam approached his mother's (Michelle Williams) infidelity and the divorce of his parents. Real angst on the part of both felt real and emotional, which I'm sure helped Spielberg adjust to the follies and foibles of the human condition. What I will say is that I think the best was saved for last, when still teenage Sam met acclaimed director John Ford (David Lynch), who helped him discern his own future horizon. The closing scene was a moment of triumph that almost looked like it belonged in a different movie.",

What Spielberg does with Tony Kushner is transport us to the director's most personal memories and create a wonderful film of forgiveness and gratitude for a very personal moment for the director, which is his relationship with his parents and the beginning of his love for the world. Cinema.The fictional childhood journey he creates for Sammy is also a story of a man destined to pass his talents on to others. A fresh story full of wonderful moments, sequences that are pure cinema and performances that only transmit emotions.A varied tour of emotions that summarize what life is in simplicity. Moods and situations that are marking our life and what we are and will be in the future.It is a mature film that does not indulge in cheap nostalgia, in fact, on the contrary, it is a controlled drama impregnated with a pure sadness that assures us that we have the director's most moving and mature film before our eyes.Michelle Williams delivers one of the most forceful interpretations of her career, she is our thermometer of emotions and sensations generated by the story that Spielberg proposes to us, together with her an ignored by the academy Paul Dano who also shines with her interpretation and a more than deserved Judd Hirsch back to the nominations with his small, but forceful participation that must be one of the most amazing moments that the film offers us.Possibly, it will not be in the top 3 of the films that the director has to his credit, but without a doubt it is perhaps the film that makes us understand the genius behind the cameras, he is a genius giving thanks to art, his family and his dreams who today have him as one of the best directors in the history of cinema.A journey towards cinema and magic and as the great David Lynch says, impersonating John Ford: \"When the horizon is in the background it is interesting.

It was as if she only has a narrow range for acting-- which probably is not true but it was true in this movie. She was flat (too much botox?), unexpressive (except her dialogue) and definitely did not look the part. Rachel Brosnahan (Marvelous Mrs. Maisel) or a young Bette Midler would have brought pathos and animation to her role. With the exception of one or two scenes, MW was not even remotely credible.Similarly, the father was sweet and boring but not nearly obsessive, quirky, distracted or otherwise the \"absent minded professor\" that he was supposed to be. We only knew about his character again, through the dialogue-- not the acting. However, hard to know if this was the fault of the script or the actor, or both.Otherwise, the movie was entertaining.

I believe that this is an interesting, emotional and fun - at times - coming-of-age film that will appeal to anyone who is an artist - or feels a bit artistic - and anyone who often feels torn between that world and the real world.The truth is, the first 25-30 minutes didn't work out that well for me. The story didn't grab me, the family didn't captivate me right away and it all seemed quite disjointed. It is from the moment we realize that there is a certain secret in that family that the drama increases, which curiously improves the part of the film related to \"being an artist\". It is in these small familiar films that the young man realizes what he can discover through films, expressions and attitudes that are better demonstrated through images than words. When the \"young Spielberg\" shows his films to other people, it is also clear how much they touch other people, the feelings that these films awaken, saying through them much of what he even has difficulty saying to their parents. This tells him enough: this is his gift.The dialogue is fantastic. It is the high point of The Fabelmans. Almost every five minutes we have a phrase, an expression that can accompany us for a long time, especially when we are in a creative process, but also when we have to deal with ever-present family problems. Spielberg is a master at managing these types of relationships and, yes, of course, he once again uses the dinner table perfectly to show us the different stages of relationships (compare between dinner parties!). Gabriel La Belle surprised me with an excellent performance in which many moments made me believe I was watching the young Steven Spielberg. The artist, the son, the bullied, the dreamer, the introvert, and the person. Michelle Williams is fascinating as his mother, Mitzi. Sometimes over-the-top (clearly on purpose), sometimes in another world (the world of...sad artists), but always with a huge emotional charge. Paul Dano has the character I least identified with, but he is probably faithful to the family's father Burt and does what the role requires. Finally, Judd Hirsch as Uncle Boris shines in a short but very funny and impactful passage through the film.From a technical standpoint, the cinematography is brilliant - jaw-dropping shots, moving camera - and the production design recreates that era quite believably, but it's John Williams' score that often helps to punctuate the emotions.I don't consider it one of Spielberg's best - I'm sorry, but Spielberg is the director with the most masterpieces in history, don't want to fight - nor do I think it's a better film than his previous one (WSS). It is, however, a very good film that even starts badly, but balances on its emotions, in strong characters and, above all, in its various deep meanings.",

            "content": "\"Movies are dreams that you never forget.\" Mitzi Fabelman (Michelle Williams)Arguably the best movie of 2022 is Steven Spielberg's The Fabelmans. A list of the greatest directors of all time, beginning with Orson Welles, would include Steven Spielberg. This thesis is proven multiple times in his tour-de-force The Fabelmans, his semi-autobiography that chronicles the early family life of Sammy Fabelman, standing in for Spielberg, and the birth of his obsession with movies.As a youngster, Sammy Fabelman (Gabriel La Belle) is introduced to cinema by his mother, Mitzi, and father, Burt (Paul Dano), after he exclaimed his lack of desire to witness this adult diversion. Once he saw a train wreck on the screen, he was impelled to re-create the scene with his model train. Subsequently as a young man he filmed toilet-paper mummies, his Boy Scout troupe in stock westerns, and bloody war movies in the desert of Arizona.And so began the story of his film passion up through his brief encounter with legendary director John Ford: \"They tell me you want to become a picture maker. What do you know about art, kid?\" Obviously much.The strength of this engaging recounting of Sammy's growth into a world-class director is the sustained realism of the challenges a young man experiences, like his eccentric mother in love with his dad's best friend, \"Uncle\" Benny (Seth Rogan), and crushing anti-Semitism in high school. The depiction of his harassment is alternately cliched-the bigger boys pick on diminutive, Jewish him-and inspiring as he uses his burgeoning film expertise to subvert the relentless annoyances.Midway in the drama, itinerant arts-loving Uncle Boris (Judd Hirsch) expresses what Spielberg and his co-writer, Tony Kushner, are getting at about the conjunction of art and life: \"Family, art, life - it will tear you in two.\" The Fabelmans evidences the way to deal with the vagaries of cinema-love every ironic and sardonic moment, because they are the stuff of art. The score, by who else but John Williams, elevates even the darkest moments.While he has difficulty dealing with these roadblocks, no doubt they contributed to his deep understanding of life's richness in its flaws. The Fabelmans will receive multiple Oscar nominations that include best picture.",

Some great drama and acting by all of the main characters, the first hour is ho hum and the dialogue is not well written; it just doesn't engage you. It is only after 'Sam' is portrayed as a teenager that you get some real dramatic tension. With that said the movie is not well woven together, it does not follow a coherent narrative arc, IE why is this scene, dialogue , character even in the movie ?Some of the acting is strained and predictable at best and at other times just plain awkward. The truly good parts of the movie is where there is no dialogue and and the story and emotion is conveyed visually. Bottom line, an auto biography that is easily an hour too long and so much should have been edited . . . Out. I liked the movie, am glad I saw it but no Oscars for this one and certainly not up to Spielberg's best work , too predictable , and hackneyed.",

Spielberg digs deep into his memory to facilitate a story worthy of the big screen with the help of a great co-writer in Tony Kushner. But it doesn't just end there. Anyone can write words on a piece of paper. To bring it to life in a satisfying manner (to & for the audience) is the real challenge and is what makes a great director, great.The film flowed smoothly from scene to scene, sequence to sequence. You really get a sense of what it must've been like to live in such a precarious environment for the young Spielberg.The ending was superb. Having David Lynch portray John Ford was a treat as well as Spielbergs recollection of the horizon anecdote.(That final shot was very clever.)At two hours & twenty-three minutes, the story felt like it was just beginning but we have more than a hint of how it ended up for the newcomer Sammy Fabelman.The only thing this film suffered from was a horribly cut trailer that didn't provoke any interest from me. I went on to watch because it's one of the greatest filmmakers living & was glad that he did not disappoint.The team that crafted this film deserves to win awards for executing such a strong film.Mazel tov, Mr. Spielberg!",

Paul Dano is terrific as a truly nice guy who frustratingly just can't understand the desire to make films.Michelle Williams goes for broke in an extremely over the top performance that thankfully pays off. Judd Hirsch only has scene but his performance lingers long after with a fierce and intimidating presence that hammers home the cost of art.Steven Spielberg's direction is amazing, his trademark for subtly understated one takes remains and is always a pleasure to see and the film looks gorgeous from beginning to end thanks to long time collaborator Janusz Kaminski's immaculate cinematography.",

Well with his latest \"The Fabelmans\" it is his own autobiography life like story as he grew up as a young boy in post War War II Arizona. It follows the life of the Fabelman family with dad the bright Burt(perfect Paul Dano) who's a smart engineer and he lives a happy life it seems with wife Mitzi(the sunshine like performance from Michelle Williams) and his kids in tow, however little boy Sammy seems special and life changes for him and the family after Sammy sees his first big screen movie out at the cinema. His interest is to start making his own movies at home starting with filming and taking pictures of a train set, then by getting his first camera homemade movies begin, only gradually it's on to bigger and better things with a movie camera as Sammy makes family like documentary pictures and his journey and love of film has him filming friends and his school life. Along the way a move to California opens his eyes even more as Sammy is closer to the land of Hollywood and movies however struggles of growing up dealing with school, peer pressure, and finding love all factor into Sammy's life. Also a family secret is revealed that involves mom Mitzi and a past family friend in Bennie(Seth Rogen). This splits the family up from dad Burt, however nothing will stop Sammy in the pursuit of his dream of loving film and movies as to make images on the big screen is his dream. Overall wonderful film of life as it's introduction to dreams blends well with family again this is a super coming of age story that proves art and life intersect to become real. Overall wonderful well done personal film from Steven.",

The script is quite smart in how it develops most of these family members with sympathetic plights and passions.Because the film is more of a portrayal of life than an actual story with a concrete concept, the 2 1/2 hour runtime is felt. Several story arcs take place with many beginnings and endings coming and going.But that's not to say it's boring; the many stories do advance the characters and it's so often fascinating to watch them grow up and experience their lives' most impactful moments.It's sporadically hilarious, heartwarming, and tragic, even if it lacks any sort of central hook.",

This doesn't necessary restrict itself to big effects pictures, although they are a part of it, but Spielberg is pure Hollywood and for the first time he has made a film which doesn't follow that path except for the delightful ending. This therefore is not a bad film by any stretch and gave me a number of laughs and some scenes, including when the lead character Sam, edits his camping holiday film, are perfection. The performances are largely strong particularly Michelle Williams as the mother and Paul Dano underplays nicely. I was less keen on Judd Hirsch doing a straight out of central casting rather clumsy Jewish turn or Seth Rogen, rather meh as Dano's best friend. It is a little too long and somewhat episodic but if you love films and Spielberg, it is worth catching this smaller than usual and very personal picture, but expectations need managing.",

In fact it might be one of his worst.The plot is a generic coming of age drama, heightened with overwrought performances and an indulgent, roving camera. At 2hrs 30 mins, it feels bloated with sentimentality; the dialogue is awkward and unnatural while the performances are hammed up to the point of parody. Michelle Williams as Sammy's mother, seems to be channelling Judy Garland in her drunk years, while Paul Dano sounds like a tired 50's car salesman.It's all very clich\u00e9, by the numbers stuff, and despite a solid main performance from Gabrielle LaBelle as Sammy, it didn't resonate with me emotionally, as much as it tried to do.

If that story or plot is cinematic gold doesnt need to be a priority in this case. There is not much of a plot, its truly a coming of age story of a boy who follows his dreams and a boy who gets influenced by a lot of people in his sorroundings to fulfill this very dream.Its really a beautiful piece of cinema and one of the best films this year. Steven Spielberg gives us a very intimate look into his own soul and life. A master of his craft and this movie just adds to his legacy which is kind of ironic but just as it is supposed to be.The acing is tremendous and some of the best ensemble work in any Spielberg film. Newcomer Gabriel LaBelle is the newcomer of the year. He really nails the role and gives it the right amount of heart and soul. He came the character. Great work of this young actor and surely worthy of any kind of awards attention. Michelle Williams is also great. I was not the biggest fan of her character who sometimes appeared to be annoying but I liked how Williams mixed this with the other character traits to make this character appealing after all. It was surely not an easy role as on paper I think it was not a very likable character on first sight, or lets say its a very difficult character to like but still a character with the heart at the right spot. Williams brought this effectively on screen.I did prefer Paul Dano though. He had the less showier part but most of it happened with his expressions and quiet moments. Its a fantastic performance by Dano who keeps being great and versatile. I also loved Judd Hirsch's brief role where he completey commanded the screen and of course David Lynch's cameo is something to remember. Seth Rogen was okay but I felt they could have fleshed out his role more. John Williams last Spielberg score (most likely) is a very subtle and beautiful piece of music. I loved the cinematography and general look. On one hand a very un-Spielberg film but on the other hand just as recognizable as any other. Pure cinematic magic.",

Crafted with enormous care, told with unfailing precision and exhibiting first-rate execution on all fronts, The Fabelmans is yet another masterpiece from the master storyteller.Co-written & directed by Steven Spielberg, the film presents the esteemed filmmaker mustering enough courage to put up his vulnerable side on screen for others to look at & reflect upon. It is an incredibly intimate & personal effort and yet, there isn't any shortage of cinematic bravura & filmmaking ingenuity on display here. Also, despite the poignance & critical eye, it brims with all the awe, warmth & wonder that makes his works so profound & comforting.Apart from serving as a gripping coming-of-age drama, the film explores the power of cinema, its ability to evoke memories, expose truths in them as they are and also offer refuge when the harsh realities of life become overwhelming. Tony Kushner's splendid script, Janusz Kaminski's impeccable cinematography, Michael Kahn's tight editing & John Williams' touching score also conjure pure magic while sincere, nuanced performances from the cast keep us invested in the picture.Overall, The Fabelmans is one of the best all-round films of the year that makes for a beautiful ode to cinema, a powerfully moving memoir, a captivating coming-of-age story & a compelling family drama all at once, and ranks right up there with Spielberg's finest directorial efforts. It is light & unassuming on surface but never in a way that conceals its emotional complexity & in-depth layers.

It's about that time in your life where you stop seeing your parents as godly caregivers and realize they're human beings with their own flaws and dreams. It's not a simple process: there's confusion and anger involved, but THE FABELMANS treats this stage of adolescence with compassion and insight.On a cinematic level, this is astounding work. Fabulous acting, wonderful compositions, and a great eye for period detail (way too many movies set in the past just make it feel like we're watching 21st century people in Halloween costumes-- the atmosphere in this feels both realistic and yet elevated in its presentation of the 60s before it started swinging).",

It is fascinating to see the beginnings of the man who brought films such as \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Indiana Jones\" to life. Though it took a minute for me to become invested in the characters, once the pacing hit its stride, I was hooked.The film tackles difficult topics, such as racism and infidelity, without forcing an agenda. There is a truth to \"The Fabelmans\" that was uniquely charming. Spielberg is not afraid of silence, and some of the most memorable scenes are from those quiet moments. Rather than relying on words, facial expressions perfectly conveyed the message he wanted to tell.When the film started, I was concerned about the acting and the script. Some of the performances were stiff and felt pretentious, at least at first. It was evident that the pressure of portraying Spielberg's family was daunting for some of the actors. After about 20 minutes, the acting seemed more natural, and I was able to see the passion behind each performance.As the film is based on Steven Spielberg's childhood/youth, there were a lot of small stories over the 2 hour 30-minute runtime. At times, these individual scenes felt disconnected from the ultimate narrative. Similarly, some of the editing was choppy and out of place. Ultimately, the story came together, but there were some unnecessary stops along the way.If you love films, you will find joy in \"The Fabelmans\". After finishing the movie, I felt inspired in a unique way. It is evident that Steven Spielberg put his heart into this project and that he tapped into deep, personal roots. As the Academy Awards approach, this film is a lock to win one, if not more of their seven nominations.Best Character: Sammy\nBest Scene: Late Night Passion Projects\nBest Quote: \"Movies are dreams that you never forget.\" - Mitzi Fabelman\nBest Piece of Score: \"Mother and Son\"",

I am shocked that Gabriel LaBelle is not nominated in best actor category as this is a much better performance that Paul Mescal, but who am I!It was a very long movie, there was no need, the music was good and Michelle clearly played several of the Beethoven pieces.

It will be very popular on any streamer that gets it. But talk of Oscars is stretching it. It isn't THAT great. In fact the comedy almost all falls flat and in many ways the film comes off as closed off, not the open raw look at a persons life but more like a carefully crafted \"fiction\", sort of a winky cheeky look at my life and beginnings but not really it's fiction but it's not. Good movie, will do great in streaming. But it's no magic carpet ride to the academy awards so don't believe that paid-for hype.",

This was one of my most highly anticipated recent films and it did not disappoint! It's Spielberg at his best, and I feel very honoured to have such a personal look into his life. As an aspiring filmmaker myself, this film really inspires me.This film is so gorgeous and beautiful to look at, the cinematography is second to none. The attention to detail with the camerawork is incredibly strong and it shows off many impressive camera techniques. There's a very broad range of colour palettes that reflect the tone of each scene well, I especially love the warmer colours used.The sound design is equally as impressive, and is often subtle yet extremely effective. Therefore it really is a movie you should experience in a movie theatre! The score is full of emotion and the simple use of piano music gives the film a nostalgic and heartfelt feel.The characters are so well written, and all the actors give their best performances. Gabriel LaBelle is so loveable as Sammy, and he's a character I think many film-lovers can relate to in a very personal way. Michelle Williams and Paul Dano play their characters with so much heart and depth, casting them was a flawless decision!Lastly, the film is well paced and builds up the story perfectly, taking it's time whilst also being consistently entertaining. Additionally, this movie has so many inspiring and genuine messages, teaching us never to give up on our dreams no matter what others may tell us.",

We don't need constant action but the script and screenplay were mediocre at best. Here is a small tip from an average movie fan to the most successful movie director of all time: Learn how to edit! Take out the boring scenes! People are able to tell stories in an hour and 45 minutes it happens all the time. At least half of the first hour should have been left on the cutting room floor.If this film is nominated for an Oscar then it's a bad year for movies.

            "content": "The Fabelmans are a middle-class Jewish family living in various cities in the middle of the 20th century. Steven Spielberg's film about them centers on the conflict between artistic drive and personal responsibility, as well as the mysteries of talent and happiness. Where do these gifts come from? It's not just in the genes, the psyche, the conditioning, or the trauma. It's mysterious. It arrives out of nowhere like the shark in \"Jaws,\" the UFOs in \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" the miracles and disasters of \"War of the Worlds\" and the Indiana Jones and Jurassic Park movies, and the eruptions of gore and cruelty in Spielberg's R-rated historical epics. Sammy's Uncle Boris (Judd Hirsch), a circus performer and storyteller, lays it out for him one night: people who know that they have talent must commit to it, not waste it; but the more fiercely they commit, the more they may neglect their loved ones, or feel as if they are (which can induce guilt). This conflict will wrestle inside an artist forever. From an early age, Sammy figures out-or perhaps instinctively knows-that a camera can be used not merely to tell stories and make pretty pictures, but win friends; placate or manipulate enemies; woo prospective romantic partners; glamorize and humiliate; show people a better self that they could aspire to become; shield the artist against hurt during painful moments; smooth out or obstruct the truth, and blatantly lie. In the end, it all comes back to people figuring out who they are and then deciding whether to fully commit to the course they think will bring them the most happiness. That the movie leaves deep questions unresolved and presents all the related philosophical and aesthetic issues in a playful way (the final shot is a sight gag!) makes the experience quintessential Spielberg. You think he's giving you everything and that it's all right there on the surface. But the longer you sit with it, the more you realize how many gifts it contains. Much of the film is told in long takes that don't feel show-offy because Spielberg's blocking is always in service of deepening characters and illustrating themes. Just look at that opening scene outside of the movie theater, which ends with young Sammy silhouetted in the middle of the frame: a human dividing line, with his father (who speaks of cinema in terms of photography and persistence of vision) on one side and his mother (who tells him movies are mainly about feelings and dreaming) on the other.",

I know this was a very personal story for him, and the relationship between his parents clearly had a formative effect on him and his art. But I frankly didn't care all that much about the marital woes of Steven Spielberg's parents, though it does give Michelle Williams a chance to shine in a lovely performance. No, what I came for, and what kept me engaged, were the scenes showing Spielberg's budding talents as a filmmaker, and also those showing the prejudice he faced for being Jewish in a homogenous California suburb.\"The Fabelmans\" also has maybe the best ending of any movie this year, and by itself is worth the price of admission.

            "content": "The Fabelmans is a semi-autobiographical based on Steven Spielberg. Funny enough it is also directed by Steven Spielberg. I haven't ever seen a biopic story that is also directed by the person the story is about. That interested me a lot but knowing it was about the legendary director Steven Spielberg is what made me want to watch it. Is the movie an overly self-indulgent semi-biopic, or does Steven continue to show why he is such a great director?The film is such an interesting piece as the characters themselves are fictional but based on real people. For example, the character that is meant to represent Spielberg is named Samuel \"Sammy\" Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle). What I appreciate is that Steven doesn't shy away from the flaws of the character representing him. Sammy is very passionate about filmmaking but he loves it so much that he puts it above his own family. His conflict is trying to pursue his passion while his family is tearing apart. On that note, there is a complex family dynamic with the clash of the logical but stern yet loving Dad (Paul Dano) and the artistic but selfish yet encouraging Mother (Michelle Williams). Sammy inherits both qualities from his parents but also some of their worse. Seeing the struggle of chasing a dream and their isolation is such an engaging theme. None of the characters is terrible people. They do wrong things but there is a lot more nuance to them. The story is incredibly warm, funny, gut-wrenching and powerful.The performance here is terrific and worthy of an Oscar. Michelle Williams gives an unforgettable performance as the mother, Mitzi. She shows how caring yet weird of a mother she is but shows how she is gradually getting more and more broken as the movie progresses. She could have easily made her character incredibly hatable but her performance succeeds in making the audience sympathize with her despite her being the main cause of the rift in the family. Paul Dano is also terrific as the dad, Burt. His performance is less eccentric and more subtle but he perfectly conveys the internal struggle of the character. Gabriel LaBelle plays Sammy and he is great. His character is sort of arrogant and Gabriel manages to convey that without being overly pompous and annoying. LaBelle is terrific at communicating a young kid whose emotions are on the verge of exploding. He is a very promising young actor. In terms of supporting actors, Judd Hirsch appears for only two scenes yet he gives such a strong performance that takes over the scene. David Lynch also appears in just one scene but his scene might be the most memorable moment in the film.The music is composed by legendary composer John Williams and he continues to do a great job. Although, the score here isn't his most memorable. The cinematography is done by Janusz Kaminski of Schindler's List fame and he continues to be great here. There are tons of great and memorable shots that capture the essence of filmmaking in The Fabelmans. There is an amazing shot that has Sammy using his hands as a screen with a projector aimed at his palm which is stunning. If I had any issue with the film then it has to be the 2nd act with Sammy in high school. Scenes concerning Sammy's romance and his bullying are a little uninteresting compared to everything else. It doesn't help that his girlfriend feels very over the top and the bullies act like all the generic jocks you have seen over a dozen times. Fortunately, the high school stuff have a strong landing.Overall, Steven Spielberg continues to show that he is still one of the best directors out there. Despite the film being a semi-biographic on him, he doesn't shy away from the flaws of him and his parents. He shows the struggle of chasing your passion which might resonate with a lot of people. If Spielberg decided this was his last film then this would've been a great final outing. However, from this film alone, I know he loves making films and he won't stop here. I can't wait to see his next work.",

            "content": "Loosely based on Spielberg's life story, \"The Fablemans\" shows the life of a growing movie producer from the time he is about 6 to the age of 22. Although the movie is told from the eyes of the young boy (or man), it covers his close family, mom, dad and 2 sisters and his dad's closest friend Bennie (played by Seth Rogan). After reading about it, I was surprised how close it was to his real story, not that loose at all and I very much appreciated that fact.Since Spielberg did direct some of the most iconic movies of all times (Schindler's list, Jaws, E. T, Jurassic Park etc etc), it is hard to say that \"The Fabelmans\" can take a top spot in that list, however judged in a vacuum I still think it is a great movie, my only complaint with it being that the progression is very slow and might lose some viewers over that. There are not many big events or something that super extraordinary, but considering this is almost a documentary, it is well worth watching for those of us who are interested in a realistic story.Covering the early years of Steven.. er.... I mean Sammy, saves the movie from telling anything about modern day movies and only covers couple of his early years shorts, which their make-of details are murky anyway. It could have been a story about anybody, but no, it is Spielberg's story and that worth a few points in my book, otherwise I would probably rank it a bit lower.In summary, if you can sit through a semi-documentary film about filmmaking and coming-of-age story, then please give Fabelmans a try. It is different than the usual Spielberg block-busters and probably would not be a financial success, but if you coming in with the right expectations, I feel you will not be disappointed.

This must have been a painful story to tell for Steven and he waited until parents passed to tell the story. This film has beautiful cinematography with a great score and beautiful acting. Michelle Williams is the real standout as Sammy's mother. She is beautiful, funny and heart breaking.

Spielberg is one of the most acclaimed and respected directors of all time. He also is the biggest reason I love watching movies. Jaws, Et, Indiana Jones (1-3, Not 4), Jurassic Park, & The Goonies are all staples of my childhood. Without Spielberg, I might not be the person I am today. The Fablemans is what every Spielberg fan wanted an absolute masterpiece.This film blew me away. Its direction, score, acting, and cinematography are amongst the year's best. Michelle Williams won't win Best Actress, but she has to have the best performance in this film. Every bit of this film is emotional and nostalgic. Each scene takes you back into this life that so closely mirrors that of Spielberg. Who would have guessed that an movie with loose ties to Spielbergs life would make for one of the best films of his career? Even though Spielberg gets the credit, John Williams deserves just as much praise. Williams has done scores for so many franchises (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter, and Jurassic Park, to name a few). I hope he gets honored so he can become the oldest winner of an Academy award. Everything Everywhere All At Once is a better film and deserves to win at the Oscars. If I could have one wish this year, it would be that Steven Spielberg wins Best Director. Even if he loses, I'll always look back at this film as another masterpiece in the Steven Spielberg catalog.10/10 Spielberg, like a fine wine, keeps getting better with age.",

I wasn't expecting much but I got the feeling that I got when I was watching another Paul Dano movie \"There Will Be Blood\". I only get those sense when I'm watching truly good cinema. A unique movie. The performance of every single cast was fantastic, especially Michelle Williams (Spielberg's Mom) and Garbriel LaBelle (Spielberg). These two poured their heart and soul into this movie and I was very impressed. It was a nice homage to old-school films and filmmaking -which to be honest, I need more knowledge on. The music was done by the legendary John Williams and boy, am I glad that he's still doing movies. There was no outstanding melodies in the score of this movie as people may know John Williams for. But he shows that he may not need those to make the music totally work for the movie.This movie at point brought me to tears because it reminded so much of my childhood in certain aspects. I used to want to be a director and I made lots of videos when I was young. My family dynamic had issues just like Spielberg did and it all felt very relatable. I also loved the thematic approach in how Spielberg intertwines the idea of family and his love for film together. To him, filmmaking was something he loved but it also represented the idea of family feud as he discovers the evidence of his mother's affair through film. But it was also his mother who kept pushing him to pursue film. Perhaps Spielberg wanted to stop making films because he saw too much of himself in his mother and pursuing \"art\" would make him selfish like his mother seemed. But in the end, pursuing art is doing what you want to do, at the cost of many sacrifices including family, because it is the ultimate form of self-expression. It's not gonna be all pretty but it expresses. I think they drove this point to home when Spielberg moves high schools and there is a gap between the filmmaker and the subject, and what's portrayed in the film and his current situation with all the antisemetic bullying he experienced.But in the end, you don't need to analyze someone's life story. With all of that aside, this was still an amazing film in its narrative skills and kept me captivated for 2.5h.",

But this is Spielberg tipping his cap to us film nerds who have studied his work. Instead, it felt more like a surfaced idealism of nostalgia. What you expect is a little bit more introspection of a driven filmmaker, instead you get a maudlin kid who has to watch his parents' relationship deteriorate.The story is of Sam Fabelman (Gabriel LaBell), a boy whose visual senses are first introduced by an artistic Mother, Mitzi (played wonderfully by Michelle Williams) and Burt (an equally Oscar worthy Paul Dano). They are deeply supportive of Sam's photographic muses. He first sees a movie and is deeply mesmerized by the images that he sets out to recreate them. This is shown to be the impetus of his future in filmmaking. Now, you can either say this was smart or dumb, but there is very little in how Sam becomes obsessed with the craft of moviemaking. They show moments of making backyard films with his friends, with elaborate stunts and a sophisticated knowledge of framing, but it is all brief to the drama that unfolds between his parents marriage. Sam documents their lives and attempts to fashion much of it into a story of some kind. The trick is to allow the audience to be a part of it. But it doesn't play out like that. Sam gets derailed with first domestic issues, THEN when he is old enough to have his own relationship, that sidetracks him. It was like they abandoned the story of his obsession with movies. The focus becomes greatly muddled as I expected probably more about him driven to make movies. I didn't get that sense. They never reach the part where it does consume his life. And, I do believe that is as a result of keeping to much to his own life's realities rather than elevating it into some level of fantasy. There is just too much reality in there to make it THAT whimsical. I'm sure there are also little things in there that nod to his influences to his future movies that another viewing may elicit a smile. I was, perhaps, expecting a much more obvious ones that would give us fans a moment of satisfactory recognition.The gauzy nature of the film does give you the sense of looking back at the life of a filmmaker, but none of it makes you feel it. The documentary \"American Movie\" about filmmaker Mike Borchardt hits harder than this. This was a glossy version of how a boy becomes a filmmaker but the best parts are after the movie ends.I was disappointed in the film. But those who don't know Spielberg's life or any of his anecdotes will find the ending particularly funny. A story he has told in past interviews that is about meeting one of his heroes. It is re-created with director David Lynch.There is enough there to keep it moving, as even Spielberg's least interesting film is still better than others' best. I don't think it will give you any deeper insight into his genius (again, probably because he probably doesn't know where his genius comes from). It will gather much accolades during award seasons for fantastic moments with Judd Hirsch (a cameo moment, really) and the two adult leads. Incidentally, closer and closer towards the end of the movie, Gabriel LaBell REALLY starts to looks like Steven Spielberg and it is sometimes unnerving.",

            "content": "Currently aged 76 years, the harsh reality of the situation is we are now very much in the twilight period of influential director and all-round cinematic treasure Steven Spielberg's life.The multi-Oscar winning spectacled filmmaker has long provided audiences around the globe with a vast array of worthy features ranging from the large-scale to the small-scale, with his based on his own experiences The Fabelmans his most intimate, personal and quiet film in an extensive catalogue of products.Beloved by critics, this semi-autobiographical drama may have struck a chord with the \"experts\" and awards circuits (likely to be a major factor in the upcoming key Oscar categories) but has curiously become one of Spielberg's biggest box-office duds in a career littered with success stories, which is a shame as The Fabelmans is a worthy addition to the director's legendary career that showcases a different side of both the filmmaker and the person behind the camera.Proclaimed to be Spielberg's love letter to the power of cinema and the artistry that lays at the core of what the medium provides, The Fabelmans is certainly that in some capacity but it's also just as much if not more so a tribute to Spielberg's parents with Michelle Williams Mitzi and Paul Dano's Burt Fabelman lovingly crafted incarnations of Spielberg's influential kin that is key to Gabriel LaBelle's Sammy's growth from a wide-eyed movie loving child to a close to adulthood dreamer unsure of where his \"hobby\" may take him.In many ways there's not so much of plot to Spielberg's film as such with key moments such as a camping trip, Scout movie projects and family interactions making up much of The Fabelmans runtime and some viewers may find their interest levels wanning at times as the films two and half hour runtime moves on without much of a hurry but as you would expect from such a talented and intelligent director as Spielberg there's so much love for cinema displayed here and so much warmth and emotion that you can't help but be impressed by yet another such fully formed feature from the iconic figure.Far more humorous and softly spoken than we've come to expect from Spielberg across his career (a scene involving a Christian loving teenager one of the funniest of the director's career), The Fabelman's is a chance for Spielberg to dial things way back with his casts impressive but unshowy performances, highlighted by a career making turn from LaBelle and scene-stealing cameos from Judd Hirsch and David Lynch all noteworthy with Dano and Williams both assured Oscar nominees while even his supposed last collaboration with longstanding collaborator and composer John Williams beautiful in its simple yet effective nature, much like the work of cinematographer Janusz Kaminski who ensures The Fabelmans is up there with the best looking Spielberg's features of the last few decades.Where The Fabelmans will rank amongst the filmography of Spielberg's CV is still to be determined by the time yet to come but there's little doubt that we should be thankful for Spielberg showing us a different and more vulnerable side to himself that comes across in this heart-warming and insightful piece of his own self come to life before our eyes.Final Say -Closing in one of the most memorable ways imaginable, The Fabelman's takes us on a kindly observed coming of age tale that just so happens to remind us of the power of the moving image to play a role in our lives, as well as offering us a reminder that we are so very fortunate to have shared the cinematic journey that Spielberg has been destined to follow since the age he first laid eyes on the cinema screen.4 horizons out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",

You can always find the same unique taste in his movies.I feel that having this coming of age film, depends on his own real life, from him is a phenomenal chance for me. Especially being able to watch it at the cinemas, where movies are supposed to be seen! Seeing frames from his childhood with this amazing cast was indescribably amazing.Michelle Williams, my lover in every movie she acts in, was always sparkling with her amazing acting skills. Paul Dano has gotten better and better from the first movie I've watched of him throughout the years. He's become a real hollywood star for me. And speaking of stars, I feel like saying this, no one but Gabriel LaBelle could have fit into this role more than him. I am perfectly sure he's put so much effort onto this role and all that perfectly paid off. He looks amazing, he sounds, acts amazing! Without a doubt Spielberg felt so proud of him. I hope LaBelle has a bright future in this business and he never stops because I know that he'll be the rising star. I appreciate Spielberg so much for giving this chance to him.The colour grade is remarkable, not the one Spielberg always uses but for this exact film it worked out so well. I'd had a worry that the aspect ratio would be classic wide 2.39 : 1 but when the movie started and I saw 1.85 : 1 was chosen, I was more excited than ever because I'd really wanted to watch this speacial piece of art on a full screen.Long story short, I adore this film. It made me think so much about my life, about his life and everything. Definitely one of my favorite movies at all times. I can't wait to own a poster and of course a bluray copy.That's was it :)",

            "content": "Sammy Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle-teen/adult, Mateo Zoryon Francis-Deford- young) grows up dealing with his anxieties by discovering a love of film that is encouraged by his pianist mother Mitzi (Michelle Williams) while Sammy's father Burt (Paul Dano) sees it more as a hobby. As Sammy goes through childhood, his teenage years, and finally early adulthood, Sammy also must deal with the flaws of his family that leads to the Fabelman family coming apart.The Fabelmans is the latest film from director Steven Spielberg and is based upon the director's childhood. The origins for the film date back to 1999 wherein Spielberg had discussions with his sister Anne Spielberg for the project titled \"I'll Be Home\" but Spielberg put the project on the backburner out of respect for his family as he wasn't comfortable due to the possible responses from his family notably his parents. Spielberg revisited the idea many times notably in 2004 with a discussion with screenwriter and playwright Tony Kushner to whom Spielberg told his life story with Kushner telling Spielberg he'll have to make a movie about it. Following work development began on the film during the filming of Spielberg's 2021 version of West Side Story with Spielberg co-writing the script with Kushner in his first credited screenwriting role since A. I.: Artificial Intelligence. The movie as expected for an award season prestige piece is as expected a celebration of filmmaking and the power of cinema, but it's also a very vulnerable film and easily ranks as one of Spielberg's finest films.Gabriel LaBelle is really strong as Sammy Fabelman and he does a good channeling the passion for filmmaking as well as the emotional turmoil as he struggles with his uneasy family dynamic. Michelle Williams is also very good as Sammy's troubled mother Mitzi who while a loving and encouraging mother also hides a sadness and pain behind her smile that eventually becomes too great to hide. Paul Dano is also very strong as Sammy's father Burt who is a very careful and softspoken man who while appreciative of Sammy's talents tries to encourage Sammy towards more \"practical\" avenues and the contrast and friction between Mitzi and Burt is a key part of where the story's core is and neither parent is \"the bad guy\" as Sammy gets life lessons and practical knowledge from both to make him who he is but that same friction eventually serves to drive the two of them apart. Seth Rogen does well playing an against type role as the Fabelman's family friend Bennie Loewy and while he keeps a lot of his likability and humor from certain performances he's given added depth when his relationship to the Fabelmans is explored further in. Despite the movie having moments of heartbreak and emotional turmoil, the movie also shows the beauty that can come from family, even in the case of very messy ones. Sammy's interactions with his sisters Anne and Reggie when he makes his short films due endear us to the family and make us love them as characters. Aside from the strong writing and emotional resonance of the way in which Spielberg and Kushner tell Spielberg's life story, stylistically speaking the movie is a love letter to cinema and also includes subtle nods that link back to the director's iconic works and you can see the DNA of scenes from Poltergeist, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Goonies, E. T. and even Jaws in the way Spielberg sets up and frames these scenes from his past and you get the sense of where his approach for those films came from in his life.I loved the Fabelmans and this is probably in my \"top 10\" of films of 2022 you owe it to yourself to see. Spielberg and Kushner's script is rich with humor, heartbreak, and hope and the cast all do amazing work in their respective roles. The film is stylistically rich with a love of moviemaking and I wholeheartedly recommend this film not just to fans of Spielberg or moviemaking, but to anyone who wants to see a strong familial drama.",

            "content": "\"The Fabelmans\" is nothing short of Spielberg's magnum opus. It is a masterful film, as one would expect! As well, it is of course deeply personal and intimate at the same time - we really get a chance to get inside Spielberg's head more than ever before. We truly get to see the world through his eyes for once; see the childhood life he lived that inspired the way he would approach so many of the films that we have come to love. But that isn't what really struck me so immensely with this film; while I loved this exploration of his past through his family life, religion, friends and film, I adore this film because it helped me find myself. There were a scarily high amount of moments I was watching and found myself thinking how I would do the same thing, from visualizing shots with toys as a kid, to turning to films to help processing my emotions, to inner conflicts between following dreams of pursuing film or doing what is best for the family or future. Not to say I am some sort of up and coming Spielberg; I for sure am not, but I could identify myself in the character of Sammy (who is essentially the film's version of Spielberg). This film was an incredible experience for me to watch. The film brought me back to how I first fell in love with movies; and I am indebted to it for that. This film spoke to me on a deeper level than any film ever has, it touched my soul.I treasure Steven Spielberg; his work is some of my favourite pieces of cinema I have ever seen. To see him offer us the chance to explore his love of cinema and his own path to finding his way into the movie making business was magical. And this movie is him at his very best; it is much more than just autobiographical. This film is the most vulnerable Spielberg has felt as a storyteller, every shot was very clearly a memory. It is a poignant examination of coping with life's unexpected hurdles through art, even when you don't understand why. It's about how artists cope by creating something to occupy that empty space in themselves. \"The Fabelmans\" should speak to anyone who has ever struggled with their voice, communicating to their parents about what they want to pursue and that their passion is not just a phase. Especially when life changes in ways we can't control, while art is something we direct. Boiled down, it's about the power of movies and how they can change one's life, seen through the lens of a simple family drama. I loved how Spielberg portrayed his parents; the relationship he had with them and their divorce, as it had such a profound impact on his filmmaking, from \"Close Encounters\" to \"ET\" to \"Catch Me if You Can\". Through doing this, Spielberg shows how therapeutic it can be to express and see life expressed in a heightened and crafted way. It is just pure brilliance.Spielberg proves there is no one else like him; cinema would be so much less rich without his vision and style. His storytelling and visual sensibilities are pitch perfect, the choices he makes are objectively the best ways to tell the story he wants to tell. The direction is of course impeccable - you feel the magic of filmmaking through Spielberg's direction, a feeling one rarely gets with cinema these days. Everything, from the staging, cinematography, lighting, production design, costuming, music (John Willams' score, while minimal, is perfect), editing and especially acting is stunning. We don't get movies like this anymore, it is just so rich in every aspect!The acting was very notable in this movie. Spielberg really knows how to cast the perfect actors for a role, and this might just be some of his best casting yet. First off, Michelle Williams and Paul Dano are both incredible in their roles, delivering impressive performances that will be easy award contenders. David Lynch and Judd Hirsch have some awesome, scene stealing cameos that were some of my favourite moments in the film. But the true star is Gabriel LaBelle, who plays Sammy, our young Spielberg. This might just be the best breakout performance I have ever seen from a young actor, and it is certainly one of the best performances of the year! I fully believed him as a young Spielberg, you see his awkwardness, but also how his love of cinema and filmmaking informs his life. Plus he looked exactly like Spielberg himself at that age, and was such a great lead for this film!Ultimately this movie is one that I will love for years to come. This movie gave me the greatest insight into one of the greatest directors alive, as well as to myself as well. If you want to know how I see the world, this movie shows it off exactly. I don't think I've ever connected with a movie more than I did with this one. The movie shows why movies are so important, and it helps that you really feel the magic of film with this one as well! It is a celebration of cinema, of filmmaking, and it gives you an even greater amount of respect and appreciation for Spielberg himself. I loved it, more than I can ever put into words. I love a lot of movies, but I have a different type of love for this movie that is higher than most. This movie touched my soul, it's an ode to the thing I love most in the world; the movies.",

            "content": "Writer-director Steven Spielberg's less-than-veiled autobiographical coming of age story is easily his most personal film and one of his best efforts in recent years. In a production where he faithfully follows the storyline of his own youth where just about the only thing that has been changed is the characters' names, he chronicles the upbringing of an aspiring young auteur (Gabriel LaBelle) who developed a passion for filmmaking when virtually everyone else around him thought he was just aggressively pursuing a hobby. In telling this story, Spielberg touches on the many aspects of life that touched him and influenced his work, such as the support of his concert pianist-turned-reluctant-housewife mother (Michelle Williams) and his onetime-showman Uncle Boris (Judd Hirsch), the impact of antisemitism as the only Jewish kid in the neighborhood, and the strife of marital discord between his mother and father (Paul Dano) and an interloping family best friend (Seth Rogen). It's also one of the best pictures about moviemaking that I've ever seen, rivaling works like Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's \"Day for Night\" (1973). As with many of Spielberg's later films, this one, too, is a tad long in spots and occasionally somewhat episodic. But the polished storytelling and fine performances of the Cast (especially Williams and an all-too-brief appearance by Hirsch) allow this effort to shine as one of the best releases of 2022, as well as a strong contender as movie awards season plays out.",

            "content": "Sometimes, you gotta admire how Spielberg can do films as innovative as Ready Player One, as poignant as Schindler's List, and as quaint as The Fabelmans. Utilizing excessive exposure throughout the movie, the photography evokes a polished sense of nostalgia with the assistance of costume design, environmental layout, and bygone equipment, thereupon establishing a convincing while charming world of the 1950s. In a moderate yet meticulous narrative, the story portrays how a boy's enthusiasm for movie-making develops and interacts with multiple aspects of his life, following a simple chronological order. Observing the child's growing memories with his parents, siblings, playmates, mentors, schoolmates, and first love, it's impossible to not find personal resonance in the heartwarming diegesis. However, upon entering the California segment of the film, there is a point when aesthetic fatigue kicks in, and events not so much connected to the previous storyline start getting displayed just for the director's interest, creating a fissure in the overall plot.Worthy of compliments, the performance is superb, as every single figure is substantially characterized. Mitzi by Michelle Williams, an optimistic, artistic, affectionate, and ideal mother; adventurer is her essence but she's willing to submit herself entirely to family, which to some extent justifies the borderline infidelity. Burt by Paul Dano, a precise, knowledgeable, forbearing, while respectable father; the financial and emotional patron of their family, as well as a rare leader whose decisions are almost always realistically right. Even the smallest of supporting characters earn their independent highlight moments: wise uncle Boris, observant Reggie, genial uncle Bennie, insecure Logan, devoted Monica, and laconic Mr. Ford (played by who-would've-though David Lynch). All are memorable and symbolic characters for both Sammy's life and the movie itself.Altogether, an unusually well-made autobiography, a novel perspective of one of the greatest directors, and an experience worthy of both your laughter and tears.",

While The Fabelmans doesn't reach the levels of any of those films it's still a really great edition to his filmography. On the surface, The Fabelmans can seem weird. \"Why would you make an autobiography about yourself\" is what someone might ask and while \"pretentious\" might be the first thing that comes to your mind, The Fabelmans doesn't feel that way. The film honestly feels more like a Spielberg therapy session than a Spielberg biopic. It feels more like Spielberg coming to terms with who his parents were and why they mean so much to him especially his Dad and how they influenced him into making films. As with most of his films, Spielberg's directing is great and it feels much more personal than it has since probably the late 90s or early 2000s. The cinematography as well is gorgeous at points and the performances are mostly all pretty top notch. Paul Dano, Seth Rogen and Gabriel LaBelle all did a fantastic job here. Michelle Williams was good but her performance was more mixed in my opinion. Sometimes she was really good and sometimes she was just a bit much. John Williams's score was great as well. Nowhere near his best work but still some really good and nice music. I would say that the film doesn't become truly great up until the last 30 minutes. Everything else before that is good but it definitely can feel slow for good portions of the film. Once we get to the High School prom though is when the film becomes great. It has some really great and emotional scenes along with an absolutely hilarious cameo from David Lynch and a really fun final frame. I don't think this is anywhere near Spielberg's best films but it's still a great edition to his filmography and I would definitely recommend checking it out.",

It makes you wonder what his career would have been like if he had fallen in love with a film that has more to offer than a train crash.I really enjoyed this film, but I confess that the deep love for it out there perplexes me. It's a deeply personal film, but not a very deep one. It's quite possible that I was expecting something somewhat different from this film, but it told me a story about young Spielberg discovering his talent at film while dealing with emotional turmoil in his family, but I didn't really feel any of it so much as admire it from a distance.That's not to say that there isn't a lot to like about it. I think Michelle Williams and Paul Dano give really extraordinary performances, investing their characters with more depth than what's on the page. Judd Hirsch and David Lynch has wonderful cameo roles. It's a really beautifully crafted film, and it's nice to see Spielberg step into what feels like fundamentally new territory.I just wish the film felt infused with the kind of love of film it purports to be about.",

The character building was excellent, although this wasn't a autobiopic of his life it's close as we'll get during his lifetime , perhaps the 20 years since his sister first pitched the idea made it possible to finally put it to celluloid ( or possibly digital video ) was the passing of his father at the incredible age of 103.Seeing this on international holocaust Memorial Day made it even more poignant particularly when you see the anti Semitic bullying sam had to suffer .The relationship between mother and son was key , the father played a pivotal role but there are two sides to this family - the artists and the scientists and scientists don't always see the elephant in the room .The story was a coming of age for sam and his sisters as the father moved up the corporate ladder and the family had to up roots and move from state to state accompanied by their 'uncle' the friend of the family , trust was an important theme .With all these moves you as an audience we're let into a secret that only the artists could see the scientists were hindered by their naivety and this the excellent story telling of Spielberg who's rarely made a mistake in his career from the beginning the excellent Duel to the highlight Schindlers List only 1941 stands out as mishap .The story encompasses several moral dilemmas and once again this is great story telling its engaging and provides tension and remedy .I hadn't expected to think so highly of the Fablemans and that's the best way to see a film with low expectations, I never give spoilers or tell the story that's job as the viewer - all I want to do is to let you know if a film is worth seeing .This one isPad.

Then, about 45 minutes in, it grabbed me and it didn't let go. Part of the fascination was the idea of watching a young Steven Spielberg unfold. I really enjoyed seeing his early filmmaking ideas. Though I did wonder whether any seven year old could have that kind of eye for framing, perhaps Spielberg did.Plus, I found his evolving personal and family drama interesting. It made me consider how these events shaped him as an artist. Yet, if this had been based on an average person's family, I would likely have seen it as quirky, but not that engrossing. It only works here because we know how it ends.I do love Spielberg's films but I think that he may be facing a problem that I've seen with some other great directors. At this stage, who in the world is going to say, \"Great work, Steven, but you really should cut half an hour?\" It would be a much better film if he trimmed some scenes from the top.",

Most people might think that was about pictorial composition but I have a slightly different view. I think what Mr. Ford meant about interesting is not just about balancing for pictorial composition. I think he meant to make the \"character\" interesting and in his films, the \"big country\" is not a back drop, it is a character.

In a lot of ways, it feels like Spielberg directly reminiscing on his childhood, and putting it up on the big screen. There's a certain simplicity to it as a result, but it does thankfully make for an engaging movie. Performances are quite strong across the board, the celebration of filmmaking shines through in a number of key scenes, and it's undoubtedly well-made. It has the level of proficiency and visual polish you'd expect from a film made by a director this great, and in its best moments, it's a joy to watch a master of his craft at work.It didn't always work for me, though. I think there are some lines of dialogue here and there that didn't ring true, and a few things about the characters that weren't clear. 150 minutes also feels long for this kind of story, but at the same time, it only felt slightly too long. I think if it had just been 10-15 minutes (or felt 10-15 minutes shorter), I wouldn't have even thought about the runtime while watching it.Still, it's a movie I'd recommend seeing at the movies. It would lose something if you watched it at home, I think, and even if I wouldn't include it among Spielberg's best films, it's a solid late-career film that feels very Spielbergian, and for much of the film's runtime, that's enough.Even as I write this review, I should note I typed \"Spielbergian\" and it didn't put a red squiggly line under it to suggest it's not a real word. You know you've made it as an artist if something can be described as \"surnameian\" (that gets a red squiggle by the way) and the dictionary says, \"Yeah, that's a real word. I'll allow it.\"",

An original story of Steven Spielberg's teenage days with a bit of fiction and drama is all that makes The Fabelmans work for every cinephile who just loves watching movies. A boy who doesn't like watching movies is taken to watch Cecil De Mille's Oscar-winning \"The Greatest Show On Earth\" (1952) by his parents. I have also enjoyed that film, but I always wonder how it won the Oscar. It wasn't that great. But yes, the grandeur was such, just like Demille's standards. Well, the boy is appalled by the climax sequence of the train accident and becomes interested in movies. Not a regular interest, but now he wants to make his own movies. You know, I was thinking, if that not-so-great film (in my opinion) made Sammy (aka Steven) go wow about movies, how'd he react to Demille's greatest epic ever, \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956)? Why didn't Steve put this scene, yaar. Well, then there was Ford's classic with the two greatest stars of all time, John Wayne and James Stewart-\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" (1962). This clicked better than Demille's \"grand circus saga\" for me, as you know how good that film is. Then the story follows Sammy's family issues, school days, Jewish racism, and all that mediocre stuff, but at the same time you love watching that filmmaking within a film. The frames are full of art, and talk about the climax, man. I was shouting at the John Ford scene. \"You wanna meet the latest director ever to live?\" He asks and drops him off in the office. Then the pan captures all those frames of classic movies (I love all of them so much, ohh). Then, the man with an eye mask enters. I was watching the film at home, I screamed, and my mom asked, \"Hey, what happened?\" I was like, \"You won't understand.\" What a freaking amazing scene that was, followed by an artistic taunt with the 'horizon reference\" reframed at the ending frame. The great Steven Spielberg!RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",

In other words, as the NY Times critic, Manohla Dargis, puts it, Steven Spielberg tends to \"soften the edges\" of his youth. And since satisfying drama is largely composed of rigid, as opposed to malleable, edges (i.e, not all conflicts are magically resolved) there is, to mix the metaphor, a too treacly center to this particular cinematic candy bar. And in addition to lugubriousness there is a lack of sharpness and pacing in the writing and direction. Scenes that should arouse one's pity either drag on too long and are repetitive, like the endless whining and breast beating that is meant to express Sam's sense of betrayal when he finds out his mom is having an affair with his dad's best friend, or scenes that fail to launch, such as the one with Sam's sister, whose relationship with her brother is relentlessly unexplored in Spielberg and Tony Kushner's screenplay, suddenly appearing to comfort her brother and, since we do not know her, failing to make much of an impact. And then there is this director's irksome flip side to his softening of the edges, namely overcompensation. This trait gives us the supremely dull spectacle of Judd Hirsch trying to impart gruff, tough, jokey wisdom and succeeding only in boring us to death as well as heavy handed anti semitism that makes Stanley Kramer look like Lubitsch.About the only sequences that came to life for me and struck the proper balance between light and dark, soft and hard, are the ones involving film making. There are three of them. One is where Sam's mom (a too Oscar bait-y Michelle Williams) watches the camping trip film her son made wherein is revealed her infidelity. The other is Sam's film of his high school's senior ditch day wherein he reveals his need to \"soften the edges\". The third and for me most unforgettable is a lesson from The Master (AKA John Ford by way of David Lynch) about horizon lines and movie making and was the only time in this two and a half hour sentimental slog where I cried. But then again that's one more time than I shed tears for \"Love Story\". Give it a B minus.PS...I haven't even gotten around to the giant hole in the screen that is Gabrielle LaBelle. If this bore gets a nomination of any kind, I'll scream. Softly, of course.",

The script was awful; I didn't know what some of the lines meant or even the sentiment they were intended to convey.There are still parts that I don't understand. There were so many loose ends and lingering questions, even at the end of the movie. I understand that, in real life, there might be remaining uncertainties; but why did he decide to give everyone fake names if he wasn't going to slightly alter the events/details for the better of the movie?I suppose Michelle Williams played a complex character interestingly, but Paul Dano seemed kinda creepy, which I don't think was the intention.

A natural filmmaker. Alot of critics favor his contemporaries like Scorsese or Coppola etc like to point out that he makes blockbusters and is less of an artist. I don't think there is a filmmaker that has a better command of the frame than Steven Spielberg....The Fablemans is being billed as a semi-autobiographical film about Spielberg's childhood. It is definitely a love letter to his family for sure. It is also about his love for making cinema of course but it is very much about his relationship with his parents. The film is not called The Spielbergs but anyone who has read or seen a documentary about the director will recognize this is his story. His parents Burt and Mitzi Fablemans are played beautifully by Paul Dano and Michelle Williams Mitzi is a flamboyant artistic, quite out there lady and Burt is portrayed very much as a very intelligent If not very expressive husband and father. Sam(Steven) is played for most of the film by Gabriel LaBelle in a performance that started king's of rocky but ultimately won me over. Sam is taken to the movies by his parents in the beginning of the film and he is completely mesmerizrd. He started making little films starring his 3 sisters and his froends. Burt moves his family to Arizona and the film focuses mostly on that time period. The film does not get too heavy on the family conflict but it does show Sam's parents as 2 people who are growing apart. The film deals with the family moving to California and also with Sam's struggle with being bullied in school for being Jewish. The best Spielberg films are ones that feel like he loved the story he was telling. This film is of course very personal for him. The great thing is that his parents get appt of the attention here. Obviously this is told from Sam's point of view but the film is about his confusion, Ander but ultimately love for his parents. I did think the film would go a little more into his career as a director but I think this is Spielberg's best film in a long time.Grade: A-",

When Steven Spielberg directs you can be sure to get some high class stuff. The movie chronicles his life from the time Sammy Fabelman was a kid infatuated with the magic of moving pictures. Sammy is a member of the wholesome American family and lives with parents and sisters. He first sees action on the big screen in the form of scenes of train crash and this has him hooked to cinema. This is from Cecil B DeMille's movie\" The greatest show on earth\". One is reminded of the old movie \"Cinema paradiso \" and the recent \" Last film show\" which talk of a kid's fascination for the mechanics of moving pictures. His dad tells him the basics of motion pictures explaining the principle of \" persistence of vision\" and gives him an 8mm movie camera to make movies. The movie then moves on to show his troubled life in school as a teenager, the dysfunctional relationship with his mother, the family's turmoil as they relocate from place to place and finally how he enters Hollywood to make pictures.Director Steven Spielberg builds up a fairly absorbing narrative of the growing up years complete with the awkwardness and gawkiness associated. Scenes of\n\" movies within movies\" follow, like portions of \" The man who shot Liberty Valance \", home movies where he analyzes details of the scenes filmed , the prom day shot movie, and the war movie he makes with the help of his friends. Finally all grown up and raring to go, Sammy gets to meet the great director John Ford at his office for a minute who gives him advice on how to frame shots with the horizon either at top or bottom of the frame but never at the centre. Only a true connoisseur of cinematography can say whether Steven followed that advice when he subsequently made movies.",

It's a love letter to cinema, a heartfelt tribute to his parents and family, and is a story of growing up, maturing, and following your dreams; in that sense it's very Spielberg. It's a deeply personal journey we're taken on by the man himself, in effect showing us his own origin story (or 'fable') with no doubt some dramatic embellishments. It is sometimes just a tad sugary and perhaps a rose tinted view of youth, but who would deny him a bit of nostalgia? I'd say this is one of Speilberg's best films, and though perhaps not up to the absolute classics, if like myself you are a lifelong cinema lover, then The Fabelmans should resonate strongly.All round, it's a wonderful film and tremendously well cast, especially the parents, and newcomer Gabriel LaBelle as Sammy Fabelman, and there are many great supporting performances too. Written and directed sensitively, the film is packed with the sort of memorable moments you expect from Mr S, though it is of course essentially a small scale family drama, so it might not satisfy some who want thrills or less intimacy etc. I left the cinema with a spring in my step and on an emotional high, and knew I'd seen something special.",

So what else is there?The family name. Sammy Fabelman personifies the Jewish storyteller, the Jew in Sammy and the narrative conviction of the fable-man. In Spielberg's case, the extremely able fable-man.Indeed, when Sammy's prom-screening converts his school bully into an iconic All-American ideal, the Golden Boy - to the bully's moral confusion and chagrin - Spielberg encapsulates the theme of Neal Gabler's How The Jews Invented Hollywood. The persecuted immigrant Jewish merchants created The American Dream in their projection of an idealized urban America. In defence against antisemitism they imagined an ideal America that just might accept them.It never did, entirely. As with Sammy's Jesus-loving girlfriend, embracing the Jew requires his conversion.The second driving theme is John Ford's lesson on filmmaking: \"When the horizon is at the top, it's interesting. When it's on the bottom, it's interesting. When it's in the middle, it's boring as s---t! Got it? \"\nGot it. But that's as true for life as it is for visual composition. Life demands the extreme, whether the height of passion or the depth of despair. The median blah is a waste of the materials whether of art or of life.Though the one-eyed director spells it out, that passion has already been pronounced by Sammy's mother, Mitzi: \"You know what I miss most about the piano? Surrendering to the score.\" And at greater length by Uncle Boris: \"Family, art. It will tear you in two.... Art will give you crowns in heaven and laurels on Earth, but also, it will tear your heart out. Art is no game! Art is dangerous as a lion's mouth. It'll bite your head off.\"\nAs if to prove that, it's by filming his family's picnic that Sammy discovers his mother's passionate affair with his father's best friend. That is to say, making art opens a reality beyond the artist's awareness and experience. What making art can discover can tear out the heart or bite off the head - or compel further exploration and risk.For Spielberg, that's show-biz.",

He gets born as a filmmaker from that point on.Mom, a creative, melodramatic type, is splintered and addled, too much so for a conventional life; dad is a science nerd, too conventional and un-crazy for his wife.This situation creates complications and disruptions in the family, while Sammy utilizes all that to flesh out his discovery of the power of filmmaking. His mother encourages him, but his traditional square of a father vigorously tries to discourage him, telling his son it isn't viable or realistic.The entire cast, superbly guided and directed by Spielberg, all give memorable, strikingly individual performances and portrayals.There's some disturbing depictions of brutal anti-Semitism that I found very hard to watch; but it was completely necessary.A note about Michelle Williams. While she was highly lauded by a majority of critics, I have seen some rumblings by those who think she's over-the-top and, even, campy. All I can say is that those who have never known a \"nutty, artistic type\" have never truly known a nutty, artistic type. They are wily, highly emotional and unpredictable. Take those traits and put them on women who were stifled by social conventions of the Fifties, and you have quite an explosive package.The star-making portrayal here is Gabriel LaBelle as Sammy Fabelman. He's positively magnetic a performer, nuanced, and skillful at conveying all of the character's drives, passions, and conflicts. Yet he has a great sense of the deeper cosmic humor of life, and LaBelle is absolutely endearing and captivating a screen presence. Not yet 20 when he made this movie, A-list stardom is in the cards for him. The scene with one of his tormentors is just electrifying, shattering almost. The very last scene, which I will not reveal, is just glorious, with a dazzling cameo by a famous someone.The Fabelmans went to streaming almost immediately, it did poor business in the theaters. I've a feeling it will not resonate with straight-laced types, those who Jack Kerouac famously wrote of, \"The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.\"This movie spoke to me.",

Even though I haven't finished his entire catalogue, the ones I've seen thus far have left significant marks on my mind!So to see his life progressively emerge on screen, from his youth to his adolescence, was a sort of epiphany, one that will inspire millions of storytellers and cinephiles alike.This is not only a film about a filmmaker's fight to gain recognition and family support, but it is also about the force of art and how it triumphs over any hurdles or limits. The movie not only teaches us to pursue our hearts' aspirations with tenacity, but also to hang on tight even when the odds are stacked against us!If you truly love something, you must care for it and stick to it. It may tear your heart out, it may adversely impact everything you care about other than your passion, but one day, you will be rewarded, you will be paid back in full for all the sacrifices you made.The medium of cinema will always prevail.P. S. I would not mind if Michelle Williams gets the Oscar, she poured her heart into her role and it won't be an undeserving win, not at all!",

It's a movie loving movie! An mlm! Wait...Anyhow. It is both an inspired and inspiring Spielberg instant classic loosely based on his own life. It is highly cinematic while maintaining its footing in reality.A big congratulations to the 2023 Oscar nominees for The Fabelmans. Each performance was special and memorable in some way or another, but I'm sorely disappointed at the obvious Oscar snub, Paul Dano for Best Supporting Actor, especially considering he was the standout performance. Subtle roles are often overlooked, but considering the schmaltzy nature of the film, the opportunity to finally nominate this inexplicably tremendous actor was staring them in the face...And yet they still didn't cease the opportunity. I'm surprised I didn't see it coming. Hats off to the academy, they're still killing it (joking). The color scheme suits the retro vibe, which is largely in part due to its authenticity from filming with actual film, and the cinematography is spectacular. It wraps up like a gift for the audience and left my heart full. I hoped it would end when it did, not because I was eager for it to be over, but because it was the best possible conclusion for the film. The directing feels very natural when necessary and animated when appropriate. The unnatural elements are likely intentional. It is among the films that wants to remind you that this is a cinematic experience. The score is lovely, especially the theme. The costume design is great and the writing is pretty good for the most part. Truly, it is an undeniably great movie from a technical standpoint and is both a challenging and fun experience overall.I recommend The Fabelmans.***TW (out of context spoilers present): familial turmoil (including a brief instant of domestic violence and adultery, though there is not any sexual content in regards to the latter) and discriminatory violence.",

            "content": "The Fabelmans (2022)The idea of Steven Spielberg directing a biographical movie about Steven Spielberg did sound interesting because of the director's status so I prepared myself to be swayed by the magic of cinema. The film was hyped up to another level by my fellow cinephiles and while I did find it enjoyable, there was one glaring element that might not make it as interesting to the casual moviegoers. See, the key selling point of The Fabelmans is that the protagonist is Spielberg but if someone watches the movie without knowing it, then it is reduced to a rather basic stretched out story of a boy making amateur films.With plenty of warmth and care, Spielberg presents a tale of his teenage years when he first picked up a camera and discovered the passion for the art of filmmaking. It's a joyful film with humor, drama and spirit and yet, it shows how Spielberg's life was completely average without anything extraordinary or dramatic to make it into a gripping story. He had educated parents who loved him, his family was well off financially and he was free to pursue his passion without a care in the world. While there is definitely nothing wrong with growing up this way, it doesn't make for an interesting or inspirational movie.The film does a great job in showing the power of editing which is often taken for granted. Here, it's one of the main reasons why Spielberg's amateur films worked so well while showing how he has always been creating new concepts and bending boundaries of filmmaking that turned him into a legendary director. Ironically, The Fablemans itself suffers from poor editing as it could have easily removed 30 minutes.The Fabelmans is also a story of Steven's parents and the scenes involving them injected some much needed emotion and drama. The movie has a nice grainy filter that creates the cozy feel-good atmosphere and the actor chemistry allowed it to flow despite the excessive runtime. The technical elements of movie making were presented in an easy to understand way without boring the audience with complexities. I was wondering if the film would end in some cliche fashion and thankfully, it had a nice cinema-esque conclusion.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV Show reviews.",

            "content": "In \"The Fabelmans\", Steven Spielberg reminds us why he loves the movies - movies are a powerful art form and impassioned mediums of expression, they blur the lines between reality and fantasy, they speak truths and can be deeply personal, and they stand the test of time. This is a masterful, paradoxical story crafted by one of cinemas most impactful directors about his upbringing as a novice filmmaker in a time when filmmaking, as we know it today, was in its infancy.Spielberg tells his memoir through Sammy Fabelman, and he could have only dreamt about back in the 60s and 70s of capturing his younger years with this level of expertise and technological innovation. The film is not only a lesson about the history of film but an intricate exploration of film techniques and family dynamics.There are many revelations and gutsy, tough themes in \"The Fabelmans\", but none speaks more strongly than that of the capabilities and evolution of film - that cameras often capture and preserve moments that can't be captured, or often go unnoticed, in real life.This is proof that film is magic, a precious time capsule where Spielberg pays homage to the movies. Yet not everything is glossy, as we also get an intimate look at the challenges that come with marriage, parenthood, coming of age, bullying, and antisemitism. Yes, some scenes are emotionally charged, even painful, but others are beautiful and funny, and Spielberg's trademark moments of innocence, wonder, and awe shine through.Top this masterwork with some great performances, especially by Gabriel LaBelle as Sammy and Michelle Williams as his mom, Mitzi, and you have one of the best films of 2022.",

            "content": "My Review-\nThe Fablemans\nMy Rating 10/10The Fablemans begins in the Cinema with an appreciation from Stephen Spielberg its Director co writer and the character that Sammy Fableman is based on.He thanks the audience for coming out to watch his movie on the Cinema screen the way it was meant to be seen.Apparently judging by the World Box Office so far Cinema audiences are staying away in droves.I cannot answer why and only hope that the films recent Golden Globe Awards for Best Picture and Best Director for Steven Spielberg plus the AFI choice as Best Picture of the year will encourage film goers to see this fine movie at the Cinema.If the films critical success is repeated at The Oscars it could mean 2 more Academy Awards to add to Steven Spielberg's three well deserved wins.The Fablemans is a deceptively simple story closely mirroring the actual life experiences of Steven Spielberg's young life growing up in a privileged Jewish home in Phoenix Arizona . It obviously was a labour of love and some pain that Stephen Spielberg and the great Tony Kushner completed during the Covid pandemic and the making of his Oscar nominated West Side Story.Lovers of Cinema and the process of making movies like myself I'm sure will love The Fablemans because it's been made by one of the greatest movie makers of all time.When I say it's deceptively simple I mean that it has no gimmicks and doesn't try to be clever . It's what I love most in movies an interesting story with a fine script plus some great performances and great production values .Young Gabriel LaBelle is so impressive as Sammy Fableman and throughly deserved the praise that Steven Spielberg paid him at The Golden Globes this week.His acting especially in the pivotal scene where Sonny discovers his innocent home movie of a family camping trip reveals much more about his much loved and supportive mother Mitzi than he expected .Another wonderful moment for me is Sammy's reaction to seeing his first movie Cecil B DeMill's The Greatest Show on Earth made in 1952 during a family outing to a local Cinema . The movie is showing to a full house to an audience that's captivated by another great film spectacular movie.It took me back to my childhood when my Dad was a projectionist at Brighton Le Sands when I was the same age as young Sammy.I'm always impressed with Michelle Williams and she excels in The Fablemans cast as Sonny's mother Mitzi Fableman , Mitzi is a talented sensitive woman who gave up a possible career as a concert pianist to marry a pleasant but dull and nerdy computer expert.Michelle Williams captures the affection of a mother who adores her son and family plus the vulnerability and fragility when circumstances occur to change the dynamics of the Fableman's family forever.Paul Dano as Burt Fableman who provides well for his family is also impressive as is Seth Rogan as his best friend Benny .Burt takes a better job and moves his family to California where Sammy sadly discovers Antisemitism and bullying for the first time in his young life.Veteran actor Judd Hirsh as Uncle Boris gives a supporting role worthy of an Oscar nomination when he turns up on the doorstep for his sisters funeral much to Mitzi's horror .He spots the passion and talent of young Sonny and encourages him not to compromise in his quest to make movies .The attention to detail by the Spielberg team captures the 1960's perfectly I noticed even a subtle homage to the past history of movies with a Cinerama movie theatre featured in the background\nCinerama was a widescreen process that originally projected images simultaneously from three synchronized 35mm projectors onto a huge, deeply curved\nI remember The Spanish style Plaza Cinerama theatre in Sydney that now has been gutted and turned into a McDonalds store.John Williams Spielberg's regular composer has created another beautiful musical score for this fine movie.I've seen The Fablemans twice now and will watch it again as it's a film like my favourite film about the love of movies Cinema Paradiso that I get more out of each viewing but please see it at a Cinema before it streams the detail in sets props and costumes is amazing.",

            "content": "Not another coming of age story. Well, this is Steven Spielberg's coming of age story in a sort of semi-autobiographical film, and it is very much worth seeing if you are a hard core cinephile like myself. Spielberg and his co-screenwriter, Tony Kushner, have created a tale that takes young Sammy Fabelman (Spielberg's stand in) from a young kid in New Jersey in the early '50s, though adolescence in Arizona and California as his engineer father moves for work, and along the way, a budding young film-maker is molded. A fateful trip to the movie theater to see DeMille's THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH sparks a love of storytelling and movie making in young Sam, one that only intensifies as he gets older. He makes backyard films as part of a Boy Scout project with his fellow scouts and friends, amateur westerns and war movies where he begins to grasp the both the art of movie making, and the technical skill and knowhow that comes with doing the work. But this is also the story of Sam's relationship with his parents, Burt and Mitzi, and their complicated family dynamic. Burt, played by Paul Dano, is a technocrat, one of the early designers of computer operating systems, while Mitzi, played by Michelle Williams, is a former piano prodigy who gave up a chance for a professional career to be a wife and mother. Though outwardly a successful and happy post-War suburban family, there are tensions which are hinted at in the beginning, but become readily apparent as the story progresses as Sam grows older and the family moves across the country.Some have criticized THE FABELMANS as Spielberg making a love letter to himself, but I would disagree. This film is a love letter to all of us who, early in life, become hooked on the joy of great storytelling, and simply can't get enough. More than that, they want to spread that joy to others, to be considered worthy to be placed in the company of those who brought such happiness to their lives in the first place. It's not a hobby, it's not an infatuation, it's a calling, and a dream that must be pursued. That's who I think Spielberg made this movie for, not for himself. It's also the story that shows the power of the camera to both create an illusion, and to illuminate the truth. The latter is shown when the home movie the teenage Sam is making on a camping trip reveals the relationship between his mother and a close family friend (something Spielberg's parents acknowledged as happening in interviews many years later).The acting is fist rate, especially Williams, who has earned high praise for playing a woman struggling with unhappiness. She's a mother who could be difficult to deal with, yet early on, sees the artistic spark in her son and nurtures it. Dano has the less showy part as Sam's father, but I think he registers just as strongly as Williams, as a husband and father trying to be patient and doing what he believes is right by his family. In his own way, Dano's Burt spurs his son along on his path in life just as much as his mother. It is such a dramatic departure from Dano performance as the Riddler in THE BATMAN earlier this year. And Spielberg has somehow managed to make Seth Rogen not his usual annoying self as Bennie, the family friend who is more than that to Williams' Mitzi. A lot of people have praised Judd Hirsch's turn as Uncle Boris, the family member who ran off and joined the circus. But I found his character to be a clich\u00e9, and the same for Hirsch's animated old man performance, which he has been doing ever since INDEPENDENCE DAY. It's the only thing in the movie that didn't work for me. But Gabriel LaBelle is a real find as Sam Fabelman, this movie works so well because he is so good. LaBelle's scenes with Williams have such poignance because he really conveys Sam's anger and hurt so magnificently. But he is able to pull off that comic scene in his Christian girlfriend's bedroom just as well.There are two scenes that are my favorites. One is when the anti-Semitic high school bully, who has made Sam's life miserable, confronts him in the hall on Prom night after being moved to tears seeing himself in the film Sam made for the class on Ditch Day. It's a real comment on the power of celluloid. The other scene, of course, is the finale, when a college age Sam gets to meet the legendary director, John Ford, in his Hollywood office. It's a reenactment of a story Spielberg has told of an event that happened in real life, and for us Ford fans, it is the perfect Valentine to one of the greatest film makers of all time. I am not so sure that Ford didn't come back from the Hereafter and play himself using David Lynch as an alias. It is my favorite moment in any movie I've seen in years.I do fear that THAT FABELMANS has not found the wider audience that it should have because it just might be a little too inside if you're not a film fanatic. How many casual film goers today know who John Ford is and why he matters? If that is true, then it is truly a loss for many. But for us cinephiles (a fancy name we movie buffs have given ourselves) THE FABELMANS is an acknowledgement from one of our own, telling us how he did it, and to keep the faith in the power of great stories and the joy they give us.",

However, it is captured in such a dramatic way that makes it incredibly endearing to watch. It is so quickly able to go from serious to funny and has moments where you don't know how your supposed to think Plot:0.75/1This is some of the most pristine acting you will see in a motion picture and there really is no weak link throughout the film except perhaps Seth Rogan in his role as Bennie. The MVP of the film must be Michelle Williams for her incredible performance of Mitzi but props must be given to all actors especially the child actors. Acting:1/1This classic story is told so dynamically to the point where a story this classic should not be this entertaining but it is because of Spielberg's ability to put you right in the heart of the story. This lovable but haunting story told through the perceptions of so many makes it such a unique tale and one that it becomes incredibly challenging to find if there really is a bad guy Storytelling:1/1As mentioned previously, there is nothing too terribly creative about the film but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable to watch. However, what makes it creative is the fact that it doesn't need to utilize crazy twists. It just tells the truly heartbreaking tales that come with life Creativity:0.75/5While there is nothing that adds immensely to the film, there is nothing that takes away from the enjoyment of the film. The score is nice, the cinematography is effective, and it created a nice environment. The only issue I have with this is that there were times in which I felt the film didn't truly capture the 1950's aspect the film was based in Other Factors:0.75/1Overall, the Fablemens is a tale that everyone can enjoy and also one that everyone can relate to. It has characters that you can relate to as well as many characters to root for. In a tale about nothing, in a way it is about everything Overall: 4.25/5.",

It is also a noteworthy and timeless message that parents often dismiss their child's passion as unworthy of a career focus as they would understand it. There are numerous technical bits that get washed over and others that are insightful.

            "content": "The Fabelmans is a legacy movie, one that's supposed to cap off a legendary career. While Spielberg is still going strong, it's clear that Fabelmans is intended to cement his legacy with this film. It's semi-autobiographical, young Jewish filmmaker Sammy Fabelman builds on his childhood passion for films as his family's life falls apart around him. The film follows Sammy, his parents and three sisters, through his early childhood up to college, with everything from fun family trips, moving across the country, and his parent's divorce. It's a very heartfelt movie, and most of its scenes have a deeply personal touch to them. Some of the best scenes in this film are the scenes of just them having fun together as a family.The cast and acting are fantastic. The standout performance is that of Michelle Williams. Mitzi, Sammy's mother, is such a lively character, and Williams performs her serious and fun moments excellently. Hers was easily the best in the movie, and quite possibly the best of her career as well. The child actors were good as well. Gabriel LaBelle, teenage Sammy's actor, was also very good for someone new on the scene. Judd Hirsch's extremely limited role was a good one, and he completely steals his one scene. The Fabelmans will also be remembered as probably the last collaboration between Spielberg and the legendary John Williams, the greatest director-composer duo there ever was, and is likely to ever be. The soundtrack is more intimate than most of Williams' music, and feels very much like Satie.There are two things this movie did right as a biopic. The first is that Spielberg does not make his own self-insert this perfect guy. The other, which is tied directly to the first, is that every member of the Fabelman family is treated fairly, himself included. Regarding the first, there isn't much self-indulgence in this movie (although if anyone has earned it, it's Spielberg). Sammy is brilliant at what he does, but he's depicted as no less faulted than anyone else. With the second, there's the way everyone and their actions are looked at not through the eyes of Sammy, but rather through Spielberg himself. The movie doesn't live in the moment of its own time, it looks at it through more mature eyes.And yet, it's not a masterpiece. The Fabelmans is a good film, but it's neither as good as it was expected to be nor as good as it really can be. The main issue with the movie is the pacing, it can't eat everything on its plate, despite the 2 hour, 31 minute runtime. It dedicates way too much time to things that really aren't that important, such as the mini-arc with the high school girlfriend, Monica. Furthermore, a lot of major ideas, like his father viewing moviemaking as a hobby rather than a career, is underdeveloped. It starts out and ends as a movie about an aspiring filmmaker, but then gets lost along the way. It also doesn't help that most of the best scenes in this movie are clustered towards the beginning of the film. The first ten minutes of the movie are practically perfect, but the last third of it really starts to drag. Judd Hirsch's character of Uncle Boris is a great character, but he only has one scene. The movie spends as much time building up his arrival as it does actually having him on the screen. Given the role that this character plays in Sammy's life, it would make sense to give him more screen time. There is definitely enough material to fill that runtime, but it is not used properly.I can't help but compare this to one of last year's contenders, Kenneth Branagh's Belfast. They have quite a lot in common. Both are a semi-autobiographical film by an acclaimed director that focuses on his childhood growing up in a tumultuous time period with difficult family decisions looming over them, and movies are a light in the darkness and the source of his inspiration. They even both have the same shot of the child protagonist staring in awe upon seeing his first movie in the theater. The difference is that Belfast makes better use of its time, doesn't show anything unnecessary, and does all this despite being 50 minutes shorter.This is perhaps an instance where there were unfair expectations for the movie heading in. There was a time before release when people were acting like this movie was a lock for Best Picture. The trailer for the movie is one of the best in recent memory. And it did get glowing reviews from the critics and all the major nominations, and Best Picture at the Globes. Very few movies can live up to standards as high as that. And it is a pity, because if this movie was as good as it could have been, it would no doubt find its place among Spielberg's all-time greats.",

Luckily, this movie beyond my expectation.This movie is about a famz struggle with the coming-of-age theme (adolescence life to adult life). They came from a discriminated socio background because they are Jewish in the US. BUT, they are finally able to manage all the ebbs and flows.RN, the struggle is a really great emotion to us that because of this pandemic impact never ends. Well, the struggle is perfectly delivered in this movie. This gives sentimental value to the audiences and easy to relate.Besides, this movie gives us a warm sensation about famz and year-end vibes (Christmas & New Year's Eve). Pretty odd coz Jewish didn't celebrate this but their neighbors did it in this movie.The story is so inspiring and revealed at a slow pace. It's inspiring coz the main char, young Sam is having an aspiring dream as a movie director inspired by his go-to cinema moments with his parents. It's inevitable truth if our life dream is really constructed since we were a kid.Another pros, a relatable story coz great for delivering bout high school bullying and teenage kinds of stuff that is also an inevitable truth of our life exp.Personally, this movie story is very relatable coz I always hv an aspiring dream since I was a kid and I live with a very noisy famz too. Perhaps, it is similar to this movie.However, this movie's pace is too slow. Sometimes get bored even though it is an amazing moment. It getting worse coz this movie is more than 2 hrs.The bottom line is a very inspiring movie! Perfectly fulfilled our year-end vibes and a Lil bit nostalgic for our teenage stuff. But, sometimes is boring, lol. Great movie to watch! This is a Steven Spielberg semi-auto-biography!8/10.",

            "content": "At one point of their lives everyman, but especially directors, need to go back to their childhood and their teenager's years to trace back the origin of their passion and their art.We were waiting for Spielberg to do so and the Fabelmans is the answer. It's a quite and sincere movie a love letter to his family (was it really like this? What amazing parents did he have?) and to filmmaking.It's a sign of the times that even a top director like him felt the need to thank the audience for going to watch the film in a movie theatre, are we really at the end ? I hope the situation is only one of the many deaths and rebirth of going to watch movies in cinemas.Anyway going back to the film, we all know Spielberg is one of the greatest storyteller of all times so beside showing that he had a great though broken family behind him and what precocious talent he had form the very beginning, he says many important thing about movies.E.g. How do they reveal the true nature of people, how movies influence our lives and our decisions, how hard is to make a good movie, even when you have a lot of talent.I would need the space of an essay to write about this, but being a film student who aspires to become a director one day I just want to quote ( without spoilers) the lesson about the horizon that Ford/Lynch gives to the young Spielberg. You'll have to watch the film (In theatres possibly) till the end to watch it and learn about it , but I believe that when Sam/Stephen goes back and says \"thank you\" to him we know he understood a great lesson and felt for ever grateful because this opened the door to filmmaking paradise.",

It is true that a movie is much more than its plot, and if this film is so pleasant to enjoy, that is because many elements that are reminiscent of the magical side of cinema have been summoned with success. I feel that this works not only with senior audiences (where I include myself) to whom a certain nostalgia of the 60's and 70's is familiar and appealing, but also with young spectators. So, what makes The Fabelmans the great film it indeed is? Apart from the hand of director Steven Spielberg and a fantastic team of actors, the movie shines with the joie de vivre of its characters and with the delicate manner in which it displays some bad moments that life has in store for them. The whole of it is shown under the eyes of childhood and adolescence with its with its burden of illusion and occasional anxieties.The final scene (with the appearance of \"the biggest director of them all\") is a well achieved epilogue, full of humor. The same can be said of the last shot, an epilogue within the epilogue.Finally I must say I also enjoyed the initial address to the audience by Spielberg himself where, appropriately, he did not miss the opportunity to defy spectators to see films in theaters.",

Spielberg\" is in the artistic community as one of the pillars of \"Hollywood\", which some do not know what the industry will become when this man stops making films.Spielberg\", who introduced himself to the cinematic audience as one of the creators of science fiction with the war of the worlds, creatures that come from space, strange phenomena and predatory jaws, the historian who goes back in time and lists important facts that add to cinematic drama great artistic treasures, and the poet on the roads of \"New York City\" narrates. A love story that takes place amidst a struggle over the power and sovereignty of the street.A great passion that did not come from a vacuum or from a mere study of cinema concepts so that it would be a profession of earning a livelihood and living only. There is certainly some motive in the life of \"Spielberg\" that made him in love with cinema. For the imagination and accurately drawing the place, and in the general atmosphere epic, romantic, dramatic and everything that might come to the mind of the lover of the cinema of that iconic veteran.That is why the movie The Fabelmans comes as the first work of \"Steven Spielberg\", through which he tells how it all began, and the temporal, spatial and social stages that greatly affected his personality and his artistic outlook that was not a coincidence or mature after the passage of a lot of time and not from the first moment, a melodrama Full of ambition, striving, grief, passion, and realism that may touch the adolescents who are always thirsty to form their own personalities, as is the case with the hero who grew up and reached what he is thanks to that strong connection to cinema.The Fabelmans movie review\nIn conclusion, The Fabelmans deserves to be referred to as the work that will win the Oscar for the best film of the year long before the award season, because the film is a tribute to cinema and to everyone who loves the seventh art working in it or from the audience, and a human drama at the same time abundant with feelings and elaborate in all its aspects.

            "content": "The story travels from 1952 to 1966 in New York, Arizona, and California. The film is a coming-of-age story of a young Jewish boy who is captured by motion pictures as a way to release his creative energies.Burt Fabelman (Paul Dano) is a lives-in-his-head electrical engineer working for companies like RCA and General Electric on the cutting edge of the computer age. His wife, Mitzi (Michelle Williams), was a former classical pianist who is the artistic yin to Burt's scientific yang. They have four children: Sammy (Mateo Zoryon Francis-DeFord/Gabriel LaBelle), Reggie (Birdie Borria/Julia Butters), Natalie (Alina Brace/Keeley Karsten), and Lisa (Sophia Kopera). In addition, Burt's \"best friend,\" Benny Loewy (Seth Rogen), is a constant presence in the family.Sammy is an undersized, fearful child. The first movie he sees is traumatic, but the family's movie camera his interest in creating a reality separate from his real life. The film follows Sammy's growing passion for filmmaking against growing internal tensions in the family. The difficulties in Sammy's life escalate when the family moves to California just before his senior year in high school. By the end, Sammy finally receives his father's muted \"blessing\" for his passion.As one would expect, the film's story is both told and filmed exceptionally well. In addition, humor reduces the bite of the more complicated conflicts. Francis DeFord and Gabriel LaBelle are excellent as Sammy. The movie's most effective scene for me was Mitzi's face as she watches a short film that Sammy made only for her.The problem for me was how much this is seen as a biopic of Steven Spielberg. Spielberg movies always contain spectacle, which leads to the question of what is \"truth\" in any Spielberg movie. I suspect this movie is only partially authentic but very entertaining.",

            "content": "There's an excitement I get going in a Spielberg movie that I just don't get with other directors. I can't quite put my finger on the specific reason, other than that he captures the magic of cinema in a way that nobody else can replicate. The Fabelmans is no exception. This film just feels special.It recreates the formative years of Spielberg himself through the fictional Fabelman family. Young Sammy Fabelman (a version of Spielberg played brilliantly by Gabriel LaBelle) develops a love of film and tries to pursue his passion whilst in the midst of family drama, the usual headaches that accompany teen life, as well as more insidious anti-semitic behaviour.Broadly it is a coming of age story, but it is also a love letter to the art of cinema and a reflection on family.It is packed full of story. Packed full of character. Packed full of feeling and love and care. I don't think it is technically or narratively Spielberg's best, but it is his most personal film and you can feel this in every frame. You can tell his soul was poured into it and it is all the better for it.As mentioned the performance from LaBelle as Sammy (Spielberg) is top notch. Such a daunting role that he handles with ease. Michelle Williams steals the show as Sammy's troubled mother, and Paul Dano once again proves that he is one of the best working today. I must admit Seth Rogen felt a little out of place in the film but this wasn't too distracting.The themes of the film are all explored perfectly, with a spot on balance of humour, charm, impact and emotion. The direction is fantastic. The score beautiful. What more is there to say?If you are a fan of Spielberg, a fan of cinema, a fan of great performances, a fan of technical finesse, then The Fabelmans will satiate you and more. A marvellous film.",

I wasn't able to get any empathy for any of the characters, it just feels like a long drama movie I couldn't wait to be over.The acting is all right but many parts feels like over the top and messy not sure if that was the goal but it just feels unnatural, plus the most ridiculous thing of all, how on Earth regardless how good he was, does Judd Hirsch get an Oscar nomination for less than 5 minutes of screen time, is this really necessary? Feels like the Academy is including Spielberg's movies for the sake of tradition, nothing in the movie is Oscar worthy..Maybe I'm being too harsh but that's my honest feeling of this movies, a really average flick that happens to have good actors and a house hold name director...",

It's a problem shared with Branagh's Belfast and the French film Mr Bojangles. The film doesn't earn its climaxes as we are not invested in the character's journies, trials and travails. Spielberg and Kushner (who have both made terrific works in the past) here rely on over-used stereotypes (Brisket, anyone?, High school jocks and nerds) that deliver little payoff. What, ultimately, is the lesson learned from the bullet-headed uncle sleeping Shiva? It doesn't seem to impact the character of our hero at all. And everything takes so long (dancing in the firelight on the camping trip, viewing and reviewing the film of the 'hidden' moments of the camping trip etc). The actors are working hard because they are in a big, personal film by Spielber. It doesn't pay off. Michelle Williams seems to be channeling Shirley McLean, Judd Hirsh is doing his best Mel Brooks (if only!), Paul Dano has only been given one note to play by Spielberg and Kushner. The film is way too long, has no energy and wouldn't inspire anyone to take up film-making or any other creative pursuit. It may be based on Mr Spielberg's life, but perhaps he should have left it to someone else to make the movie version. Dull, dull, dull.",

Young Sammy watches with big eyes how the train and carts rumble of the track and the car goes high in the air. After having a nightmare Sammy knows what he wants for Hanukkah, he wants a model train set. A feature that is a dedication to Steven Spielbergs childhood growing up as a young man that falls in love with the art. It is also a feature with a bit of sadness aswell. A father that cant see the signals in front of him how his beloved wife slowly drifts away from him. It is a familiar feeling im met with like in most Spielberg films. Im rather cotent being here, most of the puzzle boxes are there. It would be easy to call it Spielberg on autopilot, but with statement i must add that reaching this level of craftmanship and say its auto pilot its only fair to compliment the man. There arent to many flaws here is what im saying. Young Gabriel LaBelle is great as is Dano and Williams. I guess the problem for me is to put into words that this is a pretty good feature.

All the leads are simply superb - not a surprise regarding Michelle Williams - I've seen her in so many role- never a bad one. But Paul Dano, whom I've seen in a few roles is simply breathtaking here; Judd Hirsch has such a tiny role, and still manages to work wonders performing it; and I could go on and on - I can't think of a role that wasn't splendidly written and excellently performed.I also loved Spielberg's sense of balance, which I usually don't in his real-life stories. He doesn't ever go overboard. His characters ring true even when they're over-reacting or going haywire. They actually feel more human when they do. And the same sense of balance is true of the story itself.Technically. I could never fault Spielberg, he's definitely a master of his trade, and always was. So, what's my problem with this movie, why didn't I rate it a perfect 10? - Here goes my title - It's not the first time I've seen great directors doing the story of their own biography in film. More often than not the end result is packed to the brim with details, tiny stories that draw a complex picture, a very complex, elaborate and meandering plotline that at the bottom line diminishes the impact of a would-be great film. The personal attachment to the life story we see stops even some of the best directors from cutting out scenes they should. This movie should've been at least 20 minutes shorter. It would've been a perfect 10 then, at least in my personal book.",

And while you'd think that the premise of this film would mean that the meat of the film is one in which Spielberg depicts himself in coping with the trauma of his parents's marriage falling apart by submersing himself in filmmaking, that aspect of the story is merely the tool by which Sam discovers it. The rest of the movie then puts its focus toward Sam's struggle to see his parents as three dimensional, deeply flawed humans, coming to forgive his mother and understand her mistakes, to understand his father as an emotional being (as opposed to the intellectual robot he'd grown up with), and also in Sam's experience being the only Jewish kid in an American high school in the 60s, with the filmmaking angle being less a focal point of the plot, and simply how Sam attempts to understand his place in all of these events.A lot of the material here works tremendously well, it's very funny, and the family drama contains emotionally satisfying arcs, however, there's also an arc in which Sam reconciles with his high school bully, a plotline that doesn't begin until there's only 40 minutes left in the movie, which isn't given enough time to breathe before resolving, and the resolution comes so late in the film that there isn't enough time to dedicate towards making it as emotionally compelling as the rest of the drama. Also, none of it really comes together with much to say outside of Spielberg's apparent desire to help audiences understand the angle to which he's approached almost all of his films, and to that effect, yeah, it does make many of his other films make more sense to me, I just wish that the film itself had more it say outside of how it impacts the way you might read Spielberg's other films.",

While the camera angles are impressive, the overall execution of the movie falls short and comes across as boring and silly.In the film, Spielberg spends a considerable amount of time delving into his personal history, recounting the challenges he faced while growing up and in his career.

It's as if Spielberg is working through his own personal demons on the big screen, leaving little room for viewers to connect with the story or find something that resonates with them.Overall, while the film may be interesting for diehard Spielberg fans or those interested in his personal life, it may not be the best source of inspiration for those looking to learn from his successes and apply them to their own lives.It seems as though the director, Stephen, wanted to create a film that portrays him as similar to the main character, likely to boost his public image. Unfortunately, the dialogue is poorly written and some of the acting is wooden and over-the-top, making it even more frustrating to watch. Overall, this movie is a disappointing and exasperating experience that I wouldn't recommend.",

If you want good vintage Spielberg check out 1941, always, war of the worlds, Jurassic park 3, jaws 2, war horse, showgirls or swept away or any one of his early greats. His new stuff is self indulgent tripe and the box office numbers prove it.Please retire.",

            "content": "Ever since missing it at the Festival Lumi\u00e8re last year, I just couldn't wait to see it in the cinemas, and oh boy did it deliver. The movie is semi-autobiographical, and based on Spielberg's own life. You meet Sam Fabelman as he first watches Cecil B. DeMille's The Greatest Show on Earth, and falls in love with movies. While his dad is very much down to Earth and fails to see that Sam's \"hobby\" is much more than this, his mom Mitzi lets him live his passion, letting him borrow cameras, and helping him fulfil what she understands as his destiny. If you do not already love movies, this is the movie to watch, as it lets you see how movies are made and edited. But most of all you follow a young man, falling in love with cinema in all its glory, helping want-to-be actors be their best selves, in front of a camera. This story is also about family, its complexity, its deterioration, and how someone can love others in very different ways. Though the story is very hard at some points, with antisemitism and violence, this is not what you get out of the movie with. To me, this is a love letter to cinema, and to an extent, to family. I had a smile on my face for most of the movie, and I thoroughly enjoyed all the aspects of filmmaking that were shown. Add to this great actors that were well chosen, a director like Spielberg, and you are sure to enjoy yourself. I also loved seeing a few scenes reminding me of other Spielberg movies, like Super 8 right at the beginning. This for sure is a movie that I will watch again.",

            "review_title": "What Dreams Are Made Of",
            "content": "First Impressions:\nThe movie was not only written and directed by the incomparable Steven Spielberg, but was also based on his own childhood memories and moments. This, more than anything else, made \"The Fabelmans\" a semi-biopic treat for movie lovers across the world.It was deep, emotional, meaningful, and fascinating in ways that must be seen to be appreciated. I felt glad to write this review the day after Steven Spielberg's 76th birthday.The Crew:\nAs writer and director, Steven Spielberg did an excellent job capturing nuanced human moments in meaningful settings.Tony Kushner also worked on screenplay and did a splendid job scripting this filmmaking masterpiece.John Williams' musical scoring was the chocolate sauce on this cake.Janusz Kaminski's cinematography was faultless.Remarkable work on production design, art direction, and set decoration.Editing and sound effects were praiseworthy.VFX, hair-makeup, and stunts all did great work.Mark Bridges' costume design was exemplary.The Cast:\nGabriel LaBelle as young Sammy Fabelman was a revelation.His even younger version was played quite well by Mateo Zoryan.Paul Dano as Burt Fabelman was superb.Michelle Williams as Mitzi Fabelman was outstanding.Seth Rogen as Bennie Loewy was great.Judd Hirsch as Uncle Boris was noteworthy.Keeley Karsten as young Natalie Fabelman was memorable.Her even younger version was played quite well by Alina Brace.Julia Butters as young Reggie Fabelman was amazing.Her even younger version was played by Birdie Borria, who was great.Sam Rechner as Logan Hall was quite good.Oakes Fegley as Chad Thomas was notable.Chloe East as Monica Sherwood was memorable.David Lynch as John Ford was captivating.Plot Summary & Analysis:\nThis was not a full-fledged biopic, so stay at ease when you go through several dramatized sequences. In fact, just watch it as you would a typical movie. That said, some of the memories written into the script were loosely based on Steven Spielberg's early days growing up in Arizona in the aftermath of WWII, and then later in California where his filmmaking dreams truly picked up.Playing his younger version was Gabriel LaBelle in the fictional role of Sammy Fabelman. Gabriel's performance was every bit as enthralling and memorable as expected. He wonderfully captured Spielberg's early passion and penchant for filmmaking.In keeping with Spielberg's own beliefs, the movie didn't shy from emphasizing the wonder and awe of the traditional cinema theatre experience. It was a tad ironic that I streamed this movie on my computer, but you get the picture (pun unintended).Spielberg's Jewish heritage and upbringing were also given due attention. This was one of the most essential elements in \"The Fabelmans\", and added to the man's storied legacy. I also liked how boldly Spielberg covered anti-Semitism (hatred for Jews) in this project. That's never an easy subject to tackle, not even a good day, let alone in a movie based loosely on the man's own past.Through some of the scenes contained in this movie, the team paid homage to Spielberg's rich filmography. These nostalgic throwbacks and references made me recall brilliant productions like \"War of the Worlds\" (2005), \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" (1989), \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981), \"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" (2008), \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" (1977), \"Poltergeist\" (1982), \"Hook\" (1991), \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), and of course \"E. T.\" (1982).You'll have to spot the references for yourself, because otherwise I'd have to detail every scene in which they appeared, and we'll be here all day and the better part of the night if I do.On a special note, all the scenes featuring Uncle Boris (played by Judd Hirsch) were a lesson in acting and line delivery. He brought his own distinct meaning to the movie. As for Michelle Williams, she gave a powerhouse performance as Mitzi Fabelman - her acting shook me to the core. Burt Fabelman (Paul Dano) gave an under-rated performance in this project.Final Notes:\nEssentially a coming-of-age story, \"The Fabelmans\" conveyed nostalgia and motivation in equal measure. Regardless of your age, your will appreciate everything that Steven Spielberg did with this production.The movie captured his early days as an impassioned filmmaker, right from his childhood and well into his teens. Throwbacks to some of his best work in cinema further enriched this project and gave it an almost autobiographical aura.If you love movies and entertainment in general, or if you happen to be a budding filmmaker, \"The Fabelmans\" will call to the artist within you.",

            "content": "The Fabelmans is a touching and mesmerizing film that celebrates the acclaimed director Steven Spielberg while recounting his origins as a filmmaker. The film is absolutely emotional; it's mainly about family and deals with the vicissitudes of family interaction while paying homage to cinema.As a kid, Sam Fabelman learns an important lesson from his father, one of the basic principles of filmmaking: retinal persistence. Like magic, films are a simple succession of still images which gives the illusion of movement. When Sammy attends his first movie projection the event turns into a life changing experience. The story follows his life while he discovers his passion for movie making supported by his family: his dad Burt (Paul Dano), his mother Mitzi (Michelle Williams), his 3 sisters, and his uncle Ben (Seth Rogen). His father is an electrical engineer, his mother a concept piano player and the fusion of technicality with art certainly shaped his craft. The family's dynamic was beautiful yet cloudy at times; a source material turned in melodrama, perfect for great storytelling.I love the humanity that The Fabelmans displays. And I loved the way the film showed and captured Sam's life overall, in the sense that it didn't just feel like you were watching a story. As the audience I could really understand and feel the emotions Sam was feeling. The core of the storyline are the characters and the relationships between them. Despite the Fabelmans are not a perfect family, they stand out in their unity and the bond between them. The relationship between Sam and his mom, masterfully performed by Michelle Williams, is mesmerizing to watch. There's a complicity that it is put to the test, generating wonderful conflict. Williams scenes are like study material for an actor. But every cast member is great at its craft in this film. The camera moves fluidly from the family dinners, to the action scenes contained in Sam's early films through the corners of the houses where the family moved and the places that hide the deepest family secrets. Janusz Kaminski's photography resembles the era and has the perfect warmth, and the score of John Williams stays in our hearts. The Fabelmans deserves a nomination on each major category in the upcoming Academy Awards: Best Film, Best Original Script, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Score and Williams and Dana most probably will nod Best Actress and Best supporting actor respectively.My favorite scenes are Sam experimenting and reproducing the train crash he watched in his first movie experience and Mitzi watching herself in his son family movie. My favorite quote: \"Guilt is a waste of an emotion\" which I consider profoundly meaningful of what this movie is telling its audience. The message of the film is to be able to find balance in adversity. Families are not perfect, but true bond should prevail.The Fabelmans is PG 13 due to mature thematic elements and brief violence and drug use.I give The Fabelmans 5 out of 5 starts and recommended for audiences 12 to 18 and adults. The Fabelmans opens in theaters November 23, 2022. By Zoe C., KIDS FIRST.",

            "content": "As Radio Days is to Woody Allen and Fanny and Alexander is to Ingmar Bergman, so is The Fabelmans to Steven Spielberg. It includes a sentimental look back on his early passion for making amateur movies, staring with his first film crashing a train set and ending with his meeting with John Ford, events which served as bookends in his development here. The film also includes what I imagine was a cathartic release of the difficulties he went through with his parents' relationship (discovering infidelity, moving because of it, and then seeing them divorce), and the bullying rooted in anti-Semitism he faced in high school. Seeing his origin story from his perspective always held my interest, and there is a level of vulnerability on display here which I appreciated.I can't say I truly loved the film, however. I don't doubt that these events happened in his life, but the way many of them are portrayed had a sheen of glossiness which took away from the sense of realism. Not all of them, mind you - that scene with John Ford felt very authentic, and was wonderful. But too often the rest of it seemed carefully packaged, slipped too easily into being maudlin, and had characters speaking in ways that didn't seem real. In Spielberg's mind this is probably how he sees these people from his early life and it's certainly deeply personal to him, but it may have been a better film had it been written and made by someone else.",

It was beautiful watching how proud their parents were of their genius.It's hard to deny Spielberg's talent as a filmmaker. Despite not being my usual taste, his films are masterfully made. The film showcases his early days as a young filmmaker, solving problems with limited resources and his genius is on full display.Paul Dano usually delivers over-the-top and unrealistic performances, but he is outstanding in The Fabelmans as the innocent and laid-back father. Michelle Williams was also impressive as the mother, and the film presents a complex and intimate family drama that explores tough moral dilemmas.Overall, the film is a personal and beautifully told story, filled with moments that will resonate with audiences.

The direction is calm, contained, with simple plans and great shots, always looking for the emotional side of its characters, the soundtrack is fantastic, the photography changes according to the location of the characters and the pace is good. One of the highlights is the acting, all the characters are fantastic, but Michelle Willians is impeccable, playing an anguished character full of sentimental contraventions, and the actress manages to express all sides of that feeling. 8/10.",

            "content": "\"The Fabelmans\" is a coming-of-age drama film directed and co-written by Steven Spielberg. Starring Paul Dano, Michelle Williams, Seth Rogen, and newcomer Gabriel LaBelle, it encapsulates everything a film enthusiast should love about the art form with an affectionate examination of all it is capable of.In 1952 in New Jersey, Jewish parents Burt (Paul Dano) and Mitzi (Michelle Williams) take their young son Sammy (Mateo Zoryon Francis-DeFord) to his very first screening of a movie: \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" by Cecil B. DeMille. Sammy becomes enamoured by an epic train crash scene that occurs during the film's climax and decides to ask for his own toy train set for Hanukkah. Shortly after receiving his gift, Sammy crashes the trains in an attempt to recreate what he saw onscreen, much to the annoyance of both his parents. Realising her son's true motives, Mitzi allows Sammy to film another train crash with Burt's home video camera, setting the stage for his passion for filming things with his family and friends. Years later in Arizona, a now-teenaged Sammy (Gabriel LaBelle) continues to film his own movies with his Boy Scout troop, but various family issues and other matters begin to slowly threaten his love of filmmaking.Anybody who knows me best should be aware that I absolutely love movies. I love watching movies, reading about movies, and discussing movies with anybody willing to hear me out. There's just something fascinating about the way this visual art form can take us out of reality for such a long period of time and invite us to view things from the perspective of whoever is behind the camera. But if there's anything I love equally as much as watching a film, it's watching a film about the process of filmmaking. Steven Spielberg's \"The Fabelmans\" not only shows us everything the veteran director loves about his craft, but it also reminds us of why film is such an important medium in the first place.As a semi-autobiographical take on his own venture into the profession, Spielberg uses every opportunity to show us all the ups-and-downs of what one can expect to go through when following the dream of becoming a filmmaker. This is accomplished through the character of Sammy, who essentially functions as Spielberg's self-insert. From falling in love with the way a film can draw us into its story to eventually picking up a camera to film his own home movies, Sammy discovers that his journey won't be as streamlined as he may have imagined, but in the process he learns so much about the art and his own life. The parallels drawn between film and reality are so well done here that the movie can strike a chord with virtually anybody who has been emotionally affected by a film, no matter which one that might be. Instead of a self-indulgent vanity piece, this film as a whole is actually a beautifully told tale of how deep a renowned filmmaker's adoration for movies can run.Pretty much everybody knows who Steven Spielberg is and is familiar with at least one of the movies he has directed, so it should come as no surprise that this is a story being told by someone who fully understands the creative process. We see Spielberg's enthusiasm brimming throughout every frame, whether it's Sammy's life-altering experience of first visiting the cinema or showing his own completed film to his fellow Boy Scouts. Every emotional note is hit perfectly, to the point where even the most casual viewer can understand where Spielberg is coming from. There is so much to appreciate in the way Spielberg is able to convey each of these moments to showcase how a film can leave such a profound impact on the lives of both a creator and an audience. As a result, we immediately understand his own affinity for filmmaking, which in turn could encourage others out there to follow suit to make his or her own movies. Only one other film made me feel the same amount of joy this one did and that would be 1988's \"Cinema Paradiso\", one of my all-time favourites. Both are told from the perspectives of a young man whose admiration for film extends throughout most of his life. Whether Spielberg intended for his audience to draw that comparison is unknown at this time, but it is a huge compliment coming from me.In his first leading role, relative newcomer Gabriel LaBelle demonstrates that he has what it takes to carry a film of such a level of importance. Each aspect of Sammy's dedication to film is brought to life at various points thanks to LaBelle's masterful interactions with the rest of his fellow cast members. We watch as Sammy's vision for his craft is shaped and influenced by all those around him in both positive and negative ways. For example, when he and his family relocate to a different state, Sammy soon realises that not everybody is going to be as accommodating to his artistic perspective. Because of that, he must now find alternative ways to remain true to his vision while also seeking how to validate himself as an independent creator. This of course mirrors the way life often throws obstacles in our path to test how determined we really are towards following our own passions.Both Michelle Williams and Paul Dano also gave great performances as Sammy's parents Mitzi and Burt. Mitzi is shown to have a number of personal insecurities holding her back from what she loves doing, but tries not to let them get in the way of allowing her son to succeed in the world of film. Williams plays into Mitsi's vulnerability so well that even when she does something questionable, you don't feel the need to hold it against her right away. I consider this to be one of Williams's best roles to date as it demonstrates the impressive emotional range she has as an actress. Likewise, Dano portrays Burt as a loving father who goes to great lengths to nurture his son's talents as an aspiring filmmaker. Although Burt doesn't share Sammy's enthusiasm for what he does, he nonetheless understands why it is so important to him, even if it means working extra hard to pay for the necessary amenities.Though his role is brief, I think Seth Rogen is worth a mention as well in the role of Bennie, a family friend who acts as a surrogate uncle for Sammy. I was impressed at how Rogen was able to play a character that is both an amusing friend but also an intelligent voice of reason. In fact, if it weren't for Bennie, I don't think the film would have worked anywhere near as well as it did. This is a notable change from the usual type of roles Rogen likes to play, which often takes the form of a crude stoner spouting one-liners. Rogen has definitely shown he has the acting chops to continue playing characters like this, something I hope he will take into consideration for future films.For the avid cinephile, \"The Fabelmans\" has practically everything you could ever ask for in a loving tribute to this wonderful art form. Thanks to Steven Spielberg, we are able to gain a better understanding of why film goes beyond mere entertainment and how it has the potential to touch all of our lives in more ways than we can imagine. Even if you aren't a devoted fan of cinema as a whole, there are still plenty of other things to appreciate about what it can offer us all. No matter how old I may grow, I will always love movies and ones like this will help cement that in my mind for the rest of time.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",

I am not sure I have seen this good of a movie since at least before the pandemic and it is certainly one of the best movies of the last ten years at least. Even after 2 and a half hours I still wanted more. This movie pulls you in and it is impossible to look away. Michelle Williams & Paul Dano should take away their long overdue Oscars for this film and newcomer Gabriel LaBelle was tremendous playing the role of Sammy Fabelman. Supporting roles from Seth Rogen and Judd Hirsch were also a very fun addition. This movie delivers all the emotions a film possibly can, and it will undoubtedly leave you with a smile on your face when the credits begin to roll. Steven Spielberg should be a lock for Best Director. He most definitely deserves it. This is the best film of 2022 and I hope the Academy will agree. The Fabelmans is just movie magic. 10/10 A+ Absolutely Recommend.",

So it's no surprise that what's essentially his autobiographical film would be great and hold its own with his classics.Almost all the things you can get right in a film are present in this one. The cinematography is phenomenal (shocking, I know), John Williams gave us another fantastic score (again, shocking), and despite what others may say the acting and casting is amazing. There's not a single weak performance to be found here.The story may seem like it doesn't have a purpose but as long as we slap the good ol' \"slice of life\" label on this movie it's completely justified. The family conflicts feel real relatable despite that fact that most people watching this movie aren't filmmakers.There's only one problem that I have with this movie and that is pacing. I feel like a lot of the time spent on the family could've and should've been spent on Sam and his films.Tl;dr: Good acting, good cinematography, good score, bad pacing.",

The story is about young Sammy Fabelman who falls in love with filmmaking after his parents take him to see a motion picture for the first time, then he started making a movie with the camera his parents gave him.It's a coming-of-age movie based on the director's childhood growing up in the post-World War II era. Since I started watching movies, I find it very hard to say who's the best if not the greatest movie director (in my humble opinion of course) because they have different directing styles, etc. But when I watch Spielberg's movies, he instantly became my favorite director, because most of his movies emphasize the story on the characters and their family. He's such a great storyteller.The Fabelmans give you a good laugh, joy, motivation, and tears throughout the movie at the same time. With a 2 hour and 31 minutes runtime, this movie has a perfect pace to make the audience stay connected to the story of a struggle and conflict both internal and external of young Sammy (or Spielberg) experienced growing up while he pursued his dream of becoming a filmmaker.I don't even know what to say about the actors, all of them gave an almost-perfect performance. Gabriel LaBelle as Sammy, and both Michelle Williams and Paul Dano as basically Spielberg's parents, Seth Rogen as Bennie. And even Judd Hirsch as Uncle Boris who only appears for a short time.The Production is beautiful, with a great score by John Williams and also excellent cinematography by Janusz Kaminski, especially the final shot. It's a perfect shot that gave a glorious vibe to the character. I strongly hope this movie won't get snubbed at the Academy Awards.The Fabelmans is perhaps Steven Spielberg's most personal movie based on his childhood, and it's a love letter to his family and also his fond for cinema.",

It starts with the character, named Sam Fabelmans, being taken to see his first movie in a movie theater. The year is 1952 and the movie he sees is \"The Greatest Show on Earth\".His parents are played by Paul Dano and Michelle Williams and they both give great performances. Seth Rogan is also very good. And David Lynch is amusing in a small part as the director John Ford.The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is excellent as usual. The score by John Williams is also good.

            "content": "Spielberg's autobiographical love letter to the film industry seems like a mixed bag for a long stretch but there are early signs of promise that eventually come to fruition. It ultimately blooms into something truly wholesome and in keeping with the director's trademark soulfulness. It's the story of a boy growing up in the early 1950s whose passion for film drives his ambitions. His dreams get inconsistent support from his engineer father (Paul Dano) but wholehearted encouragement from his more artistic mother (Michelle Williams). It's a depiction of the germinating early stages of one's life goals and the minefield that is a challenging family.Watching the account of the director's childhood is a lot like watching a child grow up. In the early going, it's full of vexations and is sometimes exhausting but as the story develops and the protagonist's life direction starts to crystallize, we too become fixated. The film begins to take off when Judd Hirsch infuses the narrative with brio. He's the one who eloquently dares the boy to challenge himself and reach for the stars. From that point on, the vitality builds to the point where we get to the young man's high school years in which his gumption and true skill as a filmmaker get honed and tested. In the end, it leads to a truly inspired conclusion.Dano and Williams are quite good as the boy's parents. Seth Rogen is creatively deployed as the boy's father's best friend. Without giving away too much, it's a good idea to go in mostly cold. You don't have to know Spielberg's personal story to get invested in this. A film that makes one overlook or discount its manifest flaws in the beginning is a hard-earned achievement and Spielberg earns his way back to the top with this one. Strongly recommended.",

            "review_title": "A real love letter for film as an art form",
            "content": "Once again Steven Spielberg, director and co-writer, knocks it out of the park with this movie. This movie is a love letter to cinema and all of those who love this art form. This is best shown with the story for this movie but specifically on the surface level. On the surface level, this movie is about a young boy who has a dream but some of his family members consider it a hobby. Lots of people will see themselves in Sammy and relate to him due to this aspiration he has. How so many people want to work in the movie industry but there are those who say it's not a stable career option or that it's just a hobby. That's what makes this movie so incredible to watch is how relatable it is. You connect with the characters in this movie and want to keep watching to see what's going to happen next. This especially connects well when you look at the movie in a deeper way. When you look past everything on the surface level this story is about a family wanting to be there for each other and how film can capture that. Some of the earliest movies people make are family home videos and that's exactly what this movie feels like. You follow this family through different experiences and moments in their lives and how it changes and affects them. You feel like a fly on the wall throughout the entire movie. This brings me to what I loved the most about this movie which is the emotion it has in it. The movie brings you on a wild roller coaster and from beginning to end you're hooked. One second you're laughing and the next you're starting to tear up which I actually did while watching. But again, that just shows how powerful film is and what this whole movie is about is how it can move and affect you.To tie this all together with what I originally said, this movie's story is really for those who love this art form but even for those who don't. The story does an excellent job of explaining certain things for those who might not be as well educated in the way of film but more specifically the behind-the-scenes aspects of it. I really enjoyed the scenes where we got to see the making of process for Sammy's movies as it shows what are some aspects of what directors do on sets and what it was like to edit movies back in the old days. I especially liked getting to see how exactly they edited movies back then and seeing how tough it was. This movie's story really makes you reflect back to the moment you first fell in love with film and how it's impacted you. Despite how long this movie is, it honestly flashes before your eyes. I didn't notice how long I had been sitting there due to how memorized and hooked I was with this movie's story. This movie is paced super well and knows how long each moment should be in order for the audience to get the full effect of it. But the true reason this story is so engaging to watch is the performances in this movie. All of the acting in this movie was incredibly well done and makes you feel like this is a real family. Everybody works off of each other in order to help the audience fully understand both their character and their dynamic in the household. This is best explored with Michelle Williams's, who plays Mitzi Fabelman, performance as the mother and past dreamer. Michelle Williams's character is the one who is most similar to Sammy so it's understandable why she would be encouraging him to pursue his dreams. She's been where he was and it almost seems like she regrets her decision to not properly pursue her dream. It's also great to see one of the parents fully support Sammy's dreams from the very beginning and continually encourage him along the way. But, it's not just, for this reason, she was captivating to watch but also because of her character's mental health issues. Her character's mental health issues are so interesting to watch especially as they spiral downwards.After a reveal in the movie, you see Michelle Williams completely change the way you see her portray her character. She's still this loving mother who cares for her children but she's also very depressed and doing her best to try and understand why. To counteract Michelle Williams's performance we have Paul Dano, who plays Burt Fabelman, as the doting father. Paul Dano plays this by the book's character who doesn't fully believe his son could make a career by making movies. But no matter what his thoughts are he still cares for his family, especially his son, and wants what's best for them. He's always looking for ways to cheer up his wife and care for her. Paul Dano plays this so well that you can't help but like his character. I just wanted to quickly shout out Mateo Zoryan, who plays younger Sammy, as he perfectly portrayed the childhood wonders a lot of people got from watching movies at a young age. The scene stealer in this movie was hands down Gabriel LaBelle. Just like with Mateo Zoryan, Gabriel is able to show how movies can impact and shape us. Those who want to work in the film industry will be able to relate to him. He shows how much hard work goes into making movies and how directors look at all of the different reactions to their movies. Gabriel Labelle also demonstrates so well how passionate directors can be when it comes to making movies and especially when directing their actors. During the scene where he's making the WW2 movie, you see this. He always knows what exactly he wants to be done and how to get it executed that way. But what really makes his performance stand out amongst the others is how down-to-earth his performance is. He plays Sammy in such a way that during the moments he isn't directing movies you can still relate to him. When it comes to him learning the truth he reacts the same way any teenager would learning this kind of truth. It's thanks to Gabriel LaBelle's performance in this movie that we the audience are taken on a rollercoaster ride of emotion.But none of this could've been done without the help of an incredible director and Steven Spielberg proves he's still got it with this movie. I think what really helped him with directing this movie is how this movie is semi-autobiographical about his early years. So he has a deeper connection to this story but either way Steven Spielberg continues showing why he's one of the best directors of all time here. He knew how to direct his actors to make sure he got the correct reaction out of them that was needed for whatever scene it was. I especially loved the scenes where we only saw the reaction shots before we got the reveal of what they were looking at. He knows how to keep the audience wondering what's going on and what's going to happen next. In the end, The Fabelmans is a must-see movie for those who love the cinema or just want to watch a really good drama movie. This movie is for all those with a dream to keep pursuing it no matter what.",

Put simply, there have been times he has applied his prodigious talents to minor films (e.g., The Terminal, West Side Story).I just saw The Fabelmans, and I really loved it. I have rarely seen a film where every single shot is so carefully, meticulously and lovingly crafted. It was obvious that this semi-autobiographical movie was close to his heart (indeed, those are the projects that have produced his BEST films, such as E. T., Schindler's List, and Saving Private Ryan. It is clearly the work of a mature artist who is in the later years of his life and wants to tell his own story.Spielberg co-wrote the screenplay with Pulitzer Prize-winner Tony Kushner, and the contributions of a major playwright are evident here in the dramaturgy, particularly the dialogue. The other technical contributions, including production design, cinematography and editing all support the film mightily.The cast is extremely effective under the director's fine hand, with Paul Dano adding unexpected maturity as Mr. Fabelman, and the always superb Michelle Williams breaking my heart as the complicated matriarch. (This could FINALLY be her Oscar performance. )\nThis space is not the place for a detailed or robust review, but I will say that The Fabelmans jumps to my pantheon of Spielberg's best films. I think it was a movie that he NEEDED to make, and I'm pleased that he did it with care rather than a reckless abandon.A POSTSCRIPT TO MY FELLOW CINEASTES: I'm not giving anything away to say that the film concludes with Sammy, the Spielberg's stand-in character, meeting the great director John Ford. The person cast as Ford is a bit of a surprise and a bit of an inside joke. Don't reveal it here to other IMDB readers; just enjoy it.",

The Fablements dealt with some heavy topics including , emotional instability, parental child(the unique and significant affiliation between a parent and child) and infidelity; Bullying, growing up Jewish and the antisemitism themes .There is quite a lot to unpack here. However the most gratifying and fun aspect of the film was the character development of Sammy's coming of age and finding his identity .It's Spielberg's most personal film, one that gorgeously revives the memories of his childhood and youth I would say almost a memoir but shines bright with remarkable performances from Michelle Williams, Paul Dano and Gabriel LaBelle .

Having studied film, I just enjoyed watching how this legendary filmmaker showed us his journey IN filmmaking in the context of his own life and upbringing. A movie for movie lovers BY one of the biggest movie lovers of all time.",

Just because it has Spielberg's name attached to it and supposedly chronicles his life, doesn't mean it will translate well onto the screen. It's unfortunate that Michelle Williams lent her name to this project as she has a decent previous resume. This movie is too long and too tedious and too dull. It also shamelessly has scenes of anti-Christianite behaviour with overtly tiresome tropes on Catholicism. It's hard to imagine that someone who gave us \"Jaws\" would stoop to such depravity and utter nonsense.",

Why would I do that?\".I get the impression that the team were trying to create something with multiple storylines, but didn't know how to achieve it. Instead, it is comprised of a number of scenes in which dramatic notions are touched upon and then immediately resolved.I think the best description would be to say that the filmmakers got lost in their self-indulgence, and forgot to make a movie.--all superbly filmed, but all unoriginal.

            "content": "Some filmmakers, like Truffaut, begin with autobiographical movies (\"Les 400 Coups\" is still the most famous and influential work of that great French 'cin\u00e9aste') before they go on to deal with themes more detached from their own personal experiences. Spielberg took the reverse course, beginning in a world of sheer fantasy (as in the Indiana Jones movies and \"E. T.\"), then moving on in his mature years to more serious matters from real life (\"Schindler's List\", \"Munich\", e. G.) and only now, at 76, finally tackling the challenge of making his own life and experiences the explicit subject matter of his art.Spielberg's autobiographical movie may very well be his greatest opus and his ultimate cinematic creation (even if snubbed by critics and flopped at the box office). Much more than merely a film about coming of age (as it has been heralded by many) or a compilation of personal reminiscences of childhood and early youth (although it is all that, too), the central topic that permeates the picture and really touches the viewer is the absolute passion for movies -- which, in the case of the protagonist (LaBelle), who is actually Spielberg's alter-ego, manifests itself as an urge for filmmaking. Everything else appears to be but a background for his devotion to movies -- as it often occurs in the life of any real film lover, because for them (I should rather say 'for us') life itself is but the background against which films exist. Movies are bigger and more important than life; or, as Truffaut himself once put it, movies are stronger than life. Movies are real, whereas life is but shadows projected on a wall, as in Plato's allegory of the cave. And that is because movies deal with the essence of things themselves, while casual experiences met in real life are necessarily contingent.In \"The Fabelmans\", the protagonist relates to other people and deals with problems in his life (such as his mother's adultery and the bullying he suffers from a musclebound schoolmate) mostly through filmmaking. The problems and people he can't deal with by means of his movies are those he ultimately can't handle or relate to in real life (such as his father, who thinks that films are just 'a hobby', and the Christian girlfriend, who leaves him in the end).David Lynch plays a cameo as John Ford in the final sequence, in which the legendary filmmaker (supposedly as per Spielberg's own recollection) summarizes in a nutshell, in an utterly minimalist way, the essence of what good filmmaking is really all about. Spielberg clearly got the gist of the lesson: this movie is itself a prime example of good filmmaking, indeed.",

Like most of Spielberg's latter work, The Fabelmans is innocuous, but that doesn't mean it's painless. Through his alter ego Sam Fabelman, Spielberg pokes into his parents' character flaws and his own insecurities and perceived shortcomings (literally speaking), and it's all very relatable and told with a warmth and sleight of hand that most certainly will suck you in and transport you effectively back to the 1960s. A fine coming-of-age film made stronger by the filmmakers' honesty and firsthand experience; the film is reportedly autobiographical down to almost every detail. Superb performances by the three leads augment the drama, even if Seth Rogen is slightly out of place and depth as the Fabelman's family friend Bennie.",

And I'm a Jew that's been in love with the movies from the same age as Spielberg. Two performances have been widely praised. Michelle Williams as the mother does give a very good performance, but I never really thought she went deep enough. And her calling her son \"Dolling!\" was just grating and cliched. Judd Hirsch overacts so much as Uncle Boris that he makes Al Pacino's worst \"HOO-HAH!\" moments seem subtle.Outstanding period cinematography and production design.It's a good movie, but nowhere near great.

In imitating a chunk of Cinema Paradiso (a superior film to this one), the emphasis is on the family and its problems.

It does a great job of how Spielberg BEGAN his interest in film, but the overly-long sequence of his family difficulties overwhelm the development of Spielberg's movie making career.There are dozens of films that deal with sensitive divorce issues and how the family is devastated by the events of divorce. However, film goers are not going to this movie to see scenes from a family tragedy; they are going to this movie because they love film, and want to see how Spielberg developed his love for film after becoming a new director in Hollywood, not his love of home movies, which, although important in his development, was merely a beginning of his journey, and not the essence of his talent. Maybe there will be a sequel to show how Spielberg rose in Hollywood.A very good film with great performances, by Hirsch and Dano, in particular.",

            "content": "Whether you're a big fan of cinema or not, it probably goes without saying that at least one of the films you've loved watching is one of Steven Spielbergs. Most of his films have been home runs and have become classics, so hearing that he was going to be making a film about his own life intrigued me. Growing up myself as an aspiring filmmaker, I went into this film hoping to be amazed. While I can't say that that I think The Fabelmans is an amazing film by any means, it's still great. The funny thing is that I don't really have much to complain about here, the film is just very simplistic and I think I was hoping for more.Sammy Fabelman (which is a pseudonym for Steven Spielberg) is a young boy who was blown away after being taken to the movies for the first time. After his first experience at the movies, he wishes to recreate what he had seen. This eventually led him to have his own camera and work hard at creating short films. Once his family moves away though, times get rough for him in school and family issues ensue. This film was a very nice watch and there are some terrific moments sprinkled throughout, but I never felt like I was watching a film about Spielberg. The awe and wonder about filmmaking is absolutely present and I connected to this film personally, but it never goes in any interesting directions, which is really my only complaint.I thought that both Gabriel LaBelle who portrays Sammy Fabelman throughout the majority of the run time and Mateo Zoryan who plays him at the start of the film gave terrific performances. Their commitment to the real-life figure they were playing really helped sell the film to me. Paul Dano as the father was fantastic as well and even though Michelle Williams delivered a great performance as always, there was something off about the character to me. I also think that was the point of her character, so I could be overthinking that. The performances overall are great across the board.The reason I was excited about this film was to see how Speilberg was influenced and why he chose to be a filmmaker in the first place. Other than being amazed at a young age, this film is really more about his family life and how that shaped who is is today. The score is wonderful and the imagery put a smile on my face on multiple occasions. I can't quite gush about this film because it's a Spielberg movie and obviously it's well-made from start to finish, I just hoped for a little more from this story. Still, all in all, I enjoyed every minute of it and that final scene had me laughing pretty damn hard. The Fabelmans was a very, very pleasant watch.",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg has to have the biggest flex in telling his own story of filmmaking through film itself.Sammy is taken by his parents Mitzi and Burt Fabelman on his first trip to the movie theater to watch Cecil B. DeMille's The Greatest Show on Earth. A nervous sammy watches in horror with mouth-agape fascination, as a pair of circus trains collide. To us, as 2022 audiences, the crash effects are crude and the scene is pretty lackluster, but to sammy in 1952, it truly is, The Greatest Show on Earth.On the ride home, sammy's parents are debating if the movie was too scary for him but sammy says nothing, still wondering what he saw and that night, he goes to bed dreaming of trains. We then see sammy screaming for his mom at the top of his lungs and we instantly assume The Greatest Show on Earth has given him the Greatest Nightmare on Earth. Alas, that isn't the case. Sammy is jauntily jumping in bed and he knows exactly what he wants for Hanukkah: A Train Set. He then recreates the crash scene from The Greatest Show on Earth with his train over and over until his mother gives him the family's 8mm camera to shoot his own version of the sequence. She thinks that the camera will get the crashing trains out of his mind, or at least encourage him to stop smashing the very expensive toy around. Although it does happen, it's not quite what you'd expect; instead, sammy has now transferred his interest from the train to the camera and once he did, he never let it go as evident from the film and his director itself.What's most intriguing about this film is that you can tell, that even after 70 years, the real Steven Spielberg remains equally obsessed with movies. He's obviously learned a lot about how to make them since 1952; but he has never lost sight of the why.The performances in this film are just heartbreaking and beautiful. Paul dano has never had a bad performance in his entire career and his streak remains intact. And what's even more impressive, he has given us the role of a psychopath on a murderous spree and that of a loving, heartbroken father wanting what's best for his boy both in the same year. Truly one of the best actors of our time. Michelle williams OMG. What an absolute icon. This might be her most nuanced, emotionally-wrecking role to date and that shows. She was obviously the best part of the film for me because although the film never antagonizes paul dano's character (because he truly is the nicest person to exist who thinks rationally and is confined to reality), you know that he and michelle william's character can't stay together for long. They eventually have to seperate. The film uses this plot point like a chekhov's gun waiting to fire, a powder keg waiting to blow and steven builds up to that moment of lives being shattered with utmost delicacy. Even the after-effects felt due to that are felt to the core and just brilliantly written. Gabriel LaBelle honestly is literally me. He is afraid, emotional, unsure of what to do in life if not following his true passion and even willing to sacrifice that passion for the sake of the family. Truly a standout performance and I wish to see more of him in future films. Rest of the performances are also really great and not a single loose thread.The background score. 2022, a year of such great musical numbers and background scores. We have avatar 2' action packed score, babylon's trumpets, and the batman's epic and rousing theme (which I still think is the best score of the year and the academy does a real disservice to michael giacchino by not even nominating it). Just when we thought we had it done and dusted, john williams rose from the ashes and gave us the beautiful score of this film. Truly some exceptional work here. Each and every single one of the piano pieces are beautiful and I desire to have this on vinyl.The cinematography is also beautiful and not wanting to say much here without spoiling the absolute beauty of the shots, the 2 best scenes of the film for me are michelle williams gracefully performing in front of the car headlights in a gorgeous white gown and the last shot of the film which skillfully shifts the horizon from the middle to bottom.I'm just happy that even though I had the chance to watch this at home, I decided to wait for that theatrical experience and got the best out of it.P. S.: truly bummed and shocked to see this film's box office failure. Cinema is truly dying and only we can save it guys. Please go for this film in the theatres if you can because this is spielberg's most personal film to date and it deserves your attention.",

There was one line in the film were his mother said \"You don't owe your life to anyone\" She was saying that because Sam (Spielberg) was so upset that his parents were getting a divorce. When i saw that Sam's mother having an affair with her husbands best friend (Bennie) i was thinking to myself this is sad and selfish, but when she said that she was not acting normal because she was not around Bennie i thought she was not being selfish it was just sad.

John Williams is no longer what he used to be. Although I liked the movie, I did not understand the purpose of its production. Let's be honest, I don't think it's a good decision to make a biography film about a living person. It can be perceived as egoism that he wrote this film and directed it himself. It's like saying look at the people who don't believe in him, people who don't like him, people who beat him, where I am now. Frankly, at the end of the movie, I had such an idea. I think a Spielberg biopic could have been made later on, rather than continuing with fictional name and surnames. So don't be misunderstood, I think it's better to make biographies or something like that people who are very, very old or dead.

            "content": "Practically everything that Steven Spielberg has directed, from his 1971 made-for-TV psychological thriller DUEL to his 2021 re-imagining of WEST SIDE STORY, has had a personal resonance for him in some way or another. But his new film THE FABELMANS is quite a different animal altogether. This one is Personal in the most naked definition of that term, as he turns his camera more or less on his own peripatetic upbringing, starting with his first movie-going experience as a five year-old in Camden, New Jersey in 1952, going through his formative years as the family moves first to Arizona and then to Northern California, and finishing up with his first up-close encounter with Hollywood directing royalty in 1965. It is a story that is arguably quite cinema-centric, but one that alludes to things that too many kids went through during the conformist years of the 1950's and early 1960's, and things that too many kids of Jewish ancestry like Spielberg had to put up with.As portrayed by Mateo Zayan in his very early years, Sammy Fabelman becomes excited (though also fairly terrified) with his first encounter with the art of movies via the 1952 Cecil B. DeMille opus THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH, which his parents Mitzi (Michelle Williams) and Burt (Paul Dano) take him to see at a cinema house in Camden, New Jersey. In those years, he borrows a motion picture camera to stage a mini version of that film's famous train wreck with his own train set. Then as the family moves out to Arizona, due to his father's expertise in the burgeoning technological explosion of the times, Sammy, henceforth played by Gabrielle LaBelle, gets downright serious. But through his little cinematic films of his family's Arizona adventures, he uncovers a very troubling secret that his mom has been keeping from the kids, one that involves close family friend Bennie Loewey (Seth Rogen). And once the family makes one more final move, this time to what would become known as Silicon Valley, not only do Williams and Dano start to split up, leaving LaBelle and his sisters to pick up the pieces, as a high school student in a largely WASP-ish community LaBelle encounters for the first time virulent anti-Semitism being aimed straight at him. Movie-making is his only real respite; and even then, he's not exactly sure whether he really wants to do it anymore--until that aforementioned first brush with a Hollywood directing legend of, how shall we say, some renown.Co-written by Spielberg and his frequent collaborator Tony Kushner, THE FABELMANS is a moving film that's more than just about movies and the power to inspire one kid to take up this art form. It is about how he has to deal as a kid and then as a teenager morphing into an adult much sooner than he had ever expected with things that he had no way of controlling (let alone directing). It's one thing to go through those stages in what we used to call a \"nuclear family\" that is silently imploding, which far too many kids from the 1950's to this very day have had to do; but it is quite another matter when you're a kid trying to fit in a society that not only has no use for Jews but has this unfortunate tendency want to denigrate and destroy them. There are also quite a few amusing moments, as in the scenes in high school where LaBelle befriends a girl who tries to convert him from Judaism to Christianity (needless to say, that doesn't take), and his filming of his high school's hi-jinks on \"Ditch Day\" on the beach at Santa Cruz. LaBelle so accurately captures the triumphs and trauma of Spielberg's upbringing; and Williams, Dano, and Rogen are also incredibly good. Judd Hirsch has a ten-minute cameo role as Uncle Boris, who gives LaBelle some pointers about how art and love can tear a person in two, as it almost does to LaBelle.So often in the past, Spielberg has been accused of being overtly sentimental and manipulative in some of his films, while being much too serious in others. But these charges are not very credible when it comes to those films; and they don't ring true when it comes to THE FABELMANS either. This is not only a personal film for Spielberg, it is eminently relatable to anyone who has had to go through the trauma of a family break-up and then to be bullied in school for the most petty and stupid reasons possible. Spielberg is a director of extraordinary ability, but he also believes in common people with common concerns and common dreams. In the end, THE FABELMANS hits very close to home when one thinks about it hard enough, and that's the kind of Hollywood art that Spielberg has engaged in for a half century-plus, to our everlasting benefit.",

The same story could have been told with more efficacy and punch. This whole movie was boring, didn't connect emotionally and just seemed like an ego project for Spielberg trying to remind us of how great he once was. The magic he illuminates in movies like ET, where he captures the imagination and innocence of youth, doesn't translate here and seems contrived either because it's dated or not written well. I couldn't relate to any of the characters probably because, as written, they didn't inspire any empathy. They all come across as selfish with their own goals trumping any love within the family. Michelle Williams particularly comes across as so self absorbed any hope of relating to her is impossible. Maybe that's who his mother was but it seems more tragic than relatable. This movie was boring and some of the characters were bizarre. The mom character was a total loonie. Total art house film, pet passion project for Spielberg. We were all shocked especially by the fact of the positive reviews (it's impossible, no honest person can objectively say that it's a good movie. That's rubbish!! I admired Spielberg before... . After this farce, this \"organized\" theatrical release, we were fooled with the pseudo positive reviews, Spielberg has become nothing but a profiteer... and even mediocre.

Sammy's hesitant, yet supportive parents, Mitzi and Burt Fabelman are played by the luminous Michelle Williams and the convincing Paul Dano. Also in the film, Judd Hirsch making a short but memorable appearance in his recent Best Supporting Actor Oscar-nominated performance as Sammy's cantankerous Uncle Boris. Spielberg pays homage to the wonders and realities of youth, dreams and love of cinema seen through the eyes of Sammy whose early life witnesses his mother's unrealized musical aspirations, his father's multiple job changes resulting in the Fabelmans various moves from state-to-state, and the ultimate breakup of his family following his parents divorce. All this going on while Sammy realizes and begins to nurture his own artistic talents for filmmaking. A highlight of the movie is an almost unrecognizable David Lynch who appears at the climax of the film as Iconic director John Ford who talks to Sammy about the importance of horizon in good filmmaking. Steven Spielberg is one of the great directors who is blessed with a true gift for storytelling and he accomplishes this, again with THE FABELMANS. You may recognize his abiding love for Indiana Jones in this film through the character of a handsome, tough on the outside, flawed on the inside high school track star, caught on camera on Ditch Day by 18 year old Sammy Fabelman. It's obvious Steven Spielberg never forgot him.",

            "content": "Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Indiana Jones, Saving Private Ryan, Ready Player One) was inspired to make E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial based on his childhood experience of his parents' divorce. I was most interested in this film having seen the trailer, as it looked like it was almost completely based on his youth, written by Spielberg himself and Tony Kushner (Munich, Lincoln, West Side Story). Basically, in 1952, in Haddon Township, New Jersey, young Samuel \"Sammy\" Fabelman (Mateo Zoryan Francis-DeFord) is taken by his Jewish parents Mitzi (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Michelle Williams) and Burt (Paul Dano) to the cinema to see his first film: Cecil B. DeMille's The Greatest Show on Earth. Sammy is dazzled by a scene featuring a train crash; he is delighted to receive a model train for Hanukkah and tries to recreate his own crash one night. Understanding Sammy's intentions, Mitzi allows him to borrow Burt's 8mm camera to film a crash scene to watch whenever he wishes. Sammy becomes fascinated in making his own short films, and often has his younger sisters Regina \"Reggie\" (Birdie Borria), Natalie (Alina Brace), and Lisa (Sophia Kopera) in costume starring in them. The family move to Phoenix, Arizona in 1957 when Burt is offered a new job. Mitzi insists Burt's best friend and business partner Bennie Loewy (Seth Rogen) goes with them. Years later, teenage Sammy (Gabriel LaBelle) continues making films with his friends in a Boy Scout troop. His creative projects become increasingly ambitious, utilising post-production effects, and he subsequently earns a badge in photography. Later, the Fabelmans and Bennie take a camping trip, during which Sammy captures footage of their vacation. One night of the trip, Mitzi starts dancing in her nightgown in the dark, Burt turns the car headlights on to add backlighting for Sammy to film her dancing. Shortly afterwards, Mitzi's mother Tina Schildkraut (Robin Bartlett) dies from old age, Burt recommends that Sammy should turn the camping trip footage into a film to cheer her up. Sammy objects due to scheduling for his next film, but Burt, who sees that Sammy's passion for film as nothing more than a hobby, argues that the home movie is more important. The next morning, the Fabelmans receive a surprise visit from Mitzi's uncle Boris (Oscar nominated Judd Hirsch), a former lion tamer at a circus, and a former film worker. That night, Sammy is fascinated to hear the insights his granduncle Boris has about filmmaking, including the idea that aspects of family and art will be at odds with one another. After Boris leaves, Sammy begins editing the camping trip footage, during which he is angered to discover evidence that Mitzi and Bennie are having an affair. After weeks of harsh treatment towards her and Bennie, Sammy and Mitzi get into a heated argument. In a fit of rage over her son's behaviour, Mitzi slaps him across the back. Following this outburst, Sammy is forced to show her the compiled footage. He promises to keep it a secret between them. The following week, Burt receives a promotion from work, meaning the family will have to move with him to Saratoga, California. Bennie remains in Phoenix, but not before giving Sammy a film camera he always wanted as a gift. Sammy continuously refuses the camera, and despite Bennie buying it for him, having fallen out with him, Sammy announces he will never use it. Arriving at his new high school, Sammy is bullied by students Logan Hall (Sam Rechner) and Chad Thomas (Oakes Fegley), who hurl abusive anti-Semitic comments at him for his Jewish beliefs. Sammy also begins dating devoutly Christian student Monica Sherwood (Chloe East). During dinner with the Fabelmans, Monica suggests that Sammy should film Ditch Day at the beach, he considers it eventually accepts when Monica tells him her father owns a 16mm Arriflex camera he can borrow. One day, Sammy spies Logan cheating on his girlfriend Claudia Denning (Isabelle Kusman) with Renee (Chandler Lovelle). Sammy tells Claudia about what he saw, Logan beats him claiming that he is lying, but Sammy stands up for himself. The Fabelmans finally move from a rental to a purchased home, but shortly after Mitzi and Burt announce they are getting divorced. This is due to Mitzi's depression and the Burt discovering the affair; Natalie (Keeley Karsten), Reggie (Julia Butters), Lisa, and especially Sammy, are heartbroken. On prom night, Sammy tells Monica that he loves her, gives her jewellery, and asks her to come with him to Hollywood after high school. But Monica has plans to attend Texas A&M University, she breaks up with Sammy, leaving him despondent. The Ditch Day film is played in front of the entire school prom, where it receives a rapturous response. The film appears to glorify Logan, who is brought close to tears of admiration, while Chad walks out in anger as he is vilified. In the corridor, Logan is confronted by Logan who is confused over his positive portrayal in the film, admitting that he has been horrible to him. Chad tries to attack Sammy only for Logan to fight him off, and after Chad walks away, Sammy and Logan come to something of an understanding. The next morning, Mitzi and Sammy talk about their future together. Mitzi admits she cannot give up her love for Bennie and tells Sammy he should not give up his love for filmmaking. The following year, Sammy is living with Burt in Hollywood. Sammy considers dropping out of college after being unable to find work at a film studio. Burt, having learned to accept his son's passion, after seeing a photograph of Mitzi and Bennie together, tells him to keep on his path if it makes him happy. Sammy finally receives a letter from CBS, offering him a job working on sitcom Hogan's Heroes. The show's co-creator Bernard Fein (Heroes' Greg Grunberg) recognises that Sammy is more interested in filmmaking and invites Sammy to the office of a renowned filmmaker. Sammy is amazed to recognise from various posters on the wall that he is about to meet film director John Ford, one of his greatest filmmaking influences. John Ford (David Lynch) is grouchy but offers Sammy some useful brief pointers about framing, saying that a horizon at the top or the bottom is interesting, but in the middle, it is rubbish. Newly invigorated, Sammy walks through the studio backlot as the camera frames the horizon to the centre, contrary to Ford's advice. Before the film ends the picture is re-framed to show the horizon at the far bottom. Also starring Jeannie Berlin as Hadassah Fabelman, Gustavo Escobar as Sal, Nicolas Cantu as Hark, Cooper Dodson as Turkey, Gabriel Bateman as Roger, Stephen Matthew Smith as Angelo, Lane Factor as Dean, James Urbaniak as Grand View High School Principal, and Crystal the Monkey as Bennie the Monkey. Newcomer LaBelle is perfectly cast as the adolescent who falls in love with the movies, Williams is well cast as his supportive mother, Dano is good as the less enthusiastic father, there are terrific supporting performances, especially a brief Hirsch, and the marvellous cameo appearance of Lynch. I recognised from the trailer the story was semi-autobiographical, based on Spielberg's experiences, being Jewish, his parents divorcing and his passion for filmmaking. Spielberg himself has become one of the greatest and most influential directors of all time, this film is definitely his most personal. His screenplay works well both as a memoir and an ode to the power of the movies, it makes you laugh, it moves you, and it most interesting to see the (near fully accurate) story of a great filmmaker, a terrific coming-of-age drama. It is nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay for Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner, Best Original Score for John Williams, and Best Production Design, it is nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score, and Best Screenplay.

            "content": "For good or for ill, THE FABELMANS is exactly the memoir film you'd expect from Steven Spielberg. The renaming of his surname also hints at the mythic quality the legendary filmmaker brings to his oft-told origin story. More truth in advertising.Spielberg and co-writer Tony Kushner base their screenplay on the formative years in the future Director's life from the time he saw his first movie in a theater at age 6 (DeMille's 1952 GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH) to his arrival in Hollywood in the late 60s. Spielberg's stand-in is named Sammy Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle and Mateo Francis-Deford at various ages) and his parents are Burt (Paul Dano) and Mitzi (Michelle Williams). Burt is an engineer who's work takes the family from New Jersey to Arizona to Northern California over the years. From a young age, Sammy is obsessed with making movies and by the time he is in Arizona he's directing his own mini-epics enlisting his sisters and friends to be his filmmaking troupe.The heart of the film is, in many ways, those Arizona years. Not only did young Sammy first really learn how to use the camera to tell stories, but he also experienced his parents slowly drifting apart. In true cinematic style, Spielberg captures that breakdown in a riff on Antonioni's BLOW UP. Sammy's \"Uncle Bennie\" (Seth Rogan) becomes more and more than a friend of the family to Sammy's mom. A real uncle, Boris (Judd Hirsch), visits to dispense some oddball advice along the way. By the time the family moves to Northern California, the marriage is at the breaking point. Sammy is now in high school and has his first girlfriend (Chloe East) -- but also his first real brush with antisemitism. The Hollywood section is more of an epilogue, dominated by a cameo by David Lynch as the famously brusque John Ford.Spielberg's direction keeps things moving even if those moves are pretty familiar and predictable by now (he's admitted that he's \"improved\" the directing chops of Sammy compared to himself at that age). Janusz Kaminski maintains authenticity by actually shooting on film (including 16mm for the amateur movies). John Williams, in what may be his last collaboration with Spielberg, contributes a lovely and sweet score. The Spielberg-Williams partnership is one of the greatest in in cinema rivaling Fellini-Rota and Hitchcock-Herrmann.Rogan is very good as Bennie, managing to be both engagingly humorous and honest throughout. Dano and the pair of Sammys do well even if the script never really challenges them. Williams, a steady actress, has the most difficult role to maneuver. Spielberg obviously idealizes his mother in many ways. Williams resists such easy pigeonholing, but, she too is up against a thin script. It's a good performance, but compromised.THE FABELMANS can't help but feel like a sentimental film. Spielberg does add a few moments here and there of grit, but, they never really disrupt his flow of mostly fond memories. The high school years are a mix of awkward humor and schmaltz. In the end, the film is a genteel summing up of Spielberg's early life, told with his trademark professionalism, but. Lacking the true sense of wonder his finest films have brought to cinema. In the end, his own story is simply not as interesting as the ones he has dreamed up.",

As Steve Jobs said: You can't connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backward. These anecdotes seem to lead to the only possible conclusion, how inevitably the protagonist would become a great director. But actually Spielberg wants to tell us that this wasn't natural at all. The focus of this part is his mother, her way of living her life as a dream will allow him to follow his own dream. His father is not the antagonist, but is only presented as a complementary force. And while we see how his parents eventually separate, we can already understand how he brings them together in his later films, combining his mother's visionary power with his father's technical finesse.The second half is a long anecdote that expands into a story and eventually a reflection on filmmaking itself. It revolves around the experience of being Jewish and an outsider. Here we have an antagonist, split into two characters: a sociopath who is vilified, and an insecure and immature person who experiences some redemption. But there is also his first love who is somewhat antagonistic, she is presented in a very light and funny way, showing us how wit and disarming charm can also be ways to handle a controversial subject. These are the three pillars of his cinematic art: to vilify, to redeem, to charm. He shows them as personified types, but we can also ask ourselves how these means of his art have helped to shape this portrait of his parents.A special bow to Michelle Williams, without her outstanding performance this film would not be possible.",

            "content": "On the surface, \"The Fabelmans\" is very much a passion project for director Steven Spielberg, it being essentially an autobiography of his early years. But of course, Spielberg is too smart/savvy to simply make a film for his own liking. Within his own story, he interweaves themes about the power of film and its influence (and the opposite) on family. One's ability to interpret and/or appreciate those \"deeper cuts\" will largely determine their enjoyment.For a very basic overview, \"The Fabelmans\" tells the story of Sammy Fabelman (young: Mateo Zoryan; adolescent: Gabriel LaBelle), a boy obsessed with the cinema and making movies. While witnessing his artistically-inclined mother Mitzi (Michelle Williams) and straight-laced--if well-meaning--father Burt (Paul Dano) interact with the world, Sam struggles with the \"art vs family/stability\" conflict as he reaches high school age and a little beyond.At face value, \"The Fabelmans\" may be disappointing for some. It is far from the rip-roaring adventures or immaculate dramas that largely perpetuate his filmography. It is a very straight-ahead family drama without a ton of surprises. In a certain sense, it sort of violates the principle that artistic expression shouldn't be an exact re-telling, but rather an endeavor to transfer an emotion from person to person.But the deeper level is where \"Fabelmans\" will likely rise/fall ratings-wise. As the expected Spielberg/Fabelman story plays out, there is a steady undercurrent of the power of film (and film-making, by extension). Over and over again, Sammy witnesses his film endeavors elicit reactions from others that are wholly unexpected to him. This is the true message of the film.Personally, though of course \"Fabelmans\" is expertly crafted/shot, I give it a just-about-average 6/10 stars because I'm not a huge fan of analyzing the power of cinema on such a deep level. I love movies--but not so much digging \"behind the scenes\" on why/how moving pictures move us like that do. I will fully concede that those who enjoy that more meta-commentary will absolutely love this picture.All in all, I think I like the Spielberg mythos to stay exactly that--spread out in the characters that populate his enormous resume. To me, \"The Fabelmans\" was a little too on-the-nose and a little too reverent about the power of film to be truly engaging/exciting beyond the \"well-made\" label.",

His mother Mitizzy Fabelman(Michelle Williams) admires Sammy's hobby. Sammy Fabelman(Gabriel LaBelle) grows up in Arizona with his two sisters, and Benny who is a co-worker of the father played by Seth Rogen He makes amateur films for his Eagle Scout Troop and he''s always the director. His father who works for General Electric as a engineer gives him all the tools he needs to make his movies from his gizmo cameras to a old fashioned movie editing machine. Things get a little tough for Sammy when he goes to high school. He gets bullied a little bit but it doesn't effect him. The big moment for Sammy is towards the end of the film where he gets to meet director John Ford at CBS Television Studio. Steven Spielberg's The Fabelmans is a movie about movies done right. It's a little long and could''ve been shortened but i think it''s sprawling, bittersweet and surprisingly entertaining.",

Happy family of six plus one spend lot of time together and enjoy camping. Picnics, dinners. Mitzi a pianist entertains family. Both Burt and Mitzi instill love for the movies in young reluctant Sammy. Sammy gets interested in camera and photography and takes lots of pictures of family in different settings. Children have a very healthy relationship with their mom, dad and uncle Bennie. The scene when overzealous Mitzi drives Sammy and two young daughters to watch tornado with Burt standing on the porch holding baby girl is beautiful. When the family moves to Arizona and Mitzi makes sure her husband gets Bennie a job so he could stay with the family and not be left behind shows true separation anxiety. The scenes when Mitzi's long, well manicured nails are targeted by both Burt and Bennie show lot of involved caring for each other. The movie shows true love and caring of a devoted mother for her children and beautiful bonding between son and mom who have artistic talents whereas the dad is very involved in science and technology. Michelle Williams is excellent as Mitzi who is extremely happy to love and be with all who love her is again Oscar worthy. Good to see subdued and toned down Seth Rogen as Bennie. Paul Dano as Burt did very well. Gabriel LaBelle as Sammy is definitely talented and well suited for the role of a son who loves his trustworthy dad and non-judgemental of a talented mom full of love and happiness with 2 men in her life. 2hrs31min long could be edited. Oscar worthy acting. Oscar worthy Direction.",

In school, and at home with his friends and family, he tries to make movies. When his shooting was done he shared it with everybody and all of them loved his work.

However, Spielberg really delivered on that item with The Fablemans. Such a simple story yet so tastefully done. The casting was impecable, the set designs of the 50s and 60s were perfect, and the performances were out of this world.The Fablemans now has my vote for Best Picture at The 2023 Academy Awards. This is a film that could be an instant classic because it has a lot of heart and a lot of laughs. If you find yourself turned away from Hollywood because of the current generation of movies, just watch this one again and be reminded of the power of cinema.",

They range from straight out bullying to an endearingly sincere effort by a very attractive young Christian woman to bring Jesus into the heart and soul of the unwilling (but smitten) 16-year-old Jewish Sam.Along with the portrait of an artist as a young man, the film also devotes time to the pain, confusion, and trauma of divorce, for both the adults and children. There is a light but serious touch to some very heavy themes which make the film enjoyable while at the same time leave the viewer with plenty to ponder and think about long after the lights go back on.

(Calling him Bagelman etc and harming him physically) that really did not happen in the sunshine state at that era as far as I experienced.Now my personal feeling acting wise no one shines, Personally Michelle Williams who plays the mother is an actress I always hated, an ugly duckling with 1966 Guiding Light acting style and the charm of a schnitzel (She once played M Monroe in a bio epic a casting decisionI I find criminal)\nand she is hard to watch especially here.

It reminds us of why we love movies as it transports us to other worlds that are real or very close to reality, despite the fact that Sammy's dad believed that recording-directing movies would not generate any change in the lives of the people who see them. It is also a film that indirectly tells us the life of its director Spielberg.

It mirrored my own growing up in one way in that , as it was for Spielberg, the people I met and knew much about up through about junior high were generally decent and wonderful people. Then , in high school, everything started to go downhill and I became disillusioned by the characters of people ( as happened with Spielberg also). My very favorite part was the camping trip and the parts in Arizona. My least favorite part was when the main character Sammy goes to high school and the other students treat him badly right off the bat without giving him much of a chance. Apparently, critical thinking and fairness weren't taught in high schools in the 1960s? However, I did kind of like the character of Claudia except that like a lot of rather decent and intelligent girls, she definitely had horrible taste in guys. In real life, Spielberg endured a lot at the California high school he went to and did not respond to the invitations to the five and ten year reunions. At any rate, I liked how it showed how his interest in film making developed and how sometimes it even took precedence over family crises ( as often is the case with individuals who have a particular interest that they spend a lot of time on). There's a few slow parts and the ending felt a bit abrupt ( interesting but abrupt). Overall , though, I liked it quite a bit.",

            "content": "Every director of merit deserves one vanity picture. P. T. Anderson released the visually superb Licorice Pizza despite it having more to do with giving his army of production designers work than a story that needed to be told. Tarantino has nearly ten vanity pictures under his belt with scripts that are so in love with themselves Narcissus would be jealous. A chance to amuse Tarantino has never been missed by Tarantino. Van Gogh modeled for himself an extraordinary 35 times. Writers like Hesse, Kerouac, Sylvia Plath and Jack London all looked no further than the mirror for inspiration. So, an auteur's self portrait is historically justified. Furthermore, Spielberg is not blind to the trend of making a biopic for every pop culture icon in history of humanity so why should he allow another production crew first crack at his story in 30 years?While Tarantino thinks he is Dialogue's equivalent of Mozart and the removal of a single line of superfluous jive vernacular would cause his whole precious post modern universe to implode, Spielberg is far more humble and concise as he employed the brilliant Tony Kushner to cowrite and navigate a quirky, difficult, real life, coming of age reminiscence that includes mostly uncomfortable stretch marks few would want to expose to the world. (I credit Kushner for refusing to allow a Great White Shark reference to be made during the beach scene. Or I credit editor Michael Kahn for cutting it out )Spielberg has put serving the audience at the top of his list of priorities long enough to allow one indulgence of his own origin story, audience be damned. There were only a few moments where I felt I was secretly reading someone's teenage diary and felt the urge to look away.The director mostly manages to avoid the pitfalls of these story lines that aim directly at awkwardness, isolation, equally isolated allies, cardboard villains, family dysfunction, implausible heroics, etc, by concentrating on the truly unique dynamics he experienced (the protagonist's sexual awakening is most unusual. No heroics are to be found in this film) and not just in the context of adolescence but in the context of filmmaking.What inspired Spielberg to want to make pictures? Well, if the movie Cinema Paradiso didn't answer that question well enough for you then The Fabelmans, a love letter to his own beginnings, should fill in the gaps.",

I wish there was more focus on the art of moving making itself, because those pieces were the best parts about the movie. Overall it felt more like 65% of the time was spent on family and school drama.This is a bit of an Oscar-bait movie about one's love of Hollywood and films, but it was nowhere near as captivating as something like \"The Artist\". Too long and self-indulgent, and unfortunately not particularly inspiring either.A large chunk of time is spent dealing with the fallout of his mother's cheating, but I had very little sympathy for her and her constant excuses and attitude. At least she admits that it's the most selfish thing that she's ever done, but the fact that she kept going on and on about how much she cares for her children despite her actions just really started to grate. There's a scene earlier in the movie where you see the mom driving her car towards a tornado with no regard for the safety of her kids in the backseat, and it nicely foreshadowed how she never stops to think about the emotional trauma she inflicted on her kids and spouse.The protagonist Sammy, who is much closer in personality to his mother, isn't exactly relatable either. By the end of the movie I mostly felt bad for the dad. He was patient and kind and loving to his family, and even though he wasn't 100% behind Sammy going into the movie industry at first, he still spent tons of money buying toys and filming equipment for him. He was there whenever Sammy had a screening, and he put up with a lot of BS from his family. I can't imagine having to deal with your best friend screwing around with your spouse after you mentored him and got him some really nice jobs.With so much time spent on family drama in this movie, at least the emotional turmoil of the kids were spot on, though I wonder if all of the kids were so forgiving (assuming this is how it was like for Spielberg), or if he chose to make the relationship rosier than it actually was after the fallout of the divorce.It's such a shame, because certain cameos in this movie are excellent. If only there was more focus on the craft of film making itself, or of Sammy/Spielberg's experience working his way up in Hollywood, because those scenes were truly wonderful.",

When he got to the stage to accept the award he disavowed DiCaprio's comparison and said that film is a collaborative medium calling for the contributions of dozens of creative talents from writers, composers, cinematographers, editors, etc. A director is not writing Hamlet or a Beethoven symphony.I kept thinking about Scorcese's comments while watching this film. This movie is expertly made and I enjoyed it. But I also found it self-indulgent and ultimately shallow. Stephen Spielberg is talented, but he is not a complex or deep artist and thinker.

This film has a runtime of 2hrs 31 mins and I can honestly say that every second of that flew right by. I was engaged and hooked into the story right from the very first scene.Ultimately this is a movie about people who are suffering. One is suffering for his family to love him, one is suffering for love, and one is suffering for his art.It was interesting to see the instant connection that Spielberg had with movies. He was hooked as soon as he saw the train crash in \"The Greatest Show On Earth.\" So much so, that he tried to recreate it and the rest is history as they say.The acting in this film was just phenomenal. You could really feel the internal struggle which plagued Paul Dano throughout the film. He knew his faults as a husband and father, but did nothing to be better. He just kept on being a workaholic and this ultimately caused the downfall of the family.Gabriel LaBelle Really shined as the main character. He slowly gains his footing into film making and uses it as an escape from his reality, but also as a means to show the truth. He persevered and eventually got what he wanted, a chance to break into the industry. He never had support from his father, he suffered for his art. We can ultimately see how Spielberg developed his style.Michelle Williams is the standout star in this one. She really portrayed her character well. Her pain at not being with the right person really felt real. She didn't even need to speak all her mannerisms and facial expressions did the work for her. She is a selfish as they come (even admits it) and I personally didn't like this. Why break up your family like that? Life will not always be exciting. You have a loving husband and wonderful kids and you threw it away to be with his friend. Shame on her.It goes to show that you don't need to have any special effects or exploding cars to make a good movie. A great story will always triumph, and this movie certainly has.It's a must watch.This gets a LennyReviewz Score of: 10/10.",

I've fallen in love with movies a long time ago and considering the fact that that is what this movie is about, I guess I shouldn't be surprised..... In the end I think it kind of comes down to it being the right film at the right time. I'm sort of coming off of one of the worst times of my life rn and I think I really needed to be reminded how much I love filmmaking and why I should still try to pursue it.As a film, it's not really a masterpiece, but I think we all knew that going in, but it is a good film, I'll give it that. I absolutely adored how Spielberg directed the film in the same ways that Sammy directed his films (at times obvious, at times surprisingly subtle), and I think it's just another small touch that's verry much appreciated in a film that's basically a love letter to cinema.All in all, I really enjoyed it.",

However, the family does not support the protagonist because they need him/her to help their family business/does not believe the arts are a practical pursuit for financial independence/is anti-art. Ultimately the protagonist has to choose between his/her family or his/her passion, but whatever choice the protagonist makes, everything is reconciled at the end. Or not.But here's the kicker. This is a true story about one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. Spielberg Has a plethora of stories to share about the incredible life he has led. There are so many amazing things that make him stand out from the crowd... and he chose to share in his biopic: none of them. To me, that's a testament to his character rather than show us all the ways that he is different from us, or all the ways that he is extraordinary, Spielberg is focusing on all the ways he is human. He is sharing with us the parts of his upbringing that we have all gone through at one time or another. Considering how many people he has around him who probably stroke his ego all the time, deservedly so, I think he should be commended for his humility and grace.If this was a fictional film, written by some random person who nobody knew, it would just be, yet another stupid formulaic coming of age nonsense story. The fact that someone like Spielberg is the one telling it is what makes it special.",

            "content": "Thinking of the line in Sunset Boulevard that silent film actors \"had faces\" in place of dialogue, and marveling again at Spielberg's skill with eyes as instruments of revelation.Sure, the actors are talented, trained, and tested. But a director sets the scene and creates a dynamic of discovery, and this director knows a thing or two thousand about summoning awe and amazement, insight and epiphany.Mitzi (Michelle Williams) loses balance at a woodland crossing, eyes moving from fright to relief, then giddy warmth to loving affection, gazing upward at family friend Bennie (Seth Rogen), caught in his embrace. Later in the movie, while Burt (Paul Dano) solely views a snapshot in hand, his eyelids peel back from an initial glance, pinching at the corners, as he reacts to figures discerned in deep background. And when Sammy (Gabriel LaBelle) finds himself in some director's waiting room, bulbs behind irises turn on and white orbs spill light, as his inner lenses focus on a long line of one sheet wonders--not yet seen by the audience--shining bright.Spielberg trusts that wordless moments resonate, letting setups play out, suspense build, and mystery envelop. He goes beyond himself in that scene with Sammy, concluding a reverie round of movie posters with a repeat reference to a film that shares The Fabelmans' triangle motif. He then breaks the spell, upon a hurried entry of the lipstick-smudged director in question, with a scratching cutoff of another picture's soundtrack recording--music from one of the most memorable opening shots in cinema, a portal moving from dark to light--signaling a trifecta of open doors: filmic, comic, and metaphoric.The Fabelmans is filled with tripart imagery, evoking the film's interpersonal, conceptual, and formative themes: from triangular windowpanes to three bandits framed within the open legs of a sheriff in Sammy's Boy Scout western; from fulcrums under boards exploding sand in his war movie to the triad of camera, seagulls, and victims at the beach; from a tripod of sticks suspending a cauldron over a campfire to the seesaw rocking of Mitzi cradled from a bough. My favorite: Uncle Boris (Judd Hirsch) miming a perceived self-rending dichotomy of family and art, then thrusting a finger of fate--swish-panned past the center angle of assembled Fabelmans--at Sammy, who defies the dictum with a Superman stance, legs spread wide and arms triangulated via hands on hips and elbows out.In Spielberg's hands films tell stories within a story. Consider the close encounters that punctuate this picture, interaction where the stakes are high: Sammy's dialogues with Mitzi, Burt, Uncle Boris, Bennie, his sister Reggie, his high school antagonist Logan. Note, as well, a low-angle shot of Sammy gazing at an office window, affirming a threshold moment. It's a figurative doffing of the hat to a certain professional--himself no stranger to letting eyes do the talking--who engaged a kid in a discussion of art and disclosed particulars of perception that were of a piece with the young man's own unrelenting attention to detail. See it as a salute to one picture maker from another, a fellow pilgrim on the way to the horizon that is the silver screen.",

            "content": "Happy Holidays, Streamers! It's that time of year when the movie landscape is crowded with holiday family movies and \"prestige\" pics. Those \"prestige\" pics are the ones attempting to garner enough attention to be considered for the Academy Awards. While The Fabelmans is a family drama, it definitely falls more into the \"prestige\" pic category. It's got everything: Michelle Williams actress-ing; Spielberg Spielberg-ing; coming-of-age tropes including a kid fascinated with a life making art. Oh! And a monkey, I can't forget the monkey. Here's how it went for me.The Fabelmans was directed by Steven Spielberg and co-written by Spielberg and Tony Kushner. There's a lot of prestigious people in mentioned in that sentence. Anyway, that talent sets the bar pretty high for this movie. The Fabelmans tells a semi-autobiographical story of Sammy Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle), a young, Jewish burgeoning film director and his family that happens to be coming apart at the seams. Sammy is introduced to the wonder of movies early and his parents unwittingly cultivate his obsession with motion pictures. Sammy's mother, Mitzi Fabelman (Michelle Williams), is a flighty, loving and passionate mother who sees herself as an artist and encourages Sammy's filmmaking efforts. Burt Fabelman (Paul Dano) is methodical and reasonable and sees Sammy's filmmaking as just a silly hobby. Sammy and his movies capture the highs and lows of his family through the 1950s and 1960s and give the audience insight into the foundation behind the film's director. Spielbergian hijinks ensue.That wasn't a great synopsis, but you get it. It's a coming-of-age story about a boy who wants to become a movie director and how that affects his family. It takes 2 and a half hours to tell this story? These coming-of-age stories can be a dime a dozen, but this one has the added layer of being told by and about the fictionalized family of one of the greatest living American directors. If you are into the Spielberg thing, then The Fabelmans should be catnip for you. If you don't really care about Steven Spielberg, then it may not be that interesting without that hook.Nevertheless, there are great moments throughout The Fabelmans. There are really interesting scenes of teenage Sammy filming and editing his low budget movies. He has some striking ingenuity in directing and adding effects to the early films. The movie tells a compelling story about the difference between capturing truth on film versus living it. There's a strong moral lesson to be learned from Sammy's singlemindedness in pursuing his art at all costs. Gabriel LaBelle does an excellent job of anchoring this movie as the main character. As for the parents, Paul Dano is very good as the mild-tempered and evenhanded Burt. Everything he does makes sense even when his family may be falling apart around him. On the other hand, Michelle Williams is all over the place, manic and grating. That may be the character that Spielberg has created, but it's also the over-the-top, scenery-chewing performance that Michelle Williams is giving.Ultimately, The Fabelmans is a good coming-of-age movie that hits some basic beats. It is elevated for those who are interested in the Steven Spielberg origin story. There are interesting parts about how the young man becomes a filmmaker, but if you don't care about that, then it's just another coming-of-age story to throw on the overflowing pile of them. For Spielberg fans, I say you'll be happy with a big box of popcorn if you venture to the theater. For everyone else, grab a bowl of popcorn for a matinee if you can't wait for it to show up on VOD or your favorite streaming channel.",

No one in here is likable and the plot is competing somewhere between lame and moronic. I suggest watching this only as a study on how to fail without even trying. I really DID want to like it.

There's something peaceable about this film and surprising in the masterful unraveling of the story. Some things you expect to happen, but they don't unfold in an obvious way.

I was just glad to see David Lynch talking about movies and give a really funny moments in the office but thats all. We dont learn more about Spielberg except that he was Jewish and how he believes in things i guess. There were some part who were pretty hilarious like the girl who talked about praying and Jesus stuff( i laughed so hard). But to be honest the whole movie feel like more a comedy movie with some drama and secrets between parents. Nothing more. We talk also briefly about cinema but very superficial. I thought at the beginning the movie was just to learn more about Spielberg and his life in genereal but only his teenager and young adult times are showed nothing more. I need to say that i am pretty disappointed overall and i didnt really think that they mixed comedy, fiction and autobiographic elements and im not a huge fan of that kind of mix; i really prefer something more autobiographic and sometimes we feel that some moments are not necessary and the movie feel a little bit long for nothing.

A similar thing can be said about a director who makes a film about himself. I found it silly, clumsy and not at all insightful into what made one of the greatest film directors ever. The first third comes off like an episode of 1950s Leave it to Beaver, or the Dick Van Dyke Show in that it is cartoonish.It seems that the major family event is marital issues. Yawn. Then the kid gets picked on in school. Yawn. And these are supposed to give us insight into what shaped this man? They don't. The family and school dramas are very low level and passe.The high school grad with the big bully break down scene is just absurd in how unrealistic it is.There certainly are stand out performances by Hirsh and. Williams, but even these are not enough to hold this lumpy mess together. The film comes off as lazy and clumsy covered in 'who cares?' sauce.",

Growing up in an happy environment with mother \"Mitzi\" (Michelle Williams), father \"Burt\" (Paul Dano) and sister \"Natalie\" (Keeley Karsten) they all rub along amiably enough. His father is a developer in the computer industry, and together with their best family friend \"Bennie\" (Seth Rogan) relocate to a better opportunity in Arizona. It's after a family camping trip - and the death of his grandmother - that the young \"Sammy\" is asked to make a short movie from the film he shot whilst they were all messing about in the wilderness. His attention to the detail of his photography gradually reveals something that upsets him, and threatens the very equilibrium of their erstwhile happy family. What now ensues demonstrates how, gradually, all come to terms with his discovery and he determines just where his future career lies. I am not really a fan of Williams - I find her sterile most of the time; but here she is on really good form. The character of \"Mitzi\" is probably the most interesting, certainly the most conflicted - and she delivers it well. There are two lovely little, inspirational in differing ways, cameos from Judd Hirsch and from David Lynch at the end of this film that has a distinct lusciousness to it. Like the performances, the photography and the soundtrack are natural and engaging and could easily convince any of us that a career in film making is possible - indeed, straightforward! I don't know the extent to which it is autobiographical of Steven Spielberg's life, but to be honest I didn't really care. This is just a fine film to watch.",

            "content": "This was supposedly (according to the descriptions in IMDB) loosely based on how Steven Spielberg developed his interest in film and movie-making. The first half of the movie addressed that well and was interesting. Particularly the storyline involving Seth Grogan. Once his character left, the movie's tone changed significantly.The second half of the movie saw the focus shift to the disfunction of the Jewish Fabelman family and their move to California. The tone then shifted from movie making to Sammy's nutty mom, and. Sammy's own difficulty in high school, specifically with two raciest schoolmate bullies who looked to be in their 20's (as did many of the extras who portrayed high school students), and a Jesus-believing hypocritical Christian girl who the non-Jesus believing Sammy falls in love with. Taking cheap shots at Christians seems to be getting common in Hollywood these days, and this movie is no exception!Point is the second half of the movie went off track and, except for a couple of situations, rarely addressed Sammy's growth in moviemaking and became more of a family soap opera. Which was disappointing.Still, the acting in it was very good, particularly from the Fabelman kids and Paul Dano, who was fresh off his role as the psychotic Riddler in \"The Batman\", a 360 degree role reversal. Michelle Williams, however, will probably get all of the attention, and very possibly an Oscar nomination, even though her acting was over the top at times. But still very good. So the story overall was good, filmed nicely, and acted very well. Worth a look. But I'd recommend a matinee.",

            "content": "The Fablemans is an intriguing film. Creating a feature inspired by personal events is not an easy task. There were nice moments, such as the family singing together and celebrating holidays.While it was a treat to watch the new Spielberg film, I was left unsatisfied at the end--not because it was too short, but because it ran on too long, without a clear climactic point nor resolution.Spielberg is one director who knows well how to make films. Not only are they widely popular, but a few of them are quite good and memorable on their critical merits alone. But The Fablemans seems to run on in many sequences when time might have been better devoted to young Sam's budding career. Typically, and significantly,, most well regarded biopics, especially about persons who have made considerable social, political, scientific or creative contributions, not only reveal the hero's early life, but also important steps they have taken to reach their most sought after goals. The Fablemans, on the contrary, spends inordinate amounts of time on Sam's family members without following his progression to where he winds up as a filmmaker. The film could have used more advice in terms of editing as well as screenwriting.When a screenwriter sets out to build a tight story, they need to make a list of possible conflicts or dynamics to choose from. The family content is fine, but it's too long and as a result the film is too scattered. The issue with his mother, for instance did not need to include several minutes of her dancing around in a sheer dress in front of the family and her lover.Speaking of family sequences, Neither Sam as a teen nor his siblings looked much like the parents. Both are fine actors, but maybe not well cast in that sense. The bullying at high school was not fully believable in its extreme form, since an authority figure seems to be nowhere.As for young Sammy, a violent film seems an odd choice to take a five year old to, especially one that has scary dreams.I also think the film would have benefited from a clearer clue than the fantasy-clued title, that it would play fast and loose with titles such as that boldly telling us this is January 10, 1952 since Sammy and his parents return home from a movie at night with Christmas lights on houses, asking Sammy what he wanted for Hanukkah followed by the lighting of the candles with the whole family.Another issue is young Sam's replying to the girlfriend that he was Jewish from the moment of his circumcision when in fact a boy is Jewish by virtue of having a Jewish mother. Indeed, the practice is no longer exclusive to our tribe; rather it is practiced routinely at hospitals across the country.Several of the family scenes verged on stereotypical portrayals of Jews rather than touching, or deeply thought out.As far as the meeting with acclaimed director John Ford, David Lynch's distinctive nasal pitch gives it away and seems comical rather than meaningful. I don't know how factual the verbal interchange was between Ford and Sam/Spielberg, but it seemed petty rather than meaningful.The Fablemans is on the whole captivating in terms of it being about such a famous and accomplished filmmaker. But it lacked in focus and script. I doubt seriously that any big shot in Hollywood would ever look at even a few pages of such script, including Spielberg himself.",

(For instance, I will insist until the day I die that the middle act of Saving Private Ryan drags it down into the middle ranks of Spielberg's filmography, but for most filmmakers it would be the high point of their career.)THE FABLEMANS is not at the level of E. T. (which it occasionally echoes and comments on), JAWS, SCHINDLER'S LIST, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS or even LINCOLN, but it is obviously Spielberg's most personal film and one of the few on which he has taken a screenplay credit. You want to know what formed Spielberg's love of the movies, and what shaped his point of view? Here it all is lovingly spelled out for the viewer, with Spielberg's typically brilliant but not showy direction, terrifically acted by a crackerjack cast. It will tug and your heartstrings, but is generally not mawkish. My only issues with it are that THE FABLEMANS does not possess the subtlety of Spielberg's best works and because it is a \"small\" family drama the bluntness of some of the film's points appears more obvious than it would be in one of Spielberg's epic blockbusters. The movie hurtles through about 15 years of \"Sammy Fableman's\" adolescence (as the older Sammy, Gabriel Bell probably deserves an Oscar nom), yet while sometimes the story feels padded, other times it moves past an interesting story point or a potentially compelling character too quickly-I thought Seth Rogen's \"Uncle Benny\" was especially underwritten.The movie is about 2 hours and 20 minutes and while it is all time well spent, a tighter focus might have made it a masterpiece. Wait for the appearances by Judd Hirsch and (no misprint here) David Lynch. They have three scenes and one scene respectively, but I thought they had the most electrifying moments in the film.",

Like James Cameroon, who waits for years to make a sci-fi film until the special visual effects reach a breakthrough and make his film. Or Chris Nolan, whose many films depend on a series of enigmatic ideas and thoughts, that's why he makes a film every three years. But Spielberg teaches them filmmaking and makes a masterpiece out of nothing that can be admired in any situation. Spielberg made his life the basis of a film to say to the proud and dependent directors of today: I was able to make a film without having a special script or idea and without having amazing special effects, which is more love than all your films.

Uncle Boris did that, sort of. The mother did not. But Uncle Boris' life doesn't seem any more fulfilling than the mother's, who reminded me of the middle character in *The Hours*, except not as well written or played as the Julianne Moore character.

Where were the continuity folks? Contact lenses? Was it intentional? Did they just not think it mattered?

The movie bursts us with artistic passion, making choices between art and reality, it explores strong and relatable family relationship themes, and captured moments that play as a bonding thread in the household and ultimately reshape the meaning of the family's emotional conflicts and dynamics.A subtle masterpiece, this may not be Spielberg's biggest or most show-off kind of movie but it certainly hits all the right spots brilliantly and will stay with you for a while if you connect with it.Spielberg takes us on a very nostalgic felt journey with a close look at how his love for film was influenced and his role within the household and their crisis with living life, pursuing professional choices, and Sammy's own fascinations and priorities, onto the beginning of his emerging career following his aspirations and dreaming big.Cinema is a powerful tool and we can that here. The narrative is very simple yet holds deep emotional layers that can pierce through your heart. The way I connected with it evoked so much in me on a personal level, I felt a resemblance to my younger self nostalgically recalling a vivid childhood memory of watching one of Spielberg's movies which highly affected me at an age where I didn't even understand any bits of what I watched.This relatability factor I think is what makes the movie stand out on a certain level and helps amplify the cinematic experience and the premises it explores.Though I think the runtime might've been a bit long for this type of movie that is not necessarily driven by huge dramatic moments but rather the feelings of it, not the biggest thing to worry about because it was beautiful still.The nostalgic aesthetic wasn't limited to the story, on the contrary, it was driven further by the visuals where Janusz Kaminiski's cinematography makes you wonder beyond the surface.The exquisitely composed frames with the simple blocking of the camera, the long takes, and the classic lighting style translated so much depth both in creating beautiful mesmerizing imagery and in shaping the character's performances and emotional delivery, and help in translating the story through the screen.Michelle Williams's performance was outstanding, the way she embodied her character's complexity was beautifully executed. Gabriel LaBelle also did a beautiful job, his emotional depth was on point, and so did Paul Dano.Symbolically, I believe the \"camera\" as an object also had a performative role in the movie, the way Sammy used it wasn't just to capture regular memories, but it was also his way to discover life through glamorized visualization that showed realities and determined his future pursuits.",

Use the grandparent and great-grandparents aged actors for grandparent and great-grandparent aged roles.

Given a camera from his mother to help as an outlet for his creativity, Sammy manages to capture an act that will tear his family apart if shown. A love letter to the events of his past, director Steven Spielberg uses Sammy to relay to the audience the pains of growing up Jewish in a post-World War II era as well as the joys of his life's calling.With the continuing trend of older directors looking back and retelling imagined versions of their youth (Belfast, Armageddon Time), Spielberg proves yet again that he's one of the masters of the craft. Showing the slow dissolving relationship of the Fabelman family as contrasted with Sammy's growing love and talent for storytelling gives the movie the necessary weight while not being shy to inject moments of humor throughout. A point of interest that Spielberg intentionally plays with is the magic of movies as a use of escapism; for most moviegoers, a movie is a great way to forget life's ills for a couple of hours and be swept away to far flung lands said audience may never get the chance to experience for themselves. Unfortunately, in The Fabelmans, it's Sammy's discovery while editing film that really kickstarts the unravelling of the family. Full of heart, emotion, a love of movies and the process behind the making of them, The Fabelmans never gets too saccharine or overly sentimental; Spielberg rides a perfect line between dreamy nostalgia and melancholic remembrance.Starring Gabriel LaBelle, The Fabelmans shows the makings of an excellent young actor who's poised to have an amazing career. Confident, funny, cold, and extremely vulnerable at times, LaBelle is the movie's brightest spot. With his easygoing charm, it's easy for audiences to immediately latch onto LaBelle as his portrays Sammy Fabelman, the Steven Spielberg stand-in for the story. There's times Spielberg perfectly captures the wonder on LaBelle's face, primarily when Sammy is shooting or editing a movie. While not as strong in some of the film's more emotional scenes, specifically those with his parents, LaBelle still manages to provide an overall impressive performance, especially in the shoes he's filling.Also starring Michelle Williams and Paul Dano as Sammy's parents, it's not immediately clear why either actor took these roles. It's not until late in the film where Michelle Williams really starts heating up and giving a great performance that it's clear to see why she accepted the role. Williams cruises along through the movie, but in two powerful scenes kicks into a higher gear where the audience is reminded that she's a four-time Academy Award nominated actress. There are depths of sadness to Mitzi Fabelman, and Williams swims those depths with the skill of a well-seasoned sailor. The pain, the attempts to hide the pain, and the depression that battles Mitzi throughout the film make for some of the more poignant scenes in the movie.For his part, Paul Dano's performance is incredibly subdued in a way that only Paul Dano can do. Fresh off his take as The Riddler in Matt Reeves' The Batman, Dano does a come about-face here as the soft spoken, loving father figure of the The Fabelmans' household. As a technological wizard, Burt Fabelman uses his skills and saavy to increase his family's station in life, although some of the family moves seem to have ulterior motives behind them. While never spoken aloud in Burt's presence, there's a secret that hangs about the family that Dano manages to squeeze every drop of doubt from. With an incredible internal performance, this role of Burt Fabelman is one of Dano's best.It'd be criminal to not give a mention to veteran actor Judd Hirsch. Appearing in only three scenes in the film, it's the second scene, the meat of his time on screen, that Hirsch steals every bit of shine from Gabriel LaBelle and takes him to acting class. Charming, funny, and still deadly serious, Sammy's great uncle Hersch lays down for Sammy the two paths that face him in life. Almost a monologue with brief interruptions from Sammy, Boris provides one of the year's best scenes as a character who drops a bit of backstory for Mitzi as well as being the catalyst for Sammy. Hirsch's performance speaks to decades of screen and theater work, nailing his timing while dispensing his life advice and had he more screen time, Hirsch could've had a clear shot at a Supporting Actor nomination.Directed by Steven Spielberg, The Fabelmans shows a storyteller entering his sixth decade of moviemaking still retaining the ability to produce stories that inspire awe and wonder. It's never easy to adapt and fictionalize one's life into a story for mass consumption, but Spielberg does so in a way that neither paints him as a saint nor asks the audience for pity. While it's unlikely that Spielberg will reveal which elements are real, which are embellished, and which are completely fabricated, that fact that all three blend so seamlessly together shows just how he and writer Tony Kushner are (this being their fourth collaboration behind Munich, Lincoln, and West Side Story). From a directorial standpoint, Spielberg doesn't bring anything new or flashy out of the toolbox. Unlike West Side Story, which features some impressive feats of cinematography, timing, and coordination, here in The Fabelmans he turns it down a notch, preferring to keep the focus off his talents and on his fictionalized family.Overall, The Fabelmans is one of the year's more heartfelt stories. A fictionalized retelling of the youth of one of the best living filmmakers, Spielberg shows both the ugly sides and the bright sides of his life in a way that keeps the audience engaged and locked in. Knowing how the story ends makes the journey even more entertaining; seeing Sammy's love and appreciation for filmmaking blossom and mature gives the audience an insight into the life of a man who's dedicated his to the art of storytelling. With excellent performances from the three main leads, as well as one powerfully raw scene with Judd Hirsch, The Fabelmans stands as one the best movies to start winding down the year.",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg has made this movie by basing the main character off of himself and from what I've read, it's pretty much the real story of his childhood and his family.This is a good movie. I mean it's nice to learn more about one of my favourite filmmakers. Steven Spielberg is one of the best directors out there and he's proven it again and again. And if this was a movie he really wanted to make, obviously I'm all for it. But if I forget for a second that this movie is about Spielberg, and made by Spielberg himself, there isn't really much beneath the surface.I'm a bit disappointed from this movie. From the title \"The Fabelmans\" I should have known that this movie is going to be a drama about Spielberg's family, rather than an origin story about Spielberg himself. The family drama though was what I disliked about this movie. I mean it's fine for sure, but the actions of certain characters are very confusing at times. And really, the drama doesn't have much of a connection with Spielberg's filmmaking journey, which was running on the side as a sub-plot. And the slow pace of certain scenes, and thus the long length of the entire movie didn't make much sense to me either. I tried thinking a lot about what could be the meaning behind it but I couldn't really get it.Everything about Spielberg making films as a child though was perfect. As someone who loves filmmaking, I loved seeing his passion for movies. I loved seeing him figure out how to create certain scenes, and how to bring heart and realism to those scenes. There's an entire scene where he's shooting a war movie, and then he's explaining the actor, exactly what emotion he wants to portray in this scene, I loved that entire sequence.Overall I thought it was okay. I went with my friends and they liked it, so my thoughts could change a bit on a rewatch.",

It was also nice to see Seth Rogen in such a role that was just the opposite of who he is normally. He's normally unfunny and I think such roles suit him the best.

This gives the likes of Paul Dano, Michelle Williams, Judd Hirsch and (surprisingly) Seth Rogan a chance to shine in their very dialogue-heavy scenes (with both Williams and Hirsch being nominated for Oscars).It is clear that this is a deeply emotional experience for Spielberg as he focuses his attentions on the details of the proceedings - especially of the young Sam putting together his short films. These are loooong sequences that, quite frankly, just didn't interest me as much as it must have interested Spielberg.What is interesting are those brief parts of the film where something happens - but those times are few and far between. When they do happen, Williams (especially) and Dano shine. As does Hirsch in his brief appearance in this film. Also...without spoiling...there is a very famous modern day Director who plays a very famous old-time Director at the end of his career who gives Spielberg some sage advice. This scene at the end of the film is worth the price of admission alone.It is for these moments that The Fabelmans is worth the watch - otherwise, you'll have to indulge Spielberg in his walk down memory lane. Kind of like when your In-Laws pull out the slide projector.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

Based loosely on Steven Spielberg's adolescence, it follows the story of Sammy Fabelman, an aspiring young filmmaker who discovers a family secret and is forced to confront difficult truths about his past.The film features excellent performances from its cast, particularly from its young lead, Gabriel LaBelle, who brings a nuanced vulnerability to the role, and Michelle Williams who is brilliant as Sammy's confused mother.The cinematography is stunning, bringing an ethereal beauty to its scenes that transport viewers into another time. The movie also features captivating music from the era, tying in with the film's overall theme of nostalgia and remembrance. The intricate set design and cinematography also help to paint an effective picture of life in 1950s Arizona.The Fabelmans is far from perfect due to its almost too-glossy look and the feeling that it doesn't dig deep enough, but it succeeds due to its strong performances and smart storytelling. It's a film that offers an inspiring glimpse into the power of film and its ability to help people confront difficult truths. Overall, I found it enjoyable and thought-provoking, and it left me feeling a little wiser for the experience.",

Now for me I watched the trailer in cinema about 5 times and loved seeing it show up each time but finally watching it was definitely worthwhile. The acting from each character was amazing and Michelle Williams really stood out for me in this as Sammys mother, especially when there's this shot towards the final few parts where she just looks dead in the camera with this look in her eyes and knowing the context behind it truly made me choke up, fully deserving of her Oscar nomination. I also felt like I had some similarities that resonated with me in some parts of the film like with Sam and his relationship with his parents individually which I won't get into but it hit a certain part of me which made me fall even more in love with this film. I also have to say about the outstanding shots and scenes in this film and the complexity and beauty behind them and also with seeing west side story in cinema also having featured those incredible shots like the dancing scenes in the gym hall, I can't help but hope to never see the day come where Spielberg stops making films.

It's a scene which captures the essence of cinema in a simple conversation between the film maker (Sammy Fabelman) and his subject (a guy Sammy hates). 'Why did you film me this way?', the guy asks, implying he is not happy with the film. 'What way?', Sammy answers. 'I filmed what I saw'.It proves that Sammy Fabelman has put an extra layer of meaning over the simple images. He filmed what he saw, but there's more to it than that. Of course, this shows how talented he is. Film making is exactly that: adding a meaning to images.'The Fabelmans' is not a profound cinematographic document about the secret of succesful films. It's a personal movie about a family falling apart. Film, and what is captured on film, is an element of that process. But, knowing that Sammy Fabelman is Steven Spielberg, you can't help thinking about what Spielberg wants us to know about his style of film making. He shows how he learns to control every aspect of it, from coaching actors to using technical tricks, from finding good shot angles to smart editing. We see it all happening in 'The Fabelmans', right until the very last shot.Apart from letting us learn a lot about Spielberg as a film maker, 'The Fabelmans' is also a nice coming-of-age movie. Of course, it helps that Spielberg's youth is a good story in itself, with enough drama, fun and emotion in it for 2,5 hours of entertainment. I can imagine that for a director, making a good film about your own family requires a completely different approach than making a good film about a giant shark or a friendly alien creature. But Spielberg has shown many times before how versatile he can be, and how he succeeds in different genres. This autobiograpical movie is once more a case in point.",

            "content": "The Fabelmans is a new drama directed, co-written and produced by Steven Spielberg, director of E. T. Jaws and Schindler's List.Growing up after World War II, Sammy Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle) discovers his passion for films and later learns to make his own films. For example, he uses his knowledge and talents of movies to express his passion and emotions, but while filming he learns a family secret that can completely change his family life.With this film, Steven Spielberg shows his own history and how he himself developed a passion for films and making his own films. Fans of films and people with a passion for films or making their own films will find themselves in this film. In addition to his passion for filmmaking, Spielberg has also incorporated the family drama from his own history into the film. These two different storylines have a good cause and effect relationship, but unfortunately do not always work in a balanced way next to each other. One storyline can sometimes take over the other a bit too much, so that the balance of the story is sometimes lost. Although this can take the film out of focus, it does respond appropriately to how filmmakers sometimes find it difficult to combine their passion and private life.In addition to his own family history of and discovering his passion for film, Spielberg has also incorporated the history of his own film career into film. For example, he links back to well-known films that he has directed himself or the connections he has built up during his career. For example, with the soundtrack he links back to his collaboration with composer John Williams, who has provided the soundtracks for many Spielberg-directed films. John Williams was supposed to retire too, but he came back for this film, of which he also made the soundtrack.Spielberg has also portrayed the film appropriately, making the different times in which the film takes place seem credible. He does this with appropriate film sets, hairstyles and clothing of the film cast. He also does this by having the main character keep changing film cameras. With the times, the technologies kept improving resulting in more and more modern movie cameras to capture movies in newer and different ways.The cast members of the film are also well cast, because they resemble the people of whom they play a fictional character. For example, Gabriel LaBelle closely resembles a younger version of what Steven Spielberg looked like in his younger years. Furthermore, Gabriel LaBelle also plays the role of someone who is more concerned with his passion for film and making his own films. Instead of actually getting into things that most average people are into during their lives. Michelle Williams and Paul Dano also play his parents well, who try to be there for their children despite their personal problems.",

            "content": "After a career spanning almost six decades, Steven Spielberg strikes gold yet again with this autobiography that feels deeply personal.The Fabelmans, very aptly named as it gives focus and attention to seemingly all characters equally, opens with a shot of a family in front of a cinema. We see a mother and a father excited to take their son to his first expedition to the movies. They're excited for him because they know how seeing your first film can be a very special experience. And it is. For the young Sammy, pictures of a train crashing into a car haunt him and he just can't seem to be able to get them out of his mind. He feels scared, excited, confused and decides that he should take the matter into his own hands, so he takes his father camera and recreates the scene with his toys and shoots it. It's incredible how Spielberg managed to capture a lot of revealing moments about the characters and present them to the audience so transparently. The moment Sammy falls in love with film, the moment he stops seeing his mother as an all-powerful and faultless parent and starts seeing her as a human being for the first time, and when his uncle so vividly explains to him that he'll pursue his dreams or be miserable if he doesn't.Gabriel LaBelle does a fine job in his role of Sammy, Seth Rogen is a pleasant surprise in a somewhat different role of Bennie to what he usually does, Paul Dano does a great job of portraying the father of the family but the absolute star of the show is Michelle Williams. And what can you say about Steven Spielberg himself. After doing so many different films so well, he manages to do another original and new story that truly cements him as one of the greatest directors of all time, all the while giving viewers that magical feeling of happiness that stems from knowing you're watching something special on the big screen. Thank you, Mr. Spielberg for making me rediscover my love for the art of cinema and putting a smile on my face.This is a must see for anyone considering themselves a genuine fan of film and cinema, so if you liked Nuovo Cinema Paradiso this is a film for you to see, and if you haven't, well, go and watch it the first time you get a chance.",

I honestly believe that many people with good reviews are like the people standing in front of paintings that mean nothing and start forcing meanings over them. I love Steven Spielberg. But this is just a bad movie. I don't know what else to say to fill the 600 words. The movies quality dropped significantly since 2020 but movies reviews are getting higher. This is strange. These days the minimum score that a movie should have on IMDB to be considered a possibly good movie (for me) is 7, and 10 if it is a Bollywood movie. But now I believe no number is safe.",

The young protagonist is confronted by the dilemma created by his talented mother and a school environment which makes antisemitism an issue which prevents any other consideration. There are very engaging scenes and what emerges at any moment of this story is how driven the young protagonist is. Nothing seems to stop him.

That turned out to be a mistake.This dull film drags so badly, one would swear it lasted five hours instead of two and a half. The biggest drag was Michelle Williams. I certainly hope Mr. Spielberg didn't think he was portraying his mother in a sympathetic way. His high school years seemed as unreal as unreal could be, too. It was like watching a really bad high school and beach party movie combined.The film reminded me of poorly written memoirs, where the memoirists could not care less if their reading audience liked their book or even understood it. No, the most important thing was for them to tell their childhood story exactly how they wanted to tell it. Steven Spielberg obviously tells his childhood story in this movie exactly how he wanted to tell it. I hope at least he's happy with it. Personally, I would like my $6 back.",

Spielberg is \"Sammy\" in the film, played by Zoryan as a young boy, then by LaBelle in his teenage years. We follow him growing up with his 3 sisters and being raised by parents Burt (Dano) & Mitzi (Williams). We get plenty of insight into the family's life and it's good to see Burt & Mitzi as actual characters with true limitations and motivations, rather than just as cliched mum & dad.Some good cameos from Uncle Boris (Hirsch), Uncle Bennie (Rogen) and the famous director at the end. The film has some funny moments, but is primarily a family drama, following the ups and downs of a regular family, caught up in the start of the computer era, with Burt & Bennie working for GE & IBM. The sisters maybe don't get as much time, as we follow Sammy starting to make 8mm films, but they feel real enough as characters.The move to California as a high-schooler presents new challenges for Sammy, but the ending is satisfying and doesn't take us all the way up to 'Jaws', but does show how he gets on the Hollywood path. Good performances all round, nothing too exceptional and possibly slightly too long, but enjoyable.",

            "review_title": "Being Spielberg",
            "content": "It is maybe like \"Being John Malkovich\" when you make a movie about your life. I saw this Spielberg outing as a chance for him to show off his filmmaking skills, justifying the great amount of accolades given to him. How he told this story was more important to me than the actual subject. A gifted filmmaker in his 6th decade of productivity, you respect the places he has taken movie audiences, and you respect that he has shown growth in his discipline over time. The first thing you may not be able to avoid is the similarity in other directors who are infatuated with those first memories that sparked their career. I like those films if they are done well. Knowing how a filmmaker saw their world when they were young helps you to understand why they films in a particular way.For instance, when your parents have a troubled relationship, it shapes how you depict modern families in movies like \"Close Encounters\" and \"E. T.\". Spielberg has become a natural in making easily digestible stories. With great appreciation to Spielberg's longtime editor Michael Kahn, there is a fluidity to the pacing of his movies, choreographing scenes to address the material in an efficient way. As much as I caught Spielberg touches, I sometimes found myself immersed in certain scenes, only later realizing I have been witnessing a long stretch of time occurring in a single shot, for instance.The reason I got immersed in parts of this film was due to flashbacks of my own life. I found some amazing similarity with this partially dysfunctional family compared to my own. I had a workaholic Dad who expected me to follow in his footsteps. Instead I got involved in the arts. I was a professionally trained piano player not a filmmaker. In this film it is the mother who has the musical dimension to the household. But my mother was the one who really nurtured my artistic abilities, and pursued a career in painting herself.The portrait of Spielberg as a child showed he didn't need a lot of nurturing to pursue his destiny. I had my mind set on music and worked my own way into that world. Another connection I had with this film is that Spielberg was bullied in school. I suffered from bulling myself and both of us ultimately prevailed. What helped to make this movie a breeze instead of a slog is keeping the running time to a relatively reasonable length. It was also a breeze because the story was structured to emphasise the aspects of Spielberg's world that affected the way he is now, more than the story of his introduction and pursuit of filmmaking. To a certain degree, Spielberg already accomplished the story of how he made his first home movies in the film \"Super 8\". The Fablemans makes a big deal about recreating a spectacular train wreck sequence from the film \"The Greatest Show On Earth\". Spielberg in real life finally fulfilled that obsession with the train wreck sequence in \"Super 8\". Nevertheless, this film has moments showing how Spielberg had the proper instincts to be a gifted filmmaker.With the help of a trusted screenwriter, the story focuses on Spielberg's family. The ensemble work reminded me of a good Woody Allen film, where each character represents different aspects of the folly of life. Conversations at the dinner table can have profound impacts on a person's view of life. The hard truth is exposed to a child, which is a part of growing up. So the first half of the film turns the lense toward the family, then changes the focus to Spielberg himself as he become a young adult. Even then the steps he took to succeed in the film industry take a backdrop to his awkwardness in social situations. Having gone through this myself, I understand how stifling this is to a person's potential. It is important to stand up to the bully. I know I am a better person when I did so myself.So I enjoyed this film. The only real misstep is how the film addresses the central conflict in the plot.MINOR SPOILERIt is made clear in the first act the mother is in love with the husband's best friend. When the father announces their move to Phoenix, the she insists his friend comes along. Most audience members got the cue there was something between them.END MINOR SPOILERThis conflict slowly grows, culminating in an unnecessarily extended sequence where the Mother's secret is discovered when Spielberg is editing a family camping trip he filmed. The confrontation with this revelation is also a little clunky. But in truth, that is probably how Spielberg remembers it, and was very specific in how it was shown. What was also just little disappointing was the more conventional shooting style. Framing and movement was not very adventurous. The Spielberg touch on his own autobiography was absent, but the story was interesting enough to enjoy it on that level. Great performances by the entire cast also displays Spielbergs gift with working with actors-. He also defies convention by effectively working with the three no-nos: Crowds, Children, and Animals.",

Its just ok.Visually, clearly Spielberg is more than competent though nothing really special.As usual, I personally hated the way its coded which character we should like and be apathetic too, which is very Spielberg. The story perhaps is the weirdest and weakest portion of the film. It just goes for the emotional gut punches and it never really relish to it or much precedent. Sadly, it made the film bizarrely paced and uneventful. The dialogue is pits too. It also weirdly hateful of the dad character. I felt that there is a real detachment that Spielberg has for that character. He is almost always left on his own with his thoughts, which is unlike the mother who is saved time and time again by external voices, especially from this roman \u00e0 clef's representation of Spielberg himself.Acting wise, there is nothing really to write about. Williams is subpar due to the uneven script. Dano is fine. Gabrielle Labelle was competent but would have been better if the writing was build up better.Personally, this film left me really cold. Its a nice footnote but lacks the self reflection that would pushed it into another level. I feel really sad about it given that these are deeply personal stories from his life. Looking back few years from now, especially with how the New Hollywood directors are going their 70s to 80s, it would be just a few years and they will be dunzo and I still do not feel he reached his highest potential. He cannot fully let go of his inhibitions and expectation but I guess he will always have his \"blockbusters\".",

            "content": "The major problem of THE FABELMANS is an inconsistent point-of-view. It took a long time for the audience to warm up to this movie at the sparsely attended matinee I was a part of. For the first half hour of the movie, I was the only one laughing. I don't think the audience knew whether or not it was supposed to be funny. The director is Stephen Spielberg. The screenplay is by Tony Kushner. It is not a good mix of sensibilities. Spielberg's trademark is \"warm and fuzzy\"; Kushner's is \"cold and resentful.\" These two points-of-view battle throughout this movie about a film maker's coming-of-age. The movie starts off as a gentle comedy about a 1950s Jewish family in suburban New Jersey who relocate to the West for the father's career. Then the family's oldest child (and only son) falls in love with film-making. The parents are impressed with the son's efforts at making a film for his Boy Scout merit badge. The mother, a frustrated artist (pianist and dancer) encourages her son; the father, while impressed, considers his son's film-making a hobby and tries to discourage it and steer his son toward something that would lead to a more secure and lucrative future. But when the mother's mother dies, the father encourages his son to make a film about a family camping trip in the hope that it will cheer up the mother, who is obviously having a serious emotional breakdown. In the process of making his film, the boy inadvertently stumbles upon an unsettling and unsavory family secret. It is at this point that THE FABELMANS becomes a sort of teenage version of Antonioni's BLOW UP or Coppola's THE CONVERSATION. The screenplay is very episodic with several episodes that could stand alone as one-act plays. There are a lot of elements of this story that don't all really mesh: an artist's struggle to find his own voice, the problems of being the only Jewish people in a sea of WASPs, the challenge of being the target of teenage bullying, and the uncomfortable knowledge that all is not as it seems on the surface. I respected the movie more than I liked it. Although it is extremely well-done with the smooth professionalism we've come to expect from Spielberg, ultimately, I was disappointed. I'll rate it a 6 and a half out of 10.",

And it's difficult, because according to my humble, inexperienced and amateur eye, it's a film that contains insurmountable elements, but also other quite questionable ones.No one could question the story that Spielberg wants to tell about himself, even if he uses a little bit of fiction to accommodate certain events. However, the story of The Fabelmans seems too generic and unoriginal to me. The boy who dreams of a certain profession; family or social obstacles that prevent him from carrying out those dreams; the father figure or mentor who accompanies the protagonist on his way; the realization of the dream in a round ending. The film not only lacks originality, but is also wildly scattered, wandering from one emotional conflict to the next, all contributing to the main thread being fuzzy and distracting. Nor can it be said that through family dramas the protagonist channels his tribulations into his movies, because at one point there were so many dramas that making movies was almost discarded. Honestly, I would have preferred Spielberg to write a totally fictional story but with a better finish to its purpose, because The Fabelmans can be a love letter to parental divorce rather than to the early life of a filmmaker.Leaving all this aside, as I said at the beginning, there are also elements of unsurpassed quality. Spielberg does what he knows how to do with mastery and passion. This is probably one of the best film directing jobs I've seen in recent years. The photography also stands out enormously. As for the performances, Michelle Williams is the one who takes the laurels over her co-stars, who actually weren't bad at all. The editing was a bit weak, showing continuity little details, but the rest of the technicalities are from a decent level to impeccable.In the final sum, this film seems worth seeing more for its technical details than for its story. I recommend you follow the camera trajectories, the frame transitions, the different pans, the framing and all those wonderful details that Spielberg gives us, who I hope will win the Oscar for best direction, but not for best film.",

Some sequence' s development reminded me a lot of Fanny And Alexander, because of some lyrical solutions of that film.All the characters that Sammy founds out through the film are funny and great(with the emphasis on David Lynch' s hilarious cameo). Steven Spielberg proves once more that he haves the universal power to tell a story, he is probably the best on managing the camera and all that is a result of the partnership between Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg. However, the collaboration that most shines through this and probably the most of Steven's work is the one with John Williams.Probably the aspect that makes The Fabelmans so adorable is the fact that it's by it's whole a sincere and passional movie about how we love things, be it a film, your family, friends, or our most personal memories.

Right after the wheels starts to rotate, the movie starts to grip you and tries to steer you slowly but steadily down the plot while maintaining the grip. As the movie continues to the second act things start to move at a decent pace while throwing bits of spices here and there. The story presents itself as a big main course right in front of you with a strong smell but as it moves further it starts to lose the smell and so does the taste. All the characters that appeared right from the start played a beautiful part in making you enjoy even the tiny bits of emotion through the frames, and for that, all the praise and credits go to actors starting from Paul Dano to Michelle Williams and everyone else. Coming to director Steven Spielberg has not only created just another good harmony but a piece of art that holds a fair potential to make you sit and let itself unfold until it reaches the horizon. Talking about the other departments, the camera work, cinematography, and everything else only put more spice into the dish to create an even better service. All in all The Fabelmans gives you a space to enjoy a story which unfolds in a decent way but enjoys itself while it lasts.",

A beautiful movie about a moviemaker by the moviemaker himself for the moviemakers & movie lovers across globe. It tells the story of young Spielberg, who was born with it, he's fascinated by the movie camera, he could present any stories interestingly and all he needed was inspiration. The two most powerful moments in the film that will become cult moments, (1) that scene where Sammy aims the projector at his open palms using his hands as a temporary screen to watch the film more closely. (2) when Sammy notices his mother's affair with his uncle while cutting the film he shot, which he didn't notice when he was capturing, metaphorically saying ' you notice more in editing room than in production when you see them objectively with a different perspective(a sign of an amateur filmmaker) and its saying the camera captures everything '. This movie proves Spielberg wasn't only living his life but also viewing it as film all his life, finally revealing us his secrets from childhood and personal life. Writing, Cinematography, Acting, Production Design everything was so old school like classics.A must watch for every picture-maker, movie lovers & Spielberg fans. And loved the last shot & movement, \"it's interesting when the horizon is at the bottom or the top.\" Throughout the film it was in the middle which was boring but as soon as he met his idol he changed it to what he was taught.",

I think it must be nice to have so much money to glorify your story to the point that things that are so common in every day life, seem to be interesting.I'm guessing, that if this is Spielberg's way of telling his life, we'll get to Jaws in The Fablemans 5.",

Given the age demographic, The high school angst also seemed over the top and considerably over thought.

Co-written by Spielberg and frequent writing partner Tony Kushner, Steven's analogue is Sammy Fabelman. There seem to be two major goals here, convey how Sammy was captivated by cinema very early on in his life and re-live how he used to make home movies during his adolescent into young adulthood. The second goal is to display the disenchantment of growing up, learning that your parents are faulty human beings (divorce plays a huge role in the film) and the world is a mean place. The two strands drive the film and ultimately come together in a pretty satisfying way by the end. That would be my key phrase for the film \"pretty satisfying.\" As one would expect, the cinematography is beautiful, thoughtful, and always contains a shot or two that surprises in its power (this seems to come to Spielberg naturally). The score, art direction, and acting are all good too. At the end of the day though, it was all a bit...well pedestrian to me. The \"coming of age\" genre is filled with strong entries and as much as I love Spielberg, his story isn't all that exciting in cinematic terms - it's pretty satisfying. With the knowledge we have now about the things Spielberg feels was vital in his development, 2002's Catch Me If You Can is probably the more fascinating and insightful vessel for Steven than we thought then.",

Its sad to see his decline.Yet another flop from Spielberg, this is what happens when you only make movies for yourself and not the audience. At least his last flop, 'West Side Story', was less dull, even if it was the most needless film ever made. Why repaint the Mona Lisa?This movie is just one annoying scene after an another, where you end up shouting at the screen. For example the 'chasing the tornado' scene , the 'boys in the theatre' scene, the 'mother dancing in front of the car' scene, and the scene with John Ford were you're screaming, 'the horizon is on the top'.It's overlong with pointless scenes of Spielberg, I mean Fabelman, editing, sometimes over the never ending piano playing of his mother. I found out later the music was by John Williams, wow, even he's losing his touch.In this movie we dont have one annoying uncle, we have two. Annoying Uncle one, played by Seth Rogan, who is basically playing himself. The movie has Rogan as the most hilarious uncle in the world, well supposedly, although he doesnt do or say anthing actually funny, but everyone is in stiches at his every word.Annoying Uncle Two is played by Judd Hirsch, who the moment you see getting out of a car, you know exactly what he's going to do, and he does it, think annoying dad from 'Independence Day' , but with an accent. He must be a shoo-in for the Golden Rasperry.More scenes of the young Spielberg, I mean Fabelman, making kids movies, and believe it or not, this is a lot duller that it sounds.The overacting in this film is taken to a new level. Gabriel LaBelle seems to think he's playing the Young Woody Allen, not the young Steven Spielberg. Michelle Williams, who is usually amazing, acts like she's been told to turn the overacting up to 11. And so many scenes are just clumsy and badly conceived.It seems like the days of Spielberg making entertaing movies that an audience might enjoy are well and truly over.

Seth Rogan (who can't act worth beans) plays the role of Williams friend and eventual love interest.Judd Hirsch has been nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor for his role in this film.

Perhaps some would rather watch something more lighthearted like a comedy or more action-filled like a Marvel movie but if your kind of movie is emotional and a kind of dramatic. Then yes, go watch it, it's exactly what you're looking for.Spielberg will always find a way to inspire...even his own life is an inspiring story worth watching. Go get your ticket for the cinema...it's totally worth it.",

Thank to his genious dad's success the family was comfortable and he got almost everything he wanted, including, of course, the chance to make movies even as a kid.He was, in his high school years, bullied by 2 boys for being Jewish and his parents divorced - both events a depicted at lenth but quite superficially in this movie - such were his troubles. There was simply not much in this story that made it either compelling or moving, all the more so as the movie is so long...I'm happy for Mr. Spielberg that he become so successful and he did make some wonderful movies. This one, though - despite pretty good acting by the leads - is all in all dissapointing.",

The audience figures out the \"secret\" fairly quickly and the making of movies really does not have the \"power\" you'd expect aside from Sam being defended by a jock. The entire cast is excellent. The script could have been honed in a different manner to include the entire family.. especially Paul Dani's character versus Michelle Williams character of the mother who irritated the heck out of me as some scenes with her dragged on too long.A one time watch for me.

However, the kid at the center, the stand in for Steven Spielberg, just isn't that interesting.This is no dig at the actors who portray him. They do what they can. And, hell,maybe growing up Spielberg really was just a kid interested in film and not much else. However, as far as a character goes. He is a bit of a bore. Even when faced with antisemitic harassment his response is dull. If not, mystifying! At one point he makes a film glorifying a person who once punched him out. A response to the situation even the picture doesn't understand.Still, that doesn't in anyway sink the film. Though Michelle Williams's crazy mama routine comes damn close. But, again, if that's the way it was. That's the way it was. Personally, I don't know how Papa Spielberg put up with that woman for more than a week let alone married someone so exhausting.I don't maybe being exposed to that level of crazy is what prepares one for a life in the entertainment industry.

It's also true that many of his films have dealt with \"coming of age\" themes before and he's sensitive to their nuances.It's no surprise then that \"The Fabelmans\" is entertaining and joyous. It captures Spielberg's upbringing in all of its anarchic glory. At the same time some events cast shade over the happiness just as in real life.However this doesn't exactly make for a compelling, dramatic story and really it could all have been wrapped up in a TV movie.

It was beautiful, inspirational and well written. Loved the cast, dialogue and themes. I'm rooting this movie for Best Picture, Director, Actress and Original Screenplay.

If you're tired of Spielberg's dramatic overreaching from his material over the last 20 years, this will not make you think he's \"matured\" in any way.It breaks my heart to see the \"Love Letter\" of his past become victim to the melodrama and conveniently simplistic nature of his movie-making behaviors. Even today. Darnit, that's a shame. Why can't this guy pay attention to how false his movies are, once you get past nicely presented cinematography and predictable story arcs?If you are tired of his \"schtick\" up to this point, this movie won't make you think differently.

I was initially confused about the Best Supporting Actor nomination of Judd Hirsch because he was in it for about a minute. The uncle character's dialogue is very important and is actually echoed through the end of the movie, it's very important to the main character's development, so I guess it makes sense.

The story was great because of how personal it was to Spielberg. Dano was the standout of the movie along with Hirsch. All around solid movie but didn't blow me away like he has done before.

Maybe he's just too close to the subject matter to be able to tell his own story.There are flashes of brilliance here. Michelle Williams brings a terrifying delight to the slowly falling to pieces mother. Like many women she hides it so well, until she is dancing around a campfire in a nightgown on a family camping trip. Most of the family watches entranced, even the husband, and of course, out comes the camera. One of the daughters is watching from the tent crying, because she seems to understand mom is cuckoo and this is not just more campfire entertainment.Judd Hirsch makes an all too brief appearance as an estranged uncle. I wish he'd had more than 6 minutes of screen time, he's a genius.The rest of the movie is a meandering trip through an antisemitic high school to a Jesus loving girlfriend to the shocking revelation that tears the Fableman's apart. Truthfully, we don't know how any other Fableman's feel about the shocking revelation because this show is all about Sam and his mother and so little time is spent on the rest of the Fableman's. The other Fableman's are present, but mostly in the background, which is a shame.As with the plodding Nomadland, I'm sure that this will win an Oscar, and I'm sad to say the rest of field is disappointing. I found Banshee's, All Quiet, T\u00e1r, and Triangle of Sadness all inexplicably boring. I didn't finish All Quiet or T\u00e1r because they were literally painful to watch.

Also, we have a memoir on one of the most prolific directors of our time, directed Steven Spielberg himself. When these two things are combined, it makes for a great picture. Even though it is 2 and a half hours long the time flew by and the story kept me engaged the entire time. Also, the performances the entire cast gives is top tier. Michelle Williams though is the real standout. She could easily win the Oscar for Best Actress. Even though it's Spielberg's story, she is basically the second main character. As an avid watcher and lover of film, this is by far my favorite of the year. Spielberg put so much of himself into making this and it really shows.

Rather directly, he went on semi-autobiography direction whereas he can transfer his own story into representative characters, even if they're mostly still identifiable through his perspective. Triumphant once again, we're given the film-loving roots plus the straining difficulties stemming from personal, discouraging affairs, and the genuine nostalgia of our own growth with thorough touches refusing to leave any unresolved notes. We're introduced to his inspirations and managed to pick out subtle references to his previously acclaimed classics, as part of his cinematic venture's thoroughness whilst revisiting his past and curve it as a narrative.\n\nPraiseworthy for all it can be, it seems Spielberg's main aim was towards the performative showcases perfectly embodying the self and spiritual identification only he can see happily like opening a time capsule to his past that led him onto an amazing path. Remarkably cast and brilliantly performed, particularly few at their best, as they're the true center in this honest, exceptionally scripted intimate portrait under the maintained trademarked magic dimmed down to a more personal level. If we were to determine where this film would rank in defining its release year's best of the best, it to show the formation of a cinephile's originated love that helps nurtured the cinema whilst reliving those nostalgic beginnings of mostly cherished times then deciding to project those memories personally and faithfully dramatized for a full circle momentum.

            "content": "One of Steven Spielberg's outstanding characteristics besides being a pioneer and a master director, especially in his works of old is his versatility. He has dipped his feet in almost all kinds of genres and has succeeded in his own right \u2013 science fiction to top them all, adapted screenplays, original war-time stories, adventures, et al appealing to an audience of all ages. It wasn't going to be too long until we would have seen him creating something based on his own formative days.\n\"The Fabelmans\" is pretty much his story shadow-played through a fictional family. One would have expected this sooner from him, but apprehension of the possibility that such a personal creation could hurt his parents held him back, even though his sister Anne had written something for him to direct almost a couple of decades back. His mother and father passed away in 2017 and 2020 respectively.\nThe film starts with the little boy Sammy's first brush with cinema, and his awe and anxiety towards the scary images on the silver screen, way back in 1952. One can possibly relate to Sammy's curiosity and attraction towards the fantasy of replicating a train crash he had seen in the film, using a model train. And then filming it using his father's camera, and his mom's sheltered encouragement. \nSammy is immediately taken up by that magic of capturing moving images, his control over creating something fantastic, adventurous, and pursues it with passion.\nThere is the trademark Spielberg aura of a young family's dynamics \u2013 sunny disposition, chaos, happiness, joy and squabbles as Sammy's family grows and his parents Mitzi (Michelle Adams) and Burt (Paul Dano) are now parents of two more girls, younger to Sammy. The touch of typical American-Jewish family culture is natural and I think quite intriguing for those alien to it. I loved the playful moments watching the toddlers have their way.\nAs Sammy grows up into his teens (played by Gabriel LaBelle), persistently pursuing his passion by making home-made movies with his friends pitching in as actors, he discovers that all may not be as uncomplicated as it looks in his family.\nThe overall play and flow of the story is nothing outstanding \u2013 it almost feels like a typical youth's story growing up with his family in the \u201850s and \u201860s, though Sammy's attraction to making movies right from his toddler-hood is embedded with a personal touch and dedication by Spielberg. His candidness at telling some hard truths of his story is also commendable.\nThe main supporting cast of Paul Dano, Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen are good in their places, giving LaBelle the spotlight as much as possible. Michelle Williams is quite intense and shines through a great many emotions and moods, especially with her eyes. Judd Hirsh is almost miss-able with a cameo-like appearance, but his act is a reminder to me that it doesn't matter how long your presence on the screen is; if you have a crackerjack burst of histrionics and a good monologue (remember Jack Nicholson's explosion in \"A Few Good Men\" (1992) or Anne Hathaway in \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" (2012)), there is a good chance you will be recognized.\nI was really taken by Julia Butters' cameo as Reggie, Sammy's younger sister at a key moment in Sammy's life. It's not much but it is a small gem. One might remember her (I definitely do!) as the little girl who bantered with and gave some life lessons to Leonardo DiCaprio's brooding character in \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" (2019) like a wise old soul. Someone to watch out for.\nIt's a great ode by Spielberg to his story and his ever-growing passion for film-making and pioneering innovations that paved way for the directors who would weave visual magic on the screen.",

His father treats this as a hobby and his mother encourages his love of creating art. During this time, we follow the family through different dynamics, social issues, and following your dreams. \n\nAs a lifelong fan of movies, I have to say I loved this movie. It was amazing to watch someone begin their filmmaking journey and see it evolve over time. Especially knowing that this is loosely based on Steven Spielberg's life and he is one of my favorite filmmakers. \n\nAlso, I enjoyed watching the family dynamics. They showed real highs and lows within a family and the generational differences on what they believe is a viable career (seems like something that will never end). \n\nMy only criticism of the movie was that it was a little bit on the long side. There were just a few scenes that I didn't feel were completely necessary to the story. \n\nIf you have the opportunity to watch this movie, I say take the time to sit down, snuggle up, and enjoy. It is a great reminder to follow your dreams, work hard, and do whatever it takes to make them come true. I always appreciate the reminder that we only have one life so it's our job to make it the best we can. The best looks different for each of us, but it's our responsibility to shoot for the things that will make us feel fulfilled. Nobody else is going to make it happen for you, so snag every opportunity.",

FABELMANS is a decent coming-of-age tale, told with skillful attention to detail, but the film adheres to its form so faithfully that it often feels generic--you've seen this movie before. We wouldn't have much reason to care about this story if we didn't know who the protagonist would become, and at 2.5 hours, it starts to feel like an exercise in self-indulgence. The film expresses a love for the magic of movies, but unfortunately it doesn't manage to recreate that magic.",

            "content": "The Real ET\n\nThe Fabelmans tell stories to themselves. Mr. Fabelman is a scientist who tells himself that he loves his work, wife and family and that Benny is his best friend. Mrs. Fabelman tells herself that she is the creative one who loves her family and that her secrets are her own business. But, as the young protagonist Sam Fabelman learns, these fables are not really true. He learns his mother really loves Benny and not his father - and his mother confirms this when confronted - and that his father may not actually be his father.\n\nSteven Spielberg's origin story bears a strong resemblance to two films that came out in the early 1980's - ET (his acknowledged favourite) and Fanny and Alexander By Ingmar Bergman. Both are family sagas about divorce, youthful passions and strange events with a tinge of magic. It is a story of his passion for film and his genius for making films, which started very early and as of this film, hasn't yet stopped. Film as autobiography has never been so blatant or accomplished than this, nor as kind and perceptive. Paul Dano is Burt (his dad), a brilliant, bumbling, slightly cold man who has been cuckholded by Michelle Williams (his flamboyant and slightly crazy mother) with his best friend Benny ( Scott Rudin).  Gabriel La Belle (Sam) learns about film making and life, with all its ups and downs, in this unique, confessional film. It is brilliantly scripted by Spielberg  and Tony Kushner, shot with great care by the director  and the cast is impeccable. That this film was ignored by the Oscars is a terrible insult to Spielberg  and the cast, and to film making itself. It is never gimmicky, always emotionally acute and paced with great skill.\n\nIt was even better than All Quiet on the Western Front, my previous best of 2022. A classic.",

DeMille's The Greatest Show on Earth. a nervous sammy watches in horror with mouth-agape fascination, as a pair of circus trains collide. to us, as 2022 audiences, the crash effects are crude and the scene is pretty lackluster, but to sammy in 1952, it truly is, The Greatest Show on Earth.\n\non the ride home, sammy's parents are debating if the movie was too scary for him but sammy says nothing, still wondering what he saw and that night, he goes to bed dreaming of trains. we then see sammy screaming for his mom at the top of his lungs and we instantly assume The Greatest Show on Earth has given him the Greatest Nightmare on Earth. alas, that isn't the case. sammy is jauntily jumping in bed and he knows exactly what he wants for Hanukkah: A Train Set. he then recreates the crash scene from The Greatest Show on Earth with his train over and over until his mother gives him the family's 8mm camera to shoot his own version of the sequence. she thinks that the camera will get the crashing trains out of his mind, or at least encourage him to stop smashing the very expensive toy around. although it does happen, it's not quite what you'd expect; instead, sammy has now transferred his interest from the train to the camera and once he did, he never let it go as evident from the film and his director itself.\n\nwhat's most intriguing about this film is that you can tell, that even after 70 years, the real Steven Spielberg remains equally obsessed with movies. he's obviously learned a lot about how to make them since 1952; but he has never lost sight of the why.\n\nthe performances in this film are just heartbreaking and beautiful. paul dano has never had a bad performance in his entire career and his streak remains intact. and what's even more impressive, he has given us the role of a psychopath on a murderous spree and that of a loving, heartbroken father wanting what's best for his boy both in the same year. truly one of the best actors of our time. michelle williams OMG. what an absolute icon. this might be her most nuanced, emotionally-wrecking role to date and that shows. she was obviously the best part of the film for me because although the film never antagonizes paul dano's character (because he truly is the nicest person to exist who thinks rationally and is confined to reality), you know that he and michelle william's character can't stay together for long. they eventually have to seperate. the film uses this plot point like a chekhov's gun waiting to fire, a powder keg waiting to blow and steven builds up to that moment of lives being shattered with utmost delicacy. even the after-effects felt due to that are felt to the core and just brilliantly written. Gabriel LaBelle honestly is literally me. he is afraid, emotional, unsure of what to do in life if not following his true passion and even willing to sacrifice that passion for the sake of the family. truly a standout performance and I wish to see more of him in future films. rest of the performances are also really great and not a single loose thread.\n\nthe background score. 2022, a year of such great musical numbers and background scores. we have avatar 2' action packed score, babylon's trumpets, and the batman's epic and rousing theme (which I still think is the best score of the year and the academy does a real disservice to michael giacchino by not even nominating it). just when we thought we had it done and dusted, john williams rose from the ashes and gave us the beautiful score of this film. truly some exceptional work here. each and every single one of the piano pieces are beautiful and I desire to have this on vinyl.\n\nthe cinematography is also beautiful and not wanting to say much here without spoiling the absolute beauty of the shots, the 2 best scenes of the film for me are michelle williams gracefully performing in front of the car headlights in a gorgeous white gown and the last shot of the film which skillfully shifts the horizon from the middle to bottom.\n\nI'm just happy that even though I had the chance to watch this at home, I decided to wait for that theatrical experience and got the best out of it.\n\nP.S.: truly bummed and shocked to see this film's box office failure. cinema is truly dying and only we can save it guys. please go for this film in the theatres if you can because this is spielberg's most personal film to date and it deserves your attention.",

It is a nostalgic and beautiful look that also acts as an ode to the film industry and in which Spielberg shows us what shaped him into becoming one of the most beloved filmmakers of our time and how he lived through the antisemitism he had to endure in his early years. The film is masterfully made, it is a stunning spectacle and Michelle Williams delivers the most incredible and human performance of her career and one could expect great things from newcomer Gabriel LaBelle.

Here, it's Steven Spielberg in the director's chair and, as in \"Belfast\" and \"Roma,\" the director's whole soul is on display for the world to see. Reverent, earnest and occasionally cheeky, this film leans further away from the traditional trappings of the Hollywood biopic, opting instead to tell a coming-of-age tale that's freer in form than I was expecting. In any event, it's undeniably fascinating to see any filmmaker mulling over the different elements of their own life and then applying artistic flair to it in turn. There's something even more surreal, however, in having that filmmaker be the literal person whose last name is most closely associated with the profession of filmmaking itself.

While The Fabelmans doesn't reach the levels of any of those films it's still a really great edition to his filmography. On the surface, The Fabelmans can seem weird. \"Why would you make an autobiography about yourself\" is what someone might ask and while \"pretentious\" might be the first thing that comes to your mind, The Fabelmans doesn't feel that way. The film honestly feels more like a Spielberg therapy session than a Spielberg biopic. It feels more like Spielberg coming to terms with who his parents were and why they mean so much to him especially his Dad and how they influenced him into making films. As with most of his films, Spielberg's directing is great and it feels much more personal than it has since probably the late 90s or early 2000s. The cinematography as well is gorgeous at points and the performances are mostly all pretty top notch. Paul Dano, Seth Rogen and Gabriel LaBelle all did a fantastic job here. Michelle Williams was good but her performance was more mixed in my opinion. Sometimes she was really good and sometimes she was just a bit much. John Williams's score was great as well. Nowhere near his best work but still some really good and nice music. I would say that the film doesn't become truly great up until the last 30 minutes. Everything else before that is good but it definitely can feel slow for good portions of the film. Once we get to the High School prom though is when the film becomes great. It has some really great and emotional scenes along with an absolutely hilarious cameo from David Lynch and a really fun final frame. I don't think this is anywhere near Spielberg's best films but it's still a great edition to his filmography and I would definitely recommend checking it out.",

But once you decide you're an artist, you spend the rest of your life learning that art is pain, at least according to Uncle Boris.\n\nOne of the greatest story arcs is the change in the way Sammy views his parents, from perfect, strong, steady forces in his life to broken people, as unsure about things as everyone else. This happens as Sammy is growing up, trying to gain certainty is his own identity and aspirations.\n\nSammy's mom encourages her son to follow his heart, no matter what - a beautiful message which is somewhat tainted because at that time for her, following her heart meant leaving her husband and breaking up her family.\n\nMichelle Williams, per us' is the best part of any movie she's in, no matter the haircut. Paul Dano is amazing as the family patriarch. Seth Rogen, still with his characteristic goofy laugh, plays a more serious role than normal, and he does it well.\n\nIt's an ode to film, and I love film, but I do think that Hollywood can easily drift into navel-gazing and a self-congratulatory posture that no one asked for at the drop of a hat. If you love film or love Spielberg, definitely see the movie, but overall I think it's too disjointed and personal to stand on its own as a great film, or even a good story.",

            "content": "I've always been a big fan of Steven Spielberg. His films like Jurassic Park, Schindler's List and especially the Indiana Jones trilogy. While The Fabelmans doesn't reach the levels of any of those films it's still a really great edition to his filmography. On the surface, The Fabelmans can seem weird. \"Why would you make an autobiography about yourself\" is what someone might ask and while \"pretentious\" might be the first thing that comes to your mind, The Fabelmans doesn't feel that way. The film honestly feels more like a Spielberg therapy session than a Spielberg biopic. It feels more like Spielberg coming to terms with who his parents were and why they mean so much to him especially his Dad and how they influenced him into making films. As with most of his films, Spielberg's directing is great and it feels much more personal than it has since probably the late 90s or early 2000s. The cinematography as well is gorgeous at points and the performances are mostly all pretty top notch. Paul Dano, Seth Rogen and Gabriel LaBelle all did a fantastic job here. Michelle Williams was good but her performance was more mixed in my opinion. Sometimes she was really good and sometimes she was just a bit much. John Williams's score was great as well. Nowhere near his best work but still some really good and nice music. I would say that the film doesn't become truly great up until the last 30 minutes. Everything else before that is good but it definitely can feel slow for good portions of the film. Once we get to the High School prom though is when the film becomes great. It has some really great and emotional scenes along with an absolutely hilarious cameo from David Lynch and a really fun final frame. I don't think this is anywhere near Spielberg's best films but it's still a great edition to his filmography and I would definitely recommend checking it out.",

The Fabelmans is a film he's been intending to make for decades, and with the onset of COVID and the subsequent lockdowns, he's finally had the time to formulate it. It's been said that's it all about the love of movies and how both watching and making them can be a transformative experience. But having sat down and watched it last night, I was surprised how much this theme often went by the wayside. The film, at its core, is about the family unit, which can be both loving and volatile, sometimes in equal measure. When the filmmaking element is involved, it's not overindulged or even especially romanticised. Our lead's passion for making movies is treated as a dream, an aspiration, but it's not presented as a crutch. It's not something you can run to when you're in despair and expect it to take your problems away. Sammy Fabelman uses the power of film to explore and examine his family, not to glorify them. It presents the development of cinematic technology and trends over a relatively brief but important period of time, and even offers a few glimpses into the filmmaking process, which Spielberg himself has said came from his own experience. Being semi-autobiographical, it offers a window into the personal life of one of our most acclaimed cinematic figures; a man whose films we all known, but who we have never really connected with on a personal level. I liked all the performances, even though a few teetered on the verge of melodramatic at times. It clearly comes from a place of compassion and earnesty, and that's what resonated so strongly with people. It's runtime of 2 and a half hours gives us the time to get comfortable with it characters, but it frequently leaves you checking your watch. Also, for a biopic made by and about a famous figure, it doesn't take a lot of risks or do anything we haven't seen before. Even the confrontations and arguments feel sanitised and even glossed over. For these reasons, it's a film I enjoy and admire, but would almost certainly never revisit unless it was for a specific reason, like if I was making a video, recording a podcast or writing a document on it. I'm very happy that Spielberg got to tell this highly personal story, and as predictably whimsy as it can be at times, its still a beautiful story that any fan of cinema should check out at least once.",

He wants to recreate the train wreck from the movie, and it's his mom who suggests filming it on an 8mm camera... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.\n\nCouple of comments: this is Steven Spielberg's long-awaited film of his youth. I love and respect Spielberg, but this is Spielberg at his worst: sentimental and self-indulgent. There isn't a single aspect of the movie that I found interesting or redeeming. Why did Spielberg assume that his family's comings and goings, including his parents' marital challenges, would be so unique and hence interesting, when in fact this is what happened to millions and millions of families in the 50s and early 60s. As a complete aside, as most of you know Spielberg lived in Cincinnati until age 11, then moved to Phoenix. A significant early part of the movie plays out in Cincinnati, but there is not a single reference, none, to Cincinnati. Why? In contrast, the second that the family is moving to Phoenix, Arizona, the area is mentioned multiple times in the film. I find it curious, to say the least.\n\n\"The Fabelmans\" premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to immediate critical acclaim and then was released in US theaters just before Thanksgiving. Since then it has significantly underperformed at the box office (a mere $12 million after 7 weeks). The matinee screening where I saw this at the day after New Year's at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was attended well (I counted roughly 30 people). I honestly cannot think of any movie by Spielberg that is worse than this, and I cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone. If you haven't seen this yet, please save yourself the time and money. You'll thank me later when you catch it streaming at some point.",

            "content": "Inspired by childhood events and his parents' divorce when he was a teenager, Steven Spielberg's 2023 Oscar contender, co-written with playwright Tony Kushner, is an intensely personal and introspective film, which is immensely easy to like and enjoy, mashing up multiple genres that include an aspiring film-maker's coming of age story, a divorce family drama and a high school rom-com. Gabriel LaBelle, in a grounded and winsome performance, plays Sammy Fabelman, Spielberg's substitute, while Michelle Williams has the showier part of his free-spirited mother, and Paul Dano takes the subtler and often overlooked role of his down-to-earth and more practical father. As Dad's career goes from strength to strength, resulting in his family's migration across the country, Mom's unhappiness with her marriage bubbles up to become something that's no longer containable. Structured as a movie of 2 halves, the sudden pivot mid-film from family to high school anti-Semitic bully drama can cause whiplash but there's a satisfying payoff when it's all threaded through to demonstrate the power of films and its importance in Sammy/Spielberg's life, which is appealing for me on a Cinema Paradiso level. Bar the final epilogue scene (which will delight Spielberg enthusiasts), the story here has universal appeal and application to any young person who has lived through a parents' divorce, but more cynical viewers understandably can find this a schmaltzy exercise in sentimentality. Thankfully the film handles it all with sophistication and masterly control, as the treatment of Sammy's discovery of a family secret and the subsequent confrontation with his mother demonstrate; and Spielberg's effortlessly dexterous and calibrated execution, with quaintly stylish visual compositions and fluid editing, blending in Sammy's film footage for additional authenticity and warmth, is how he gets away with it and why there's a difference between saccharine and Spielbergian.",

It is fascinating to see the beginnings of the man who brought films such as \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Indiana Jones\" to life. Though it took a minute for me to become invested in the characters, once the pacing hit its stride, I was hooked. \n\nThe film tackles difficult topics, such as racism and infidelity, without forcing an agenda. There is a truth to \"The Fabelmans\" that was uniquely charming. Spielberg is not afraid of silence, and some of the most memorable scenes are from those quiet moments. Rather than relying on words, facial expressions perfectly conveyed the message he wanted to tell. \n\nWhen the film started, I was concerned about the acting and the script. Some of the performances were stiff and felt pretentious, at least at first. It was evident that the pressure of portraying Spielberg's family was daunting for some of the actors. After about 20 minutes, the acting seemed more natural, and I was able to see the passion behind each performance.   \n\nAs the film is based on Steven Spielberg's childhood/youth, there were a lot of small stories over the 2 hour 30-minute runtime. At times, these individual scenes felt disconnected from the ultimate narrative. Similarly, some of the editing was choppy and out of place. Ultimately, the story came together, but there were some unnecessary stops along the way.\n\nIf you love films, you will find joy in \"The Fabelmans\". After finishing the movie, I felt inspired in a unique way. It is evident that Steven Spielberg put his heart into this project and that he tapped into deep, personal roots. As the Academy Awards approach, this film is a lock to win one, if not more of their seven nominations.\n\nBest Character: Sammy\nBest Scene: Late Night Passion Projects\nBest Quote: \"Movies are dreams that you never forget.\" \u2013 Mitzi Fabelman\nBest Piece of Score: \"Mother and Son\"",

            "content": "For a director who has always prioritised entertainment over aesthetics and audience over auteur, The Fabelmans is an oddly discomfiting watch at times, even for a movie that seems to be trying to hit some emotional truths while maintaining the youthful protagonist's wide-eyed view of his chosen profession, movie-making. In a way, it's an homage primarily to the young Sam Fabelman's mother, and a nod to the maternal sacrifice required of her in choosing family over art, motherhood over music. This theme is repeated throughout the film, in scenes with his uncle - also with a toe in the movie business - where he tells Sammy that he'll be ripped apart by the choice between art and domestic life just as his mother, played by Michelle Williams, is.\nThere's an oddly unsettling quality to some of the 'happy family' scenes throughout, although the characters of Sammy's sisters are funny, natural, and just a tad anarchic themselves. In the end however, this emotional queasiness rises to the top, as Mimi's eccentricities tread a fine line between endearing artiness and pathological narcissism. The same tone is struck in ET as Elliott's mother strides distractedly around her chaotic post-divorce house, into which an actual extra-terrestrial has moved without her noticing, a fact that Spielberg plays on as she repeatedly crosses ET's path, highly strung and oblivious.\nIn The Fabelmans, however, Spielberg is reaching for something even closer to home - his own actual formation as a filmmaker. And like his protagonist Sam, he doesn't lack courage, drive, or even - as his sister points out - the necessary strange detachment. Neither do the depictions of his parents lack compassion or nuance. Not at all. But this doesn't make it an uncomplicated watch. It's as if, like Sam filming the anti-Semitic bullies in his school, he can't resist glorifying them and ingratiating himself at the same time. It's like a superpower, this creativity: in positioning the aesthetic superiority of the athletic blonde bully, he protects himself from the more dangerous aspects of his own 'underdog' status.\nThe Fabelmans are foregrounded as a Jewish family from the narrative get-go, and the movie certainly doesn't shy away from this fact. There are even bigger themes at play here though - life vs art; sacrifice vs responsibility; parenting vs freedom. For Jewish protagonist Sam Fabelman, the movies are a way of, as Mimi Fabelman suggests, 'controlling his anxiety' and, at the same time, winning over his detractors. It's a dangerous game though, as even the bully realises. Sam's portrayal of him as 'golden boy' is no less of a trap than Sam's role of underdog.\nIn the end however, it's the artistic conversation that matters most, as 'representer' and 'represented' grapple with their respective roles and come to an uneasy truce. \nThe youthful Sam defends his high school movie by saying 'the camera sees what it sees.' But an old veteran like his mentor John Ford (keep an eye out here - pun intended - for David Lynch) knows better -  it's the ANGLE that tells the story...",

Sammy's hesitant, yet supportive parents, Mitzi and Burt Fabelman are played by the luminous Michelle Williams and the convincing Paul Dano. Also in the film, Judd Hirsch making a short but memorable appearance in his recent Best Supporting Actor Oscar-nominated performance as Sammy's cantankerous Uncle Boris. Spielberg pays homage to the wonders and realities of youth, dreams and love of cinema seen through the eyes of Sammy whose early life witnesses his mother's unrealized musical aspirations, his father's multiple job changes resulting in the Fabelmans various moves from state-to-state, and the ultimate breakup of his family following his parents divorce. All this going on while Sammy realizes and begins to nurture his own artistic talents for filmmaking. A highlight of the movie is an almost unrecognizable David Lynch who appears at the climax of the film as Iconic director John Ford who talks to Sammy about the importance of horizon in good filmmaking. Steven Spielberg is one of the great directors who is blessed with a true gift for storytelling and he accomplishes this, again with THE FABELMANS. You may recognize his abiding love for Indiana Jones in this film through the character of a handsome, tough on the outside, flawed on the inside high school track star, caught on camera on Ditch Day by 18 year old Sammy Fabelman. It's obvious Steven Spielberg never forgot him.",

Produced after the death of his mother Leah Adler and using the fictional family name of the Fabelmans the movie focuses primarily on the iconic film makers family and the impact his parents divorce had on his young life. \u00a0\"The Fabelmans\" is rich in \u00a0exposing the influences behind classic movies like E.T. ( Set in a broken home ) and some early techniques at effects the film maker used to better his home movies.\u00a0\n\n\"The Fabelmans\" starts in the 1950's with Sammy Fabelman experiencing for the first time the magic of cinema with his parents. Slightly traumatised by the movie, particularly a train crash scene it's from this emotional experience the first glimpses of becoming a film maker appear. Who of us that have delved into the arts ( film making, actors , singers , performers , etc ) didn't start off creating these types of home made replicas? \u00a0The idyllic family set up, with the ever growing confident and more adept young home movie maker, \u00a0becomes derailed when after editing his 8mm footage of a family camping trip he discovers all was not as he remembered. \u00a0The impact of what Sam discovers about his concert pianist mother and that fateful trip results in the eventual breakdown of his parents.\u00a0\n\nAs the movie moves into the early 1960's and Spielberg's high school years \"The Fabelmans\"touches on religion, race issues and first love. Due to the impact of that fateful camping holiday and therefore following a hiatus of not wanting to make any further home movies, Sam is persuaded by his girlfriend to film the end of school year beach party get together. \u00a0The impact of Sam's return to film making is clearly visible after the graduation film he produced is shown at the school prom to great acclaim. \u00a0\n\n\"The Fabelmans\" is well documented as being a love letter to cinema but equally it is Spielberg's love letter to his family. This is the movies key fact, the acceptance of multiple things happening all at once. Vocation is driven by both fear and talent, loving relationships break down, and movies that appear simplistic are highly sophisticated. With an extremely satisfying ending \" The Fabelmans\" is a beautifully crafted work of art and remarkable insight into one of the most famous and influential directors Hollywood has ever produced",

Anyone that has watched the Wonder Years Will be immediately familiar with format\u2014the nostalgia, the examination of a family through the experience of one main character. But when that cutesy-ness lingers in the final third it morphs into out-and-out daytime TV melodrama. This film has a lot going for it but ultimately fails to close out its great ground work at the business end. All good coming of age films are relatable and complex, the best are profound and offer artistic insight in to our lives though the director's lens. Unfortunately the Fablemens fails to make the final leap despite the inclusion all the necessary complexities that should enable such a conclusion. It has complicated sexual relations, family relations, personal passions and an array of inequality and injustice that life provides\u2014all inspired no doubt by the Wonder Years and Spielberg's own life. As expected, this is complemented with a lusciously beautiful presentation of 50s and 60s nostalgia. And mainly for these reasons it is an engaging and highly enjoyable film only let down by a garbled and somewhat rushed final step. Instead of showing a exploration and blossoming of the main character after multiple setbacks, failures and family shake ups, the Fablemens relies on an cameo (a very good one) from David Lynch to end on a suspenseful albeit smug final scene (smug because of the semi autobiographical nature of the film). Much like the rest of the film, the elements required are present in the final third but they are presented austerely and without the consideration and depth of emotion required to deliver the bit when the main character actually comes of age\u2026 I left the theatre with a strong suspicion that this was meant to be two films, or perhaps even a TV show. With better prep and an editor on the side of the viewer rather than, well, Spielberg, we might have got what we expected. Wilhelm scream count - 0.",

There is no rhythm to the movie, and no actual storyline.\nTruth: I left after the first hour. Walked out and away from this mess!\nThe cast, somehow up for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble, is awkward. Paul Dano, as the fictional boy's father, is miscast, seems to be trying too hard to be fatherly, and came across dazed.\nMichelle Williams flounders. She never finds her center. Then again, she's given bizarre things to do like show us half-eaten food in her mouth and dance around in the woods.\nJudd Hirsch hams it up, and eats the scenery, but not in a good way. He continues the stereotype of what a \"Jew\" is supposed to be. \nSeth Rogen gives the best performance in the hour I actually watched.\nThe scenes sit flat. No movement. The dialogue is dull. Who cares about Dad going on and on about IBM?\nSpielberg has, frankly, lost his magic touch.\nThis is a movie that, somehow, won The Golden Globe for Best Picture.\nThen again, NBC owns Universal Pictures.\nNBC aired The Globes.\nSo...\nTHE FABLEMANS has no connection to its audience.\nGrade: F\n#Oscars #movies",

Has Spielberg lost its magic touch? The dialogues seemed so stiff and unbelievable, the acting was horrendous, I didn't believe a thing anyone said.\nThe screenplay was full of high school clich\u00e9s with none of the set up. And the editing was just so bad? So much could've been cut from this and the general pacing just seemed soo off.\n\nGranted, there are some beautiful shots in this, its generally really well lit and the horny christian girl was incredibly funny. But thats about it for its redeeming qualities. Maybe seeing how creative a young Spielberg was with his filmmaking, that was pretty cool to see, but too little, too late.\n\nYeah I have no idea how people like this randomly sticked together well lit nonsense.

This film has a runtime of 2hrs 31 mins and I can honestly say that every second of that flew right by. I was engaged and hooked into the story right from the very first scene. \n\nUltimately this is a movie about people who are suffering. One is suffering for his family to love him, one is suffering for love, and one is suffering for his art.\n\nIt was interesting to see the instant connection that Spielberg had with movies. He was hooked as soon as he saw the train crash in \"The Greatest Show On Earth.\" So much so, that he tried to recreate it and the rest is history as they say. \n\nThe acting in this film was just phenomenal. You could really feel the internal struggle which plagued Paul Dano throughout the film. He knew his faults as a husband and father, but did  nothing to be better. He just kept on being a workaholic and this ultimately caused the downfall of the family.\n\nGabriel LaBelle Really shined as the main character. He slowly gains his footing into film making and uses it as an escape from his reality, but also as a means to show the truth. He persevered and eventually got what he wanted, a chance to break into the industry. He never had support from his father, he suffered for his art. We can ultimately see how Spielberg developed his style. \n\nMichelle Williams is the standout star in this one. She really portrayed her character well. Her pain at not being with the right person really felt real. She didn't even need to speak all her mannerisms and facial expressions did the work for her. She is a selfish as they come (even admits it) and I personally didn't like this. Why break up your family like that? Life will not always be exciting. You have a loving husband and wonderful kids and you threw it away to be with his friend. Shame on her.  \n\nIt  goes to show that you don't need to have any special effects or exploding cars to make a good movie. A great story will always triumph, and this movie certainly has. \n\nIt's a must watch. \n\nThis gets a LennyReviewz Score of: 10/10",

So basically, he was close to his mother, hurt that she was having an affair. He was a victim. at school of anti-sematic attacks, mostly verbal. His girlfriend broke up with him at the senior prom. But his hard work as a Cinemaphotographer pays off at the end of the movie. That was the basically the movie. Sad at times, enjoyable at times. But not an unusually tragic event.

This story of his formative years as he comes of age and learns to love film-making is so rich, so down to earth, and so appealing in its honesty, that we see and earnestly appreciate how his genius brain was shaped. His relationship with his parents (and to a certain degree with his sisters and his great-uncle) are central and inform what makes his movies so utterly heart-felt. His movies and his art grab you and hurt your heart--and that is exactly what this wonderful film does. Highly recommended!",

A semi autobiography paying tribute to his love for films from when he was only a young boy, while also diving deep into his humble up bringing. The film almost feels like a bunch of old home family videos collected over the years, documenting the Fabelmans story through the eyes of a young aspiring film maker, Sam Fabelman. We get a close look at how Sam Fablemans love for film making, eventually helps him uncover a dark family secret. One which will shape his family's entire future. The film focuses heavily around the joys and problems that families face, and there are elements throughout the film that we as an audience, can all definitely relate to one way or another to our own lives. It's so emotional, deep on so many levels. And what it means to follow one's heart, and the risks we take in order to live out our dreams.\n\nWhile the film won't ever hit the heights of Spielberg's signature films, it really is a love letter to his passion of film making, a film that only a legendary director of his calibre, has earnt the right to make. Michelle Williams performance is absolutely phenomenal, she absolutely nailed it! She deserves a  nomination for best actress in a leading role at the Oscars, at the very least.

            "content": "The Fabelmans is an affectionate and emotionally resonant ode to the life of a family and the power of film. It has some small faults but overall it's a masterful film from a master of cinema. Director Steven Spielberg made a film based on his life and after reading his life story it's remarkably close to the truth. The film is basically divided into three parts. In 1952 New Jersey young Sammy Fabelman is taken to the movies for the first time and is awestruck. Sammy lives with his parents and two younger sisters. His father Burt is a computer engineer and lends Sammy his movie camera, where Sammy makes home movies. When Sammy is a teenager the family move to Arizona after Burt takes a job with GE. Sammy continues his love of film making small films with his friends. This part of the film really shows how one person can fall in love with the magic of cinema. The third part of the film I think is the most successful. The family moves to California, but the parents grow apart and Sammy gets bullied at high school. We see here strong emotional scenes that are handled with truth and honesty. This is a broadly entertaining film that even though at times early on veers into sentimentality it's easy to see how personal this was for Spielberg. It's an honesty portrayal of his parents and clearly shows how movies captivated him from a young age. The film is tender, funny and deeply human. It's filled with great performances but I especially loved Paul Dano and Gabriel LaBelle as Sammy. Spielberg is a true master and this fine film stacks up with his best.",

This is such a wonderful film and the only reason I'm not giving it a perfect score is because of the runtime. Unlike Avatar, I don't think the 2 and half hour runtime of this movie was necessary. I think a good 20-30 minutes could have been shaved off and it would have had the same effect. Michelle Williams and Paul Dano are fantastic as the parents of this family. Williams really sells the idea of being a woman conflicted by her marriage. And Dano really shows off the range that he has, from the Riddler to start the year to this Father trying to keep his family together to end it. Seth Rogan delivers a fantastic dramatic performance, so much so that his trademark laugh feels so out of place here. Gabriel LaBelle is just fantastic in this. Not many people can keep you invested in a 2 and half hour long movie but he did here. I was invested in his story and now I'm invested in his career and where it goes from here. I've loved Julia Butters since her time on American Housewife but I haven't seen her since she exited the show and was replaced, but I'm so happy to see her here. It took me a second because she's so much taller now but she's great here and I'm happy to see she's still acting. Jeannie Berlin and Judd Hirsch have great small roles that really flesh out this family and make it more relatable and dynamic. David Lynch makes a really fun cameo at the end that I imagine was super fun to film. The Fabelmans is such a powerful movie about family and the wonder of seeing your first movie. They do such a good job showing us why a kid would be in love with movies and how they're made. Stephen Spielberg is such a genius filmmaker and you can tell the craftsmanship of this movie has been upped on every level. This is clearly a passion project for him and I'm so happy it's as good as everyone said. I just think some of the scenes could have been tighter so the runtime could have been a lot shorter. But the acting, story, and score are all so well done. I would definitely recommend heading out to see The Fabelmans, if your AMC is even playing it. 9/10. -Tyler",

            "content": "Before I launch into this review, here's a bit of background.  I was a teenage filmmaker, like the protagonist, who filmed my own productions with families and friends that I would then screen in church basements or high school auditoriums.  I was predisposed to LOVE this film, and indeed, at times, scenes felt like they were lifted straight out of my youth.\nAlas, that was only about 20% of the time in this dull, over-wrought, over-long, poorly written snore fest that barely rises above the worst made-for-tv failing-family storytelling.  Part way through, I sensed that Spielberg himself must have been the chief writer.  I consider him something of a flawed genius.  When he turns his talents to suspense and action, he has no equal.  When he gives himself over to sentimentality, he's one of the worst.  To understand this better, think of two scenes from Jurassic Park...The terrifying T-rex night attack, and the sappy brachiosaur scene that feels lifted straight off of Saturday morning kids t.v.  How does the same filmmaker produce two such disparate scenes in one movie?  Fabelmans is 10 minutes of t-rex followed by 50 of brachiosaur.  \nI sometimes wonder if Spielberg has an astute grasp on how human emotions work, since so many scenes feature odd and strange behaviours from the characters.  The arrogant jock gets weepy at a high school film screening that makes him look like an action hero.  Perhaps he's motivated by his guilt at how poorly he's treated the film-maker.  But I've known guys like this...and in that moment, at that point in his life, he'd be nothing but pumped up.  The realization that he may have treated others badly is something that would come much later in his life, if ever.  Ditto the strange emotions of the protagonist during his screenings, when he could barely look at the audience or the screen.  If film-making is your escape from everyday life, you'd be hyper-focused on your audience reactions and likely, on cloud 9, especially when you're getting a good reception.  My own screening experiences were very much like the film's lead, and they were unfailingly a thrill and a high for me.  Escapism at its very best, not a moment to be all introspective and weepy.  \nClunky, expository scenes and dialogue are rife.  There's a cameo by Judd Hirsch that is \"deus ex machina\" at its worst.  He literally drops into the movie to explain what the overarching theme is, and then is whisked away minutes later.  \nI think my biggest beef with the film lies in the marketing.  The trailers and commercials make you think you're going to watch the story of a brilliant wunderkind using his wits and talents to reach the pinnacle of his art.  There's times when that's exactly what this is.  But it's never long before that's derailed and we are off to some other less interesting place for long long periods of time (I checked my watch more and more as it wore on). Hell, the kid even abandons his craft for a good chunk of the third act. The net result is about a half hour of an interesting movie buried in a tedious two and a half.  And my two movie-going partners concurred with all of the above.",

The movie also features captivating music from the era, tying in with the film's overall theme of nostalgia and remembrance. The intricate set design and cinematography also help to paint an effective picture of life in 1950s Arizona.\n\nThe Fabelmans is far from perfect due to its almost too-glossy look and the feeling that it doesn't dig deep enough, but it succeeds due to its strong performances and smart storytelling. It's a film that offers an inspiring glimpse into the power of film and its ability to help people confront difficult truths.

This is a masterful, paradoxical story crafted by one of cinemas most impactful directors about his upbringing as a novice filmmaker in a time when filmmaking, as we know it today, was in its infancy.\n\nSpielberg tells his memoir through Sammy Fabelman, and he could have only dreamt about back in the 60s and 70s of capturing his younger years with this level of expertise and technological innovation. The film is not only a lesson about the history of film but an intricate exploration of film techniques and family dynamics.\n\nThere are many revelations and gutsy, tough themes in \"The Fabelmans\", but none speaks more strongly than that of the capabilities and evolution of film - that cameras often capture and preserve moments that can't be captured, or often go unnoticed, in real life.\n\nThis is proof that film is magic, a precious time capsule where Spielberg pays homage to the movies. Yet not everything is glossy, as we also get an intimate look at the challenges that come with marriage, parenthood, coming of age, bullying, and antisemitism. Yes, some scenes are emotionally charged, even painful, but others are beautiful and funny, and Spielberg's trademark moments of innocence, wonder, and awe shine through.\n\nTop this masterwork with some great performances, especially by Gabriel LaBelle as Sammy and Michelle Williams as his mom, Mitzi, and you have one of the best films of 2022.",

I was fascinated to watch the impact of the art of  cinema on the gifted boy, and how his gift of art grew along with him as he matured. I grew up knowing a gifted ballerina my age, and watching an artist mature from child to adult is like watching God in action. Additionally, watching the family's move from east coast to west coast in the 1960s is also fascinating. All the scenes showing the children during that time period are good and really important, because the differences between the 2 coasts at that time were tremendous. My family and myself experienced the same emotions. The west coast's lack of tolerance, anti-semitism, the beach scene, are all examples of culture change that my siblings and I experienced. The parents were not aware of their children's struggles, probably because they were having their own struggles with the changes in roles and the norms in marriage during the 60s. The movie was very entertaining, everyone over 55 should identify with it. And for those under 55, watching this movie will  educate you about the American culture of the 1960s. That decade was very challenging to grow up in. Super movie for these 2 reasons and much more.",

That'll be how we end the movie.\"\n\"Sounds good, Steven.\"\n\nI don't think The Fabelmans is the masterpiece that others seem to believe it is. It's a very nice movie, but every film about filmmaking really needs to pull its weight and differentiate itself these days, because come Oscar season we seem to get a small handful of films about \"the craft\" that may or may not be pandering to members of the Academy, patting each other on the back over their choice of career. It's clear that there was passion and sincerity as Spielberg describes the totally-not-child-version-of-himself growing up and seeing the power of the camera, how it gave him a different perspective and a creative outlet. The stitches binding together Sammy's love of film and the observations he makes on his family's life make the two inseparable, but they don't necessarily add much in the way of insight to one another; this very lengthy film has some shockingly standard story beats - parents drifting apart, a couple of school bullies, a sense of professional aimlessness - that are all cinema ex machina'd by the restorative waters of a handheld camera. Film isn't treated so much as a salve, a placebo, or an escape in The Fablemans as much as it is a miraculous cure-all, and maybe it's that lack of realism (or cynicism?) that makes the wonder feel too sickly-sweet. Very likable, particularly the creativity that Sammy exhibits with his early filmmaking, but it seems odd for Spielberg, the creator of the blockbuster, to act as if the commercial side of cinema doesn't exist and it's easier to create this more easily digestible wonderland version. Or maybe I'm just cranky. \n\nWatching this so soon after I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's BARDO is an interesting experience; both are meditative pseudo-autobiographies on the role of film and filmmaker with heavy emphasis on family, but where I\u00f1\u00e1rritu chose to address cultural issues and experiment, Spielberg stayed relatively grounded and sentimental. Not a problem with either, more an observation. \n\nSo is Seth Rogen a legitimate actor now? I mean, we're not that far removed from Sausage Party. (3.5/5)",

The characters were not relatable, and the story was boring and did not inspire empathy.\n\nWhen watching some of the scenes, I didn't know what emotion to feel: sadness, anger, sorrow, frustration, or something else? The script was awful; I didn't know what some of the lines meant or even the sentiment they were intended to convey.\n\nThere are still parts that I don't understand. There were so many loose ends and lingering questions, even at the end of the movie. I understand that, in real life, there might be remaining uncertainties; but why did he decide to give everyone fake names if he wasn't going to slightly alter the events/details for the better of the movie? \n\nI suppose Michelle Williams played a complex character interestingly, but Paul Dano seemed kinda creepy, which I don't think was the intention. I liked seeing the behind-the-scenes of Sam creating scenes in his amateur movies. The set design/prop curation were spot-on! In my opinion, that would be the only category for which it deserves an Academy Award.",

His direction is heartfelt and every scene kept me engaged. I thought the performances were all fantastic and there really isn't a weak link anywhere. I felt the movie also spoke to things I am personally interested in like Spielberg's life as well as his love for the movies and how it developed. I felt the ending of the film was a bit abrupt and think the movie could have shown even more story and been over three hours if it wanted to, and I would have been completely fine with that, which I don't say often. Overall, this is a movie that delivers that warm and sweet feeling I can safely expect with any Steven Spielberg project, and while it might not be the best movie he has ever made, it is still a fantastic one that is most definitely his most intimate and personal.",

            "content": "The Fabelmans is a semi-autobiographical based on Steven Spielberg. Funny enough it is also directed by Steven Spielberg. I haven't ever seen a biopic story that is also directed by the person the story is about. That interested me a lot but knowing it was about the legendary director Steven Spielberg is what made me want to watch it. Is the movie an overly self-indulgent semi-biopic, or does Steven continue to show why he is such a great director?\n\nThe film is such an interesting piece as the characters themselves are fictional but based on real people. For example, the character that is meant to represent Spielberg is named Samuel \"Sammy\" Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle). What I appreciate is that Steven doesn't shy away from the flaws of the character representing him. Sammy is very passionate about filmmaking but he loves it so much that he puts it above his own family. His conflict is trying to pursue his passion while his family is tearing apart. On that note, there is a complex family dynamic with the clash of the logical but stern yet loving Dad (Paul Dano) and the artistic but selfish yet encouraging Mother (Michelle Williams). Sammy inherits both qualities from his parents but also some of their worse. Seeing the struggle of chasing a dream and their isolation is such an engaging theme. None of the characters is terrible people. They do wrong things but there is a lot more nuance to them. The story is incredibly warm, funny, gut-wrenching and powerful.\n\nThe performance here is terrific and worthy of an Oscar. Michelle Williams gives an unforgettable performance as the mother, Mitzi. She shows how caring yet weird of a mother she is but shows how she is gradually getting more and more broken as the movie progresses. She could have easily made her character incredibly hatable but her performance succeeds in making the audience sympathize with her despite her being the main cause of the rift in the family. Paul Dano is also terrific as the dad, Burt. His performance is less eccentric and more subtle but he perfectly conveys the internal struggle of the character. Gabriel LaBelle plays Sammy and he is great. His character is sort of arrogant and Gabriel manages to convey that without being overly pompous and annoying.  LaBelle is terrific at communicating a young kid whose emotions are on the verge of exploding. He is a very promising young actor. In terms of supporting actors, Judd Hirsch appears for only two scenes yet he gives such a strong performance that takes over the scene. David Lynch also appears in just one scene but his scene might be the most memorable moment in the film.\n\nThe music is composed by legendary composer John Williams and he continues to do a great job. Although, the score here isn't his most memorable. The cinematography is done by Janusz Kaminski of Schindler's List fame and he continues to be great here. There are tons of great and memorable shots that capture the essence of filmmaking in The Fabelmans. There is an amazing shot that has Sammy using his hands as a screen with a projector aimed at his palm which is stunning. If I had any issue with the film then it has to be the 2nd act with Sammy in high school. Scenes concerning Sammy's romance and his bullying are a little uninteresting compared to everything else. It doesn't help that his girlfriend feels very over the top and the bullies act like all the generic jocks you have seen over a dozen times. Fortunately, the high school stuff have a strong landing.\n\nOverall, Steven Spielberg continues to show that he is still one of the best directors out there. Despite the film being a semi-biographic on him, he doesn't shy away from the flaws of him and his parents. He shows the struggle of chasing your passion which might resonate with a lot of people. If Spielberg decided this was his last film then this would've been a great final outing. However, from this film alone, I know he loves making films and he won't stop here. I can't wait to see his next work.",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg has been the most popular film director of the last fifty years but he's never turned the focus squarely on himself, and that's the draw of The Fabelmans, a coming-of-age drama that's really a coming-of-Spielberg expose. The biographical movie follows the Fabelman family from the 1950s through the late 60s as Sammy (our Steven\u00a0 Spielberg avatar) becomes inspired to be a moviemaker while his parents' marriage deteriorates. As a lifelong lover of movies and a childhood amateur filmmaker, there's plenty here for me to connect with. The fascination with recreating images, of chasing after an eager dream, of working together with other creatives for something bigger, it's all there and it works. I'm a sucker for movies about the assemblage of movie crews, those found families working in tandem. However, the family drama stuff I found less engaging. Apparently Sammy's mother (Michelle Williams) is more impulsive, spontaneous, and attention-seeking, and may have some un-diagnosed mental illness at that, whereas his father (Paul Dano) is a dry and boring computer engineering genius. I found the family drama stuff to be a distraction from the storylines of Sammy as a budding filmmaker experimenting with his art and Sammy the unpopular new kid at high school harassed for being Jewish. There are some memorable scenes, like a girlfriend's carnal obsession with Jesus, and a culmination with a bully that is surprising on multiple counts, but ultimately I found the movie to be strangely remote and lacking great personal insight. This is why Spielberg became the greatest filmmaker in the world? I guess. I'll credit co-writer Tony Kushner (West Side Story, Lincoln) for not making this what too many modern author biopics have become, a barrage of inspirations and connections to their most famous works (\"Hey Steven, I want you to meet our neighbor, Ernest Thalberg, or E.T. as we used to call him back at Raiders U.\"). The Fabelmans is a perfectly nice movie, with solid acting, and the occasional moment that really grabs hold of you, like a electrifying meeting with a top Hollywood director in the film's finale. For me, those moments were only too fleeting. It's a family drama I wanted less family time with and more analysis on its creator.\n\nNate's Grade: B",

The whole cast in the film did a great job including Gabriel LaBelle, Michelle Williams, and Paul Dano and even though Judd Hirsch was in it for a little bit but he did a great job as well. The cinematography throughout the film from the beginning to the end was great and John William's score was great as well from beginning to end. Steven Spielberg never disappoints in this filmmaking. This film was emotional throughout and I thought this film portrayed his young life very well and I hope another one comes out where it explores during his whole career with the whole cast again showing the early days of him making the movies and related because it would be worth it. The film had many funny and sad moments throughout the film. There aren't much movies made that are based on the young life of movie directors and I'm glad this one was made and there should be more of them. This film portrayed the young life of Steven Spielberg very well and it was so unexpected and this film really pays tribute to Steven Spielberg's parents very well and also pays tribute of how Steven Spielberg became the director he was today of how he was influenced to become a filmmaker as a child to his early life. This film is one of his best movies that he created that he took his time to make that was worth it and wasn't a big box office hit because this film was different and made for a different audience than his other movies, but this film is one of his top great movies that he made including Jurassic Park, E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, Schindler's List, the Indiana Jones franchise, Jaws, Close Encounters of the third Kind, Saving Private Ryan, Minority Report, Munich, Catch Me If You Can, Lincoln, War Horse, Bridge of Spies, The Post, Ready Player One, and West Side Story. If you are a big Steven Spielberg fan and you enjoy his movies go watch this one because it won't disappoint you at all and this is one of his great films.",

It feels like Spielberg is just pouring his heart out on screen and we're watching. The performances here are absolutely incredible from everyone involved, Paul Dano is amazing here per usual, and Michelle Williams is at her best here. Gabriel LaBelle is outstanding in his breakout role, playing a fictionalized version of Spielberg himself. Whatever the film needs to convey each actor is on their A-game, which can also be attributed to Spielbergs brilliant directing.\u00a0I think this will go down as one of the best films released this year, and a top ten Spielberg feature. This is easily my favorite film released this year so far, I haven't felt this deeply connected with a film like this in a very long time. While films like Everything Everywhere All At Once\u00a0and The Banshees of Inisherin\u00a0are definite contenders for my number one this year, The Fabelmans\u00a0means a lot more to me than both of those incredible films. This is a movie everyone should see at least once, it stays consistently engaging and entertaining but at the same time shows a deep love and passion for film. Give Spielberg all the Oscars.",

            "content": "The Fabelmans, a coming-of-age tale about a young boy who discovers what would be his lifelong passion of filmmaking and storytelling, is set in the 1960s as Sammy Fabelman navigates life through his formative years. Given a camera from his mother to help as an outlet for his creativity, Sammy manages to capture an act that will tear his family apart if shown. A love letter to the events of his past, director Steven Spielberg uses Sammy to relay to the audience the pains of growing up Jewish in a post-World War II era as well as the joys of his life's calling.\n\nWith the continuing trend of older directors looking back and retelling imagined versions of their youth (Belfast, Armageddon Time), Spielberg proves yet again that he's one of the masters of the craft. Showing the slow dissolving relationship of the Fabelman family as contrasted with Sammy's growing love and talent for storytelling gives the movie the necessary weight while not being shy to inject moments of humor throughout. A point of interest that Spielberg intentionally plays with is the magic of movies as a use of escapism; for most moviegoers, a movie is a great way to forget life's ills for a couple of hours and be swept away to far flung lands said audience may never get the chance to experience for themselves. Unfortunately, in The Fabelmans, it's Sammy's discovery while editing film that really kickstarts the unravelling of the family. Full of heart, emotion, a love of movies and the process behind the making of them, The Fabelmans never gets too saccharine or overly sentimental; Spielberg rides a perfect line between dreamy nostalgia and melancholic remembrance.\n\nStarring Gabriel LaBelle, The Fabelmans shows the makings of an excellent young actor who's poised to have an amazing career. Confident, funny, cold, and extremely vulnerable at times, LaBelle is the movie's brightest spot. With his easygoing charm, it's easy for audiences to immediately latch onto LaBelle as his portrays Sammy Fabelman, the Steven Spielberg stand-in for the story. There's times Spielberg perfectly captures the wonder on LaBelle's face, primarily when Sammy is shooting or editing a movie. While not as strong in some of the film's more emotional scenes, specifically those with his parents, LaBelle still manages to provide an overall impressive performance, especially in the shoes he's filling.\n\nAlso starring Michelle Williams and Paul Dano as Sammy's parents, it's not immediately clear why either actor took these roles. It's not until late in the film where Michelle Williams really starts heating up and giving a great performance that it's clear to see why she accepted the role. Williams cruises along through the movie, but in two powerful scenes kicks into a higher gear where the audience is reminded that she's a four-time Academy Award nominated actress. There are depths of sadness to Mitzi Fabelman, and Williams swims those depths with the skill of a well-seasoned sailor. The pain, the attempts to hide the pain, and the depression that battles Mitzi throughout the film make for some of the more poignant scenes in the movie.\n\nFor his part, Paul Dano's performance is incredibly subdued in a way that only Paul Dano can do. Fresh off his take as The Riddler in Matt Reeves' The Batman, Dano does a come about-face here as the soft spoken, loving father figure of the The Fabelmans' household. As a technological wizard, Burt Fabelman uses his skills and saavy to increase his family's station in life, although some of the family moves seem to have ulterior motives behind them. While never spoken aloud in Burt's presence, there's a secret that hangs about the family that Dano manages to squeeze every drop of doubt from. With an incredible internal performance, this role of Burt Fabelman is one of Dano's best.\n\nIt'd be criminal to not give a mention to veteran actor Judd Hirsch. Appearing in only three scenes in the film, it's the second scene, the meat of his time on screen, that Hirsch steals every bit of shine from Gabriel LaBelle and takes him to acting class. Charming, funny, and still deadly serious, Sammy's great uncle Hersch lays down for Sammy the two paths that face him in life. Almost a monologue with brief interruptions from Sammy, Boris provides one of the year's best scenes as a character who drops a bit of backstory for Mitzi as well as being the catalyst for Sammy. Hirsch's performance speaks to decades of screen and theater work, nailing his timing while dispensing his life advice and had he more screen time, Hirsch could've had a clear shot at a Supporting Actor nomination.\n\nDirected by Steven Spielberg, The Fabelmans shows a storyteller entering his sixth decade of moviemaking still retaining the ability to produce stories that inspire awe and wonder. It's never easy to adapt and fictionalize one's life into a story for mass consumption, but Spielberg does so in a way that neither paints him as a saint nor asks the audience for pity. While it's unlikely that Spielberg will reveal which elements are real, which are embellished, and which are completely fabricated, that fact that all three blend so seamlessly together shows just how he and writer Tony Kushner are (this being their fourth collaboration behind Munich, Lincoln, and West Side Story). From a directorial standpoint, Spielberg doesn't bring anything new or flashy out of the toolbox. Unlike West Side Story, which features some impressive feats of cinematography, timing, and coordination, here in The Fabelmans he turns it down a notch, preferring to keep the focus off his talents and on his fictionalized family.\n\nOverall, The Fabelmans is one of the year's more heartfelt stories. A fictionalized retelling of the youth of one of the best living filmmakers, Spielberg shows both the ugly sides and the bright sides of his life in a way that keeps the audience engaged and locked in. Knowing how the story ends makes the journey even more entertaining; seeing Sammy's love and appreciation for filmmaking blossom and mature gives the audience an insight into the life of a man who's dedicated his to the art of storytelling. With excellent performances from the three main leads, as well as one powerfully raw scene with Judd Hirsch, The Fabelmans stands as one the best movies to start winding down the year.",

            "content": "The Fabelmans is a touching and mesmerizing film that celebrates the acclaimed director Steven Spielberg while recounting his origins as a filmmaker. The film is absolutely emotional; it's mainly about family and deals with the vicissitudes of family interaction while paying homage to cinema.\n\nAs a kid, Sam Fabelman learns an important lesson from his father, one of the basic principles of filmmaking: retinal persistence. Like magic, films are a simple succession of still images which gives the illusion of movement. When Sammy attends his first movie projection the event turns into a life changing experience. The story follows his life while he discovers his passion for movie making supported by his family: his dad Burt (Paul Dano), his mother Mitzi (Michelle Williams), his 3 sisters, and his uncle Ben (Seth Rogen). His father is an electrical engineer, his mother a concept piano player and the fusion of technicality with art certainly shaped his craft. The family's dynamic was beautiful yet cloudy at times; a source material turned in melodrama, perfect for great storytelling.\n\nI love the humanity that The Fabelmans displays. And I loved the way the film showed and captured Sam's life overall, in the sense that it didn't just feel like you were watching a story. As the audience I could really understand and feel the emotions Sam was feeling. The core of the storyline are the characters and the relationships between them. Despite the Fabelmans are not a perfect family, they stand out in their unity and the bond between them. The relationship between Sam and his mom, masterfully performed by Michelle Williams, is mesmerizing to watch. There's a complicity that it is put to the test, generating wonderful conflict. Williams scenes are like study material for an actor. But every cast member is great at its craft in this film. The camera moves fluidly from the family dinners, to the action scenes contained in Sam's early films through the corners of the houses where the family moved and the places that hide the deepest family secrets. Janusz Kaminski's photography resembles the era and has the perfect warmth, and the score of John Williams stays in our hearts. The Fabelmans deserves a nomination on each major category in the upcoming Academy Awards: Best Film, Best Original Script, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Score and Williams and Dana most probably will nod Best Actress and Best supporting actor respectively.\n\nMy favorite scenes are Sam experimenting and reproducing the train crash he watched in his first movie experience and Mitzi watching herself in his son family movie. My favorite quote: \"Guilt is a waste of an emotion\" which I consider profoundly meaningful of what this movie is telling its audience. The message of the film is to be able to find balance in adversity. Families are not perfect, but true bond should prevail.\n\nThe Fabelmans is PG 13 due to mature thematic elements and brief violence and drug use.\n\nI give The Fabelmans 5 out of 5 starts and recommended for audiences 12 to 18 and adults. The Fabelmans opens in theaters November 23, 2022. By Zoe C., KIDS FIRST.",

With biographical drama, Spielberg takes nostalgic trips down memory lane reminiscing childhood pain motivated him make movies entertain. It's Spielberg's first attempts dramatize parent marriage deterioration set stage for his love of moving image, but he achieves deftly. Using captivating cinematography, Spielberg draws viewers into a teenager's journey of self-discovery coming to terms with his troubled upbringing pursuing passions for filmmaking. Emulating \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", Spielberg effectively utilizes lens flare showcase Sammy Fabelmans' awe-inspiring obsession with filmmaking profession. Recalling Roy Neary's laser-focus obsession with searching for aliens leading towards marriage deterioration, Sammy Fabelman becomes obsessed with shooting motions pictures against lens flare backgrounds. Spielberg showcases extraordinary controls over productions-design, costume and music, construct out-of-the-world movie-going experience. Spielberg effectively pays homage to his famous movies (ex. 1998's \"Saving Private Ryan\") through behind-the-scenes footage of films Sammy produces. Spielberg's screenplay is also sensational, creating compassionate portrait of teenager experiencing divorce repercussion through minimal dialogue. One appreciates marvelous performances. Gabriel LaBelle gives breakthrough performance as Sammy Fabelman. With smart expression, he conveys bravery, obsession and perseverance of adolescent whose obsession with making movies allows him overcome parent marriage deterioration. Michelle Williams is wonderful in role of mother possessing artistic skills supports her sons' dreams fulfills capturing moving stills even though it doesn't pay the bills. Williams imbues complexity into a mother experiences marriage deterioration using tone of voice. Finally, Paul Dano's dazzling. As sensitive father sheds tear when son states he doesn't want pursue engineer career, he brings heartbreaking emotion to the movie. Finally, \"The Fabelmans\" deserve appreciation for its universal message about determination pursue dreams forming bond aliens E.T. galaxies expeditions. Recalling \"E.T. The Extraterrestrial\", Spielberg discusses universal themes of child-like innocence, divorce and community which everyone will relate towards. As film-buff whose hobbies always clashed with professional responsibilities, I related with Sammy Fabelman. Hence, \"The Fabelmans\" is one of those special movies offering wide-ranging appeal. Fans of Steven Spielberg will definitely enjoy \"The Fabelmans\" and so will movie-goers seek heartwarming entertainment. Like flipping through nostalgic images of a photo album captured Jurassic-Park paleontologists stored households torn apart by E.T. divorce tragedies, it brought back fond memories of my own childhood stare up at skies searching Close-Encounters-of-the-Third-Kind galaxies enduring bullying for A.I. Artificial Intelligence developing obsessions with an art-form as precious as Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark artifacts writing about movies as past-time hobby in world where one's dreams seldom ever materialize into realities for filmmakers rarely ever reach achievements Spielbergian artists world-famous making blockbuster movies.",

Covering a span of about fifteen years, The Fabelmans finishes with a spectacular scene of Gabriel's meeting with famed director John Ford (David Lynch), clearly based on Spielberg's own meeting with the crusty master of American cinema.  The acting throughout is brilliant, including a short but impactful performance by Judd Hirsch as Gabriel's uncle, some beautifully rendered scenes (Gabriel's mother watching a film in the closet, a turning point in the movie), and plenty of insightful and touching dialogue.  The movie lags a bit when the family initially moves to California, but otherwise, it is one of Spielberg's best films.",

I loved the family that was so dysfunctional - it added to the journey and reason that Spielberg made the world of filmmaking his chosen mission in life.  The characters were interesting, but a bit shallow, as they were almost stereo-typical...I remember when the late Neil Simon did his trilogy plays that became films - especially his Brighton Beach memoirs.  That was an everlasting example of a tightly knit, Jewish family who learned to exist with each other - this however, lost the family charisma..and was a tad bland in the expectations of the characters - almost as if Spielberg did not want great performances, he used great actors, but the finished product was a bit too generic.  Tony Kushner (Angels in America) is a fabulous co-producer and writer - he is one of the greats of all time - but the lack of total emotional involvement in the portrayals left off that extra star.  I know that I am probably one of the few who gave it only four stars - but - I am also quite observant and knowledgeable of his better works and those of Mr. Kushner.  Guys - it shoulda/coulda been magnificent if only there was more angst and empathy happening.  It is still a must see film, but do not say - it is Spielberg and Kushner that gives it a full five star - realize that if you did not know who collaborated upon it, you would feel differently..BTW - I am a fan of bot gentlemen!",

            "content": "\"The Fabelmans\" is nothing short of Spielberg's magnum opus. It is a masterful film, as one would expect! As well, it is of course deeply personal and intimate at the same time \u2014 we really get a chance to get inside Spielberg's head more than ever before. We truly get to see the world through his eyes for once; see the childhood life he lived that inspired the way he would approach so many of the films that we have come to love. But that isn't what really struck me so immensely with this film; while I loved this exploration of his past through his family life, religion, friends and film, I adore this film because it helped me find myself. There were a scarily high amount of moments I was watching and found myself thinking how I would do the same thing, from visualizing shots with toys as a kid, to turning to films to help processing my emotions, to inner conflicts between following dreams of pursuing film or doing what is best for the family or future. Not to say I am some sort of up and coming Spielberg; I for sure am not, but I could identify myself in the character of Sammy (who is essentially the film's version of Spielberg). This film was an incredible experience for me to watch. The film brought me back to how I first fell in love with movies; and I am indebted to it for that. This film spoke to me on a deeper level than any film ever has, it touched my soul.\n\nI treasure Steven Spielberg; his work is some of my favourite pieces of cinema I have ever seen. To see him offer us the chance to explore his love of cinema and his own path to finding his way into the movie making business was magical. And this movie is him at his very best; it is much more than just autobiographical. This film is the most vulnerable Spielberg has felt as a storyteller, every shot was very clearly a memory. It is a poignant examination of coping with life's unexpected hurdles through art, even when you don't understand why. It's about how artists cope by creating something to occupy that empty space in themselves. \"The Fabelmans\" should speak to anyone who has ever struggled with their voice, communicating to their parents about what they want to pursue and that their passion is not just a phase. Especially when life changes in ways we can't control, while art is something we direct. Boiled down, it's about the power of movies and how they can change one's life, seen through the lens of a simple family drama. I loved how Spielberg portrayed his parents; the relationship he had with them and their divorce, as it had such a profound impact on his filmmaking, from \"Close Encounters\" to \"ET\" to \"Catch Me if You Can\". Through doing this, Spielberg shows how therapeutic it can be to express and see life expressed in a heightened and crafted way. It is just pure brilliance.\n\nSpielberg proves there is no one else like him; cinema would be so much less rich without his vision and style. His storytelling and visual sensibilities are pitch perfect, the choices he makes are objectively the best ways to tell the story he wants to tell. The direction is of course impeccable \u2014 you feel the magic of filmmaking through Spielberg's direction, a feeling one rarely gets with cinema these days. Everything, from the staging, cinematography, lighting, production design, costuming, music (John Willams' score, while minimal, is perfect), editing and especially acting is stunning. We don't get movies like this anymore, it is just so rich in every aspect! \n\nThe acting was very notable in this movie. Spielberg really knows how to cast the perfect actors for a role, and this might just be some of his best casting yet. First off, Michelle Williams and Paul Dano are both incredible in their roles, delivering impressive performances that will be easy award contenders. David Lynch and Judd Hirsch have some awesome, scene stealing cameos that were some of my favourite moments in the film. But the true star is Gabriel LaBelle, who plays Sammy, our young Spielberg. This might just be the best breakout performance I have ever seen from a young actor, and it is certainly one of the best performances of the year! I fully believed him as a young Spielberg, you see his awkwardness, but also how his love of cinema and filmmaking informs his life. Plus he looked exactly like Spielberg himself at that age, and was such a great lead for this film!\n\nUltimately this movie is one that I will love for years to come. This movie gave me the greatest insight into one of the greatest directors alive, as well as to myself as well. If you want to know how I see the world, this movie shows it off exactly. I don't think I've ever connected with a movie more than I did with this one. The movie shows why movies are so important, and it helps that you really feel the magic of film with this one as well! It is a celebration of cinema, of filmmaking, and it gives you an even greater amount of respect and appreciation for Spielberg himself. I loved it, more than I can ever put into words. I love a lot of movies, but I have a different type of love for this movie that is higher than most. This movie touched my soul, it's an ode to the thing I love most in the world; the movies.",

If I was Queen, Id say screw the turkey and save the Christmas (Or Hanukkah) gift money and lets do an activity philanthropic donations and bowling perhaps.\n\nI say this to introduce how I felt about The Fablemans, directed by Steven Spielberg which he co-wrote with Tony Kushner. Meaning, most of the adults were acting on an annoying stage play hyperbolic level while the kids were believable, led by the ideal super actor and Spielberg teenage representative, Gabrielle LaBelle.\n\nPaul Dano was decent as the nerd scientist Dad whos enamored by his wifes histrionics, ignoring her fixation on his best friend (Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen respectively). Williams and Rogen took part of the fun of of this film for me, due to the aforementioned, adults are boring thesis. Their acting was eye rollingly annoying, so schmaltzy you wondered who could even stand being in the same room with them. But I guess thats why they were meant to be together. Judd Hirsch, while also melodramatic, as an Uncle of Williams, made more sense to me (who doesnt have an out there Uncle?).\n\nThe teenage high school rom com section was spot on which is saying something since Im usually allergic to the cliche high school bullies, first romance, yada yada. Here, I was riveted with breathtaking scenes between LaBelle and Chloe East as well as LaBelle and Sam Rechners hallway scene (all three definitely future stars). These moments were complex on a level that the adult parts were not. Fortunately the kids took over this movie in time and grandeur and made this holiday film worth participating in.",

If you have ever tried to be an artist, are a struggling artist or grew up in a family that valued practicality and physical tools but downplayed art and conceptual things, this film will hit home. Even though it's a pretty standard coming-of-age story, I see people giving it bad reviews or saying they didn't understand the story and that's probably because this may be Spielberg's most Jewish film yet. Not Jewish in the obvious and overt way them being hunted by Nazis, struggling during the wars etc. Instead the film is very Jewish culturally and dramatically from songs that are sung and dinners to humor and dialogue. People may not have expected that (I didn't) but maybe it's due to having Jewish friends that I found the humorous parts hilarious and the overall story entertaining.  Again at its core it's a coming-age-story and a family drama, so it's smaller in scope and topic compared to Spielberg's other movies. \"The Fabelmans\" is probably my favorite dramatic film of the year. \n\n\nIf you want more of my film/TV thoughts follow me: @MedleyMovies",

This film misses the mark by a landslide. Steven Spielberg blew what could have been a great story. It has wonderful actors doing their best with what they were given, but it doesn't have any heart or soul and there is absolutely no emotional connection between the audience and the characters onscreen. Most egregious of all, is Steven Spielberg's total lack of balls... this film is too safe and in no way brave. Total dud.

Terrible casting in my opinion - Paul Dano is one dimensional and feels like a cliche of a cliche of a cliche, while Seth Rogan should just stay in his lane and stick to fart jokes. \n\nCredit where credit is due - they nailed the production design (even though I always wonder why everything looks so clean - resulting in people looking like they are wearing costumes instead of actually living, breathing humans). The super-8 movie sequences are very fun, and again, glimpses of brilliance in some of the editing scenes as well...\n\nOverall - a total mess!",

This story, brought to life through a screenplay co-written by Spielberg and Tony Kushner, literally speaks to you and resonates with anyone of any age who aspires to be an artist in any field.\n\nThe rest of the performances are terrific, with Michelle Williams as Sammy's mother Mitzi being a major standout, same with Paul Dano as Sammy's father Burt, and Judd Hirsch, who gives a memorable monologue as Sammy's great uncle Boris. These 4 performances deserve tons of award nominations. The cinematography is beautiful, as we can all expect from the great Janusz Kaminski. John Williams' score, while a bit more subdued and minimalist this time due to it being mostly driven by piano, suits the film's uplifting tone, no matter what people think of it.

Over the years, he\u2019s given us films that were touchstones for two generations.  So we owe him this self-indulgence.What Spielberg and Co-Writer Tony Kushner (\u201cAngels in America\u201d) have created is puzzling.  From my perspective, the film is in three acts of widely varying lengths and equally diverse intentions.  The first 75% of this film traces Spielberg\u2019s development from his first movie experience, seeing DeMille\u2019s \u201cThe Greatest Show on Earth,\u201d through his adolescent movie-making.  It\u2019s ironic that the re-creation of Spielberg\u2019s early movie-making is actually pretty dull, offering little insight into his cinematic sensibilities.  During this time, the fissures in his parents\u2019 relationship - and the ripple effects throughout the family \u2013 become apparent.  When it\u2019s not being depressing or sad, this section of the film is remote and emotionally distant, apparently because of Spielberg\u2019s tortured attempt not to take one parent\u2019s side in the conflict.Act Two explores Spielberg\u2019s move to Northern California and his experiences in a high school which was apparently heavily populated by very tall Aryan males.  We discover that his first girlfriend is a devout Christian (her wall is a shrine dedicated equally to Jesus, Fabian and Bobby Rydell) who hopes to save his soul.  She also has apparent difficulty conflating religious fervor and sexual arousal.  This section of the film is just as impressionistic as Act One, but the colors are brighter and the tone is light, if not frivolous.Act Three lasts only a few minutes. In torment, Spielberg\u2019s character has decided to drop out of college to pursue his dream.  Along the way, he\u2019s given a five-minute audience with Director John Ford, who offers weighty utterances about cinematic technique through vast clouds of cigar smoke.  This causes our protagonist to stride happily, optimistically into the sunset for no apparent reason.Along the way, Spielberg and Kushner offer some alternative theories about Spielberg\u2019s passion for filmmaking.  For Spielberg, is filmmaking a way to control and make meaning of the chaos around him?  Possibly.  Could making movies be a buffer and an escape from family tension as his parents\u2019 marriage disintegrates?  Maybe.  Could making films offer an antidote for personal loneliness?  Could be.  Was moviemaking simply a way for Spielberg to find his place in the confusing social landscape of childhood and adolescence?  Kinda.  Does he enjoy playing God, deciding the winners and losers in his narratives? Perhaps.  The most frustrating element of this film is that Spielberg seems more perplexed about the events around him and his own motivations than he has ever been when filming his iconic characters.  But then, maybe that\u2019s the way it is with humans.  When we\u2019re the subject of the conversation, it always messier.  At the end of the day, life is apparently just as confusing for Spielberg as it is for the rest of us.",

Spielberg obviously made this movie with care since it is about his childhood and that care I think really shows in the final product. The performances are really strong especially Gabriel LaBelle and Paul Dano. The Mitzi dance scene is one of my favorite scenes this year. I think the coming age of story is pretty standard but I think there is always interesting going on with the characters so I didn't mind. I just wish it dove a little deeper to the darker side of his complex relationships with his parents since it gets kind of abandoned in the latter half of the movie. John William's final score for Spielberg is emotional and really wonderful. Overall, I really like the movie but I wish I could have seen the more darker sides to the certain events that happen in the film since almost everything is conveyed so optimistically.",

Here, it's Steven Spielberg in the director's chair and the director's whole soul is on display for the world to see. Reverent, earnest and cheeky, this film leans further away from the usual trappings of the Hollywood biopic, opting instead to tell a coming-of-age tale that's freer in form than expected. In any event, it's undeniably fascinating to see any filmmaker mulling over the elements of their own life and then applying artistic flair in turn. There's something even more surreal about that filmmaker being the literal person whose last name is most closely associated with the profession of filmmaking itself. Definitely a solid watch.",

In the film Sammy Fabelman, as Spielberg\u2019sI remember my first childhood experience in the cinema with my brother going to see X-MEN. Coincidentally filming of that movie took place at Roy Thompson Hall where the screening of this movie was. In the film Sammy Fabelman, as Spielberg\u2019s onscreen proxy, witnesses The Greatest Show on Earth. His first childhood cinematic experience. The Fablemans does not match the experience of seeing X-MEN or The Greatest Show on Earth for the first time, but its recreation of childhood may be enough to inspire others to go out and do the same. If you ever wish you could go back to when you were younger with all the knowledge you know now, Spielberg has the solution: make a movie.It was my favourite film of 2022. This is a director who has made 33 films over 4 decades and his talent and experience show. It\u2019s fun to spot the references to Spielberg\u2019s other work during the film.What I was most worried about going into the film was Spielberg\u2019s writing. He\u2019s not known for being a writer. His dialogue is plainspoken, tin-eared, and a little corny. Yet he\u2019s smart enough not to try and make poetry. The dialogue is simple enough for an 8-year-old to understand. Even though Dad (Paul Dano, low key) explains in groan-inducing technical terms how movies work, reciting what sounds like the first page out of a film studies book. It still is earnest.The script for the movie started with his sister Anne in the 90s. She is known for writing the Academy Award-nominated script for the Tom Hanks movie Big. Funny enough, in the movie she is portrayed onscreen in by Julia Butters. When she tells young Sammy he should make more movies starring girls. It\u2019s definitely an acknowledgment of his limitations.The female lead characters in Ready Player One (Art3mis) and West Side Story (Maria) demonstrate his growth in directing female characters. But his female lead here Mitzi is a step back.Michelle Williams plays the mother Mitzi. Reaching for the emotional highs of her previous character in Blue Valentine, Williams dials it up. However, the screenplay doesn\u2019t lend the necessary depth to support her character. So in her overacting, it feels closer to Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Her best moment comes when she brings her children out of the house towards a literal tornado. \u201cIs it safe?\u201d One of the daughters asks. \u201cOf course it\u2019s safe, I\u2019m your mother!\u201d A resonant moment that succeeds at making Mitzi interesting. But the film doesn\u2019t counterbalance her zaniness, rendering her cartoonish.A Best Actress Oscar campaign is underway to promote Williams. She isn\u2019t a Lead, but it looks like Spielberg is trying to perfect his record. In the last decade, his films have collected Oscars in all other acting categories.I wanted more of Sammy\u2019s complicated relationship with his father Burt. The father-son dynamics of Spielberg\u2019s films are often a highlight. It\u2019s clear the director wanted to focus on the nourishing creativity Mitzi provided, but greater closure for the father character was needed. The rest of the family is supportive, so the father is the main opponent. However, thanks to the film\u2019s focus on Sammy\u2019s internal journey, the external relationships matter less.The Fabelmans is able to make up for its shallowness in two ways; direction and acting. Because his parents are so distinct, Sammy\u2019s conflicts remain clear. Gabriel LaBelle is perfect as Sammy. He\u2019s given heavy material but doesn\u2019t overdo it, landing several emotional beats with the right touch. A showdown with a high school bully nails Spielberg\u2019s quiet and not-so-quiet confidence. The family ensemble gives the movie its heart. Particularly Seth Rogen in his final scene. It\u2019s far from Rogen\u2019s best work, but the audience did get a kick out of hearing his iconic laugh. Such touches remind you there\u2019s real life put into these roles. It all adds up to Spielberg\u2019s biggest emotional punch in decades.Despite the heavy subject matter, there is a lightness to it, it is literally Spielberg. The brilliance is knowing he\u2019ll land on his feet. Perfect for a coming-of-age film. Whenever Sammy contemplates quitting there\u2019s fun in waiting to see what inspiration strikes for him to pick up the camera again. The movie doesn\u2019t kid itself. The setbacks Sammy faces are temporary. As bad as things get, and they can get pretty bad during high school, there is still light at the end of the tunnel.",

Our director, of course, shows no regrets; the tale articulates the painful experience of letting your relatives know that you don't want to follow their path in some way or another, just as little Paul in James Gray's 'Armageddon Time.''The Fabelmans' is a simple coming-of-age story, but what elevates it is the honesty of the screenplay, the acting, and the way it focuses on the mother \u2014 played brilliantly by Michelle Williams. As an artist herself, her struggle shows the consequences of not finding yourself and being held down by your own family \u2014 in her case, her mother.This is Steven Spielbergs most intimate movie in maybe decades, but it's not short of spectacle; the amateur filming sequences are outstanding. 'American Graffiti' and 'E.T.' come to mind when you're watching this; memories of a great time mixed with the urgency of the present. Oh, and the last scene is just memorable.

Written, produced, and directed by Steven Spielberg, this is by far his most personal and autobiographical film to date, as he essentially showcases his own personal upbringing and everything that led up to his success and inception of his now legendary Hollywood career. Sharing with us all of the most tender and personal moments of his life such as, going to see 'The Greatest Show on Earth' as his first film in the theater, his parents' divorce, his struggles with growing up Jewish and suffering bullying and anti-Semitism, splitting his time between Phoenix and Hollywood, etc., Spielberg tells all here in his typical grandiose, nostalgic, and endearing fashion. Young actor Gabriel LaBelle as the high school-aged Sammy Fabelman (who is essentially Spielberg) captures the spirit and determination of the filmmaker wonderfully. Williams and Dano as his mother Mitzi and his father Burt respectively also deliver some of their best and most tender work here. Judd Hirsch even briefly appears in one memorable scene as his uncle, and Seth Rogen also plays his own goofy self here as the uncle-like figure to Sammy. Production-wise, we are graced with beautiful cinematography that really manages to capture the look and feel of the era quite nicely, and Spielberg's go-to composer John Williams also delivers a beautiful and uplifting score as he always does. There are times where it feels a little overly sentimental and sappy, but I for one have come to expect this for most Spielberg films at this point anyway, and it almost certainly didn't hinder my enjoyment. Overall, it's an absolute love letter to film fans all over, and a beautiful and true testament to the power of film and its ability to move, inspire, and simply make us feel something. It's films like this that reaffirm just why I love films so much and am the huge film buff that I am and always have been for as long as I can remember. They truly shape who I am, and this film is a beautiful, touching, and tender reminder of that. Hats off to you Mr. Spielberg!",

Also in the film, Judd Hirsch making a short but memorable appearance in his recent Best Supporting Actor Oscar-nominated performance as Sammy's cantankerous Uncle Boris. Spielberg pays homage to the wonders and realities of youth, dreams and love of cinema seen through the eyes of Sammy whose early life witnesses his mother's unrealized musical aspirations, his father's multiple job changes resulting in the Fabelmans various moves from state-to-state, and the ultimate breakup of his family following his parents divorce. All this going on while Sammy realizes and begins to nurture his own artistic talents for filmmaking. A highlight of the movie is an almost unrecognizable David Lynch who appears at the climax of the film as Iconic director John Ford who talks to Sammy about the importance of horizon in good filmmaking. Steven Spielberg is one of the great directors who is blessed with a true gift for storytelling and he accomplishes this, again with THE FABELMANS. You may recognize his abiding love for Indiana Jones in this film through the character of a handsome, tough on the outside, flawed on the inside high school track star, caught on camera on Ditch Day by 18 year old Sammy Fabelman.

Funny enough it is also directed by Steven Spielberg. I haven't ever seen a biopic story that is also directed by the person the story is about. That interested me a lot but knowing it was about the legendary director Steven Spielberg is what made me want to watch it. Is the movie an overly self-indulgent semi-biopic, or does Steven continue to show why he is such a great director?The film is such an interesting piece as the characters themselves are fictional but based on real people. For example, the character that is meant to represent Spielberg is named Samuel \"Sammy\" Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle). What I appreciate is that Steven doesn't shy away from the flaws of the character representing him. Sammy is very passionate about filmmaking but he loves it so much that he puts it above his own family. His conflict is trying to pursue his passion while his family is tearing apart. On that note, there is a complex family dynamic with the clash of the logical but stern yet loving Dad (Paul Dano) and the artistic but selfish yet encouraging Mother (Michelle Williams). Sammy inherits both qualities from his parents but also some of their worse. Seeing the struggle of chasing a dream and their isolation is such an engaging theme. None of the characters is terrible people. They do wrong things but there is a lot more nuance to them. The story is incredibly warm, funny, gut-wrenching and powerful.The performance here is terrific and worthy of an Oscar. Michelle Williams gives an unforgettable performance as the mother, Mitzi. She shows how caring yet weird of a mother she is but shows how she is gradually getting more and more broken as the movie progresses. She could have easily made her character incredibly hatable but her performance succeeds in making the audience sympathize with her despite her being the main cause of the rift in the family. Paul Dano is also terrific as the dad, Burt. His performance is less eccentric and more subtle but he perfectly conveys the internal struggle of the character. Gabriel LaBelle plays Sammy and he is great. His character is sort of arrogant and Gabriel manages to convey that without being overly pompous and annoying.  LaBelle is terrific at communicating a young kid whose emotions are on the verge of exploding. He is a very promising young actor. In terms of supporting actors, Judd Hirsch appears for only two scenes yet he gives such a strong performance that takes over the scene. David Lynch also appears in just one scene but his scene might be the most memorable moment in the film.The music is composed by legendary composer John Williams and he continues to do a great job. Although, the score here isn't his most memorable. The cinematography is done by Janusz Kaminski of Schindler's List fame and he continues to be great here. There are tons of great and memorable shots that capture the essence of filmmaking in The Fabelmans. There is an amazing shot that has Sammy using his hands as a screen with a projector aimed at his palm which is stunning. If I had any issue with the film then it has to be the 2nd act with Sammy in high school. Scenes concerning Sammy's romance and his bullying are a little uninteresting compared to everything else. It doesn't help that his girlfriend feels very over the top and the bullies act like all the generic jocks you have seen over a dozen times. Fortunately, the high school stuff have a strong landing.Steven continues to show that he is still one of the best directors out there. Despite the film being a semi-biographic on him, he doesn't shy away from the flaws of him and his parents. He shows the struggle of chasing your passion which might resonate with a lot of people. If Spielberg decided this was his last film then this would've been a great final outing. However, from this film alone, I know he loves making films and he won't stop here. I can't wait to see his next work.",

It's that time of year when the movie landscape is crowded with holiday family movies and \"prestige\" pics. Those \"prestige\" pics are the ones attempting to garner enough attention to be considered for the Academy Awards. While The Fabelmans is a family drama, it definitely falls more into the \"prestige\" pic category. It's got everything: Michelle Williams actress-ing; Spielberg Spielberg-ing; coming-of-age tropes including a kid fascinated with a life making art. Oh! And a monkey, I can't forget the monkey. Here's how it went for me.The Fabelmans was directed by Steven Spielberg and co-written by Spielberg and Tony Kushner. There's a lot of prestigious people in mentioned in that sentence. Anyway, that talent sets the bar pretty high for this movie. The Fabelmans tells a semi-autobiographical story of Sammy Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle), a young, Jewish burgeoning film director and his family that happens to be coming apart at the seams. Sammy is introduced to the wonder of movies early and his parents unwittingly cultivate his obsession with motion pictures. Sammy's mother, Mitzi Fabelman (Michelle Williams), is a flighty, loving and passionate mother who sees herself as an artist and encourages Sammy's filmmaking efforts. Burt Fabelman (Paul Dano) is methodical and reasonable and sees Sammy's filmmaking as just a silly hobby. Sammy and his movies capture the highs and lows of his family through the 1950s and 1960s and give the audience insight into the foundation behind the film's director. Spielbergian hijinks ensue.That wasn't a great synopsis, but you get it. It's a coming-of-age story about a boy who wants to become a movie director and how that affects his family. It takes 2 and a half hours to tell this story? These coming-of-age stories can be a dime a dozen, but this one has the added layer of being told by and about the fictionalized family of one of the greatest living American directors. If you are into the Spielberg thing, then The Fabelmans should be catnip for you. If you don't really care about Steven Spielberg, then it may not be that interesting without that hook.Nevertheless, there are great moments throughout The Fabelmans. There are really interesting scenes of teenage Sammy filming and editing his low budget movies. He has some striking ingenuity in directing and adding effects to the early films. The movie tells a compelling story about the difference between capturing truth on film versus living it. There's a strong moral lesson to be learned from Sammy's singlemindedness in pursuing his art at all costs. Gabriel LaBelle does an excellent job of anchoring this movie as the main character. As for the parents, Paul Dano is very good as the mild-tempered and evenhanded Burt. Everything he does makes sense even when his family may be falling apart around him. On the other hand, Michelle Williams is all over the place, manic and grating. That may be the character that Spielberg has created, but it's also the over-the-top, scenery-chewing performance that Michelle Williams is giving.Ultimately, The Fabelmans is a good coming-of-age movie that hits some basic beats. It is elevated for those who are interested in the Steven Spielberg origin story. There are interesting parts about how the young man becomes a filmmaker, but if you don't care about that, then it's just another coming-of-age story to throw on the overflowing pile of them. For Spielberg fans, I say you'll be happy with a big box of popcorn if you venture to the theater. For everyone else, grab a bowl of popcorn for a matinee if you can't wait for it to show up on VOD or your favorite streaming channel.",

A beautiful homage to his life and family. A great coming of age movie and a must see for all the Spielberg fans. Young Sammy Fabelman (Mateo Zoryan/Gabriel LaBelle) aspires to become a filmmaker, facing issues throughout his childhood and adolescence with bullying and a devastating family secret. He explores his love and talent for filmmaking and how the power of films can help him see the truth.The Fabelmans is more of a love letter to Steven Spielberg's family than a love letter to cinema. It's described as the most personal film that Spielberg has ever made, and I wouldn't doubt that for a second. It's constantly tugging at the heartstrings and the emotion and love that went into this pours out of the film.My main issue with The Fabelmans is it felt dragged out and at the same time left me wanting more. Part of me wanted more behind the scenes of film and the movie making process, whereas it's more a nice coming of age story than anything else. Beautifully shot but it's not Spielberg's best. Perhaps the hype and discussions surrounding The Fabelmans over the last few months might have skewed my expectations. Or maybe it's just that the bar for Spielberg movies is just too high now. Yes it captured the nostalgic feel to it alright but if you're expecting E.T. you may be a little disappointed.The cast are perfect and with Spielberg making this I'd expect nothing less. I'm sure he took a lot of time to carefully select the actors to play his family. Michelle Williams and Paul Dano were interesting casting choices but they work. In recent years there's been a few movies now by established directors that are personal love letters to cinema, this year alone we have The Fabelmans, Empire of Light, and Babylon. And although The Fabelmans is a very well made movie, it's still Martin Scorsese's Hugo that does the love letter to cinema to perfection.The Fabelmans is the perfect choice for all the Steven Spielberg fans and movie lovers, he really is a master storyteller. Also if you've managed to make it this far without the ending being spoiled on you, try to keep it that way before seeing The Fabelmans. A definite recommendation for all the Spielberg fans.",
