            "content": "Sullivan's Travels is a twofer for me, it's my favorite Preston Sturges film and my favorite Joel McCrea one. It's an anti-message film, loaded with humor, with a most sublime message indeed.Joel McCrea plays director John Sullivan who's tired of making silly comedies and musicals for his studio. He wants to make films of social significance with a message about the troubles in today's world.Problem is that he doesn't know anything about poverty and unemployment, he's a rich kid who's been to boarding school. So off he sets, several times it turns out, to discover how the other half lives.That last time he sets out is a bit unplanned and through a combination of circumstances he winds up on a prison chain gang in some southern state. He learns some really profound lessons from that experience.But that's the serious side of Sullivan's Travels. Before that the film has some really gut splitting funny moments like McCrea learning about the speed of a whippet tank, being accused of stealing his own car. But my favorite is when he falls in the clutches of spinsters Elmira Sessions and Esther Howard. McCrea sets out to learn about poverty and deprivation and the two sisters see him as the answer to some poverty and deprivation they've been suffering for some time. Maybe the chain gang didn't look so bad.Veronica Lake in her memoirs said that one of the films she enjoyed most was Sullivan's Travels where she plays an disillusioned Hollywood hopeful who befriends the tramp McCrea without knowing who he really is. The following year Lake would be paired with Alan Ladd who was closer to her height. She said McCrea was a kind and decent man and wonderful to work with. The disparity of their height was the source of some amusement and some problems for Preston Sturges. Lake was a tiny thing, it was why she was teamed with Alan Ladd, and McCrea was well over six feet tall. Check the shots of them together, very rarely will you see them standing side by side.Sturges used a lot of his regular company of players. My two favorites in the supporting cast are Robert Grieg and Edward Blore who are McCrea's butler and valet. Both turn out to be wise men in their warnings to their boss about this folly he is undertaking.It's been said that Sullivan's Travels is supposed to be the anti-Frank Capra film about messages. I'm not sure Capra saw it that way. If you look at the portion of the film when Sullivan falls into this unfamiliar universe of the chain gang, it's very similar to what George Bailey was experiencing in that parallel universe he was sent to in It's A Wonderful Life. I think Sturges and Capra would find a lot of common ground in the messages of It's A Wonderful Life and Sullivan's Travels.",

            "content": "In Hollywood, the spoiled director of humdrum movies, John Lloyd Sullivan (Joel McCrea), was born in silver spoon but is very successful with his superficial comedies. Out of the blue, he tells to his producer Mr. LeBrand (Robert Warwick) that he wants to make serious dramas, like \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" and he will live like a tramp on the streets to learn the sorrows of great part of the population. He wears cheap clothes and tries to blend with poor people but he always returns to Hollywood protected by the safety team hired by the studio.One day, he goes to a dinner with a coin and a blonde girl (Veronica Lake) offers bacon and eggs to him. Soon he learns that the girl is a failed actress that had never a chance in Hollywood and is returning home hitchhiking without any money. Sullivan decides to retribute her kindness giving a ride to her in his car but they are arrested by the police. When they are released, the girl decides to join Sullivan in his quest to learn about poverty. When Sullivan is satisfied, he is robbed and dumped unconscious in a train. He awakes in the countryside where there is an incident and he is arrested and sentenced to a labor camp, where he leans the importance of comedy in the miserable lives of destitute people. \"Sullivan's Travels\" is a delightful movie by Preston Sturges with a satire of Hollywood lifestyle and the importance of comedy in the life of people, a relief for a couple of minutes for those that do not have other sort of entertainment. Joel McCrea is very funny in the role of a naive director trying to find how the poor people live. His chemistry with the gorgeous Veronika Lake is perfect and this was the first time that I noted that this lovely actress was only 1.51 m height. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Contrastes Humanos\" (\"Human Contrasts\")",

            "content": "When it comes right down to it, what you `think' you want isn't necessarily what you `really' want, nor is it likely to be anything you need.  But finding the answer is up to the individual, a prospect that's explored in the satirical `Sullivan's Travels,' directed by Preston Sturges.  Movie director John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea) has made a career of churning out one successful comedy after another, yet he remains unfulfilled.  He longs to do a `serious' film, one with meaning, a drama that will leave his mark on the industry and the world.  And he has a property that he thinks is perfect, a screenplay entitled `O Brother, Where Art Thou?'  The studio he works for, however, balks at the idea; Sullivan's comedies are not only good, they're a cash cow for the studio, so why fool with success?\tSullivan is adamant, though, and determined to make his film he strikes a bargain with the studio and gets the green light.  But once he's given the go-ahead, he wants to do it right-- and he realizes that to make a truly meaningful film, he must first experience himself the hardships of life he will be examining in `O Brother.'  So with only a dime in his pockets, he sets out on the road to find out what `life' is really all about.  And before it's over, he will get all he's looking for and more, in an odyssey that will be unforgettable for Sullivan, and for the audience, as well. \n\tFilled with pathos and poignancy, Sturges' film is an insightful sojourn across the territory of the human condition.  It'll make you laugh and it'll make you cry, as along with Sullivan you come face to face with some hard truths about reality.  And Sullivan's eventual epiphany regarding his personal wants and needs may be your own, as well, because this is a film with a definite message that is honest and undeniable.  A lesson in life delivered subtly and sensitively by Sturges, who makes it entertaining and thought provoking at the same time.  It's refreshing, in fact, t discover a film that delivers such an impact without having to resort to any kind of sensationalism, relying instead on the inherent humanity of the story, which Sturges conveys masterfully.  With exceptions, of course, it's a sensibility few of today's directors seem to possess.  Some notable exceptions would be Ang Lee with `The Ice Storm,' Kenneth Lonergan's `You Can Count On Me' and Tom DiCillo's `Box of Moonlight.'  All are films that, like `Sullivan,' are journeys of discovery, profound in sentiment without being overly sentimental.  There are more, to be sure, but they seem too few and far between.\tOne of the elements that makes this film so engaging is its colorful cast of characters, and the actors it employs to bring it to life, beginning with it's star, McCrea, who hits his stride as Sullivan with facility.  He credibly reflects Sullivan's ideals and principles with a look, as well as an attitude, that makes it work quite naturally.  You can believe this is a man with, perhaps not a naive, but certainly a rather guarded perception of life in the real world.  Which is not to say he lacks insight or wisdom; it's merely one of the basic truths this film points out-- that people live within parameters of their own design, established through personal experience and frame of reference.  And that's the John Sullivan McCrea presents here, with a portrayal that is honest and incisive.\tVeronica Lake was one of the hottest actresses around in 1942 when this film was made, and as the girl who becomes a part of Sullivan's journey, she lends considerable charm and a bit of mystique to the film.  It's a fairly straightforward role that benefits from her sparkle and personality; a notable performance that adds a touch of humor and some class to the proceedings, without being particularly exceptional.  But watching her, it's easy to understand the attention she received, especially after draping her long blond hair across her eye, peek-a-boo style-- which started a craze that swept the country, while creating an indelible image that ultimately defined her career.\tThe supporting cast includes Robert Warwick (Mr. Lebrand), William Demarest (Mr. Jones), Franklin Pangborn (Mr. Casalsis), Porter Hall (Mr. Hadrian), Byron Foulger (Mr. Valdelle), Margaret Hayes (Secretary), Robert Greig (Sullivan's Butler) and Eric Blore (Sullivan's Valet).  Call it a lesson in life, or a lesson about human nature; however you see it, `Sullivan's Travels' is an experience you're going to remember.  Entertaining, enjoyable and enlightening, it's an uplifting appreciation of the way things are, and not necessarily the way you `think' they should be.  It's a film that celebrates the comfort to be found in finding your own niche and realizing the importance of whatever it is that you contribute to your world and those around you.  It leaves you with a sense of purpose and the understanding that the grass is not always greener on the other side.  And it makes your own grass look pretty good in the bargain.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",

            "content": "\"Sullivan's Travels\" is one of the best films that came out of Hollywood in 1941. Preston Sturges showed he was an original with this story about self-discovery for a man that has a different view of the world. In a way, this is a satire about the movie industry.Hollywood in the early years, wouldn't touch any project that it deemed non commercial. Which is why when John Sullivan, a successful director of film comedies decides to do a movie based on a serious book, the studio thinks he must be going crazy. Why would this director want to make the movie going public think? It was a preposterous notion then, as well as today, when basically all movies making any points are independently produced. After all, the industry wants everyone to have a great time, be entertained, and not make them think about at all.John Sullivan gets much more than what he bargained for when he decides to take to the back roads of the country, dressed as a hobo and with only ten cents in his pocket. The first check on reality comes when he meets the kind girl at the road side diner. He is hungry, but what can one get for a dime? This girl, who has had it trying to make a name in the movies, orders ham and eggs for him, no strings attached. If there is a more kindred soul than this young woman who wants nothing in return, we haven't met her yet.Sully and the girl go back on the road where they witness the reality of America's indigents traveling back and forth in empty cattle cars all over the country in search of jobs, or perhaps a better living. Sullivan ultimately wants to give money anonymously to the poor people he has met, but he meets with disaster and ends up in jail, the victim of circumstantial evidence and he is sent to jail. One night Sully discovers the great mystery about the allure of the pictures: It's the laughter stupid! Sullivan realizes how far off the mark he has been in trying to bring drama to the masses.Joel McCrea makes a fantastic Sullivan. This under estimated man was a great comedian, as well as an actor that is always believable. The whole reason for watching this movie is Mr. McCrea's performance. His chemistry with the ravishingly beautiful and young Veronica Lake is one of the best things in the film. Both these actors, under Mr. Sturges' direction do their best work on screen. Sturges makes fun at his own expense when the girl asks Sully if he can introduce her to the great Hollywood director, Ernst Lubitsch. Mr. McCrea and Ms. Lake seem to be having a fun time together.Mr. Sturges always surrounded himself with a group of actors that one sees in his movies. Robert Greig, Eric Blore, William Demarest, and the rest of the cast contribute to make this a winning comedy. The best scene that involves most of these actors happen at the beginning of the film when they are chasing Sullivan in the R.V. and things inside the trailer begin falling all over the place. That was priceless movie making.Preston Sturges combines a social commentary with comedy in this brilliant film that is a tribute to his genius.",

Fortunately those pretentious rips fail to appear and it's the arrival of Veronica Lake that turns the ramble to a journey and an illustration as relevant today about the lack of opportunity we continually chose to turn a blind eye to. An interesting twist towards the end provides something to chew on and supports a finale that may well give you a little to smile about, maybe even a chuckle.",

I especially would recommend seeing this on the Criterion DVD version to get the best picture available. I'm not plugging that company because I think their discs are overpriced, but they do a great job giving you the best transfer of these classics you'll ever find and it made this film even better.The story is very different: one that suddenly turns 180 degrees in the last segment. After a more lighthearted combination of drama and humor through much of the story, the film gets surprisingly rough in the last 20 minutes and is not always fun to watch and the leading man, Joel McCrea, goes through some very, very tough times. This is one of Veronica Lake's more appealing roles and, although not a beautiful women, she's intriguing enough - especially with her fabulous long blonde hair - to make me glad I have at least one sharp-looking film of her.Overall, this Preston Sturges-directed movie is good stuff and a classic film that deservedly still has a solid reputation.",

            "content": "Sturges' most daringly double-edged film, laced with bitter ironies.  It is also arguably the most audacious film in Hollywood's (mainstream) history, audacious because it takes the kinds of risks that can so easily fall flat on their face, and right until the final image, as Sturges becomes increasingly ambitious and multi-layered, you wonder how long he can keep it up without getting ridiculous.  It never does, but the film is so full of contradictions, tensions, suppressions, clanging lurches in tone - 'Travels' is ostensibly a comedy, and one of Hollywood's best, but the last twenty minutes are truly painful to watch, harrowing and not at all funny.The overriding source of tension, of course,  is the film itself, the plot, and the emotions that are supposed to be elicited.  It is very difficult, and frequently impossible to gauge the tone of any one scene.  Sometimes this is straightforward, as when information is deliberately withheld from the audience, it is asked to make a judgement, and then shown to be wrong, as in the scenes where the studio moguls claim a background of deprivation (which is historically plausible).  This kind of comedy is familiar enough. \nBut what about the later montage of Sullivan and the Girl experiencing the 'reality' of poverty - are these scenes supposed to be genuine representation of poverty?  Are they part of a wider satire on pious films like 'Grapes of Wrath', which dubiously aestheticise poverty - there are a lot of Expressionistic flourishes in this sequence?  Are they a kind of abstract purgatory through which Sullivan finds spiritual understanding? \nThere is a big difference between the representation of poverty in this sequence and the one where Sullivan is attacked and sent to prison.  But is one more 'authentic' than the other - the second one bravely rejects the view of 'noble' poverty, shows how it dehumanises people, turns them instinctual and brutal; but it also provides a neat moral, which suggests that if you do somebody wrong, you will be (horribly) punished for it.  This realism, therefore, is as contrived as the first.  Is this Sturges' point, that the good intentions of realism are always tainted by ideological assumptions, patronising good-will, or motives of elevation.  This sense of artifice, of a film comprised of varying self-reflexive modes rather than a plausible narrative, runs through 'Travels', with characters talking about the film they're in as a plot - in direst danger, Sullivan acknowledges the need for a helluva twist which duly arrives, filmed in silent slapstick with barely concealed Sturges contempt (and did his friends seem terribly put out by his death?).This would seem to uphold 'Travels'' ostensible theme, its celebration of comedy as a sugar with which to sweeten the harshness of reality.  This is a very cynical view of comedy, and a highly manipulative, conservative one - distract an unhappy populace from the injustice of their lives.  The best comedies - from 'Sherlock Jr' and 'Modern Times' to 'Playtime' and 'The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie' have always been about real life, encouraging their viewers to think harder about the society they live in, much more effectively than so-called naturalism.  'Travels' is no exception.  It might be a celebration of comedy, but this is comedy a million miles from 'Ants in your Pants'.  What other 40s film still manages to show the brutality of poverty, of the prison system, of race relations, the fate of young women in sexually voracious Hollywood (the Girl's ease with her body in the swimming pool scene speaks volumes), however we choose to read them?  When Sullivan's determination at the end to continue making populist comedies is endorsed by the ringing laughter of the world's meek and suffering, the disjunction is grotesque.  This is a man, on an airplane, completely removed from reality, surrounded by wealthy toadies. Those happy laughs could so easily be contemptuous guffaws, because what Sullivan wants to do, and Sturges hasn't, is hide the inequalities of capitalism, the system on which Hollywood thrives, and the flaws in which they would be only too happy to cover up with inanity.  But to even suggest this is to fall into the 'Capra' trap mocked at the beginning.This difficulty is what makes 'Travels' such a stunningly modern film - its shifts from sophisticated verbal wit to elaborate slapstick to blatant Carry On-like innuendo (the matronly sister dusting  the bedpost after seeing a sweating, shirtless Sullivan work) to tragedy to hallucination and dream to satire foreshadows Melville and the New Wave, while the privileged rich man who cannot escape Hollywood would transmute into the guests who can't leave the house, or can't get dinner in later Bunuel films; or the film that begins with an end.  The opening sequence takes off 'Citizen Kane'.  The deadpan genderplay is quietly gobsmacking, and Veronica Lake as a (gorgeous) tramp would be alluded to by Jeanne Moreau in 'Jules et JIm'.  But the joys are all Sturges', as he democratises comedy (see again that swimming pool sequence);  I love in particular those glorious supporting actors: my favourite being the immortal Eric Blore and Robert Greig as Sullivan's servants.",

A Hollywood variation on Gulliver's Travels, it's the tale of Hollywood director John Sullivan (Joel McCrea), tired of making Hollywood Fluff, who wants to branch out with a socially conscious epic, called \"O Brother, Where Art Thou\", and sets out to research the meaning of poverty. His studio bosses (very funny roles by Robert Warwick and Porter Hall) try to tell him it's a ridiculous idea but Sullivan insists, puts on some hobo clothes and sets out to see what it's like to experience poverty and suffering. The studio soon sees it as potential publicity stunt and sent an entire crew to follow him around during his trip.Some very enjoyable references to socially conscious movie-making, to Ernst Lubitch in particular, make this particularly fun with some knowledge of the period and the films mentioned, albeit not necessary. And almost worth seeing alone for Veronica Lake's memorable performance as a failed starlet.According to Sturges, the film did contain a little \"message\":\"SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS is the result of an urge, an urge to tell some of my fellow filmwrights that they were getting a little too deep-dish and to leave the preaching to the preachers.\" By any means, he made a uniquely self-reflective comedy about Hollywood with wonderful characterizations and superlative performances.

            "content": "John Sullivan, a successful director of light comedy's, wants to make something more meaningful. He wants to make a film about the suffering of poor people. The film company is not amused (they want more of his box office hits) and his producer remarks that John knows nothing about poor people. This remark has not the intended effect, because John decides to roam for a while dressed up as a little tramp a la Chaplin. Eventually he gets into trouble. Learns more about the live of the poor. Sees the joy that a light comedy film can give them, and never makes his \"meaningful\" film.The title of \"Sullivan's travels\" reminds us of the classical book \"Gulliver's travels \" (1726, Jonathan Swift). Gulliver travels to exotic country's. Sullivan travels in his own country, but the kind of people he meets are not less strange to this upper class director. In this respect there are similarities between \"Sullivan's travels\" and \"My man Godfrey\" (1936, Gregory La Cava). In both films upper class people are interfering with poor people without knowing a thing about them. In \"My man Godfrey\" they see them as a sort of curiosity to be hunted in a scavenger hunt. In \"Sullivan's travels\" John Sullivan is interested in them in a much more respectful and sympathetic way.One can interpret \"Sullivan's travels\" in two ways. The first interpretation looks at the directors. In this interpreation the message to the directors is to take oneself not to seriously. The second interpretation looks at the audience. In this interpretation the message of the film is that people only want \"bread and circuses\" and that it is a wasted effort to try to interest them for something more substantial.The second interpreation is a bit haughty and I really don't believe that Preston Sturges intended the film in this way. This second interpretation is in particular contradicted by a brilliant scene in the middle of the film. In this scene (which last for several minutes and is entirly without dialogue) Sullivan (as a tramp) is walking through a dormitory full of homeless people looking for a place to lay his tired body.Remains the first interpretation, and looked at in this way, \"Sullivan's travels\" is one of the best films about the film industry, maybe less known than but on par with a film like \"Sunset boulevard\" (1950, Billy Wilder).The book John Sullivan originally wants to make a film of (but never does) is titled \"O brother where are thou\". In 2000 the Coen brothers at long last made a film of this name. In this film they pay tribute to Preston Sturges, but I doubt if this film (based as it is on \"The odyssey\" from Homer) is the one John Sullivan originally had in mind.",

He takes with him Veronica Lake, playing a Hollywood starlet wannabe who's just about ready to throw in the towel. Together, they find out that they can't really ever know what it's like to be poor unless they're actually poor, a fate that eventually befalls Sullivan through a crazy turn of events, after which he rediscovers the value of using film to make people laugh.\"Sullivan's Travels\" is one of those reflexive movies about Hollywood and the business of film making that can be wonderful when done well and entirely too self conscious when done poorly. I can't imagine writer/director Preston Sturges having done a better job than he does here with this simply marvelous film, easily one of the best of the 1940s and perhaps one of the best ever. Rarely have I felt that a director has made his point as clearly and effectively as Sturges does with this film. He manipulates his audience dexterously but not cheaply. When the film takes a dark and sobering turn, we fidget anxiously and wait for it to get funny again, which is exactly the reaction the studio executives in the film's opening tell Sullivan he can expect from his \"important\" film, and why they tell him to stick to comedy in the first place. The irony of course is that in making a film about the value of mindless comedy, Sturges at the same time made a quite important picture that more forcefully addressed the plight of the working man than any number of other films that treated the subject more seriously.I've never liked Joel McCrea better than I do here. His laconic way with a one liner is perfectly suited to Sturges' brand of quick and witty writing. Indeed, the patter comes at you so quickly that your brain may have trouble keeping up with the jokes. Veronica Lake is cute and droll, and she and McCrea get on well together. The film's best moments come when the pair are learning how to be hobos. And Sturges fills out the rest of his film with a cast of regulars from his stable of character actors, with virtually every member getting some bit of business or a line to remember him by.However, despite Sturges' wonderful dialogue, the film's most memorable and beautiful moment comes when everybody shuts up, and a montage of scenes showing McCrea and Lake experiencing life as it was for countless homeless and unemployed regular Americans at the tail end of the Depression plays out with no sound, accompanied only by a pretty musical passage. In a movie that will take your breath away with its pace and crack comic timing, this moment will take your breath away for different reasons altogether.Grade: A+",

            "content": "I think all film junkies have a few films they hate that nearly everyone loves. So, while \"Sullivan't Travels\" is considered a classic and has an extremely high rating of 8.1, when I last saw it I was terribly disappointed and didn't understand all the hoopla about the film. That was years ago and I decided to do something I rarely do...see the film again to see if perhaps my original IMDb review (which I have since deleted) was right or wrong. Here is what I think of the film on a second viewing....The first thing that really stood out in my mind when I watched the film was Preston Sturgis' casting for the movie. Veronica Lake was very popular in Alan Ladd pictures because he was a very short man...and she was a rather tiny actress. Yet, in spite of this (or, most likely because of this), Sturgis paired her with one of the largest leading men of his day. The 15 inch difference in height was NOT typical at all of Hollywood...but more typical of real life and I can only assume the famed writer/director deliberately was resisting traditional casting decisions since the movie is a critical look at Hollywood and its clich\u00e9s. I appreciated this more the second time viewing the picture.The story finds the famous Hollywood director, John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea) in a funk. While he's successful in his career, he also worries that his films lack a connection to the common man and might not be representing real life. This is a reasonable concern-- especially since most films of the preceding decade portrayed very rich, happy and fashionable folks...all during the Great Depression!! So, Sullivan decides to try living incognito-- traveling the country dressed like a hobo to see the other side of America. Along the way, he meets an adorable lady (Veronica Lake) and they decide to go slumming together. The problem is that no matter how bad life is living in the gutter, they can always elect to return home to comfort and a good meal...and Sullivan finds out the hard way what it's like NOT to be able to just go home when he's tired of slumming it.Overall, I was MUCH more positive to the film the second time around. Now I am not saying I loved the movie but I did love much of it. Like many Sturgis pictures, the dialog was the best part...and it was snappy and enjoyable. My reservations for not giving it a higher score are that the story seems, at least today, a bit contrived. Also, the Mickey Mouse cartoon segment STILL seems way overdone (NOTHING is that funny)...my biggest complaint the first time. But on balance, the good far outweighs the bad and I am glad I decided to give it another try. I still think it's a bit overrated but an excellent film nonetheless.",

My comments here are part of an enterprise to build a fully enriched visual imagination. But there is a third category, it seems: films that in the modern context are powerless, but which were influential in changing the course of the world of film. This effectively means they changed the world.`Birth of a Nation' is one of these. Quite apart from the topic of the story, it turned the new unfettered medium of film into an extension of stage plays. This hampered film for decades. Many people - including filmmakers - still believe that films can be `about' something. That started to change in 1941 with the appearance of two films: `Kane' in which narrative folding was merged with the choreographed camera (already being played with by Hitchcock), and `Travels' which introduced irony into the notion of watching.Its tricky, what Sturges has done: the film is ostensibly `about' a film. One expects lots of blurring between the two, but he fools us. In the story proper, there is no such blurring. Instead, he blurs the style of the entire enterprise, where it is unclear whether we are IN the movie or watching it. (Look for the incongruous legs in the tree by the riverbank.) This notion of in/out, supplemented by the revolution in acting from Brando, is part of every film made today.It is not the grand tour, the loud obvious excess of ideas that is `Kane,' it is simple, single-minded, rather subtle. That he gives us the cue in the plot is something of a matter of genius. Having done this one clever thing that changed how we all think, even govern, he faded from the scene.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 4: Every visually literate person should experience this.",

            "content": "Preston Sturges (1898-1959) wrote over 40 film screenplays spanning the years 1930-1958 and directed over a dozen films 1940-1955.  His first attempt at directing was a success with a string of two popularly and critically acclaimed films in each of the years 1940 and 1941, \"The Great McGinty\", \"Christmas in July\"; \"The Lady Eve\" (starring Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck), and this film, \"Sullivan's Travels\".The beauty of \"Sullivan's Travels\" is the combination in genre of comedy as well as social satire and realism of the tough times of the Great Depression that the country had just weathered for a decade.  Throw a romance in to the mix and a level of redirection of a \"film on film\" to make this an interesting film.John Sullivan (Joel McCrea) is a famous director who is at odds with his production company.  They want him to direct a comic film, while he wants to apply his talent to creating an analytic looking glass onto the sobering times called, \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\".  Wealthy and successful, he is mocked for not at all knowing misfortune - how would he make such a film? John takes this as a challenge, dresses as a hobo, and leaves the studio with a dime in his pocket to explore what life is like for the down and out.However he tries to flee, he ends up getting somehow quickly being returned to Hollywood.  Early on, he meets \"the girl\" (Veronica Lake; I don't recall her ever being given a name in the film) who sees that he is too innocent to survive on his own, and insists on bringing her broader knowledge of society to the journey and joining him to get him through this learning adventure.The first part of the film is comic, but just as it seems to be coming to an unfulfilled ending, something unexpected happens.  This event alters the course of everything and exposes John to some of the true injustices of the time - and shows him (and poignantly reminded me) that comedy is particularly important when some people have nothing else to cheer them up.This is a film of classic Hollywood vintage, with good, snappy performances by both of the lead actors.  The romance isn't at all developed but just seems to happen in a matter-of-fact way (perhaps we can take it on faith that there is instant chemistry), but what is lacking in psychology of the relationship is made up for in the chilling glimpse we get of the psyche of the underdog in Depression America.   --Dilip Barman June 19, 2004",

Sullivan (Joel McCrea - a very underestimated actor) is asucccessful director of frivolous musicals and comedies who, one day, decides he needs to make a Capra-esque \"serious\"film. His studio chiefs and immediate staff are against it and point out that he is rich and privileged, what does he know about the less fortunate? Sullivan retorts with an ingenious plan:Sullivan: \"You're perfectly right...but I'll tell you what I'm going to do first: I'm going to get some old clothes and some old shoes from wardrobe and start out with ten cents in my pocket...and I'm not coming back till I know what trouble it..I'm going out on the road to find out what it's like to be poor and needy and then I'm going to make a picture about it.\"Burrows(his butler): If you'll permit me to say so, sir, the subject is not an interesting one. The poor know all about poverty and only the morbid rich would find the topic glamorous. Nevertheless, Sullivan does it and unwittingly (and hilariously) discovers the true value comedy has in the lives of those with little else to laugh about...It's genius. Exquisitely written, directed and acted (Sturges uses his usual ensemble plus the ever watchable Veronica Lake, even here in her most improbable disguises [I met her, professionally, in England in the 70s, she was still a class act and her \"rider\" demanded her drink of choice - vodka and cranberry juice).Sullivan's Travels is a true gem of American Cinema.

It's interesting to note that McCrea's next film was to be with Lake - \"I Married a Witch\" - but he informed the studio he couldn't work with her again.

Once he is convinced he knows nothing about \"real life,\" he decides to travel across country as a tramp and discover that life. But nothing works. Everything conspires to deliver him back to Hollywood until he runs into a girl, Lake in a wonderful performance, in an \"owl wagon.\" They hook up and she teaches him the ropes. They travel by box car across country as tramps, sleeping in camps and starving. After they have had their fill, they go back to Hollywood. McCrea is so grateful he decides to make one last pass among the bums and pass out 5-dollar bills. Then tragedy strikes.As the film takes a tragic turn, in becomes one of the great social satires of all time. Reaching the heights of Greek Tragedy, Sullivan's Travels pulls no punches as Sturges examines reality vs. Hollywood illusion. Just a wonderful film from start to finish.McCrea and Lake had spotty careers in Hollywood. McCrea played all kinds of parts in the 30s and 40s, but never really became a top star. He hit his peak in the early 40s with this film, The Palm Beach Story, and The More the Merrier. Lake was mostly confined to \"glamour\" roles but is totally winning and charming in this film. Both should have been bigger stars.Sturges populates the film with with his \"stock\" players and other great character actors.

Instead, he wants to make something different...an important, relevant, socially relevant drama about poverty. When he realizes he knows nothing about THAT sort of life, he sets out with 10 cents in his pocket and finds out what it's really like. Along the way, he meets Veronica Lake - who plays \"The Girl\". She is a discouraged aspiring actress getting no where and on the verge of leaving town. Despite her own bad luck, she takes pity on the hobo Sullivan and buys him breakfast. When she eventually finds out his true identity, she insists on accompanying him on the road due to his inexperience at such a lifestyle. Lake does a great job of the dry co-star. She's not the greatest actress but she does justice to the part and offers a bit of eye candy for the viewers in contrast. She is a joy to watch on screen, that's for sure! I want to see more of her movies.Sullivan's Travels is a very funny film with the appeal of Lake, witty comedy and a true underlying message.

If you want your comedy to be tightly constructed, meaningful, unambiguous, and logical, then you do not want comedy at all -- you want some stuffy college professor's idea of What is Comedy for a term paper.The glorious truth is that you cannot domesticate great comedy.  It occurs on no regular basis, from no reliable source, and is accountable to no one for what it says and does.  Preston Sturges wanted to make that point in Sullivans Travels and he does so exceedingly well with everything from slapstick frolics in the land cruiser to fleas in the bed to hectoring soliloquies about poverty from the butler.Ten years before Chaplin tried to explain the same thing in his movie Limelight, Sturges tells a tale meant to both hearten and cozen us.  It heartens us to know that a cynical, moneygrubbing place like Hollywood will continue to spin out comedies, because they make money.

Years after this masterpiece, as age caught up with the two stars, McCrea, now too old to play the leading man, would be successfully recast in a series of westerns and actually enjoyed a second career as a cowpoke. No such luck for Lake. Once considered one of the sexiest stars in Hollywood, she continued with a bunch of \"filmes noire\" for a spell, but within a decade her career had fizzled. Late in life she did a series of interviews saying that of all the sex goddesses of the era, her portrayal was the most effortless, she merely needed to \"brush her hair a certain way\" and men, dumb as they were, practically swooned. (Not entirely true. She had a naturally coarse voice which was unusual, and sexy, in that era; and she did indeed have the figure of a sex goddess, as the very very brief shower scene in Sullivans Travels reveals.) OK, back to 1941. With both stars pretty at the apex of their careers, here is the kind of story that Hollywood does best, a story of the rich vs. the poor, and the problems that can arise trying to reconcile the two. McCrea is pitch perfect as the idealistic rich guy (film producer) trying to see the world through the eyes of the downtrodden, and Lake is pitch perfect as the beautiful, cynical, babe who tags along for the ride whether McCrea likes it or not.

Every film and television series/programme seen is watched and reviewed with no bias for or against the genre, director or any of the actors ever intended (hope it hasn't come across that way, as people usually good can be bad and those not usually highly thought of by me can occasionally be tolerable).When Preston Sturges was in his prime (1940-1944, with 'The Great McGinty', 'Christmas in July', 'The Lady Eve', 'Sullivan's Treavels', 'The Palm Beach Story', 'The Miracle of Morgan's Creek' and 'Hail the Conquering Hero') it made for one of the best golden years/prime periods for any director in my view, where five or more very good to masterpieces in a row were made close to each other. Of those seven films mentioned, the top two for me are 'The Lady Eve' and especially 'Sullivan's Travels'. 'Sullivan's Travels' being one of the finest examples of balancing and winningly combining satire with human drama, for me it is one of the funniest and cleverest films there is while also being one of the most warm-hearted and most intelligent.As with his previous films, Sturges' direction is impeccable. It is always accomplished and with a light sophisticated touch that never veers too heavily, which allows the script and actors to shine and get the best out of them. The best he gets out of the actors he does. Joel McCrea was never better than here and the incadescent Veronica Lake's star-making performance is more than up to his level, making for a sparkling well matched pairing. William Demarest is the best in support and did find myself engaging with the characters.Especially good about 'Sullivan's Travels' is the script. Not many other films have satire this sharp and funny and then that is balanced seamlessly with truly insightful moments that really provoke thought and ones that are very human and poignant. 'Sullivan's Travels' is one film that epitomises a film that entertains while being big in brains and being even bigger in heart, have not seen many of those recently to be honest with you. Not many films made me feel about not taking things for granted and such in the way this film did and the message is well-intended, universal, relevant and makes its point without hammering home. The story goes at a vigorous, but never rushed, pace and both entertains and endears. Parts are intentionally corny, but in an affectionate way and never feeling contrived.'Sullivan's Travels' is always beautifully filmed and feel the same way about how it complements and loves Lake here than with Barbara Stanwyck in 'The Lady Eve', both actresses in their respective films looked beautiful in their films and the camera clearly loved them.In conclusion, fantastic film.

            "content": "\"Sullivan's Travels\" is an outstanding comedy satire with a serious look at the plight of the homeless and unemployed at the end of the Great Depression. Work began on the movie in May of 1941 and filming wrapped up on July 22. But it took over half a year before it was released. It was screened for critics on Dec. 4, but the bombing of Pearl Harbor three days later and the U. S. entry into World War II, delayed its release further. It premiered in Jackson, Tennessee on Dec. 29, and finally opened on February 12, 1942, in Los Angeles.This film is billed as an adventure, comedy and drama. But one must remember that this is a Preston Sturges film all the way. He wrote the screenplay and directed the film. So, while there's more to it than comedy, \"Sullivan's Travels\" is first and foremost a comedy satire. And, a superb one at that. The only thing that keeps it from competing for the best of that genre is the approximate one-third that gets very serious. The drama with portrayals of homeless and people living on the streets, and then the crime and portrayal of poor justice in the South of the time provided some serious scenes. But Sturges needed to find a way to have his hero wake up to the fact that comedy had tremendous social value for the masses - for everyone.He provides that with some poor and downtrodden people watching a movie and Sullivan seeing them rolling with laughter at a cartoon. By having such a scene with a prison chain gang where men felt even more helpless and less hopeful, the point becomes starker. And then, to have this kindness provided as a charitable act by a poor African-American congregation, who were still living under segregation in the South, the satire is firmly nailed. Obviously the film couldn't begin to tackle all the social ills of the day that it showed, and the film already was 90 minutes long. But Sturges left hanging any resolution of the injustice that Sullivan experienced. And that much begged treatment unless audiences are left to think that Sullivan didn't care about any of those other souls and the injustices they suffered - once he got out of trouble himself. Since the audience is left hanging on this point, this film misses contending with the very best satires of all time.This film is filled with fast-paced, witty and funny dialog. And, it's all the more outstanding for its sizable cast of well-known supporting actors of the day, who themselves provide much of the comedy. Porter Hall and Robert Warwick are the studio bigwigs, Mr. Hadrian and Mr. LeBrand, who have some rapid-fire, hilarious exchanges with Joel McCrea's John \"Sully\" Sullivan. Robert Greig, one of the best actors ever to play butlers, has a smashingly adroit and very funny role as Sullivan's Butler, Burroughs (or, spelled Burrows). Eric Blore, another of the best butlers, valets and other comedy sidekicks is funny, but with fewer lines, as Sullivan's unnamed valet. William Demarest and Franklin Pangborn are their usual comical characters, here as Mr. Jonas and Mr. Casalsis.Sturges apparently wrote the story and screenplay with Joel McCrea in mind. McCrea is perfect for the role. Not only because of his normally serious persona, but in his portrayal of the wronged guy in the prison chain gang. Sullivan's background really was one of a silver spoon. And, he wouldn't know what to do or how to survive in real hardships. Of course, that's his argument for going out on his own to \"discover\" the plight of the downtrodden. So, when he tangles with the law and gets a bad rap, he isn't savvy enough - as are the other men, to be quiet and bide his time. Instead, he blurts out his wrong treatment, and later says to Jimmy Conlin, the prison Trustee, that movie directors aren't treated that way. That just proves the point that Veronica Lake makes as the unnamed \"The Girl.\" Early on, she tells Sully, \"You don't know anything about anything,\" and says he couldn't get along on his own in real life. Lake is fair in her role, although she seems too aloof even after getting to know Sully. Barbara Stanwyck or Carole Lombard would have added some zing to that role.Still, this film is a wonderful satire about Hollywood efforts at times to delve into deep subjects about which it has no expertise, solid knowledge or experience, especially dealing with social issues. The film's message clearly was that the entertaining function of filmdom, especially making people laugh, was worth a great deal and a worthy enterprise itself in the social fabric of society. And, for that, Hollywood had the expertise.Here are some favorite lines from this film. For many more, see the Quotes section under this IMDb movie Web page.Mr. Casalsis, \"People always like what they don't know anything about.\"Mr. LeBrand, to Sully, \"That's why your pictures have been so bright, so cheerful, so inspiring.\" Mr. Hadrian, \"They don't stink with messages.\"Mr. Hadrian, \"We'd better insure him for a million.\" Mr. LeBrand, \"He's worth more.\" Mr. Hadrian, \"The bonehead.\" Mr. LeBrand, \"Yes, but what a genius.\"Sully, on the telephone, \"Have you made out the panther woman's check yet?\"Burroughs, \"You see, sir, rich people and theorists, who are usually rich people, think of poverty in the negative, as the lack of riches - as diseases might be called the lack of health.\"Sully, about Burroughs, \"He gets a little bit gruesome every once in a while.\" Sully's valet (Eric Blore), \"Yeah. Always reading books, sir.\"Sully, \"Now, let's just sit here and try to feel like a couple of tramps.\"Sully, \"You can't tell what kind of heel is apt to be behind the wheel.\" The Girl, \"All heels are pretty much the same.\"",

            "content": "Sardonic, delightfully fun and whip-quick romp about a Hollywood director : Joel MacCrea tired of making comedies who decides to make a socially responsible, serious film and hits the road masquerading as a hobo in order to know poverty and hardship. Along the way he meets a beautiful aspiring actress, Veronica Lake, and get together to carry out the surprising travel.Wonderfully sustained, inspired satire that relentlessly mocked the ambitions of Depression-era social cinema. It has a tricky\nblend of sadness and slapstick that never jars. Gets a little over-dark near the final when the starring is imprisoned and submitted to strong punishments, before the happy end. Sturges insisted on a great main and support cast as Joel MacCrea who is excellent as the filmmaker who undertakes a risked travel disguising as a beggar, looking for a meaning in life, and 20-year-old Veronica Lake in her most bewitching role, she is really gorgeous as his journey mate, however, her pregnancy forced Preston to design new gowns and to rewrite scenes for her. Secondary actors are excellent such as : William Demarest, Robert Warwick, Robert Greig , Meyer and Porter Hall.The motion picture includes an adequate and brilliant cinematography in black and white by John Seitz, being splendidly directed by Preston Sturges. Resulting to be a portrait of director Preston Sturges' own state at the time. Preston Sturges was a phenomenal filmmaker directing all kinds of movies with penchant for comedies such as : The great McGinty, Christman in July, The lady Eve, The great moment, Hail the conquering hero, The miracle of Morgan's Creek, Unfaithfully yours, The beautiful blondie from Bashful Bend, The diary of Major Thompson, among others.",

            "review_title": "Combines \"The Prince and the Pauper\" with \"It Happened One Night\"",
            "content": "This film may be thought of as a talkie version of Chaplin's repeatedly winning combination of pathos and comedy in the adventures of his silent 'Little Tramp' character, which often included an association with a poor, but virtuous, girl. The two films mentioned in my title are not Chaplin films. Rather, they are talkies from the mid-30s that separately illustrate the two dominant features of this film: 1) A wealthy privileged person suddenly must cope with the daily survival realities and prejudices against the very poor and unemployed, 2) a serendipitous meeting of a man and beautiful woman, who get to know each other and fall in love while on an eccentric odyssey, with occasional humorous incidents. During much of this odyssey, involving Sullivan(Joel McCrea) and 'The Girl'(Veronica Lake), she is heavily dressed, with cap, supposedly masquerading as a boy(she was short), as there are no other women in the places frequented by tramps where they will go(But as Sullivan quips, her beautiful face will easily give her away!). The film also exposes the brutality of the chain gang institution, as did the prior Muni-starring \"I am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang\" and the later Newman-starring \"Cool Hand Luke\".(Did California have chain gangs?)There are occasional incidents of physical humor, such as the obstacles encountered when Sullivan escapes out the window of his new boarding house, and several unplanned dunkings in his backyard swimming pool, but much of the humor relates to a series of ironies, along with the verbal exchanges and deceptions between Sullivan and 'The Girl'.Here are some examples of these ironies: 1)Sullivan is temporarily jailed for stealing his own car(His car vanished when he wasn't supposed to be around) 2)The truck he gets a ride in took him back to Hollywood, where he didn't want to go, but this resulted in his meeting his soul mate:'The Girl'. 3)While handing out $5. bills to random tramps, one recipient gets greedy and robs Sullivan of his remaining bills. 4)This tramp, who knocked Sullivan out, robbed him and stuffed him in an empty boxcar, ended up being run over by a train while he tried to collect the scattered bills he dropped on the tracks. 5)The body of this killed tramp is assumed to be that of Sullivan, since Sullivan's shoes are found on him and Sullivan can't be found 6)Sullivan, the victim of an assault and robbery, is subject to abuse by a rail yard employee while still disoriented, and given a long prison sentence for fighting back 7)Sullivan is not recognized by the court as such, because he can't remember his name and has no ID on him, having been robbed. 8)An all African American church congregation welcomes the all white chain gang as being 'those less fortunate than us' 9)Sullivan has to confess to being his own murder in order to attract attention to himself as an inmate on a chain gang 10)Sullivan finally gets a good excuse to divorce his estranged wife as a result of his presumed death and imprisonment, when she marries his crooked business manager, who engineered their marriage. Then, he will be free to marry 'The Girl'. 11) After seeing how his fellow inmates laughed at the cartoons hosted by the church, he abandons his ambition to direct a film about the dispossessed, in favor of yet another comedy, as apparently being more important to humanity.Question: Why is Veronica never given a name other than 'The Girl'? Perhaps to add to her natural mystique? Question:Why didn't the chain gang include African Americans and Latinos? Question:Why did the chain gang enter an all African American church to see cartoons? I suspect this was meant to contrast their treatment of down and out whites with that of the white establishment. Question: Why was Sullivan freed from his chain gang once his identity is recognized? Presumably, his status as a wealthy famous person, rather than an apparently mentally ill hobo, has induced the court to reclassify his assault on the rail yard employee as retaliatory self-defense.McCrea was perfect for the part of Sullivan, as he should have been, the role having been written with him in mind.(Cooper would also have been great.) Several actresses were considered for 'The Girl'. Barbara Stanwyck had costarred with McCrea in \"Union Pacific\", but was no longer a spring chicken. Francis Farmer was also considered. Veronica was much younger than those ladies, but was 6 months pregnant, although she failed to inform the director until after she was chosen! Nonetheless, she worked out quite well, coming across as innocently appealing, with her long lustrous peekaboo blond hair, rather dead pan typical expression, and typical shy, if sometimes teasing, demeanor. She seemed to have great chemistry with McCrea. Unfortunately, McCrea, like many others, found her personality difficult, and declined to do another film with her. It's clear that Veronica had some mental health issues throughout her life, being diagnosed as a child with schizophrenia, and dying at an early age from the effects of alcoholism.",

If Hollywood had a Moliere, Sturges was that.Sullivan's Travels (1941) was one of Sturges' most personal films and told the story of a successful director of lightweight movies - the title of his most recent work was 'Ants in Your Pants of 1939' - whose great desire was to finally film something socially relevant. To this end, he went among boxcar hobos to find inspiration, living with them and sharing their meager meals and failed aspirations.

            "content": "\"Sullivan's Travels\" is often held up as director Preston Sturges' peak moment at blending comedy and drama, but to my lights it strains at the significance of his better work. You laugh, you feel sympathy, but you can't help feel manipulated, too.Director John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea) has a number of hit films to his credit, including a recent dramatic potboiler which is killing them in New York but died in Pittsburgh. His producers encourage him to go back to the light comedies and musicals that brought him broader box-office success. But Sullivan is a man on a mission, to shed a light on humanity's plight \"with grim death gargling at every corner.\" Dressed as a hobo, he sets out to discover real suffering.\"Sullivan's Travels\" is a curiously uneven film structurally and stylistically. Sturges starts out making a knockabout comedy, with much flopping around and less wit than usual (Sully's response about Pittsburgh audiences being his one funny line). McCrea is overbearingly serious, in a way that might have played as send-up with a more comic actor in the role. Here he comes off as insufferable. Sturges pushes the angst, especially near the end when we suddenly leave the world of screwball comedy for \"I Was A Fugitive On A Chain Gang.\"No, this film doesn't put Sturges back with the shipping news, but it's not much fun. What works in the film is in part its slapdash energy and whirl of familiar Sturges faces, but mostly Veronica Lake, playing a character known only as the Girl or \"the kid\" (a nod to Chaplin; she even resembles Jackie Coogan standing next to the lanky McCrea in hobo dress and an over-sized flat cap.) She bites off her lines with casual flair and does what she can to puncture the pomposity around her, the sort of thing you can count on Sturges doing in his other, better films.\"Film's the greatest educational medium the world has ever known,\" Sullivan tells her. \"You take a picture like 'Hold Back Tomorrow'...\"\"You hold it,\" she snaps back.Apart from fair Veronica, there's not much else to see. So much of the comedy seen early on is of the groaner variety, like McCrea falling into haystacks (twice) and a rain barrel. Sturges regular William Demerest even gets stuck with a gin rummy/I don't drink exchange, punctuated by an Edgar Kennedy slow burn. By the time we see Sully and the girl push each other into a pool, you almost want the film to stop trying to be so forcedly merry. Until it does, whereupon we get more pontificating from Sullivan about what it all means.The film snaps into better shape at the end. There's a terrific scene set in a black church which brings out some needed humanity, as well as one of the few times I can see a '40s film featuring black actors that doesn't make me wince in shame. The resolution is fine, too, especially a delirious scene featuring Lake in a hoop skirt.\"Sullivan's Travels\" has just enough going for it to make it pleasant, and even, occasionally, worthy of its lofty aim of celebrating mirth for mirth's sake. Sturges' films famously benefit from multiple viewings, and maybe for me the fifth time will be the charm. Alas, to these tired eyes, it comes off more as sermon than Sennett, one of those classic films movie critics love because it's about the movies, rather than a movie worth loving.",

            "content": "Going from nothing to AFI's top 100 in 2007, Sullivan's Travels is an achievement in cinema worth the recognition. The film is about a comedy director named Sullivan who wants to make a dramatic film about poverty, but having no experience with it, goes out as a tramp with only 10 cents. Everyone warns him of the misguided nature of that experiment; eventually he runs into a down-on-her-luck girl (Veronica Lake) who accompanies him.At first a light comedy with plenty of wit and enjoyable physical humour, Sullivan's Travels admires the commentary films can make on social systems. Sullivan praises a film symbolizing capitalism and labour destroying each other, and wants to make a film like it. It also explores, fairly extensively, how the rich can sympathize for the poor not knowing what the conditions are actually like. The butler condemns such rich people as morbid for glamourizing poverty. Sullivan, in fact, has great difficulty really getting into the feel of it, as he keeps ending up back in Hollywood, back at his mansion, back in the hands of his staff. He receives some sympathy he doesn't need. He asks tramps how they feel about the labour situation (how are they supposed to feel about it?). When Lake pushes him into the pool, one feels he deserves it.That's until the last third of the film, which turns much darker. After Sullivan is robbed and knocked out by the only villainous poor person in the film, he, in a dazed state, hits a railroad worker with a rock and goes to prison. No one knows who he is. Now he's really facing harsh reality, beaten, in chains, unable to access the quality defence he needs. When he, fellow-prisoners and a black congregation watch a comedy film in a church, Sullivan sees first-hand what comedy can give these people. Once let out, he goes back to making comedies- everything's come full-circle, but now he has more purpose than ever.This is a movie that adeptly balances comedy and drama, to examine comedy and drama. Two things particularly stand out- one is Lake, with her sultry voice and jaded character which are simply irresistible. The other is the scene in the church, where comedy unites and uplifts the downtrodden. This is movie magic.",

            "content": "In this offbeat comedy/drama, a young Hollywood director decides to take to the road as a tramp in order to get some \"real-life\" experience about human suffering. Why? So he can more effectively direct his next film about the tragic human condition.Lots of crazy, zany things happen along the way -- most of which prohibits Sullivan (McCrea) from truly gaining any insight into the life of the less fortunate. Finally, however, something unexpected occurs which truly gives him a new perspective on the poor class and as his role as an entertainer.While many (if not most) consider this film to be a comedy classic, I'm afraid I must disagree. Although there are some humorous parts, the film (in my perspective) fails in it's most lofty ambition -- that is to poignantly express the condition of the less fortunate while wrapping a screwball comedy around it which would be just the kind of entertainment those same unfortunate soles would enjoy -- an ironic movie about movies.Charlie Chaplin was much more effective in expressing both the sadness of the poor class while mixing in effective and genuinely funny humor. Perhaps his films (and others with similar themes) succeeded where this one failed because we were drawn into the life of someone in the poor class and routed for the underdog as our protagonist in the midst of the humorous circumstances.In this case, I found the protagonist to be shallow, selfish and ultimately hypocritical. Here we have a rich, well-to-do Hollywood type pretending to be a tramp and being at a disconnect with their way of life for almost the entire film. As such, we never develop a fondness for his character, even though the circumstances he finds himself in may be interesting. In addition, the whole character of Veronica Lake was entirely out of place in this film. The love interest distracted from the message the film tried to convey, and she couldn't come across as looking even remotely the part of a poor, disadvantaged young girl. She looked much more out of place in the tramp suit than did McCrea.In the final vignette where Sullivan supposedly sees the real plight of the \"less fortunate\", it is via rubbing shoulders with hardened criminals (!), not just the poor, unemployed, trampled-upon, everyday man. And then he uses his position of status to its fullest (unethical) extent in order to weasel his way out of his undesired condition. Then we're asked to turn around and cheer for our liberated hero and his supposed \"enlightened viewpoint\". I don't find such a plot that funny or poignant.Not a classic by any means in my eyes.",

Some of the slap-sticky comedy scenes seemed to be uninspired - like the scene at the swimming pool at the director's mansion. The film's second half is quite downbeat with the director being thrown into jail and finally learning that the best he can do for the poor is make them laugh.I liked the dialogs and the sharp one liners over the slapstick comedy scenes. The supporting cast (especially ROBERT GREIG as the butler who mouths the most profound dialog in the film) was excellent.It is a bit of a genre bending film and hard to classify. The film begins with a pulsating action scene atop a train that turns out to be a bunch of studio executives watching a film.Anyway, I'm from a different era and was unable to appreciate this completely. but I enjoyed most of it.(7/10)",

            "content": "Joel McRea is the successful movie director, Sullivan,who has made a series of wildly popular light comedies with titles like \"Hey, Hey, in the Hayloft.\" The studio heads are proud of him and want him to continue but McRea wants to dive head first into sober and tragic stories that have social relevance -- this being the tail end of the Great Depression, a time of hardship with which the audience was all too familiar.The worried Suits point out to McRea that although many people are suffering, McRea himself knows nothing about it, since he was in boarding school and college before becoming a director.The light goes on in that bubble above McRea's head. He'll become a sociologist of poverty. He'll dress like a 'Bo and go amongst them with only a few dollars and a studio ID card hidden in his shoe. Well, the Suits plunge into a state of complete frenzy. Their most profitable director prowling around among the soup kitchens and Hoovervilles. Even the servants in his millionaire's aerie advise against it. \"Poverty, sir, is an abomination. It is to be shunned!\" But it's no use. McRea hits the road with his bindle over his shoulder, but the Suits insist on a huge bus following him as he walks along the highway. Twenty yards or so behind him is this Land Cruiser full of bodyguards, secretaries, valets, and cooks. (That's my kind of field work.) McRea tries to lose them by hitching a ride with a 13-year-old boy driving a souped-up \"Wupper Tank.\" The speedometer is painted on the wooden dashboard and reads a constant 130 miles per hour. The Wupper Tank takes off, followed by the speeding, lumbering bus and its passengers. The pursuit takes both vehicles off the road and over hill and dale. You've seen this kind of low comedy before -- from the Keystone Kops to \"The Long, Long Trailer\" -- but you will never have laughed quite so hard before.After that the humor returns to the quietly ironic. Somewhere along the way, McRea picks up Veronica Lake, a starlet manque who is fleeing Hollywood. They hop onto a freight train along with dozens of other vagrants and when they hop off they find themselves back in Hollywood.Towards the end of his picaresque peregrinations -- the title of course is from Swift's satire, \"Gulliver's Travels\" -- McRea and Lake decide they've explored the dark alleys of poverty long enough and joyfully return to his swimming pool. As a last act of generosity towards those who have taught him so much, McRea returns to the alleys of hobos and distributes several thousand dollars, one hundred at a time, to the amazed bums. This is a big mistake. One of the scummier ones follows him, bops him on the head, and runs off with the money. When he's run over by a train, his body is mistaken for that of Sullivan.Sullivan wakes up in a daze, stumbles off a box car, beans a yard cop, and is sentenced to six years on a chain gang. He sasses the boss, just like Cool Hand Luke, and is deprived of such privileges as phone calls or letters, so no one knows he's alive. Now begins his real schooling, and what he learns is that poor people don't want to see their own misery reflected on the screen. They want the only good they can afford, the laughter of comedy.That ending has been pounded by critics as a sell out but I don't know what else the writer/director Preston Sturges could have done. Any other ending would have been bleak enough to make the movie unalterably tragic.At that, I don't really think the obvious moral is the one Sturges intended. He was never that frothy. Delete the last five minutes and what you have is a simple lesson: there's good and bad in every square inch of social space. Humans of all types are imperfect and sometimes those imperfections -- naivete, greed, infatuation -- lead to unexpected consequences, whether joyous or painful. The Suits are clearly greedy, but being poor doesn't necessarily make you a hero.This is one of the better comedies in a decade that was full of good comedies, and Preston Sturges was responsible for a number of them.",

            "content": "Sturges, the stepson of a wealthy, influential New York stockbroker, (whose last name he took as his own), in this movie tries to sell a patronizing, elitist premise as laudable \"social conscience\" to a credulous 1941 public. And this offense to intelligence has stood the test of time surviving the decades to stand as a Sturges comedic masterpiece. In evaluating this movie, you have to put aside nostalgia and leave behind the hype surrounding the \"worthy\" reputation of Preston Sturges. Remove the \"wacky\" screwball dressing adorning Sullivan's Travels and what you're left with is a depiction of the poor and disadvantaged as a business demographic: consumers of a commodity. Never mind that the reality was that a ticket for the 10 cent \"picture-show\" would have been a real luxury back then, an expense the poor could ill afford. Here Sturges won't even deign to suggest that they eat cake; he wants to nourish their empty stomachs with laughter.The movie execs as portrayed in the storyline here, accustomed to living in their bubbles of privilege, see themselves as purveyors of a social service by making movies that give the unfortunate a few hours of laughs, a respite from their miserable existence. A reductive and simplistic bit of self-righteous justification. Joel McCrea, as the movie director Sullivan, masquerading as a down and outer to gain material for \"serious\" film topics, engages in nothing but a tourist romp through the world of the have-nots. His travels through the netherworld are accomplished under the surveillance of an entourage of assistants and consultants who follow him around as a force in constant and protective vigil. Veronica Lake is a wraith-like bit of feminine fluff, a decorative element to provide romantic interest. She's too radiant and groomed to be believable as a disillusioned starlet, worn out by the trials and tribulations undergone in a failed attempt to achieve Hollywood stardom. The scene in the church is crafted as a plot device for dramatic epiphany and recognition. The congregation of African-American worshippers are joined by a group of convict laborers, and as the preacher emotes, \"all in the sight of God,\" and after an introductory burst of hymn singing in unison, this assembly is treated to a show of cartoons...in the likes of Mickey Mouse et al. Like an alien, continuing his rocket ride into another galaxy, Hollywood honcho Sullivan, suddenly with wonderment sees the light. This flock of humble, reverent souls burst out in unrestrained laughter, an almost religious communion of joy overtakes all. Wow!...realizes the movie director\u0085 I've got the formula now! Charlie Chaplin, purportedly, refused to be connected with the Sullivan's Travels project and it can be guessed at...for good reason. Chaplin's films could make you laugh and cry, they convey humanity and compassion. In this film, Sturges makes you cringe.",

            "content": "Sturges takes the basic \"caliph of Baghdad\" story line (person of power and privilege disguises himself to see how the other half lives) and creates an unpredictable, thought-provoking comedy. It's postmodern before its time in at least three ways. It offers a dizzying pastiche of styles and genres, including witty dialogue, elaborate slapstick, 1930s-style sitcom, muckraker grit and outrage, etc.This makes it unsettling and very unpredictable. (The plot itself is unpredictable too.) It's self-referential, both explicitly and implicitly. It is a movie about making movies, and as such explicitly about storytelling. The peculiar mix of genres also makes it implicitly self-referential, with a Brechtian verfremdungs effekt, since the viewer's attention is constantly drawn to the way the story is told, as well as the story itself. It's highly ironic. I can't explain this without spoiling the story. Let's just say that it often appears to make fun of serious movies about poverty and injustice--especially The Grapes of Wrath--and the ending appears to undercut the initial leftwing social criticism that the protagonist expresses and puts into the opening \"movie within a movie\". But as in much postmodern irony, this conservative conclusion may itself be only an appearance. At yet another level of the ironical onion, the social criticism remains valid and trenchant--the scenes of poverty and brutality we witness earlier undercut the conclusion that is apparently reached in the last scenes. The racial politics are also unsettling. At the start we get the usual silly stereotype of the African American cook. But in the decisive scene of the movie, African Americans are portrayed as people who treat their fellow human beings with respect and dignity, no matter how terrible their circumstances--which is just about the finest thing you can say about anyone. Nevertheless there is something stereotypical about this image, even if it is a positive stereotype. And African Americans are placed on the \"comedy\" not the \"serious social criticism\" side of the debate in the protagonist's head, a racial representation which is fraught with--well, ambiguity. (For more about this, see Marlon Riggs' Color Adjustment, a brilliant documentary about African Americans on TV.) Finally, this movie was my introduction to Veronica Lake. Wow!",

            "content": "Light Screwball Comedy with a heavy dark streak and a scintillating Veronica Lake\nScrewball comedies with absurd premises and popular stars were a staple of thirties Hollywood to help make people temporarily forget the misery of the great depression. Sullivan's Travels made at Paramount in 1941 when World War II was already raging in Europe was one of the last of the genre, and one of the most lasting. A film I have heard about for ages but was only able to catch now at a single night film club screening. The film starts out on a fluffy slapstick footing until the delayed appearance of Veronica Lake almost a quarter of the way through, but then takes off into classic space. \nGoing in Joel McCrae, 36, was the big star but after this he was outshone by Lake who stole the show with her timely wisecracks, cascades of platinum blonde hair and sheer youthful beauty --she was nineteen at the time! Lake went on to become one of the most popular wartime stars with her trademark peekaboo hairstyle. In this film the camera lingers lovingly on her incredible long wavy tresses in multiple scenes. One reason to hang in there.\nLake plays a down on her luck rejected film actress wannabe -- hard to believe with her looks! -- who offers McCrae a meal in a rusty spoon diner -- - but Sullivan realizes her potential and drops his hobo act taking her back to his Hollywood estate. There she pushes him into the pool to punish him for trying to pull the wool over her eyes. All others follow suite and take amusing tumbles fully clothed into the drink.\nFrom here she joins him in his hobo travels with a borderline risqu\u00e9 roll in the hay of a freight train they gave hopped in true hobo style.\nHaving learned what he needs to know about trouble from the bums met along the way Sullivan decides to reward all by handing out five dollar bills. One vicious tramp clobbers him and takes all the money and steals his shoes (which contain his real I.D, sewn into the soles) whereupon Sullivan wakes up in a freight yard and clobbers a railway guard in self defense. For assaulting an officer and refusing to reveal his name in court he is sentenced to hard labor in a chain gang. Here the comedy veers into deadly serious territory. By a quirk of his ID. found concealed in the exchanged shoes Director Sullivan is reported dead, not the hobo who stole his shoes and then got killed by a train, whereupon his retinue including Lake all go into deep mourning.\nMeanwhile, as a respite from their hard labors the chained prisoners are granted a night of watching movies in a Negro church. The film is a cartoon featuring Pluto the dog and brings roars of laughter from the forlorn chain gangers.\nNow comes the most touching scene in the entire picture. Sympathizing with the desperate plight of the weary chain gang the Preacher of the congregation (tremendous black actor, Jess Lee Brooks -- inexplicably Uncredited ! ) leads the gathering of worshipers in a stirring rendition of the Negro spiritual, \"Go down Moses -- Let my people Go!\" \nSubsequently, with the help of an older chain gang convict, Sullivan hits upon the idea that will lead to his salvation and release. Can't give such a potential spoiler away. here, Suffice it to say that all's well that ends well, but the last scene is a serious comment on the importance of laughter.\nSullivan, it might be observed, is named after John L. Sullivan, one of the most famous heavyweight boxing champions of the early century with implications that the director played by McCrea, is the kind of champion the downtrodden need while the implied critique of chain gang justice is no mere throwaway joke. \nAll in All Sullivan's Travels, if not quite a masterpiece, is a unique film of it's kind -- a hilarious comedy with a serious message of the need for humor to see us through the darkest of times. .\nNot to mention the solid arrival of that amazing blonde bombshell, Veronica Lake.\n \nIn her very next film, \"This Gun For Hire\", She received top billing above newcomer Alan Ladd, then went on to make six more films with Ladd, one of which, \"The Blue Dahlia\" will be shown next week in the Upcoming Noir festival at the Egyptian.\nMost unfortunately Ms. Lake's career did not last long after this and was basically cut short by a combination of alcohol and a disastrous private life. She ended up working as an unsung bar room waitress and died broke at fifty in 1973 of acute hepatitis.\nSULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, 1941 Review By Alex Deleon\n<filmfestivals.com>\nViewed at Egyptian Theater, Hollywood. \nApril 11, 2018",

            "content": "Copyright 4 December 1941 by Paramount Pictures Inc. New York opening at the Paramount: 28 January 1942. Sydney opening at the Prince Edward: 31 July 1942 (ran 3 weeks). 8,251 feet. 91 minutes.SYNOPSIS: A successful Hollywood film director who has made nothing but lightweight films such as \"So Long, Sarong\", suddenly gets the notion that he should make a searing drama about human suffering.COMMENT: Most critics feel that the message of this comedy is simply that expressed by the hero at the fade-out, namely that making people laugh is more important than dishing out a \"message\". So far as it goes, that's true. Notice, for instance, how the guy twisting out a sermon to all the captive bums in the mission house is so cleverly lampooned as the camera devastatingly tracks back from his harangue to the rows and rows of poor souls forced to listen to him.But the film is more than an artist-be-content-with-thy-lot. It's an attack on poverty itself and the sort of society in which it breeds. It's significant that, aside from the stars McCrea and Lake, the only actor who gets a really close, dialogue close-up in the movie is Robert Grieg: \"You see, sir, rich people and theorists \u2014 who are usually rich people \u2014 think of poverty in the negative: as the lack of riches; just as disease might be called the lack of health. But it isn't, sir. Poverty is not the lack of anything, but a positive plague, virulent in itself, contagious as cholera; with filth, criminality, vice and despair as only a few of its symptoms. It is to be stayed away from, even for purposes of study. It is to be shunned!\" What few critics have noticed is that the movie is also an attack on America's class-rigid society. \"I'm a motion picture director,\" exclaims Sullivan, on finding himself in a chain gang. \"They don't sentence motion picture directors to six years in prison for a little altercation with a yard boss.\" \u2014 \"They don't?\" questions the little trusty (Jimmy Conlin) most dubiously. And that so-called \"little altercation\" put the yard boss in hospital with a cracked skull and lacerated face. A \"vicious assault\", as the judge properly describes it. Yet Sullivan is freed with remarkable celerity as soon as his claim is verified. Someone as important in society as a motion picture director is above the law. Another example occurs earlier on in the movie when McCrea, pretending to be an ordinary member of the public, is rudely rebuffed by a railroad information clerk. However, when his valet, Eric Blore, putting on his smarmiest accent, announces that \"A few of us down at the club were having a little bet...\", the information is readily forthcoming. The rich man's foibles are instantly catered for.",

            "content": "Preston Sturges's Sullivan's Travels is a brilliant satire and an excellent tribute to the genre of comedy. It is also deemed one of the greatest films about film ever made...and keep in mind this film was released in early 1942. Sturges's socially conscious film was released to indifferent reviews and did not set the box office on fire. As time passed by, the film garnered a much better reputation. Contemporary reviews say the film is one of Sturges's best films, if not his best film. I thought it was really funny, had a relevant message, and features some fine performances from Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake.As I mentioned, the movie is a tribute to the genre of comedy, and it starts off with a dedication. \"To the memory of those who made us laugh: the motley mountebanks, the clowns, the buffoons, in all times and in all nations whose efforts have lightened our burden a little, this picture is affectionately dedicated.\" This film was Sturges's response to many comedies preaching a message. Comedies used to be fun and that is all what mattered. I guess we still have those issues today, huh? Regardless, Sturges took that idea and turned it into a biting, sharp satire about Hollywood filmmaking and comedies in general. No spoilers, but the dialogue towards the film's end sums up perfectly what Sturges is trying to say. Sturges brought the best out of his actors and created moments of hilarity, more than I expected.John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea) is a very talented director known for making light, fluffy comedies, the sort of comedies that make bank at the box office. He wants to try his hand at something new. What about making a \"message\" movie? The studios executives tried to convince him otherwise, but Sullivan wants to direct O Brother, Where Art Thou? He dresses up as a hobo and decides to see how a hobo lives. After a bunch of misfires, he comes in contact with a Good Samaritan only known as \"The Girl\" (Veronica Lake). They form a relationship with one another as she chooses to help him on his quest. As the quest continues, Sullivan asks himself is he really doing the right thing?The performances were solid. Joel McCrea did a fine job depicting a down-on-his-luck director. Thanks to Sturges's sure-handed direction, he managed to wrangle a solid performance from Veronica Lake. She used her looks to full effect, but her delivery of dialogue leaves some to be desired. She was also really tough to work with. Sturges was fuming when she came on set seven months pregnant and McCrea never wanted to work with her again after this film wrapped up shooting. Regardless, she was rather decent.In addition to some excellent comedy, there was some hard, dramatic stuff that provided the film's \"message.\" The latter portion of the movie contains a long, drawn-out prison workcamp where everyone is miserable, which leads to Sturges's point. There is a scene where the workers are taken to see a movie in a Southern Baptist church. For a 1942 film, the black people were given great treatment. That made me happy and surprised. The NAACP wrote a letter commending Sturges for the treatment they received.Sullivan's Travels is a rapid-fire comedy that just as socially important as it is funny. Sturges made sure to give a shoutout to Ernest Lubitsch and his films. I definitely laughed and had a great time. This was my first Sturges film, so I am excited to see his other films. He knows his way around comedies based on this one film. I definitely give this film a recommend!My Grade: A",

            "content": "The movie's an audacious comedy-drama. The comedy shows up in a number of slapstick sketches like the run-away trailer coach, plus snappy dialog. However, director Sturges took a real chance by shifting gears into dark melodrama of the prison farm. On the whole, it works without too many seams showing. Frankly, the Veronica Lake role appears unnecessary. But her star was rising and was no doubt a big marquee plus. At the same time, seeing McCrea in this cosmopolitan role takes some getting used to if you're used to his laconic westerns. Still, he does well enough. And whose burst of inspiration was the Black minister and congregation, plus the poignant gospel number, Go Down Moses. Catch the hymn's refrain about \"letting my people go\". In the movie's context, that suggests the Blacks are imprisoned as much as the convicts, even if within a different kind of prison. Still, I'm not sure I agree with the movie's overall message. Of course, comedy and laughter are especially important to the aggrieved and downtrodden. Still, social message films can provide hope and inspiration for those who actually need to change onerous conditions. Trouble is that director Sullivan renounces protest films in favor of comedy, and that strikes me as a retreat into easy commercialism. However, that probably suited movie industry's interests in not rocking the political boat. Anyway, this observation aside, the movie remains an effective combination of comedy, drama and societal expose.",

To remedy this he sets out to experience life as a homeless person.An interesting and entertaining comedy-drama, written and directed by Preston Sturges.

It's not laugh-a-minute - the farcical stuff is often quite silly - but some of the dialogue-based jokes are great.The movie had potential as a drama but here it is a bit unfocussed. We have themes of the plight of the homeless, injustice and laughter being the cure for everything, but nothing is done in much depth. The final take-away feels a bit like a cop-out, an easy out, after all the potential paths the movie could have taken.One positive side to the drama is the relationship between John L Sullivan and The Girl (we never get to know her name).

            "content": "SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS (1941) A film review by Dan Navarro Copyright Dan Navarro 2005Writer-director Preston Sturges' \"Sullivan's Travels\" (1941), a wicked satire of Hollywood, is a masterpiece, one of the best films ever made. The first time I saw this pinnacle of Sturges' estimable career was at an \"aud call\" when I was in grammar school. The teachers herded us kids into the auditorium to watch a 16mm print of it and, they hoped, get us out of their hair for an hour and a half. I was only about 6 years old, but I believe \"Sullivan's Travels\" is the first film that ever made me cry tears of joy. It's been more than half a century, but my eyes still well up when I watch it, a sign that either the film is effective or I'm an easy mark. I prefer to believe it's the former.The plot tells of John L. \"Sully\" Sullivan, a Hollywood director who is a big success at turning out comedies, but then gets it into his head that he should direct a \"serious\" film with social significance, all about tragedy, hopelessness, and suffering. To prepare himself for this bleak scenario, he decides to go on the road dressed as a bum, with only ten cents in his pocket, to learn what it's like to be poor and hungry. Be careful what you wish for. Before Sullivan's travels come to an end, he will have visited the darkest corner of the deepest pit of the human condition.This being a Preston Sturges picture, of course there's a happy ending. But he puts the hero through hell before that happens. There's also a romance of sorts, pairing Sullivan (Joel McRea) with a young woman we know only as The Girl (Veronica Lake). I say \"of sorts\" because there is no love scene per se, no kissing, not even any fond hugging. The closest they ever get physically is one evening when the two ersatz hobos (The Girl has joined him in his masquerade) stop to admire the moon... and put their arms around each other, lightly. Less is more. I think the love between them seems stronger than if they were pawing each other every few minutes.Preston Sturges began his Hollywood career as a screenwriter (\"Never Say Die\" [1939], \"Remember the Night\" [1940]), but soon prevailed on the studio brass to put him on as a director, because he was frustrated at the way directors were reshaping his words. His first film as both writer and director, \"The Great McGinty\" (1940), was a hit, and won him an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Sturges was on his way.There's an early scene in \"Sullivan's Travels\" that deftly shows off Sturges' skill with wordplay. McRea, Robert Warwick, and Porter Hall are having a vigorous debate over the wisdom of embarking on Sullivan's new, change-of-pace film. The rapid-fire dialogue is intoxicating to listen to, because it seems the actors never take a breath. As each line ends, a new one begins, as if we are watching a relay race with words instead of batons. That's not all: The entire scene, from beginning to end, is shot in one continuous take, with no cuts. The camera moves as necessary, to follow the actors, but essentially it is all a single shot. And Sturges manages to bring the scene in at four minutes flat. I have no idea how he did it, or how many retakes were needed to achieve this precision. But the effect is mesmerizing.Sturges gives us many great scenes in \"Sullivan's Travels,\" but there is one that really put a lump in my throat. Sully has been imprisoned in a Deep South chain gang presided over by a ruthless warden (the great Alan Bridge). The warden won't brook Sully's independent attitude and resolves to crush his spirit by locking him in \"the sweat box,\" a sadistic, one-man windowless cell where the hapless prisoner is forced to stand for hours, alone.The prison trusty, played by Sturges regular Jimmy Conlin, visits the sweat box periodically and gives water to the dehydrated prisoner, and also gives him words of encouragement. Finally, at night, the trusty is allowed to open the sweat box and release Sullivan from this torture device. He unlocks the door, and the exhausted Sullivan collapses into his arms. The camera remains still for several seconds while the trusty cradles him gently. I don't know if Sturges intended this, but the shot reminded me of a Renaissance painting of St. John holding the body of Christ after the Crucifixion.Sullivan's personal epiphany comes when he joins the other prisoners as guests at a local black church, where they are treated to an evening of Mickey Mouse cartoons. The prisoners, the warden, even the preacher, laugh uproariously at the antics of Mickey and his dog Pluto. Finally, Sullivan starts to laugh, too. And that's when this great comedy director realizes the truth: the best gift he can offer his audiences is not dour drama, but comedy -- pictures that enrich the human condition by offering a touch of happiness in a world too filled with tragedy.McRea's final line in the movie is one of the greatest closers ever. After Sullivan's eventual escape and reunion with his Hollywood friends, he announces that he won't be making that \"socially significant\" picture after all. He'll stick to making comedies. Why? \"There's a lot to be said for making people laugh. Do you know that's all some people have? It's not a lot, in this cockeyed caravan, but it's better than nothing.

Anybody can have an opinion, but when people like Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Sydney Pollack, Leonard Maltin and Roger Ebert place this film in their best 20 list, there must be a reason.  First, Preston Sturgis, a genius, they even named a building after him on the Paramount Studio Lot.  Seven big hit films in seven years, plus he had a giant reputation as a Broadway playwright. Although some may disagree, I think this film was his masterpiece. The scene in the poor black church, where the convicts go in shackles is so brilliant, it ranks with some of the best filmmaking on the planet. I've heard people say it was stereotypical, yet unfortunately, that's the way it was then.  The juxtaposition of the convicts, who had lost their civil rights, and the poor African Americans who never had civil rights, mated to the song, \"Let My People Go\", puts this film heads and shoulders against anything anybody was doing in 1942.Joel McCrea gives the performance of his career. I fell totally in love with Veronica Lake; who wouldn't?  The first scene lasts five minutes without a cut. To the MTV generation this is mortal sin, but Sturgis, having come from the theater, lets his actors, act. When I was a film student, I learned more from this film, than any other of which I can think at the moment.  It is a classic's classic.

            "content": "Sullivan's Travels has a lot to offer. Its comedy is often great, and its drama is even greater. It is also one of the most well written films I have ever seen, especially from the studio system. This is its basic premise: a Hollywood director, Sullivan, sees the suffering of the common people around him, or at least he thinks he has, and decides he must do something about it: he will make a movie about the horrors of everyday life in the slums of America. His producers object: what does he know about their lives? He's a rich college graduate, privileged all his life. He makes several thousand dollars a week. They've got him here, but he has a solution: he'll don a hobo's garb, leave his home with only a dime, and walk the streets looking for trouble. This he genuinely attempts, but his producers refuse to leave him alone, sending a high-tech fleet after him, equipped with doctors, cooks, writers, and PR people. Also, no matter how hard he tries, Sullivan ends up back in Hollywood every time. The second time he is re-routed, he meets up with a girl, played by Veronica Lake. She suggests that she could help him, for she has been on the road for a while. And that she does, although they still cannot escape the fleet of protectors. Finally, after travelling from L.A. to Kansas City as hobos (at least most of the way), Sullivan decides that he has done enough and has learned what he needs to learn.My reaction was: \"WHAT?!?!?!\" After the movie had tried to establish that these pretentious people know not a thing about the meek, it is giving up this early? By this point, its view of homelessness was the same as it was nearly everywhere else: hobos are just happy people who don't need a home.Luckily, and fantastically, the film takes an unexpected corner at this point. Instead of contradicting itself, it boldly points out that it was thus far contradicting itself. In an arrogant haze (and mostly through the fault of the PR crew), Sullivan goes out on the street with $1000 worth of fives, planning to distribute them to the homeless whom he finds. One of the homeless men, after receiving his $5 bill (and consequently gazing upon Sullivan's stack of them), follows him and knocks him out, stealing the rest of the wad. The hobo stuffs Sullivan into a train car, and then he is hit by a train while trying to collect the money he has dropped. His friends, after an exhaustive search, determine that the dead hobo is actually Sullivan. Sullivan meanwhile awakes in a haze in the deep south, where a railroad worker is hassling him to get off of the train. In a daze, Sullivan assaults the man. Because of this, he is arrested and thrown into prison.There is a half-hour left at this point, and it solidifies this film's stake as a masterpiece. Finally, Sullivan has gotten what he wished for: the vagrant's treatment. As a convict, he and his fellow convicts are tormented. No one believes his story (heck, they won't even listen!). The film's climactic scene is brilliant: the convicts are allowed to visit an all black church (and, although these black folk are a bit stereotyped, as you can only expect in a film from 1942, they are shown in a surprisingly human light; they may actually be the kindest and most sincere characters in the entire film; although it is not expressed explicitly, these people were surely just as oppressed as the convicts) where they are showing a film. It is a Micky Mouse cartoon, and both the black folk and the convicts break into uproarious laughter. Sullivan at first resists. He is a serious film director. He takes the medium seriously as an art. But then, he quickly comes to realize that this laughter is helping them much, much more than a film about their lives ever could. Afterwards, through a great twist, Sullivan alerts his friends of his whereabouts, which brings about his release. And the serious movie about the downtrodden he so very much wanted to make before his whole adventure he decides to scrap. A comedy would help much more.So, effectively, Sullivan's Travels simultaneously entertains and argues a very good point. Still, I think there must be a reason for dramas about the downtrodden. Who could ever deny the emotions awoken by a film like The Bicycle Thieves. I think these sorts of dramas are not meant to help the downtrodden directly, but rather they are meant to make those not downtrodden aware of the plight of those less fortunate, and therefore cause them to care and possibly even to do something. I hope this is how it works. I wonder how this film was accepted by the critics and the audiences when it was first released. P.S. Is Veronica Lake not the most beautiful Hollywood starlette you've ever seen? This is the first film I've seen with her in it (not counting L.A. Confidential!). Maybe my only complaint is that she was not in it nearly enough!",

            "content": "Most of the moments of physical comedy in this are not funny and are a little grating. A butler pulled into a swimming pool as he tries to pull someone else out, a chef in chaos in a mobile kitchen ends up with food all over his face, at times these moments feel like they belong in a different film. The cathartic power of laughter is the overwhelming message of the film, so a failure to be funny when it tries, should be a major problem but for several reasons it isn't. Why Sullivan's Travels is such a great film comes down to a perfect script some unforgettable performances and one of my all time favourite scenes from any film I have ever seen. While the slap-stick falls flat the dialogue on the other hand never does, it crackles with wit and intelligence sidestepping every clich\u00e9 and expectation. Veronica Lake is lovely and reason alone to watch the film but a very small role performed by Jess Lee Brooks as a kindly preacher is truly wonderful and one that leaves the strongest lasting impression.The preacher appears in just one short part but its a scene that the films whole premise and emotional beliefs radiate out from. A churches congregation prepare for their 'guests' a gang of convicts who visit for screenings of cartoons in the church. As the congregation sing 'Let my People Go' the convicts seem to be summoned up from the surrounding swamp, they somberly march in and sit in their designated pews at the front of the church. The cartoon show starts up and musters such insanely enthusiastic laughter from all present that it jolts the slightly wooden protagonist towards his epiphany. The whole scene is so totally barmy, so full of heart and so visually striking that I find myself returning to it again and again.",

            "content": "SPOILERS This is one of those Hollywood studio movies that fairly zips along at breakneck pace but, unlike some of its more mindless contemporaries, rarely strays from an intelligent and thoughtful treatment of its subject matter. Joel McCrea, in probably the best role of his career, plays Sullivan, a successful director with pretensions, who dreams of creating a socially relevant masterpiece on the back of a string of inane comedies such as Ant in Your Pants of 1939. Discouraged by his studio bosses, McCrea dresses himself as a tramp and attempts to sample life on the road with mostly disappointing results, although he does manage to hook up with the sultry Veronica Lake on the way.Sullivan's good intentions land him a six year spell on the chain gang when, having decided he has seen all he needs to see of the life of the poor, he is mugged while dispensing five dollar notes and, as a result of the only part of the film that doesn't really ring true, finds himself doing time on a chain gang. Ironically, he finds exactly the kind of experience he thought he wanted, only to discover that he is trapped in that world \u0096 until he acknowledges who he really is and what he's really about. On the way, he learns, during a church screening of a Pluto cartoon, that comedy has an important place in the lives of the poor against which a social conscience can never compete.I remember seeing a BBC news report some years ago in which a group of well-meaning but misguided celebrities led by actor Jeremy Irons were sleeping rough for a night to highlight the plight of the homeless. Trouble was, poor old Jeremy couldn't get any sleep because he was harangued by the real homeless who were outraged at he and his pals patronising efforts to salve their own social consciences. They knew that the following night Mr Irons would be surrounded by the comforts of his millionaire lifestyle while they would once again be bedding down in the shop doorways of London, and that Irons' publicity stunt would only succeed in, well, gaining some positive publicity for Irons and his friends. It was one of the funniest things I'd seen in years. Irons obviously hadn't seen this film, or considered how the real homeless might respond to his hollow gesture. Some worlds, as Sullivan finds out to his cost in this movie, are never meant to collide.Sturges was a unique talent and his brand of humour ranges from cartoon-ish slapstick to highly-barbed suggestion, all of which is displayed here. This was arguably his finest moment, and much of the comedy is as fresh and laugh-out-loud funny today as it must have been back in the early forties. There are only two drawbacks: the presence of Veronica Lake, a limited actress who delivers too many of her lines in a monotone that is really too distracting, and the way Sturges has to unrealistically compress and twist the story's timeline once Sturges is robbed of his conscience money.",

            "content": "Another excellent Sturges film. Really, I could go on all day about how great this film is. It's a perfect ode to what Sturges did best, and it packs a heap of genres and ideas in it's 90 minute running time. Joel McCrea is the Sullivan of the title, a hit comedy director who decides he wants to make a socially conscious film. Not knowing much about suffering and deprivation, he hits the road as a tramp, and encounters gorgeous Veronica Lake. From there, Sturges seamlessly meshes together a road movie, romance, slapstick comedy, social drama and crime film into one brilliant whole. It's just perfect.I found the slapstick elements really interesting, as there seems to be many references and nods to the great silent comedians of Lloyd, Chaplin and Keaton. Many of the fast-paced comic scenes have no dialogue, and are filmed with sound effects. But there's plenty of great dialogue in here too, and many a quotable line. The scene with the blacks in the church is perhaps the most stunning moment in the film. The prison chain gang walk slowly, defeated, in the foreground, while we hear the singing. The African-Americans have a deep religious faith, yet are just as oppressed as the criminals. And the magic of film, and specifically comedy, brings them together as one.The cast is letter perfect, with Joel McCrea such an under-appreciated actor. Veronica Lake is gorgeous as usual, and I love her relationship with Sully. So modern and fun. Also love the references to Lubitsch",

Directed in 1942 by the gifted playwright/screenwriter/director Preston Sturges, it achieves a near perfect balance of humor and pathos--characteristic of much of his work.  Joel McCrea plays a popular filmmaker (riding high on the success of his comedy pictures) who decides to visit the slums of America and experience life as a basis for his latest film. He talks about the transcedent nature of film as an art which can educate and speak to people on an emotional level. His pals at the studio think that he's gone crazy.  But during his journey he learns much about himself, and society, falls in love and arrives at an epiphany.  The details of his journey I will not divulge, but rest assured that I started out laughing, and by the end I had tears in my eyes.  A successful Hollywood Satire, an elegant sophisticated comedy, and a social critique all rolled into one.  Sullivan's Travels, helps remind one what great movies are all about:magic.",

            "content": "If the message of this film can truly be summed up when McCrea's character says \"There's a lot to be said for making people laugh.\" Then I can't say much for 'Sullivan's Travels'. I can see why someone might think this is a great movie. It attempts to mix comedy with social commentary. While attempting to make a comedy with some sense of purpose or message is a noble and bolder undertaking then most comedies (especially screwball comedies of the 30s/40s) were willing to attempt. That doesn't mean it automatically gets an 'A', on effort alone. The fact is that this \"comedy\" doesn't even attempt to be a comedy for the last half of the movie and instead veers sharply into melodramatic commentary on the inequities of depression age America, and the misguided way in which the upper-class views the lower. Oh and it also points out how ultimately Hollywood is a friend to the every man and provides a great social service, kind of like Clooney's Oscar speech. Anyway the point is that all of the comedy in this movie is confined to the first half and the second is an overwrought drama, which beats its message home. If this was truly a great comedy it would have integrated the two halves instead of lumping them one on after the other. Making a highly comedic satire that seamlessly blends comedy and drama while maintaining an interesting plot and effectively conveying the message can be done. 'Dr. Strangelove', or perhaps more to the point 'Network' and 'The Player' accomplish this task much more successfully then 'Sullivan's Travels' does.In any event I fail to see how AFI could rank this has the 39th funniest movie of all time. Was it the part where Veronica Lake pushes McCrea into the pool, and then she falls in, and the butler walks up and...well you know the rest. That bit has been done before\u0085 but only like a million times before, and sometimes it's a lake or pond instead of a swimming pool, and I've seen it done with a puddle of mud and a bath tub too, but I digress. Or okay, how about the part where McCrea gets in the car with the kid and it goes tearing down the street out of control with the van chasing after them. Hmmm, well OK how about the \"witty dialogue\", which for the period didn't come nearly as fast or furious as it does in other pictures. Now granted you may find the dialogue funny, and I can't say that you don't; maybe you honestly do. Maybe you were put in a maniacal uncontrollable fit of laughter, like some of those prisoners were watching Pluto chase his tale around; who knows? But what you can't tell me is that there are any jokes in the last 30 minutes of the film. And it is impossible for me to understand how a movie that half consists of routine slapstick in its first act, and doesn't even attempt comedy in its final act is the 39th funniest movie of all time. Oh wait, I know, it's a freaking \"classic\" first off, and not only that but one that champions the film industry itself. Give me a break. Oh by the way, the little joke I made in the first two lines of this review, is funnier then anything in 'Sullivan's Travels'. So at least if seeing the movie has lead you to read these reviews; you got to see at least one good joke. If you're looking for a classic screwball comedy (And after watching this I wouldn't even classify it as such, but that's what I heard going in.) go rent Arsenic and Old Lace or Bringing up Baby or something that isn't Sullivan's Travels.",

            "content": "Sullivan's Travels (1941) :\nBrief Review -An intellectual comedy of tragedy becomes a satire on glorifying ingloriousness. Sullivan's Travels has to be one of the most important comedy that mocks Hollywood films propaganda and also glorifies them in satirical climax. This has to be one of the most intellectual socially important film of the whole 40s decade. Sullivan's Travels is a top class writing exhibition by Preston Sturges which tells a story of a successful Hollywood director who wants to make a film on suffering of humanity but he himself has to experience the troubles first. He goes on journey to experience the problems himself and is accompanied by a struggling hopeless actress. He discovers that there's very less in people's life but it's better than having nothing and the suffering is accepted by them, all they need in thier busted lives is a little fun. Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake makes a sweet pair and the supporting cast does well in limited roles. The real hero of the film is the Writer and the Director of the film Mr. Preston Sturges. He made such a fine mixture of comedy and satire, I haven't seen such a great blending of all elements before. He saved the best poking sense at the last just to leave us stunned by his intellectual thoughts. Sullivan's Travels made me laugh, it made feel the poverty and troubles, it made think over it again and again. There are very less films made on social satire theme which has a reference of Hollywood involved and letting us know the importance of entertainment provided by films and also getting it intellectually and fundamentally correct. I guess actually there are no such films made before this, so i can say that, Comedy and Social Satire confronts each other for the First Time in Hollywood Cinema with Sullivan's Travels. Now you know how beautiful and important film Sullivan's Travel is. If you love cinema, you can't Miss it.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

Basically popular young Hollywood director John Lloyd Sullivan (Joel McCrea) is tired of directing comedies and wants to make something serious, exploration of the plight of the downtrodden based on the book O Brother, Where Art Thou?, but Mr. LeBrand (Robert Warwick) wants him to direct another lucrative comedy. Sullivan refuses to give in and decides to experience himself what the life for a tramp is like and truly depict the sorrows, his butler Burroughs (Robert Greig) and Valet (Top Hat's Eric Blore) question his idea, ignoring them he dresses as a penniless hobo and goes on the road, but no matter what he does he ends up back in Hollywood, he is even trailed by staff who try to bring back, even hitchhiking he ends back where he started. Then he meets The Girl (Veronica Lake), a young failed actress who is considering quitting the business, having shown him kindness he gives her a lift in his car, the servants wrongly assume the car has been stolen, following a short stint being apprehended she pushes him in a swimming pool for lying to her about who he is, but she forgives him and becomes his travelling companion. Sullivan finally manages to live like a real hobo, eating in soup kitchens and sleeping in homeless shelters with the Girl, he eventually decides to call it a day, his experiment has been successful, the Girl wants to stay with him, but advised by his business manager he explains is already married to reduce tax payments, but she has cost him double the money to get by. As he is getting ready to leave and giving homeless people $5 bills Sullivan is ambushed while alone by a homeless man who wants more money, the man knocks him unconscious and thrown onto a train boxcar leaving the city, but the thief is killed being run over by another train, he also stole Sullivan's shoes which contained identification, and everyone assumes the unrecognisable body is that of Sullivan. In another city Sullivan has woken up and has no memory of what happened or who he is, and when he assaults a railroad worker who found him he is sentenced to six years in a labour camp, and there he remembers everything, but before he will do anything to get his life back he learns the importance of laughter when the the prisoners are cheered up watching a cartoon, he knows comedy helps those less fortunate. Sullivan cannot convince the prison staff of his identity, but he comes up with the idea to confess to murdering John Lloyd Sullivan to make headlines and get his photograph in the papers, he is recognised and released, and he and the Girl reunite, and he is allowed to divorce as his \"widow\" went with a crooked business manager, the last moments are various laughing faces. Also starring William Demarest as Mr. Jones, Franklin Pangborn as Mr. Casalsis, Porter Hall as Mr. Hadrian, Arthur Hoyt as Preacher at Revival Mission and Preston Sturges as Studio Director. McCrea gives an amiable performance as the director who goes to unusual lengths to research for a new film, and it is understandable why Lake become a star after this film with her lavish long blonde hair being seductive, this film really a sideways look at both the Hollywood system and how losing everything can affect people, so it is both entertaining and thoughtful, there are just about enough funny moments but I found it more dramatic than anything, which is a good thing, a most watchable satirical comedy drama.

Although the direction is rather uneven and the film lurches rather uncomfortably from pathos to comedy, it constantly tugs the heartstrings by presenting the viewer with challenging human dilemmas. When Sullivan goes to prison, he finds himself up close with what he (and we) would normally regard as 'the dregs of society', but he (and we) are touched by their honesty and simple pleasure, and their acceptance of their place in the world. The Church scene in which a simple children's' cartoon brings out the convicts' laughter and joy - despite their terrible existence - is deeply moving. It would be very easy to mistake this film for an early Frank Capra ('You can't take it with you'/'It's a Wonderful Life') The final line is the cue to finally admit that yes, there are tears in your eyes and reach for the handkerchief: \"I want to make people laugh.

She joins him on his trampy road trip and then they re-group in the world of luxuries before McCrea goes missing one evening....and his death is reported in the press. We know he's not dead but how will he become re-united with Lake Veronica? It's meant to be a comedy and if you like the following sort of humour, then it is right up your street. A high speed car chase results in the passengers inside a coach being thrown about - one person gets his head stuck between some shutters - ha ha ha - then someone keeps slipping around - ha ha ha - then someone else slips around and falls over - ha ha ha - and it keeps going on for ages like this. Another sequence sees a group of prisoners watching a film in a church and they are all in hysterics coz the film is so funny. Once again, this sequence goes on forever and a day and the cause of the hilarity........ Pluto's antics in a Mickey Mouse feature. Yes folks, Pluto gets his paws stuck on some fly paper on the floor and he can't seem to walk properly. It's just absolutely hilarious. If you are a retard.As for the story, after an hour of blandness, the film swings to the unpleasant when a tramp is killed by a train. How unnecessary was that! Speaking of unnecessary, McCrea puts on a comedy voice to indicate that he has a cold for a section of the film because it's such a funny thing to do. And pointless. It adds nothing to the story and certainly isn't funny. The film is full of pointless touches like this. The plot also has a glaring error when McCrea is identified as being dead by the credit card in the boots that he was wearing. HOLD ON.....Lake Veronica knows that he had his boots stolen. McCrea would not be identified as the dead body so what on earth is the idiot writer thinking about and why is he continuing with this ridiculous storyline?

Too bad Hollywood never gave him the sort of roles William Holden had after his own precarious start in \"Smiling Jim\" sort of roles. Holden and McCrea have a lot in common as actors--manly and professional at all times.It's also an eye-opener to see just how luscious VERONICA LAKE was at an early stage in her career. Her flair for light comedy and flippant remarks serves her well as the girl who decides to join McCrea on his hobo adventures to see how the other half lives. He's tired of directing unreal films and thinks a taste of real life will influence his next film project.It starts out as a screwball comedy--smart, fast-paced, crackling with good dialog. The scenes aboard the director's trailer are briskly entertaining and reach slapstick comedy highlights when the trailer follows McCrea in a speeding car with hilarious results.The last third of the film delves into the dark side with such grim results (the convicts are mistreated and we're suddenly watching \"I Was A Prisoner from a Chain Gang\"), that the switch in genres is almost as if someone put the wrong reel on a film projector. Similarly, the scene in the black church with the prisoners laughing at a Mickey Mouse comedy, wears a bit thin in making a point.But all in all, it's a strangely fascinating satire with some genuine comic highlights, a message, and some nice turns by the entire cast. William Demerest, Eric Blore and Franklin Pangborn stand out in supporting roles and Jimmy Conlin is effective as a prison trusty.I enjoyed THE PALM BEACH STORY and MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK much more, but many Preston Sturges fans will enjoy this one as well.Summing up: Veronica Lake never looked so stunning and Joel McCrea can sneeze more effectively than anyone since Billy Gilbert (who voiced Sneezy in Disney's \"Snow White\").",

He sets out as a hobo with only ten cents, hooks up with a big-hearted girl and goes on a journey of self-discovery in his search for the real America.This is one of those rare films which seems almost perfect in its execution and somehow succeeds on every level of construction. It's a howler of comedy with both hilarious slapstick scenes and side-splitting dialogue, it's a beautifully touching story of adversity and dignity, it's a moral lesson in the importance of art and entertainment, it's a thoughtful observation on the little-seen American underclasses, and it's Sturges' own little mocking indictment of himself. With such a range of targets it should be wildly uneven but it isn't; every scene rings true and the pathos of the church film-show sequence, as the convicts roar with laughter at Goofy's antics, remains one of the most poignant and touching moments in cinema. Very few Hollywood movies are about have-nots (Nothing Lasts Forever, They Live) and this picture - made during the grim period between America's economic depression and its involvement in World War II - beautifully captures the mood and frustration of the times. McCrea is sensational as Sullivan, a lofty motormouth who learns the hard way about deprivation, and Lake is as spellbinding as ever as The Girl - sensuous, funny and graceful all at the same time. The ensemble is a trove of gifted comic character actors, with top laurels going to Greig as Sullivan's laid-back, lugubrious butler. This movie has been enormously influential on several generations of filmmakers and is referenced in many other pictures (notably Grand Canyon and Barton Fink) - an unpretentious film about pretension. Writer-director Sturges is one of two genius comic-dramatic directors of the forties (the other is Frank Capra); don't miss this classic or any of his other films, notably The Palm Beach Story and Hail The Conquering Hero.",

Although he tries repeatedly, his adventures continue to fail... until one day he gets in over his head.The director of this film, Preston Sturges, was consistently great, not only hitting a home run here, but also with \"Lady Eve\" and \"The Palm Beach Story\". There is something about his style that brings a sense of fun to the screen and carries a complex plot in an easy to digest manner. From the very beginning, we are treated with a \"communism\" (or perhaps Christian) message about the needs of mankind, and this is blended into a great action introduction -- among the most action you will see in a film of this period, in fact.We have some great stars -- Veronica Lake, who is a delightfully beautiful leading lady. And Eric Blore, the gay Englishman from \"Lady Eve\" and \"Top Hat\" is enjoyable in each of his roles... though this one was much smaller, sadly. And we have the ongoing influence of Sullivan's proposed movie, \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" that had to wait several decades before finally being made by the Coens.The comedy is genius and in some ways ahead of its time. For example, the \"black chef\" scene is hilarious, and seems to anticipate Lucille Ball, particularly \"The Long, Long Trailer\". There are also some very conspicuous nods to Ernst Lubitsch, which is wonderful. Lubitsch is not well known outside cinephile circles, but he had such a huge impact on Sturges and Billy Wilder, among countless others.One of the big questions of this film is whether laughter is what the poor need or social films. Mysteriously, the story assumes they go to the movies, which seems generally doubtful that the poor and homeless do. But let us run with that assumption: what benefits the poor more, a good laugh or a film that makes people think about the ills of society? Likely the latter, but arguments exist for both, of course.The Criterion Collection release has an interesting commentary with Michael McKean, Noah Baumbach and Christopher Guest. They are unfortunately not in the same room during recording, but each has something good to offer. You might be surprised how knowledgeable these men are about a film that is now over seventy years old.",

No attempt is made to glamorize the hobo life, as had been done in earlier 1930s movies.Then Sullivan ends up in a Southern workcamp and sees the injustices there, the sort of thing we would not really see again until some of Sidney Poitier's movies in the early 1960s.When Sullivan gets back to Hollywood at the end of the picture, I was sure he was going to make a movie that would denounce those inequalities and injustices. Instead, he wants to go back to making comedies. I found that, to say the least, very surprising.",

            "content": "In the era of the hobo and stealing a ride on cargo trains, the forgotten man was a visible shame of society that had been through a horrible depression and was now moving into the second world war. Film director Joel McCrea is disgusted by what he sees as a curable disease of mankind and society and decides to head out disguised as a hobo (stalked by his butler and valet) to find out their real issues and plan a new epic to document their struggles in a world of denial. Along the way, he meets a beautiful but broke movie extra (Veronica Lake) on the verge of leaving Hollywood. She buys him ham and eggs (fooled by his disguise) then is disgusted when she discovers the truth. On his own, McCrea fights off lonely widows, finds some sympathy but ultimately ends up in a work camp, a victim of amnesia who assaults a train officer in self-defense. The camp's sadistic guard cruelly taunts him and all seems lost until the amnesiac McCrea sees the other inmates laughing at a Mickey Mouse cartoon and realizes what people needs is laughter rather than a reminder of things that they already know.Although the plot is wrapped up rather quickly and a bit too neatly, it is still a satisfying conclusion. Writer and Director Preston Sturges acknowledges the Capra like structure of the plot, and like Capra, utilizes a strong core of character actors, most notably Eric Blore as the valet, Robert Greig as the butler, Esther Howard as the love-starved widow, Almira Sessions as the prickly housekeeper and Jimmy Conlin as the kindly trustee at the work farm. While the first half of the film offers a light-hearted view of the hobo's life as total freedom from the pressures of society, the last half is a lot darker and thus more profound. In many ways, it reminded me of a later version of \"Wild Boys of the Road\", a 1933 movie about lost youth trying to find themselves in a world torn asunder by depression.",

            "content": "\"There's a lot to be said for making people laugh. Did you know that that's all some people have?\" So says director John Sullivan in \"Sullivan's Travels\", Preston Sturges' 1941 film about lighthearted-comedy director John Sullivan (Joel McCrea) and his bid to make a film with a message about the nation's poor, titled \"O Brother, Where Art Thou\". (Yes, this is where the Coen brothers got the title from.) When the studio tries to talk him out of it, insisting that since he has always had a privileged upbringing and knows nothing about being poor, he decides to take off on the road as a bum to learn what it is like to suffer. Unfortunately, the studio decides that this would make a great story, so they follow him around in a large bus containing a cook, doctor, reporters and near-luxury accommodations. He has a couple of false starts because he somehow keeps ending up in Hollywood, and during one of the times he meets \"The Girl\" (Veronica Lake), who mistakes him for a bum and buys him breakfast at a diner before she packs up and leaves Hollywood after a failed attempt at making it in the business. He immediately becomes endeared to her and she ends up following him on his adventures, until he is falsely thought to be dead, when he begins to truly learn life's lessons.I absolutely love Preston Sturges films, and while this is only the third film I've seen of his, it is easy to see that this one is different from the others in that there is a message attached. Normally I don't look for a message to be included in screwball comedies of the 1930's and 1940's, but in this case I appreciated it. Sturges points out, in a time of world turmoil, that there is nothing wrong with enjoying yourself; and he does this beautifully, with one simple scene near the end. \"Sullivan's Travels\" fits in with his body of work in every other way, however. The rapid fire dialogue, double entendres, and hilarious physical comedy remain static. Joel McCrea, who, based on his performance in \"Sullivan\", was certainly a big inspiration for Tim Robbins' performance in another Coen brother's film, \"The Hudsucker Proxy\", was a wonderful, earnest dope that had every good intention, but just needed a swift kick to execute his ideas. Veronica Lake was a great surprise for me, since I am so used to seeing her as a femme fatale in noir films. Her funny, very physical performance was extremely enjoyable that really added to the charm of the film.As stated earlier, I have now seen three Sturges films, and with each film I see I want to see more. \"Sullivan's Travels\" was not flawless, it did have some pacing issues, but it was a truly enjoyable film that was so charming it is easy to forgive the small stuff. This film is highly recommended for any classic film fan, or comedy fan. I would also recommend it to anyone who, like me, are big Coen brothers fans \u0096 Sturges was a big influence on them, and so far, \"Sullivan's Travels\" is the clearest example of this. 7/10 --Shelly",

But the lesson isn't an easy one to learn, for Sullivan and Sturges both. Frustrated by a career spent making fluff comedies ('Hey, Hey in the Hayloft'), Sullivan feels compelled to tackle a serious and meaningful drama, something to reflect the desperation and inhumanity of the Great Depression, and he promptly sets out on a fact-finding mission disguised as a hobo, with a caravan of reporters, publicists, servants, and nervous studio executives hot on his heels.In this self-conscious (and semi-autobiographical?) tribute to the universal balm of laughter, Sturges adds a melancholy depth of feeling to his typically madcap sense of humor, but with decidedly mixed results. The early scenes are vintage Sturges, but by trying to balance slapstick with some very moist sentiment he falls into the same trap as his alter-ego on screen, forgetting how laughter, by itself, is often the best (and most eloquent) medicine.",

Sullivan would have made after his series of misadventures came to an end.Besides having my personal Top Ten Best and Worst Movie Lists, I also have one I call 'Best Movies No One's Ever Heard Of\". I think this one qualifies. I wound up searching it out after seeing it on the AFI list of Top 100 Movies from 2007. It starts out in the tradition of some of your best slapstick comedies, and in the final third takes a complete three sixty to thrust it's main character, portrayed by Joel McCRae, into a horribly untenable situation due to a case of mistaken identity.What I'm glad the picture stayed away from was taking it's two principal players and involving them in a romantic situation just because they were Joel McCrae and Veronica Lake. Even though there was some playful interplay between the two, I never got the impression that Sullivan was ever trying to take advantage of 'The Girl's' youth and inexperience. I would add naivet\u00e9 as well, but Lake's character never really came across as naive, having been around the block in her quest to become an actress. This was an interesting role for Lake, a screen siren of the era who's better remembered for roles like Cora Smith in \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\". I thought she cut the cutest tomboy figure dressed as a hobo, at the same time drawing viewer attention to the significant difference in height between herself and McCrae as they navigated the hobo jungles.Sullivan's 'come to Jesus' moment comes in a 'come to Jesus' setting when as a prisoner on a chain gang, he gets to watch a Disney cartoon at a Baptist revival gathering. The setting itself is a jarring juxtaposition of humanity, a poor black congregation offering their hospitality to a group of convicts whose only relief from brutal incarceration is the infrequent attendance at a local 'picture show'. Sullivan's observation and analysis brings him full circle to the quandary he was faced with at the start of the film, and is led to the conclusion that in difficult times, it's better to make people laugh. I don't know that I'd always agree with that, but for the purpose of this picture's message, it works pretty well.If you're intrigued by the hobo life as depicted in the middle part of this picture, I would direct you to the 1933 film \"Wild Boys of the Road\". It's a grittier film that ST, while blending some hefty doses of grim reality with spirit and humanity. And don't forget to catch the real 'O Brother, Where Art Thou' I mentioned earlier, capturing the essence of what Sully Sullivan might have had in mind had he ever gotten around to it.",

By homeless, include materially poor, hungry, hopeless and wretched where man is shamed into submission. This was never meant to be. The current state of mankind is to be blamed on mankind for man still has not figured out how to cure this and more yet the answers are there and doable. Note: Homeless decades ago were mostly decent people down on their luck needing a break and some criminal element mixed in. Today it s more criminal element with some down & out-ters thrown in. Drug addicts, alcoholics and felons on the run often use a cloak of homeless to hide in while others cannot escape it for lack of resources and what we would call \"a break\". The systems that keep us in bondage are hard to break and this film gives us a close-up on it quite well. I like the presentation of the subject using comedy to visit with it and as you watch this movie, it actually goes where you would not expect and pulls you in even deeper into enjoyment.

The premise is about a successful musical comedy director who wants to make a serious picture about human suffering. The film opens with a dedication to the memory of clowns, buffoons -- anyone who has dedicated their life to making people laugh. What do you think he will learn at the end of this story? It's not revealed with the most impressiveness, but few themes ring as true as this film's, especially to anyone with a love of the movies, especially classics.Conceived during the Great Depression and premiering at the very beginning of World War II, what an important picture. \"Sullivan\" champions comedy, portrays Hollywood with a sense of humor yet asks it to look in the mirror and celebrates the golden age of Hollywood that came before it with numerous classic techniques.John McCrea is John Lloyd Sullivan, a pictures director that wants to make a film of substance -- he wants to adapt \"O Brother Where Art Thou\" (a title most cleverly used by the Coen brothers in their 2000 film) but his producers want ... a little bit of sex. They tell him he knows nothing of human suffering and has no business making that kind of film. Sullivan sees it as a challenge and decides he'll dress like a hobo and learn for himself in order to make his picture.Try as he might to escape his Hollywood entourage, the humor of \"Sullivan\" is that Sullivan can never manage to escape Los Angeles. In the beginning he tries to shake them in a high- speed chase one of the funnier and more classic scenes of the film. He's in a go-kart of sorts with a 13-year-old and his friends in a giant caravan.Along the way he meets a girl (Veronica Lake) who shows him some kindness and then when they're thrown in jail and bailed out by his producers, he reveals himself rather quickly. She takes a liking to him, however, and they dress as hobos together jumping on train cars the next time out.The brilliance of Preston Sturges' story and script -- aside from his punchy dialogue -- is that despite it's sincere message, it is not a drama about a guy trying to make a drama after years of comedies, but it's a comedy. It's not the funniest thing you ever saw and it hits you right over the head with just about everything instead of drawing it out and making it a bit more epiphanic, but it serves up a pristine reminder of what it's about through use of the comedic techniques it champions.If you love film -- namely the classics -- \"Sullivan's Travels\" will find a way to your heart somehow. It's a really perceptive film for 1941, a genre rarity in those days truthfully, and it celebrates what at least one genre of film is all about.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",

Sturges was past master at combining slapstick with pointed satire, and occasionally the two with elements of drama, as the writer/director did in Hail the Conquering Hero and The Great McGinty, in particular.Regrettably, here in Sullivan's Travels, the mood swings too wildly. The high speed, topsy-turvy, farcical comedy scenes whether at the beginning or the end of the film are too ridiculous, while the social-realist dramatic sequence of Sullivan's courtroom sentencing, his sufferings on the prison farm, and his final gospel chapel epiphany goes from bleak to bizarre. The crowning moment of the film -- which is reprised over the last fadeout -- is the hysterical laughter of the convicts and the churchgoers as they watch a Mickey Mouse and Pluto cartoon. Perhaps this moment worked in 1941, but now the laughter seems demented and the whole episode is unsettling. Whenever I see this scene, I always think of the braying of gloating capitalists in some Soviet propaganda reel.Sturges apparently took his inspiration from Gulliver's Travels, moulding the name of Jonathan Swift's lead character into his own: \"Sullivan\". Gulliver, in his travels, starts off in Lilliput and ends up in the land of the Houyhnhnms, with the tone descending from farce into tragedy along the way. Sullivan's journey takes the same route. Swift was able to achieve his intentions with great effect. Sturges can be praised for his audacity in trying to accomplish the same feat. His place as one of the greatest American film-makers is still secure.",

Sullivan thought he did and looked for proof. But the rich only think they do. That discovery was the adventure of Sullivan. He learned his lesson the hard way and what the lesson thought him was not what he expected.A good concept for starters. Considering the year it was produced, and the rudimentary modus operandi in making the film, I had to rethink my evaluation perspective. In that period, the producers and directors had writers work in creative assembly process; an abundance of dialogue was written and directors used it as raw material to tell the story and to create the characters. Sadly, if a substantial portion of the dialogues had been cut to leave only the clever parts in, the ones that did convey the characters' personalities, their strong and weaker traits, what makes an actor believable, we would be closer to the better character development processes of today. The rest of the dialogue, what parts convey the environment in which takes place the story, would today, also, be scaled back and the cinematographers (their skills were just starting to develop) would use the script now with parts geared to the story's environment, in conjunction with set and special effects specialist (they were honing their own skills as well then). All this considered, I enjoyed many many parts of the dialogue, to be specific, the repartee ones.I was happy to get a sense of production and direction in that era, so I can better appreciate what we see from movie makers around the world and from time to time from Hollywood, nowadays. I like to think the templates of many scenes in movies of subsequent decades, including even today, had started being developed in those days. I was okay with the movie as a whole; thought it did a good job with a fair story and the lead actors, Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake acquitted themselves very well for a 1941 movie. I certainly don't expect any of you will be interested in seeing the movie, if you can even find a copy, nor would I be so presumptuous to think you have the time to do so, just because I suggest it.

I'm not even implying that it's not good, that it doesn't deserve its classic status, but for each scene that absolutely mesmerized me, I can think of another that really bugged me. I don't think cringe-worthy moments are the \"stuff, great movies are made on\" to paraphrase a line from a great film of the same year. Howard Hawks said: \"a good movie consists on at least three good scenes and no bad ones\". We can debate about the validity of this assumption, but just think of your favorite films and see if they fit the definition. Let me try with Preston Sturges' \"Sullivan's Travels\". Off the top of my head, I can think of three scenes that blew me away, I loved the crazy chase which reminded me of the excellent cartoon \"Mickey's Trailer\" (I suspect Sturges is a big fan of Disney), I loved the second act of Sully's journey with the public shower and the homeless shelters, and finally, the climactic church scene... not to mention the suggestive shot of Veronica Lake in the shower, I couldn't believe my eyes were watching that from a 1941 film. Now, let's see the avoidable moments that damaged the film's pretension to be 'respected', even as comedy. Regarding the black cook who got the custard pie on his face, I want to give the benefit of the doubt because earlier in the film, the executives mentioned this kind of jokes as being old-fashioned. Maybe it was a sort of meta-referential humor to show that Sully's team is lame and totally disconnected from what people love in movies (they were all stereotypical: the over-smiling Black cook, the bird-faced doctor with Eastern-Europe accent, the wisecracking secretary...), the sight of the cook with cream on his face made me cringe, but I guess it was deliberate because it was redeemed by the church scene (although portraying Black people as overly nice and noble-spirited is another form of reverse racism, but let's not get too sophisticated about it) One I clearly hated is when they all fall in the swimming pool; it was childish, unfunny and predictable. I'm not sure I loved either the sight of Lake looking like a dwarf compared to the towering McCrea, maybe it was a reference to Chaplin and the Kid, well, maybe they had to practice first playing bums, since they were more credible at the second trial. And the last moment that disturbed me was the laughing scene; it started well but then was totally over- the-top even by 40's standards. The purpose of the film was to show the value of laughs in a world of misery as the only way to endure the hardship, but couldn't they come up with a funnier Disney cartoon? I swear if it was the one where Donald, Goofy and Mickey were firemen, I would have bought it, but the Pluto gags weren't that funny, not to make a distinguished guy like Sully laugh his ass off, anyway. Now, all these arguments come to one thing, I liked the film, but I preferred the drama to the comedy, I remember I didn't laugh once during almost half an-hour. It's okay for me, as long as people don't praise it as \"one of the funniest\". I guess that's where the disappointment comes from, I absolutely loved the opening dedication, to the clowns, the buffoons, the ones who made us laugh ... and from that basis, I really expected a laugh riot, which I didn't get. The wisecracking exchanges, the interactions between Lake and McCrea, for me, it inevitably pales in comparison with any Marx Brothers' film or \"It Happened One Night\" to mention another screwball comedy. Speaking of \"It Happened One Night\", if I wanted to be harsh, I would say \"Sullivan's Travels' is a wannabe \"Capra-picture\", hell, they even mention Capra in the beginning. Indeed, it's like Sturges thought of \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\" and \"It Happened One Night\" and wondered what if he did the reverse thing, with a man discovering poverty instead of wealth, through a cross-country journey in America. It's not only a good idea, but also an excellent comical premise with a very heart-warming and inspirational quality, and you could even tell by the several newspapers' shots, and the ending with all these laughing faces, that even style-wise, Capra was an inspiration. But something was lacking in this film, and I don't blame it on the actors (although Veronica Lake was no Paulette Goddard or Jean Hagen, only seeming to exist as McCrea's love interest), it had more to do with the writing, the pacing, too many abrupt changes of tone and a lack of clear direction, which give it a sort of schizophrenic feel, as it didn't try to be a plain comedy, or a plain drama, and both effects canceled each other out \"Sullivan's Travels\" is a well-intentioned film with positive feelings and a sort of self-reflexive intelligence, but it isn't flawless and hasn't stood the test of time as well as so many cinematic landmarks of 1941, such as \"Citizen Kane\" or 'The Maltese Falcon\".",

            "content": "For the American Fourth of July, I recommend this Preston Sturges film, starring Joel McCrea in the title role and the lovely Veronica Lake as the girl. Look for Franklin Pangborn, Eric Blore, and William Demarest, too.It's a story based on a successful director's unhappiness with his success, so he sets out to bum around America in a search for real life. The director, named Sullivan, plans on making a movie called \"O Brother Where Art Thou,\" and if you've seen that movie (by the Coens), you'll recognize the chain gang scene in \"Sullivan's Travels.\" \"Sullivan's Travels\" could have been a typical \"Common Man\" movie of the Depression Era, but something brings it up a notch. McCrea is excellent, and the script (by Sturges) refuses to show common men as noble brutes and stereotypes. I can see why the Coen Brothers called their insane take off of The Odyssey \"O Brother Where Art Thou\" and paid homage to \"Sullivan's Travels.\" There never has been a Common Man.As with \"The Lady Eve,\" Sturges here is relentless in his comedy, but \"Sullivan's Travels\" has more of an edge as Sturges contrasts wealthy studio execs with working class stiffs in the real America. Naturally for Sullivan, everything that can go wrong does, he ends up in prison, then gets the girl. But pay attention. Sturges pays respect to the underclasses as few other directors did during the Thirties and early Forties.If you want to see the glorification of the Common Man, watch Gary Cooper in \"Meet John Doe\" (or just about any other Frank Capra movie). If you want to see another Sturges movie and like screwball comedies, see \"The Lady Eve\" with Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck (and Blore and Demarest). And if you haven't seen \"O Brother Where Art Thou,\" by the Coen Brothers, be sure to.NOTE: Eric Blore's death caused the funniest situation I've ever heard of regarding a death. An article in \"The New Yorker\" magazine referred to \"the late Eric Blore.\" Blore's lawyer wrote in advising that the report was premature and asking for a correction. \"The New Yorker\" was famous for its accuracy, and this was it's first correction ever. Ever. The author of the article wrote an apology which was prepared for the next issue, printed and ready for delivery on a Monday. Blore died Sunday night. Monday morning, the daily papers plastered his death and obituary all over the place, while \"The New Yorker\" went on sale apologizing for any inconvenience caused by the erroneous report of his death.",

            "content": "(It sounds like \"pants\" but they're actually saying \"plants\". I know, I heard \"pants\" too the first time and it does sound funnier that way).I do remember the first time I saw this movie, I was surprised to actually see some of the filming had been done outside. It was odd seeing some of these people in natural sunlight. I was always accustomed to all films made before the 1960s were filmed inside in a studio and had that \"un-natural light\" look about them.It's also interesting to how movies were made back then and now. From a book on this movie's script it says Preston Sturges wrote the screenplay from February 1941 to April 1941. Filming began in May and lasted until July. The finished film premiered in January 1942. That's very fast. From beginning to end in about 11 months! The book also mentions some scenes that were taken out: One where Veronica Lake's character sits sadly on a bench near the grave of John Sullivan, the leading character who she believes is dead. They should have left that scene in; it helps again show the honest affection her character had toward John Sullivan.I like the combination of Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake and out of all the attractive leading ladies over the past say 70 years, Veronica's looks have aged very well. Actually the biggest flaw of this film is its futile attempt to have us believe Veronica Lake could be made to look like a boy and no one would question it. Good luck! Please read the other reviews for this film on this Web page; they'll all good. And if you don't believe me that this is a good 1940's film then just read what the clown `tork0030' (2/8/2001) has to say.",

            "content": "All in all, \"Sullivan's Travels\" was a movie I enjoyed watching but I also had some issues with it. The movie changes its style and tone too often and toward the end the movie is sort of 'loosing' it.The movie begins as such a fun and adventurous movie, with a great story that showed even more potential. But it's more than a fun movie its also a clever one, that is multiple layered. For instance the movie can also been really watched as one about learning about yourself and live, when a successful Hollywood director goes undercover as an hobo to learn what it means to get in trouble and to live with no help from anyone and without all the money, so he can direct a tough drama he has set his mind on.But the movie in the end is all about laughing and being happy. The movie is an homage to those who makes us laugh, which comes across a bit odd to me honestly. Seriously why dedicate a movie to a thing like that? Perhaps it was because there was a world war going on at the time? I don't know but it just seems like a silly thing to me.So the movie has two contrasts in it, happy silly comedy and some tough serious drama with a message to it. I must say that this approach works out fine for most part of the movie but toward the end the movie is sort of loosing it, when its story starts to make some rather awkward turns and the comedy almost completely disappears out of the movie.It nevertheless remains a well written movie, with also some fine comical dialog in it. I love '40's movies for often featuring this style of dialog. It becomes a huge part of the movie its comedy itself. But also the psychical comedy itself is great, though I wish the entire movie was more like its first 20 minutes or so. That way this movie surely would had been one of the most amusing ones I have seen in my life.Joel McCrea is a rather unknown actor and one that acted mostly in western's throughout his career but he is really great in this movie. He looks something like the young Paul Newman but of course acts in a more comical way as he does. He was real fine in this movie and it's a bit of a shame that he never really fully broke through as an actor, or won any big important awards during his career. He worked more with director Preston Sturges after this movie but not even he could lift him to stardom.Veronica Lake was surely one beautiful woman but her acting at times sort of tends to get annoying. She gets her cheeks tightly together when she speaks, or at least she sounds like that. Oh well, at least her looks really saves her performance and ensures that she is a pleasant addition to this movie.A real mixed bag this one. On the one hand it's a real pleasant and entertaining movie to watch and on the other a bit too serious in parts and perhaps a bit too heavy handed.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "I came upon \"Sullivan's Travels\" quite by accident, in the list of DVDs at my public library system. At first I thought it was a documentary. I had never heard of writer/director Preston Sturges, but now I want to seek out more of his work. The DVD (2001) is especially nice because of the very clear picture, but also the several \"extras\" which includes a 76-minute feature on Sturges himself, and how he changed movies forever. He is credited with introducing \"irony\" into film, and the snappy, humorous dialog that was his trademark.  He was also the first \"writer\" that was allowed to \"direct\" his own film. His window of success was very narrow, spanning only a few years, but it was significant.following comments contain SPOILERS - do not read before seeing the film.\"Sullivan's Travels\" can be seen as a fictional account of Sturges' own experiences. Wanting to make a drama based on the poor and oppressed (OH Brother, Where Art Thou?), Sullivan's handlers convinced him he did not have the life experiences for that. So he (Joel McCrea)set out to get them, dressed up as a bum, accompanied by pretty and down on her luck actress (petite and pretty Veronica Lake). Through an unexpected turn, he ends up in jail, sentenced to 6 years of labor, while all his associates thought he was dead, killed by a train. But it was a bum they found, maimed by a train, who had stolen Sullivan's shoes.Sullivan's transformation came while attending a \"movie\", chained to other prisoners, at a local black church. It was a Mickey Mouse cartoon and, as he observed all the prisoners laughing, realized that comedy was needed, not another drama about the oppressed. Real life Sturges realized the same thing, and his efforts changed movie making.So, how to get out of prison and back to movie making?  He pleaded guilty to having murdered Sullivan (himself), apparently solving the mystery. He knew that would get his picture in the paper and, sure enough, his pretty girl recognized him, he was freed, and returned to movie making with comedies. He had been married, only for tax purposes, in a scheme by his former manager. His \"wife\" had already remarried and the potential scandal freed him to be with his pretty friend, forever!In many respects this film was as important to film making in general as \"Citizen Kane\" was.  It is black and white, the shooting and editing are crisp, the dialog is smart. Morality was different back then, as the main characters did not even consider an intimate relationship, even though Sullivan's marriage was a sham. An example of the smart dialog, a play was being discussed and mentioned that it didn't run very long in Pittsburgh. One actor mentioned \"Don't you think people in Pittsburgh know what they like?\" Sullivan replied, \"If they did, they wouldn't stay in Pittsburgh.\" We may take that kind of humor for granted today, but in 1941 it was revolutionary. This has to be considered a \"must see\" for anyone interested in the history of film and its evolution.",

            "content": "An ambitious mix of comedy and social comment, Preston Sturges' fine film works so well in my opinion just because it so often confounds expectations as it progresses, but still carrying the viewer along with it each step of the way. Yes, occasionally it gets a little slow and over-serious in the middle but Sturges is trying to out over some serious points about caring capitalism, in particular society's outlook towards the poor, the incarcerated and blacks and can be forgiven for occasionally dotting the \"i's\" and crossing the \"t's\" with his crusading zeal.It starts paradoxically with an ending, an allegorical fight to the death between capital and labour, as luridly directed by what we'd today call a rom-con director of hit movies, played by Joel McCrae, keen to show his serious-side and exercise his social conscience. His bluff is called by his producer and associate who both mock his wish to make a film celebrating the disadvantaged in society and challenge him to live it before he films it. Initially, a film crew is hired to film his every move as he dresses down and seeks to temporarily become a hobo, however with the help of quite literally a boy-racer, he outpaces them and leaves his pursuers in a heap in his wake. So far, so typical screwball-comedy.However, as the slapstick and wisecracking are more or less gradually moved out the way, Sturges vision grows darker with McCrae finally thinking he's on a level with his subject and ready to film it, until real-life events, in the form of a crack on the head from a greedy tramp who robs him while he's in the act of patronisingly distributing largesse to the local down-and-outs, which sees him end up convicted of his own \"death\" and condemned to hard labour on the chain- gang. Of course he eventually extricates himself from his plight but chastened by his experience, he eschews the moribund preachy fable in favour of the light comedies to the better lift spirits.McCrae is excellent in the lead role and gets a great foil in his travels with the diminutive Veronica Lake in a breakthrough role as the hard-bitten wannabe actress who likewise forgoes her relative comfort and privilege to join him on his walk on the wild side. They make a fine pairing which really is the long and the short of it. Behind them are Sturges' crew of stock actors, giving able and intuitive support. Sturges' direction is frequently imaginative and occasionally gets the pacing wrong but his central moral of charity and brotherhood emerge intact by the end of this warming and disarming feature.",

            "content": "For us in the 21st century watching Preston Sturges's \"Sullivan's Travels\", probably one of the most eye-opening things - if not THE most - is that the main character wants to make a movie called \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\", which Joel and Ethan Coen brought to the screen two score and nineteen years later. While merely one aspect of this movie, it offers an important glimpse into the fascinating world that the film creates.Here's the idea: movie director John Lloyd Sullivan (Joel McCrea) tires of making escapist flicks - starring Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and Mary Martin* - and decides that he wants to make the sort of movie that Charlie Chaplin would make. However, Sully knows nothing about poverty and suffering, having grown up quite affluent. So, he figures that he'll become a hobo for a while to learn about that life. But when he meets a certain woman (Veronica Lake), his life takes a turn that he never would have predicted.How do we interpret this movie? Well, apparently Preston Sturges had a rather patrician upbringing like Sully had; maybe Sturges wants to portray what would constitute at the same time a great ambition but also a great fear...and he makes it funny! I personally interpret the movie sort of like \"Easy Rider\", as both movies portray people going out in search of a side of America which they've never seen (of course, the potential similarities between the two films would likely end there). It's also worth noting that Sturges pushed the screen's sexual limits slightly: while he couldn't show Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake sleeping in the same bed together, he shows them sleeping next to each other in a train car (because how could any man not want to get slinky with Veronica Lake?).No matter what the movie's real gist is, we can't deny it's status as an important part of movie history, a look at our country as we were just coming out of the Depression and about to enter WWII. It's certainly one that I recommend.*Speaking of Mary Martin, I know that this isn't really related, but I wonder what the people making this movie would have thought had they known that Mary Martin's son would later play an astronaut with a really hot genie.",

To me, Sullivan's Travels has to rival The Lady Eve as his best work. In Eve, he had two of the greatest actors ever to grace the screen together in a script full of farce and scintillating dialogue. Here, there is a sublime story of Hollywood director who goes on a journey as a hobo to experience the hardships of American life in order to make a movie about it. He's tired of making comedies, complaining that they don't mean anything to anybody. Along the way, he meets the short, yet stunning Veronica Lake and experiences a chain of events like no other.This is a serious comedy, yet there is so much to laugh at and be moved by. Surely Sturges wanted the audience to laugh at certain scenes, and also be touched by others, such as the scene in church where they are watching a vintage Disney cartoon.

The real focus of this film is one man: Sullivan, good-hearted, but willful, self-centered, and clueless, and the lessons of the film really apply to him.

Gallantry, perhaps, but also very practical - would you answer for the safety of a homeless Veronica Lake? One of the lessons that he doesn't learn that disappoints me a tiny bit is that bad things *can* happen to film directors - once he makes himself known, all troubles disappear.  There's reality in that, but it lacks a bit of the morality of the rest of the pic. I love this movie dearly, it must be one of the best of all time for sheer meaning and humor and memorableness, and the scenes in the black church for their startling beauty and grace.  God forgive me for a clueless racist, but I thought those sequences were very human and moving, not stereotyped.",

            "content": "Oddly enough, in my view, the most negative thing about this picture is that the studio wanted to build up Veronica Lake (who apparently was born in the Valley Of Little-Talent), although it is clearly Joel McCrae's picture.The film begins with great promise with an exciting start that is the end (you'll understand when you watch it). Then, its early scenes are marred by talking that is way too fast, but it soon settles down in terms of its dialog. There's a hilarious chase scene that literally made me laugh out loud. Then, McCrae is trapped by and over-the-hill woman, and that segment is very funny, as well.In my view, the film goes downhill when Veronica Lake comes into the picture...sort of reminding me of one of the themes of the film -- there always has to be a beautiful woman. It's almost an hour into the film when McCrae's character catches up to the poverty he is seeking to learn about (unfortunately with Lake in tow). The Great Depression is just ending, although this film taps into that reservoir of sorrow, and does so with some very haunting images.And then, a plot twist occurs which I certainly didn't see coming, and McCrae ends up in prison for 3 years! This is another touching segment, and particularly so in the Black church.But then...almost without warning...comes the ending, and it's back to slapstick, which to me seemed a big mistake. This is the other negative in this film.Along the way you'll enjoy the performances of many character actors.Certainly a classic with some errors.

            "content": "After the phenomenal \"The Lady Eve\", Preston's next achievement slightly disappointed me. The adventures of a rich director who tries his hand at the life of a hobo, in order to be able to make a film about the hard life of the lowest class from his own experience, are undeniably fun. It is always interesting to watch a film that combines many genres in one story. A mix of screwball and slapstick comedy, social criticism, drama, prison film, thriller, and romance sounds like a fun idea, but it is very difficult to make it work. The atmosphere of the film changes radically several times, to the extent that it gives the impression that we are watching parts of different movies combined into one, and although Veronica Lake, always pleasing to the eye, performed her role well and has chemistry with Joel, to me, this romantic subplot was redundant. At one point, Preston's protagonist, director Sullivan, declares: \"There's always a girl in the picture. What's the matter, don't you go to the movies?\" As \"Sullivan's Travels\" is perhaps primarily a critique of the film industry, I believe that the entire romantic subplot was deliberately made that way, in order to parody this unwritten rule of Hollywood. Although the different genres are roughly blended and the whole thing seems hasty, the film is fun, satire, if not in the center, still hits the target to some extent, and the author must be commended for the courage to bite the hand that feeds him.7/10",

Yes, both the titles are about the journey of self discovery. A well made movie with a fine pair of characters in the lead.John Sullivan, a film director who opposes his producers' idea of making his next feature as a comedy. Instead, he wanted to adapt the famous novel 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' which determines the realistic social issues. So the question arises that how much he's experienced to take the challenging project in the hand. Now he has to discover himself everything before coming to any conclusion. So then the life changing adventure begins till he gets all the answer he wanted with a little twist at the end.It was good to know that the movie with a concept like this was made almost 70 years ago and still looks fresh and original. As expected the adventure I was taking about was not completed in one long ran instead it split into many pieces. That is the thing that irked me the most in few parts of the movie. Otherwise, it would have been a masterpiece according to the my taste in film viewing.I would have liked it better if the story was flavoured with little sentiments in those adventure parts. Although it is a comedy movie which entertains well. But still the last 20 minutes or so were the excellent which also partially reminded the 86th Academy Award winner that based on the true story. In other word the last quarter of the movie was the best part you will find in all over the storytelling.

This time it is because, believe it or not, we hadn't seen it until yesterday, 11/28/14, on Turner Classic Movies.THE STORY STARTS out with a basic premise. Wealthy Hollywood Director, John Lloyd Sullivan (Joel McRea)sets out to truly see how the other half lives by masquerading as a vagrant. Wherever he goes, there is always he extensive support staff in traveling \"studio\"; being a deluxe camper. It appears that this hobo is a rich one.ALTHOUGH SO MUCH of the story is full of Writer/Director Preston Sturges' caustic humour and accompanying sought-gags, th story turns very dark at midway point. It happens that due to a mistaken identity, Director Sullivan is thought to have been killed. He winds up in a Southern prison chain-gang, at which point he appears to be at the real low point of his odyssey.IT IS DURING this stay behind bars that he has his true epiphany. A Congregation and Pastor of a Negro Church invites the prisoners and jailers of the Chain Gang to be their guests a the showing of Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE & PLUTO Cartoon. The uninhibited laughter that permeates all in attendance proves to Sullivan that it is this merriment that is a universal cure to so many ills of the world. He decides that the next movie will be a comedy.BESIDE THE FINE writing and direction by Mr. Sturges, we are treated to the rarity of such a powerful and talented cast. Besides Joel McRea, we have names like: Veronica Lake, Robert Warwick, William Demarest, Franklin Pangborn, Porter Hall, Byron Foulger and Richard Webb.WE MUST CONFESS that our favourite gag involves the widow (Estelle Howard) who hires \"vagrant\" Sulivan to do chores around her house, all the while planning to 6turn him into her own, private \"Boy Toy\". This is explicit and very bold for 1941.IN CONCLUSION, IT appears that Mr. Sturges had a real concern for those less fortunate; but he makes no plea for any sort of socialistic remedies. His approach is more in line with the more personal, heart felt and Christian way.",

The first hour is a series of repetitive toing and froing that leave you presuming this is exactly the light comedy the brilliant opening scene railed against. The next 20 minutes though seemed to have been undertaken by a different director; one capable of crafting a scene with wit, compassion and realism. Then he buggers off again and the first director starts in again. It's a film which seems to have been directed ad hoc then written in the editing room. I know little of the film's history, but you're left presuming there was studio pressure similar to that suffered by Sullivan bearing down on Sturges; that's the only excuse I can find for the almost interminable first hour of knockabout nonsense.",

While I find it overall very good, I think Sturges did better movies like The Lady Eve and The Palm Beach Story. But this is still nonetheless a worthwhile film.I always seem to forget that at one point Joel McCrae was a popular and well respected actor before he was regulated to cheap westerns by the end of his career. But he does a good job in this film. As does Lake, but she is unconvincing as a homeless person. The film is shot well and competently edited. No issues there. I do appreciate the satirical nature of the film. Sullivan wishes to make a powerful and depressing social drama about human suffering. Great! But he's a super privileged white guy whose never been on the streets. Sturges films always seem to poke fun at the rich upper class and we see plenty of that satire here. The screenplay is witty and funny. But I don't really see this film as a comedy. It's seems way to serious for its own good and the chain gang sequences give us little to laugh about. I must say I do like the church sequence. Outcasts Of modern society coming together for a life. Even if I find the message problematic, this scene was well done and very sweet.Honestly, I have a problem with the way it presents poor people. That hasn't aged well. And I have a small problem with the message of the film. Yes, laughter is a wonderful thing and we could all use a good laugh each day. But is laughing gonna pay the bills? No it won't unfortunately. I'd like to know what Sullivan's social drama would have been like honestly.I find it odd that this is the movie that many Sturges fans point as his best. It's quite good, but I personally have to give The Lady Eve That title. That being said, Sullivan's Travels and an interesting film of its era, featuring talent at the height of their abilities.",

Most of the people take themselves very seriously, but like in real life they were actually ridiculous. The supporting cast was good and memorable.

(That was when the rich guys called the railroad to find out where to jump on the train.) There was some poor slapstick. Typical was the swimming pool scene where various people were pushed/pulled into the pool; perhaps hilarious in 1941, but not so much today. The early scene with the bus following the director seems to be here solely for the \"humorous\" chase scene; it adds nothing to the plot, and is not funny, unless watching people get bounced around inside a moving bus for 5 minutes is funny. The initial scenes with Veronica are odd because he basically fails as a hobo (getting arrested and needing help), and then has to entirely start his journey over, and Veronica learns of his true identity; so this adds little to the movie. The movie eventually takes a dark turn when he is put in the southern prison (Cool-Hand-Luke type of joint, including the sweat box). This portion of the \"comedy\" is a little jarring.; quite strange for a comedy to turn dark for 10+ minutes. Then they sort of hit the viewer in the face with some message about the value of comedy movies (versus documentaries, or serious movies). The plot about his wife is very odd too; that they married for tax reasons (really?), and then that she committed bigamy and so she would have to divorce him (probably not accurate).

It's just my opinion, but I don't find Sturges to be particularly funny or probing.  The concept of this film is great and sets up the best aspect of the film, which is the subtext about the naivety of the rich and the struggle of the poor. It's a classic character arch, but it's pulled off with such deft style that we the message is delivered with a smile of your face.  The last act seemed a little over the top, in the bad way.  All those nice little coincidences that fit together perfectly to drive forward the plot.  It's essential to Sturges message, true, but there are other ways he could have take the film through the home stretch.  Also, I guess I was the only one that didn't feel too much chemistry between Lake and McRae.  There relationship was a little stale and never fully realized.If Sturges had made a drama, I think it would have worked beautifully, which is ironic considering the entire point of his film.  If you go in for typical humor along the lines of Howard Hawks, but with a little more depth, this is a great movie for you.

So I was thrilled when Turner Classic Movies decided to air it recently.  This is why I wish I liked it better.Leonard Maltin says in his review that the film blends comedy and sorrow \"seamlessly,\" but I disagree.  The first 30 or 45 minutes of the movie were terrific.  The action was funny, the dialogue was smart and crisp, Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake played off of one another fabulously.

By the time the movie turned into \"I Was a Fugitive from a Chain Gang,\" it had lost me.I give it high marks for its wit, and I certainly wouldn't tell anyone not to see it.

Given, Warner Bros. has always been the studio of the 'working man' and does have more authority on the subject.Paramount seems to understand their precarious position to speak about poverty and what was in fact 'legal slavery' in the chain gang system, as the whole film could be read as a argumentation for the continued production of comedies while the whole world burned: \"Laughing should not be underestimated, for some people it is all they have\". They certainly were not alone in this disposition; Goebbels also made sure comedies kept being made in Nazi Germany to reassure the German public all was well with the Third Reich and the war. Note that I am not trying to compare Paramount to the Nazi media policy, just naming the best example that this argument was used in many countries at the time.The film still shows the major influence religion had on any kind of narrative form, as good deeds are highly rewarded (the charitable girl played by Veronica Lake, the shop owner who gives them free doughnuts and coffee) and those who do evil are severely, and immediately, punished ( the greedy homeless person who robs Sullivan ). Plus African Americans get -what must be rare at that time in the united States, a positive representation, yet only because they are religious; God apparently solved the racial issues (weird how they still seem to exist today, wonder when they came back?).So in all, Paramount could not help those unfortunate victims who suffered the indirect effects of the war, they could at least still make them laugh.",

His satiric scripts and slapstick physical comedy linked together brilliantly in providing equal amounts of high and low humor from beginning to end in films such as The Lady Eve, Miracle of Morgan's Creek and Hail the Conquering Hero. He was a master of keeping things light while making trenchant observations about American society's foibles and hypocrisy. He had you laughing and thinking at the same time. Sullivan's Travels is a prime example of Sturges's unique and enormous talent in his prime.John Sullivan is a very successful director of comedy films. He is disillusioned however by the reality that the Depression lingers and a large portion of American population remains in dire straights. Idealistically he decides to climb down from his ivory tower and hit the road as a hobo to get a real feel for America and perhaps make the Great American film. His producers become alarmed at his naivet\u00e9 and decide to monitor his journey but he evades them and soon finds himself convicted of a capital crime and on a chain gang.Travel's moves at a laugh filled lightening pace before the reality of being down and out on the road creeps in with some brutal desperate situations. Joel McCrae as the obstinately idealistic Sullivan goes from an energized self righteousness to anonymous victim of the times with an impressive transitional believability. Veronica Lake as his sidekick displays a tough and sexy exterior and is a perfect counterbalance to Sullivan's innocence abroad. Sturges stock supporting cast of William DeMaresat, Eric Blore, Porter Hall, Franklin Pangborn and Arthur Grieg as his butler lend solid backing but it is Arthur Hoyt as the minister of an impoverished black community that provides the film its most moving moment with a low key but highly emotional sermon to his flock about acceptance.By film's end Sullivan has come full circle through a series of misadventures to learn what he instinctively knew all along but needed the experiences to become conscious of. It is achieved through Sturges superb balance of comedy with serious undertones without cynicism and preachiness. It effortlessly moves from light to dark and back into the light shining it on the country's woes in a humorously eloquent manner that informs along the way about the infinite importance of laughter. Sullivan's Travels is one powerful screwball comedy well worth the trip.",

            "content": "\"Sullivan's Travels\" (again 1941): Veronica Lake (one of my 40's Babe crushes) had a film career that peaked before I was even born. (It's a DISTANT crush, that's for sure.) She and Joel McCrea (whose comedic sense is not the equal of Lake), star in a pre-WWII, Depression Era story about a millionaire movie mogul who decides to make a \"serious\" but warm movie (\"with a little sex\") \"in the spirit of Frank Capra\" - about the hardships Americans are facing. Convinced by one of his butlers that he knows NOTHING about the real world, he decides to find a \"tramp costume\", and set out for the \"real\" America, with only a dime in his pocket. If THIS wasn't pathetically funny enough, it only gets better, thanks to Veronica Lake, and the director Preston Sturgis. I've always felt Lake did not receive enough credit for her ability to perform comedy as easily as the vampy, noir-ish, blonde. Her timing, reactions, willingness to get down and dirty (literally), etc. is top notch. Sturgis' control makes for a uniquely good looking film, with rapid fire dialog exchanges and overlaps. All THIS, and STILL a \"Capra-esque\" message by the end. What more could you fairly expect?",

This film is very reminiscent of McCrea's 'Meet John Doe'. Also the prison scenes are a reminder of Muny's \"I was a Fugitive of a Chain Gang' and Cagney's \"Each Dawn I Die'. Sturges Oscar winning director gives us another classic. McCrea plays a successful Hollywood director, an idealist who believes you can't direct a screen tragedy until you experience it personally. He disguises himself as a road bum and takes a long trip through the USA to see America from the bottom up. He finds a beautiful but cynical women on the road and they travel together for many interesting adventures. Along the way, the film director learns that what people really need and want is laughter in their daily lives. Because laughter is the only solution to the brutality and despair of life. Fun film with a light hand on giving out to the audience a message.",

There are many relevant indicators incorporated in a fun story. The transition from comedy to serious drama is well directed.Joel McCrea as John L.

However, one fairly low and incredibly charming girl is perfect bearings. Contrast the main actors in any other option (disguised as a tramp or misunderstood director and failed actress) is very good.This movie should not be seen as a cheap promotion comedy.

That's two sentences I ended with prepositions; something that is not recommended for writers. Veronica Lake adds more than a little spice to this production with her smoking hot presence; and she can act as well. The story about a reporter who goes undercover to find out how the other half (the poor) live and cope during The Great Depression is an interesting premise.

That's when he starts screaming things like, \"I want my lawyer!\" and \"They don't put Hollywood directors in a place like this.\"  Of course, no one believes he's a Hollywood director.  It's somewhat tragic to see his plight, but at the same time I was thinking, \"Hey...he wanted to see what it's like to be homeless.\"  At the end, he finally learns that comedy is an underrated resource, and that people as unfortunate as them need comedy in their lives.  Even something as silly as a Mickey Mouse cartoon had them laughing their heads off.  When you're poor and unfortunate, you don't want to go to the movies and see more tragedy; you simply want to laugh.  And that was one of the messages that Preston Sturges was trying to deliver.  The performances are great all-around.  Veronica Lake was one of the most beautiful actresses of that decade, and I loved that first interaction between her and Joel McCrae in the diner.  The dialogue in that scene is sharp and witty.  If you're looking for a good, solid drama that packs a good message and a few good laughs as well, then I would suggest watching \"Sullivan's Travels.\"  My score:  7 (out of 10)",

            "content": "I just saw Sullivan's Travels last week. I wish I had seen it at age 11. Back then, when my mother would take me to New York, I wouldn't photograph the skyscrapers or the Hudson River or Central Park--I would take pictures of abandoned buildings and garbage in the streets. You see, I wanted to capture something \"real.\" I was, in other words, a pretentious little twerp.To a certain extent, so is John L. Sullivan, though I defy you not to fall in love him by the end of this film (and not just because he was played by the--ahem--not exactly unattractive Joel McCrea). He's a privileged Hollywood director whose past credits mainly include lowbrow comedies, but he yearns to do something more meaningful. So he decides to go on the road disguised as a hobo, though the real rail-riders are able to spot the clueless amateur from a mile away.Sullivan's journey takes him in gradually expanding concentric circles. At first, even his best efforts land him right back in Hollywood, and he can't seem to shake the coterie of publicists and caretakers that are always trailing two inches behind him. He even finds himself with an additional hanger-on, a failed starlet played with a sharp, worldly-wise sensibility by Veronica Lake. Eventually, though, Sullivan really does find himself far away from home and in deep trouble. It's one thing to sleep in shelters and rail cars when you know you can always return to your cushy home base; it's quite another when there's no way to escape the cruelties faced by the truly destitute. At this point the film suspends its comedic tone, though comedy will end up playing a crucial role at this dark moment in Sully's life. In the process, he becomes a better man. Sully may have had the best intentions when setting out on his journey, but his utter cluelessness would have made him a pretty unworthy spokesperson for the poor. After getting a taste of what it truly means to suffer, he realizes that the way he can best serve those with nothing is not to wring tears from moviegoers on their behalf, but to lessen their burden a little by making them smile. I hope I haven't been too ponderous about what really is a fantastically funny film, the definition of G.K. Chesterton's quote \"Angels fly because they take themselves lightly.\" I guess that earnest ponderousness is a habit I still find hard to break. Hopefully a few more viewings of Preston Sturges' masterpiece will set me straight.",

The lead characters come across as complete imbeciles *and* the movie insults the ideas it purports to satirize. No insight is provided into the real lives of the poor, and if any insight is provided into the rich, perhaps that insight is more on point: they don't *really* care for anyone other than themselves and have no empathic capacity to feel what it might be like to be genuinely poor.

Sullivan wants to do a serious picture about American society's underclass.

Suddenly, just as the trip is to wrap up, Sullivan encounters an event that disrupts everything and sends him on a genuine journey through hard scrapple America's prison farm system.

We learn he is a wealthy film director who longs to make a film about suffering. Thing is though, he is so privileged he needs to be reminded he has never actually suffered. So, he decides to travel with nothing but the clothes on his back to discover what it is like for himself. Although it has some faults I still thought it had a charm to it and I liked the movie for what it was. I did not love it and here is why.The problem here is this is the film itself unfortunately and quite ironically can't quite grasp poverty at all much like Sullivan's rather failed attempt to live incognito at the start of the movie. The film perceives poverty through the eyes and lives of the American middle and upper class characters. Because of this we see \"poor\" Sullivan living amongst the undesirables and less fortunate. That is until of course things get too uncomfortable, then his privilege comes into play and he is saved, time and time again. Sure, we have the church epiphany scene near the end but it comes across as superficial and out of place. In the end Sullivan is \"enlightened\" and decides he can do his part to help those in need. His answer? Comedy. Making Hollywood comedies that the true underclass and poverty ridden members of society would in no way be able to afford to see.The first half and second half of the movie are polar opposites. Which I quite enjoyed actually. My only criticism here is that the comedic first half would've been better downplayed with more subtlety rather than full-on slapstick. The pool gag for example was very predictable and silly. The Pluto scene in the church with over-exaggerated laughter felt forced and overdone which was a shame since it is a pivotal part of the story and Sullivan's journey.Did Sullivan learn about suffering? Hard to say. He was rescued at every turn. At least it all worked out in the end though. Well, at least it did for Sullivan and co. The poor were still poor. But at least the upper classes were going to get a new comedy and Sullivan got out of his unhappy marriage and doesn't need to send his wife money any more. The end.. I guess?",

Sturges' masterpiece, this is one of my favorite films and I rate it 10. A director of comedies wants to direct a \"serious\" movie about the plight of the common man, so he decides to do research disguised as a hobo. Complications, of course, ensue. The last half hour is stunning. I can't recommend this enough.",

            "content": "Intelligently directed with a confident, strong hand by Sturges with a delightful screenplay that blends irony, with just the right splashes of farce, humor, wit, romance and moments of real pathos and tragedy, this one tugs at your heart strings and still leaves you with an uplifting feeling that's hard to resist or forget.Sturges avoids sentiment and sassiness, though the film has elements of both and characters with each, but things never get mushy, heavy handed or didactic. Instead we get clever wit and humor in abundance. McCrea's understated, dry performance carries this one. He has an air of dignified charm and inherent goodness about him whether dressed in a suit, bathrobe, or tattered clothing, scrambling onto a moving train, caught with chains on his feet or falling into a swimming pool. I loved the chemistry and relationship between the vibrant Lake & McCrea, the montage of the two as homeless wanderers, the significance and symbolism of feet in the film, and a wonderful moment of surprise when a man who steals money from Sullivan, driven by greed and poverty meets an unexpected, tragic fate. As Sullivan wanders, loses and later finds his way, the film takes on a slightly graver tone, but Sturges balances the serio-comic with ease and doesn't lose control of his storytelling. The dark and light, the high and low, the rich and poor, black and white, love and divorce, life and death and all those wonderful opposing pairs of contradictions in the narrative that really reflect the very fabric of human existence find a eureka moment in a scene in a church where criminals in chains, men of god, common folk, men, women, strangers and children find something common to laugh at; Disney's MICKEY MOUSE. \"There's a lot to be said for making people laugh. Did you know that's all people have? It isn't much but it's better than nothing in this cockeyed caravan\". Amen sir, to that.",

But \"Sullivan'sTravels\" is a wonderful film.

This may have been fine for strictly comedic roles (similar to Leslie Nielson), but the roles in this movie mixed comedic banter with serious conversation to the point where I was never sure if a statement should be taken seriously or as a joke.

            "content": "I am a big fan of Preston Sturges and the movies with which he was involved as writer and preferably also as director. In particular, the eight movies that he directed from his own scripts between 1940-44 are all great, and four of these have the touch of brilliance.I'm sure that all fans of Sturges would closely agree, but whereas \"Sullivan's Travels\" is seen by some as possible the best of the bunch, that's not MY personal feeling. To me, this is a movie with much to savour in the wonderful characters and dialogue, but there are also elements with which I am not so comfortable.The big turning point of the movie is when Sullivan is declared dead and ends up in a convict barracks sentenced to six years hard labour. I find it impossible to disregard the big problem with the plot point that leads to Sullivan being declared dead... The tramp who robs Sullivan of his money is run down by a train and mistaken for Sullivan. Why??? Because he is the same tramp that stole Sullivan's boots earlier in the movie, which had Sullivan's ID card in them.Too much of a coincidence!! And in the film it is not even clear that it is the same tramp. The original shooting script does make that clear, but it must have been too difficult to convey that on screen in scenes that take place at night in an dark train-yard. I'm sorry... but that kind of problem with the narrative distracts me from enjoying a film.Also - and this my main bugbear - the combination of wild witty comedy with downbeat drama doesn't fit my idea of entertainment. I can hardly stand to watch the scenes showing the hard life of tramps and other homeless, many of whom are grotesques. I start to wonder who all these extras are. Where do they find people who look like that? Are they actors pretending to be tramps, or from a modelling agency... or what? You can tell that these are not the thoughts of somebody absorbed by the story being told on screen.Give me the wild fantasy of \"The Palm Beach Story\" or the witty romance of \"The Lady Eve\" any day!",

Like a sarcastic comedy from the time of economic depression in the States, throughout lands and small towns and a lot of adventures. If this message at the time indeed it was considered often as a clue of understatement very funny from the character of the artist preparing the next movie, hearing people as aim that it payed its costs in self-esteem by return, also it was in itself from a movie for snubbing quite the studio's system. And questioning as tramp the function of previews, that mutilated many artistic moving pictures - creating a masochist complex in every register at the time - and surveys from publicity of the stars, in which the promotion of a story was made even before the shootings should be thinking as begun. Also the lack of ideas obliging the main character coming out of the entertainment cycle for opening his mind, it was still as though such a sincerity would be the crazy touch of reality and searching quite in himself the crisis of his own sad destiny as consumer of fame and unknown flavor after all simultaneous adventure. Too much criticism and a bitter conclusion concerning the collateral responsibility of the director in unstable relationship with the movie goers as synthesis of this tale.Linking in this original fake study's case the main actor, as the same portrait of the own director, in a new kind of under genre of realistic junction with less burlesque and more integrity as pattern of acting in family, like in careless and nowhere people of the road as in the art's comedy own tradition and origin from the sidewalk in a kind of no man's land during the immediate previews of war times. And what other people - as the real tramp in the story menacing the fake tramp as the place of the director in it - in his name thought about himself, disguised as an unemployed migrant of the style of living without making anything more than attracting the attention from the severe authorities. Therefore, which putted such individual under surveillance because certainly he was crazy and less funny that he imagines, concerning likewise a potential agitator in him by his travels across misery at the time.",

But watching it for the first time today in many years, I was surprised how difficult it was to get involved. It seemed to stop and restart so many times that I got impatient.

Sturges' direction is fascinating and engaging as he opens Sullivan's Travels with a rooftop train fight, into witty banter, then proceeds into serious poverty drama, and all manner of other scenarios. Stuart Gilmore's editing keeps Sullivan's Travels down a sleek 91 minutes of all laughs and tears with quick cuts around all the action straight to the humor. Preston Sturges' writing is quite clever and sincere as he openly mocks how Hollywood wants to be seen as artistic and trying to change society, while allowing for the reality of audiences preferring the simple pleasure brought by comedies and laughing collectively.\n\n Sturges concludes that the catharsis of viewers laughing together during comedies is greater in the immediate nature of moviegoing compared to pretentious and depressing dramas for the simple fact that people like to see comedies more. The comedic relief from comedies is an escapist fantasy to deliver viewers from their low wages, poor jobs, and scarce lifestyles. But, Sullivan's Travels proves that getting the viewer to laugh is as significant as a drama making the audience cry in despair.\n\nJohn F. Seitz' cinematography looks great for all the different wide shots needed to capture a blistering car chase to homeless people standing in line at the food banks in order to survive. Seitz captures it all. Charles Bradshaw and Leo Shuken's score is perky for all the silly comedy, ravishing for the romance, and heartfelt during the serious moments of reflection. Wally Westmore's make-up delivers one ethereal beauty for Veronica Lake's face to gritty mud on Joel McCrea's hobo look. Edith Head's costumes for Veronica Lake are dazzling with diamonds and flowing robes. Head's style is immaculate and makes the already gorgeous Lake all the more dreamy and memorable.\n\nVeronica Lake is stunning from the first moment she appears on screen. Lake steals the entire film with her fearless line delivery, sultry personality, mysterious persona, playful flirting, fun actions, and hilarious sense of humor. Veronica Lake could not possibly have been a bore as she lights up the screen with more than her iconic peek-a-boo haircut, but also her bubbly whimsy and endearing wit. I adored Veronica Lake in Sullivan's Travels.\n\nLook, Joel McCrea is funny, charming, and lively in Sullivan's Travels as he goes from absurd slapstick, ridiculous banter about the importance of movies, to tender romance with Lake, then to heartfelt empathy for the poor. However, see Sullivan's Travels for Veronica Lake's daring forwardness, unforgettable charisma, classic beauty, and sweet charm.",

I can't say that the two halves are particularly well reconciled even if they are meant to explicitly contrast (they feel like two different films), but each has its own merits. Despite explicitly poking fun at Capra a bit, the film has some real power in its naive early charm and storyline that somewhat echoes the beloved director. I'm convinced that much of the film's reputation is based on its contemporary depiction of Hollywood, and later generations of critics and producers that love to recognize Sullivan's combination of self-loathing and creative genius in themselves.

Things don\u0092t go exactly as planned, which makes for a comedy of errors. I found myself laughing a lot at the many attempts to leave Hollywood that just kept leading him back, but the funnier part was the snappy banter between all the characters. Veronica Lake joins Joel McCrea for a good portion of the film, and their back-and-forth dialogue is a huge highlight for me.\n\nI suspect that Sullivan\u0092s Travels was self-referential in many places, it seemed Preston Sturges (the director of this movie) was speaking through the story. The script asks a big question about what the world needs in difficult times. Do we long for the dark truth of our situation to be shown in film, or do we want the release of a hearty laugh? This is a timeless question that would be relevant in a film from any era. And frankly, I think this movie decides the answer to that big question is exactly the answer I would give, but I won\u0092t spoil that for you here.\n\nThere was very little that wasn\u0092t a huge success for me in Sullivan\u0092s Travels. I found the acting from all the cast to be spot on, the script was funny and touching, and the look of the movie was good. If I were to start nitpicking details I might call out some of the montages as being a little too long, and the more serious tone of the third act was a little off from the tone of the rest of the film. However, I don\u0092t really want to look at the negatives in this movie. I had so much fun with Sullivan\u0092s Travels, and I\u0092m willing to bet it will become a favorite when I watch it more in the future (and I will be watching this one again, without question.)",

Sullivan who wants to make a picture about the down-and-out and their plight (to be called \"O Brother Where Art Thou?\") but he realizes that he hasn't actually known poverty and trouble himself.  So, he decides (in bad taste) to go undercover as a tramp to see what the life is really like and when he runs into broke but aspiring actress Veronica Lake, she joins him. It takes a while for the studio to let him go and a large detachment of personnel - errr, character actors -- are sent in pursuit if and when trouble does descend. But getting there is basically all the fun in this film and when McCrea and Lake actually do meet the destitute, the film gets a bit gloomy.  But Sturges pulls us out of it okay, with his usual ridiculously unbelievable plot mechanics and a grand wink about how no one really wants message films -- they just want to laugh to forget their troubles.

It is classified as a comedy, has few elements of a drama and adventure, but mainly wants to be a satire about a movie director, played by Joel McCrea, who longs to make a socially relevant drama! The title is supposed to be a reference to Gulliver's Travels, the famous novel by Jonathan Swift about another satirical journey of self-discovery. I am not as impressed as most of the people who saw this movie, but it must be significant when it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea), a popular young Hollywood director fresh from a string of very profitable, but shallow comedies, tells his studio boss, Mr. Lebrand (Robert Warwick), that he is dissatisfied and wants his next project to be a serious exploration of the plight of the downtrodden, to be based on the socially-conscious novel O Brother, Where Art Thou? by Sinclair Beckstein. Of course, Lebrand prefers that he directs lucrative comedy instead. Idealistic Sullivan refuses to give in, and decides to go out in the world to \"know trouble\" first-hand as a tramp so he can return and make a film that truly depicts the sorrows of humanity. People close to him openly question the wisdom of his plan. With only 10 cents in his pocket, Sullivan dresses as a hobo and takes to the road. However, no matter how hard he tries, somehow he always ends up back in Hollywood. Luckily, in time of trouble, he meets a young failed actress (Veronica Lake, credited only as \"The Girl\") who had enough of Hollywood is contemplating quitting the business...\r\n\r\nI understand why Sullivan's Travels was not as immediately successful at the box office as earlier Sturges films such as The Great McGinty and The Lady Eve, and also received a mixed critical reception - it is clearly divided into separate parts which I call the Yo-yo story (which helps the character to feel like a yo-yo, going back to the riches and then back to the street). At the time the reputation of the movie wasn't great and my biggest complaint even now is that lacks down to earth quality and sincerity which made the director's other three pictures a really enjoyable experience.

Yes, both the titles are about the journey of self discovery. A well made movie with a fine pair of characters in the lead.\n\nJohn Sullivan, a film director who opposes his producers' idea of making his next feature as a comedy. Instead, he wanted to adapt the famous novel 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' which determines the realistic social issues. So the question arises that how much he's experienced to take the challenging project in the hand. Now he has to discover himself everything before coming to any conclusion. So then the life changing adventure begins till he gets all the answer he wanted with a little twist at the end.\n\nIt was good to know that the movie with a concept like this was made almost 70 years ago and still looks fresh and original. As expected the adventure I was taking about was not completed in one long ran instead it split into many pieces. That is the thing that irked me the most in few parts of the movie. Otherwise, it would have been a masterpiece according to the my taste in film viewing.\n\nI would have liked it better if the story was flavoured with little sentiments in those adventure parts. Although it is a comedy movie which entertains well. But still the last 20 minutes or so were the excellent which also partially reminded the 86th Academy Award winner that based on the true story. In other word the last quarter of the movie was the best part you will find in all over the storytelling.

Sullivan, a movie director with itchy feet who - like Swift's Gulliver - is off on a voyage, both in literal terms, and in the terms of self-discovery.  McCrea was one of the most prolific of Hollywood's stalwarts (appearing in over 90 films in 50 years), yet even he turned down the chance to work with his \"Sullivan's Travels\" leading lady again.\n   To wit: \"Life is too short to make two movies with Veronica Lake.\"",

And yes, she is simply \"The Girl\". Ain't pointing this out to \"blame\" Sturges or his studio or accuse them of abject misogyny or anything, but it's interesting to see such regressive values in full view, despite the movie's otherwise good intentions. Also I find the central thesis of the movie a biiiiiit problematic - it takes the argument of art-as-charity, intended to pacify, rather than incite or inform, the marginalized and oppressed. Not that I don't think escapism has its place, but again, it's just interesting to such a self-aware movie kinda lack awareness on a deeper level.",

So unsurprisingly, the investors and producers will not buy it, then Sullivan decides to experience all the \"troubles\" which unfortunately elude him since clearly his life is too pricey to provide him with the adversity of the huddled mass.\n\nHere is the compromising plan, he puts on an act as a poor guy with only 10 cents in the pocket, and the film studio sends an 8-men crew to (not so stealthily) follow him and records his adventure, which will be compiled as a front-page story for the media and publicity, a great mutual benefit trickery only it sounds a tad highfalutin, paraphrasing a sentence from the film \"People always like what they don't know anything about it\", Sullivan is a lucky bastard born with a golden spoon in his mouth! Anyway, there he goes, it starts as a slapstick comedy, when he meets the girl (a 19-year-old Lake), who fails to have a crack into Hollywood, the film morphs into a romantic screwball, Lake is a fabulous stunner, and much to my surprise, her diminutive figure does stand for a little boy in her tramp outfit alongside a husky McCrea, and together they showcase some heavy scored silent montages of their improvised life with tramps, an apparent tribute to Chaplin. \n\nThen the film veers its trail with a mood-changing malevolence, the do-gooder has to learn a lesson for his own naivety towards the lower stratum's spite, after the courtroom hubbub with a hazy and distorted images, Sullivan has to undergo a diabolic spell in a prison camp where he will finally find what people really want to see and it is sardonically at a black people's church. \n\nDuring the viewing, there was an impulse pushing me to want to love this film more, but eventually it failed, the story is an oversimplified product of one's wacky imagination, the overall tone never cease to patronize the poor mass, the ending is too gratuitous to feel the empathy, a 7/10 is out of my respect to Sturges' cachet, anyway it is an taxing tale to spin, even for Sturges.",

Joel McCrae stars as a comedy film producer who is tired of making silly comedies and musicals for his studio. He wants to make films of social significance with a message about the troubles in today's world so he disguises himself and travels as a hobo to gather material for his next picture, a social statement about poverty.  This is one of Veronica Lake's more appealing roles in her first feature role, although her character has no name other than \"The Girl\", as McCrae's traveling companion.  Together, the two possessed excellent chemistry together.\n\nThe supporting cast includes Robert Warwick, William Demarest, Franklin Pangborn, Porter Hall, Byron Foulger, Margaret Hayes, Robert Greig and Eric Blore were great as Sullivan's hangers on who repeatedly try to rein him to Hollywood, if for no other reason than their own selfish interests. \n\nAfter a lighthearted combination of drama and humor through much of the film, the film gets surprisingly dark in the last 20 minutes as McCrea goes through some very, very tough times. \n\nSullivan's Travels is a very funny film with the appeal of Lake, witty comedy, while not being one of Hollywood's ham fisted attempts at making a movie with a message. A movie which can be watched by all - essential for those lovers of classic cinema.  Overall, this Preston Sturges-directed movie is good stuff and a classic film that deservedly still has a solid reputation.",

Sullivan's Travels, which is probably his most famous film, leaves a lot of impact, the biggest being The Coen Brothers making O Brother Where Art Thou because of this movie.\n\nTired of making comedies such as \"Ants in Your Pants of 1939\" during Great Depression-America, Hollywood director John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea, who also teamed up with Sturges in The Palm Beach Story), intends to make a film about human suffrage, called \"O Brother Where Art Thou\" (recognize the title?). Since Sullivan hasn't been poor in all his life, he leaves the rich life of Hollywood and lives out as a hobo to understand what being poor is all about.  When he meets a fallen actress (Veronica Lake), Sullivan gets more than he bargained for.\n\nSullivan's Travels is full of comedy. Sullivan gets knocked down into his pool, gets involved in a crazy car chase with a bus full of news reporters, who are on to his story, and gets allergic to hay while hitching a ride on a train. But, Sullivan's Travels is more than just a comedy.  There's also heavy dramatic material in the film. There's a lengthy sequence involving Sullivan and Veronica's experience with other hobos and a tragic scene where Sullivan is put to work in a chain gang after a case of mistaken identity. While drama can sometimes ruin a piece of comedy film, such as Groundhog Day, in Sullivan's Travels, the drama really works. Sullivan wanted to make a film about human suffrage, and we needed to see the trials he had to face in order to have the experience of human suffrage.\n\nAs far as casting goes, Joel McCrea is fantastic as Sullivan, and was more moving here than he was in The Palm Beach Story. Veronica Lake, meanwhile, is not only attractive, but also manages to have excellent chemistry with McCrea. Robert Greig and Eric Blore play Sullivan's butler and valet, and they did nothing but annoy the pants off of me. All they did was say stupid stuff and attempt to steal the spotlight. Eric Blore as the valet was worse, cause he already annoyed me as the butler in Top Hat, but I have to admit, he was a whole lot worse in Top Hat.\n\nSullivan's Travels is an excellent dramady from Preston Sturges, filled with  spectacular performances from Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake, loads of great comedy and drama, and has lots of heart. With my experience with this film, I enjoy O Brother Where Art Thou even more.",

The director's name is Sullivan (Joel McCrea), and he is more known for goofy slapstick than dramatic human interest.  He believes himself to be a noble pursuer of truth and justice, but as his butler Burrows points out, dressing up as a bum and hoboing around is something \"only the morbid rich would find glamorous\".  At first, the studio is intent on following him around (in a giant bus, no less) to document this adventure, but he quickly loses them after making a deal to meet up with them later.  Not long after, he's taken in by a girl (Veronica Lake) who buys him a ham-and-egg breakfast as she's on her way east, back home.  Sullivan is attracted to her and wants to make a movie with her, only he's still trying to maintain his incognito status, so as a compromise, he goes home and steals his own car so as to give her a ride to whereever she wants to go (\"Chicago\", she says).  After she discovers his ruse, the girl decides to go along with him on his adventure (\"How can I be alone if you're with me?\" he asks, but to no avail), and the two delve right into the seedy underbelly of America's misfortunes.  Riding the rails, sleeping in flophouses, looking for handouts, as if some great and noble purpose could be distilled from abject misery.  But as with other martyrs, that nobility is never pure, as they could escape their condition at anytime they so choose, he's never really down and out, he still has his millions waiting for him at home, and so the deception is never fully realized as he knows who he is.  Ah, but after he goes back to being Sullivan, and he's clunked over the head and robbed by a hobo and then thrown onto a freight train, well only then does he come to realize the nature of being lowly and without friends.  Sullivan comes to realize the irony of socially conscious films is that they do nothing for the people they purport to defend, that watching a film doesn't change anyone's plight.  The best a film can hope to do for the lowest rungs of our society is take away the burden of life for a little while, take a person somewhere they've never been before, let them laugh and enjoy themselves, even if it's just for a little while.  Throwing their poverty back up in their faces doesn't help them, not even a little bit.",

Sullivan's a rich director who's always had money, but he's tired of making comedies. It's time to make a film about the poor. He needs to make something real, something worthwhile. The studio heads tell him that's impossible for him because he's never had to live as a poor man, so Sullivan decides to go on the streets dressed in old, torn up clothes and only ten cents. The first day he's followed by people from the studio because they want to make sure they don't lose their investment. He jumps in a crazy 13-year-old's car and they fly around, which causes everyone in the bus following him to have a rough time. After they're done he finally gets them to agree to stop following him. That day he works for a woman in her yard then goes out with her at night. He escapes in the middle of the night and jumps onto a truck, only to find himself back in Hollywood again. Sucks to be you, Sullivan. Poor guy can't even get away from his city. While back he meets the girl played by the stunning Veronica Lake. She has the perfect noir sense about her. She could have played every femme fatale and I would have been okay with it. Okay, that might be pushing it, but still you get my point. Anyway, she buys him food and he discovers she wants to be an actress, so in order to repay her he tells her who he truly is after they go to prison because the police think he stole his car. The story goes along, she becomes interested in him, doesn't want to just try to get into pictures, so she follows him on his adventures of being poor. They make up the girl to look like a boy just in case some guy gets any funny ideas. One night Sullivan gets his shoes stolen, which we know is a big deal because the soles of his shoes have his identification card in them. When Sullivan goes out to give poor people money at night he gets mugged and thrown in a train. The mugger gets ran over by a train while trying to pick up all the money he dropped. This turns out to be the guy who also stole his shoes. Since Sullivan's knocked out in a boxcar people believe that the dead body is his since the face is unidentifiable. Here's where the plot gets a little sloppy. Sullivan hits a railroad attendant for badgering him after he gets off the train and winds up in court. Here he doesn't remember his name or what happened. The blow on the head has left him with a bit of amnesia. Because of this he gets a shorter 6 year sentence to a workers camp. This is why even though it seems sloppily put together, it works. He finally gets to see what it's like to be poor and unfortunate. If he acts better he can get more privileges, but no matter what you're always seen as a lesser human being. That's why it's so heartfelt when they go to the black church and watch a movie there with everyone laughing. Sullivan learns what he was supposed to from the start: if he's going to make a movie about poor people he has to know how to do so. They don't want to see a sad film about poor people. They go to films to escape. And only the rich will watch movies about the poor to make themselves feel better. But here's the brilliance: Preston Sturges just made a movie sympathizing with poor people, showing their condition and unveiling some truths not a lot of people want to hear or see. In the end you get Sullivan finding out how to get out of the camp (telling people he's the one who killed Sullivan which gets his picture in the paper) and he finds out his wife is remarried and now he can be with the girl. Most importantly he understands that comedy pictures are worth more than he ever realized. The last shot of Sullivan and the girl mixed with the people laughing in the church almost brought a tear to my eye. Sullivan's Travels is a mostly overlooked film even though it's one of those scripts that overall so brilliant every filmmaker should be trying to learn from it, whether if it's for the message, dialogue, or comedy. This film just works so well.",

However, it is a dark comedy, one of the first of its kind, and should be noted for how gritty and honest it truly is, especially for 1941.  Since I've been watching a lot of classic films lately, it was easy to notice how the \"language\" and \"attitude\" of this film is definitely cutting-edge compared to its contemporaries.  John Sullivan applies the \"method\" manner of film development by taking on the persona of a homeless, every-day man in order to obtain the feel of how his audiences were dealing with real life.

However, in making his picture, Sturges gives us both a wonderfully farcical comedy, a biting satire, and a socially conscious message film all in one. \n\nHow than, would you say, does such a large order fill itself over the course of a 90 minute farce about a Hollywood director who wants to make a picture about suffering?

It's smart and funny in the way the best movies of the 1940s are, combining elements of slapstick physicality with wry witticisms and quick-fire quips. Similarly there is no dead weight being dragged along in the supporting cast, and Joel McCrea's excellent lead performance is only outshined by the radiance of a stunning Veronica Lake in her breakthrough role - even if she is more convincing dressed as a young boy than Ginger Rogers was as a young girl in The Major and the Minor. \n\nSturges is probably best known for The Lady Eve, another brilliant comedy released the same year, but Sullivan's Travels may just surpass it in almost every way. The one thing that prevents the film from being perfect is the final act's dramatic turn, which isn't entirely successful. Taking itself more seriously and taking away the jokes and the girl, it risks losing those who were expecting both right to the end. Still, it's a great story, deftly told, never dull for a second, and it's up there with the best. A tribute to the importance of laughter that succeeds on every level.",

That's no argument.\r\n\r\nSeventy Years Ago in the year 1941 the world was going through utter hell. The Second World War by now had consumed most of Europe, Russia, Africa,  Asia  & The Pacific and was in its full second year of running while in the largely unaffected U.S.A had just gotten over the Great Depression. The U.S.A was yet to suffer firsthand the horrors of the last global conflict which would come towards the end of 1941 on that fateful day in Hawaii on December 7th 1941. Until then the U.S was still in peacetime when Hollywood produced three of the finest movies of all time. These were of course were Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE, John Huston's THE MALTESE FALCON & Preston Sturges' SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS.\r\n \r\nREVIEW # 499: SULLIVAN'S ODYSSEY, A LOOK AT A GREAT HOLLYWOOD FILM.\r\n\r\nMuch like Charlie Chaplin's iconic Tramp and his many comical Odysseys, SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS sees an important Hollywood director of dumb Hollywood comedies called John. L. Sullivan played by Joel McCrea (RIDE IN THE HIGH COUNTRY) who wants to adapt the Novel \"O Brother Were Art Thou?\" a story about poverty and Human suffering to the big screen. After learning from his studio bosses that he knows nothing about trouble, poverty and Human suffering Sullivan hits the road disguised as a Tramp. Sullivan learns an important message about not human suffering but the value of humour, comedy, escapism, and above all the value of laughter. Something that today and over 70 years ago was ever so important in a time of hardship. \r\n\r\n SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS for a comedy from comedic legend Preston Sturges wrote & directed exactly 70 years ago in such a turbulent time is a film of two half's as most people have written about the film. The first half of the film is a light hearted slapstick swipe at the Hollywood system and the second half is a stirring melodrama about poverty, the class divided and something not seen in a Hollywood film of its time depicted African-Americans in a positive light. After seeing this film and reaching the milestones of my 499th, 500th & 501st reviews on this site, I decided it was important to me that one these three reviews would be about a film that had long fascinated me after learning about this 1941 masterpiece. In this special feature length essay-review I'm going to review and explain why SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS is a true masterpiece of comedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLOTLINE\r\n\r\nAfter failing to impress studio Bosses Hadrian & Lebrand with his new movie, director John Sullivan has his heart set on making a film about suffering called 'O BROTHER WERE ART THOU?\". However the studio bosses are reluctant to back the idea, and remind Sullivan how he has never known about suffering over his safe upbringing and cushy life style complete with a wife who serves no better purpose than for a tax break. Sullivan determined to understand what it means to be without name and without a check book decides to dress up like a tramp with no more than 10c in his pocket and hit the road. However everyone including Sullivan's Butlers & the studio are not impressed by the idea. The studio has Sullivan watched by a Caravan filled with doctors, reporters, studio personal and even a cook to make sure no real harm falls upon him. After trying desperately to ditch the caravan Sullivan soon comes to the agreement with the crew that if they let him experience trouble first hand by himself then he will meet back up with them in Las Vegas in a few weeks time. In the meantime Sullivan begins an odyssey, which goes wrong after falling into the clutches of a needy widow and her friend. Sullivan quickly escapes from the Widow's farm and hitches a ride on the back of a truck. Upon the truck stopping in downtown L.A, Sullivan is disheartened that he has ended back in Hollywood.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter getting some breakfast in a rundown diner Sullivan comes across a failed young actress (played brilliantly by Veronica Lake) who complains to Sullivan about how hard it is to make a break in the movie industry. Sullivan becomes friendly with the girl and decides to borrow his own car and drive her home, however the pair end up in jail when Sullivan's butlers realises who the tramp is. The Actress is less than impress that Sullivan isn't the failed filmmaker and tramp he proclaimed to be, but after he explains why he was dress as a tramp the young actress wants to join him on his journey. Despite his reluctant attitude, Sullivan and the girl soon hit the road together and together Sullivan and the girl learn what it is like to be in poverty. In a silent montage Sullivan & The Girl grow closer while travelling across The U.S.A amongst the poor and hungry, upon nearly eating out of the trash Sullivan and The Girl return to the studio crew and a well off lifestyle.\r\n \r\nBut not before Sullivan decides to hand out a pile of cash in disguises as the tramp for one last time to the tramps for what they had shown him. One greedy Tramp assaults Sullivan steals his money, shoes with his I.D cards in the soles and leaves him for dead on a train. The Greedy tramp is soon killed on the rail tracks with the I.D card shoes. After not coming back to the Girl and the studio crew, a search begins for Sullivan which ends up with the wrong conclusion in the city morgue with the dead bum. Sullivan arrives on the train in  a rail-yard somewhere in the deep South of the country were disoriented Sullivan hits a railway yard worker which sees Sullivan being imprisoned for six years on a Southern Chain-Gang.  Sullivan desperately wants to get back to L.A and tries anything to get out of the gang especially after in a Gospel Church amidst a crowd of laughing people, Sullivan learns the value of comedy.  Sullivan decides to claim that he was the killer of the dead Hollywood director John Sullivan in the hope he would get media attention and be freed from the Chain gang.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACTING, SCRIPTING AND DIRECTION.\r\n\r\nThis film has many great performances in this film, from what I have found out about writer-director Preston Sturges is that he is considered the father of screwball comedy. One aspect of Sturges auteur style was that he would give the punch-lines to not always the main characters but rather to the secondary characters. The dialogue such as the excerpt at the start of the review is just amazing and how it's delivered to start with such speed it comes so quick and fast is also amazing. Later in the film Sturges comedic style fades away for a grim social melodrama like the scenes of Sullivan & the girl experiencing the hardships of life on the road, The chain gang sequence and of course the moving church sequence which are all done in a masterful way. \r\n  \r\nThe two performances that I will talk about are of course Joel McCrea & Veronica Lake. McCrea I have seen in another great film and poetic by Sam Peckinpah called RIDE IN THE COUNTRY made in 1962, were McCrea plays an ill fated aging lawman who longs to enter his house justified. McCrea much like in that film is brilliant in this film as John Sullivan. Alongside Veronica Lake who also is just brilliant as 'The Girl\" (because no name is given for her character), both McCrea & Lake are great together.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH SEQUENCE AND ITS HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE \r\n \r\n One of the most celebrated moments in this film occurs deep within the film when the chain gang and Sullivan are escorted into a Black Church to see a movie. After seeing the Minister ask his parishioners that they are going to have a bit of entertainment with people less fortunate than themselves and asking them not to judge them because they are all equal in the eyes of God. The doors open to the chain gang while they shuffle in the parishioners sing GO DOWN MOSES   to them. When the projector starts to screen a Pluto cartoon, everyone in the church is seen laughing together. 70 years after this film was made a scene like this is viewed as a normal thing, however in 1941 for African-Americans to be shown in a respectful light in a Hollywood film was almost alien. For a black people to be shown than anything other than inferiors was common place in most Hollywood films of the time.\r\n\r\n The church sequence in SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS attracted positive feedback from most liberal whites and African- American's.  Preston Sturges received a letter from NAACP secretary Walter White congratulating him for the scene, \"I want to congratulate and thank you for the church sequence in Sullivan's Travels. This is one of the most moving scenes I have seen in a moving picture for a long time. But I am particularly grateful to you, as are a number of my friends, both white and colored, for the dignified and decent treatment of Negroes in this scene. I was in Hollywood recently and am to return there soon for conferences with production heads, writers, directors, and actors and actresses in an effort to induce broader and more decent picturization of the Negro instead of limiting him to menial or comic roles. The sequence in Sullivan's Travels is a step in that direction and I want you to know how grateful we are\".  In a way SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS was one of the first Hollywood films to portray African-Americans in an equal and dignified light, sadly it would take another 15 to 25 years before Hollywood changed for the better. \r\n\r\nOVERALL THOUGHTS  \r\n\r\nSULLIVAN'S TRAVELS as I have mention is one truly great film; in fact its ground breaking portrayal of African Americans, satire of the Hollywood system, and a stirring reminder of the value of laughter makes this film a truly great movie. The only thing this film has denied is a wider audience, which is what it really needs. Personally along with a few other classic films from the 1940's, this film is without a doubt one of my all time favourite movies. My rating is a solid 100% for this great movie.",

            "content": "Perhaps the most iconic role of chic blonde bombshell Veronica Lake ever had, \"Sullivan's Travels\" is yet another\u00a0excellent Preston Sturges comedy that stings more than it makes you laugh, which isn't necessarily a bad thing when it comes to a satirical piece like this one. \u00a0It may not be as hilarious as Sturges' \"other\" 1941 film, \"The Lady Eve,\" but \"Sullivan's Travels\" is a bit more thoughtful, and by the time everything's wrapped up, it raises lots of questions that one wouldn't ordinarily think of.\n\tJoel McCrea, a Sturges favorite, portrays John L. Sullivan, a somewhat successful director that has made a profitable career out of making frothy comedies.  But after a screening of his upcoming film, Sullivan decides to put his career on halt and discover the true nature of human tragedy by living it himself.  After all, the next film he's planning to direct is \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\"\n\tSo he picks up some roughed-up clothes, dirties himself, and hits the road, with his staff tailing him in a luxurious van (much to his dislike).  He picks up a bitter actress (Lake) who's fed up with the phoniness of the movie industrey, and the attractive twosome go on a penniless journey together; they quickly lean that the \"tramp\" lifestyle isn't so bad, as long as you're able to get by.  \n\tMcCrea and Lake are such a smart couple on the screen that it's surprising that behind the screen they loathed each other greatly.\n\tA slinky combination of dry comedy and depression era-esque drama, \"Sullivan's Travels\" keeps the basic Hollywood formula of \"comedy\" in mind and, instead of putting up the good-old usual, it almost examines it. \u00a0And it isn't at all subtle, considering the main character of the film is sick of comedies, and wants to see what the darker sides of life can offer.\n\t\"Sullivan's Travels\" instantly makes you think of the majority of films during wartime, most of them being cute, escapist comedies or Technicolor-laden musical\u00a0spectacles, with just a few that come to mind about real human tragedy. \u00a0But at a time where the nation as a whole NEEDED to escape from all of the hardships of real life, it isn't at all a surprise. \u00a0Who would want to see a sad melodrama during a difficult time? In the end, \"Sullivan's Travels\" is\u00a0almost\u00a0a journey discovering why a simple, fluffy laugh is much more enticing than a tear-jerker.\n\tThis is discovered later in the film, when Sullivan is sent to a labor camp.  The work is largely difficult:\u00a0the \"employees\" have to work in the hot sun all-day, hardly with any breaks. \u00a0Everyone there is miserable, put frankly. \u00a0There's a scene, set around this labor camp, in a church, where all of the workers get the chance to go to \"the picture show,\" as one character puts it. \u00a0Along with the churchgoers, the workers get to see a Mickey Mouse cartoon.  The cartoon takes them away from their hellish life, gives them a good time, and a warm dose of happiness.\n\tIt is such a beautiful scene-- Sturges brilliantly focuses the camera on individual workers' expressions. \u00a0Many of their faces are covered in mud and sweat, but their smiles are huge, and their laughs hide their misery. \u00a0In that moment, Sullivan discovers why tragedy films aren't attractive to anyone, and just a few minutes, the film ends. \u00a0And it couldn't be better.\n\tSturges' writing and directing is 100% perfect. \u00a0This film is so fresh, funny, lovely, touching, and biting that it almost seems surprising that something so feel-good can also be razor sharp. \u00a0\"Sullivan's Travels\" is brilliant.",

Critically panned and not a big commercial success either, it eventually came to be seen as his most accomplished work by future cinemaniacs. \n\nI understand contemporary reviewers' opinion that Sturges doesn't follow his own message: films should be funny, not drown in messages that most people don't understand or care about. The conundrum of course is that making a film with that specific message becomes automatically self-defeating. I admit freely to having had a lot more fun watching that other Sturges film \"The Lady Eve\". But if you don't get hung up in the 'message controversy'\", Sullivan offers a couple of good laughs, a lot of (very fake, as it turned out) chemistry between McCrea & Lake, and some cinematic grand-standing in long sweeping camera shots. \n\nMade in Veronica Lake's heyday, just before she began succumbing to mental illness that saw her become one of Hollywood's more tragic stories, and worthy of a film in its own right (I would actually really like to see that film, provided it's well done and they get a good actress, like Amy Addams perhaps). Lake was 6 to 8 months pregnant over the course of filming, a fact she had not advised Sturges about until her contract was signed, which caused him to nearly assault her. Costume designers did a remarkable job hiding it, since nowhere does she look preggers. When aware of the fact, there's a couple of scenes towards the end of the film, when her characters runs (and falls, not scripted, hearts must have stopped when that happened), in which you can see HOW they hid her belly, but if you wouldn't know that, you'd barely notice. \n\nOther than  her advanced state, McCrea loathed Lake so violently that he refused to star in \"I married a witch\", stating that life is too short to make two films with Veronica. Eventual co-star in \"I married a witch\" apparently agreed, though he found one film too much in hindsight. Lake's talent is often derided, but here I found her compelling, convincing & charming, and since the mutual loathing between the stars, she sure acts her infatuation very well.",

The way he does this is lives like a bum and along the way (in Hollywood of all places) he finds Veronica Lake (\"The Girl\" as she is credited) and its history from there. The film has some fine lines (\"You don't know anything about anything\") and sharp comedy, as well as some beautiful tenderness, exposing the love between McCrea and Lakes' characters plus the emphasis of the hobos' lifestyle. The only critiscm I have towards this film is the first ten minutes, which seem a bit slow and bereaved of laughs, that's all.

World War II broke out shortly before this movie was released and there were suddenly much bigger problems to deal with, much more dire concerns on the public's mind.  \n\nUnfortunate, since this film should have been a huge hit. \"Sullivan's Travels\" became a reflection of a naive pre-war mindset, and its honest attempts to deal with social reform fell on blind eyes.

Joel McCrea plays a big time movie producer who is going to put out a movie about hard times, but what does he know about hard times, so he goes on the road as a hobo, meets Veronica Lake and she joins him on his quest.

But as McCrea and Lake head out into the real world, the laughs get more and more reality-based and then drama takes over as the truth of life in Depression-era America falls on our hapless hero like a ton of bricks.

The second is to have enough cash left over in this pay period to place a half.com order for a few of the ones that are expensive at Best Buy and not available to rent on Amazon. Here's hoping.\r\n\r\nThe order Im picking to watch movies is pretty random. Since I've seen about 1/4 of them before, Im trying to keep those repeats spread out to every 4th movie. Also trying to balance the online vs offline movies. Right now the strategy for picking online movies is to first go for the ones that would be most expensive to otherwise get at Best Buy. Sullivan's Travels would have actually been the most expensive purchase, according to bestbuy.com So its priority was upped and I watched it just now. Wow that paragraph was boring. Sorry, peeps.\r\n\r\nMixed feelings about this one. There were points when I thought it was one of the greatest comedies Ive ever seen, and points when I found it kinda dull. Mostly the good outweighs the bad. The dialogue (which you'll learn is prolly the most important thing in a movie for me) was smart and snappy, especially in some of the opening scenes, which I absolutely loved. But the slapstick that was sprinkled into that was a bit too much for my taste. I think thats because I tend to find visual humor very predictable, whereas quick dialogue is more likely to surprise me. That's also why I like offensive humor, but thats not applicable to this film.\r\n\r\nMy big complaint, however, is that while watching the film, it felt kinda disjointed. The main plot line wrapped up earlier than I expected, and then the story took a weird twist kinda late on. By then I was kinda ready to file this movie away, not start on some new train of thought. It all got wrapped up very nicely, but it wasnt until those final moments that it all made sense. Until then that last half hour was just awkward.\r\n\r\nAnother thing Im on the fence about is that there were a lot of sequences without any dialogue. Some of them were beautiful, others boring. Ultimately, I do think it was a nice touch, I guess I just didnt have the attention span.\r\n\r\nWhat I am completely sold on in this movie, was Veronica Lake's performance. I just loved her. She has that 1940's glam but she was also one tough cookie. This may actually be the first time that I see a character from such a far back time period who I wish I was. Sadly a quick IMDB check shows that I wont be encountering Ms Lake in any other AFI films, but she did make a zombie movie in the 70's. May hafta scope that one out later.\r\n\r\nIm just not enough in the writing flow right now to come up with any more comments on this one. I very much enjoyed the first hour, but the rest of the 90 minutes just lost me.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://expletivedleted.livejournal.com/\r\nhttp://twitter.com/ExpletiveDleted",

Sullivan (Joel McCrea), a young director working in Hollywood who has hit it big, although the films he makes are successful, he's unsatisfied with them, and he wants to make a film about the plight of the less fortunate, to be titled O Brother, Where Art Thou? He decides to try and live his life as a hobo, but the studio head Mr. Lebrand (Robert Warwick) is keeping tabs on him by following him around, Sullivan gets help from a down-on-her-luck aspiring actress known as The Girl (Veronica Lake), but his plans go slightly awry. It is a genuinely funny film with some brilliant dialogue within. It comes from the golden ages of the screwball comedies that came out of Hollywood at that time. McCrea was a brilliant leading man back then, and he sparks wonderfully of everyone he comes into contact with. Sturges' dialogue is brilliant, and has influenced many. The Coen's were heavily inspired by this for one of their films, can you guess which one??",

Joel McCrea is great as the titular director, and Veronica Lake's flirty acting style fits the material nicely.

            "content": "Sullivan's Travels is a little dated in terms of its humor, but for the most part, it's still a wonderful satire on Hollywood, comedies in general, and the relationship between the rich and poor. Joel McCrea plays John Sullivan, a famous Hollywood director notorious for making throwaway comedies. When he decides to make a serious and meaningful drama about the poor, titled \"O Brother Where Art Thou?\" the studio heads accuse Sullivan of knowing nothing about the poor, and they think that no audience member would want to see a movie so serious. So Sullivan makes a plan to live as a hobo until he is able to feel the poor man's plight. His life as a hobo is quite funny because every time he runs into a tough situation, he returns to his normal life full of wealth and power to fix it. Along the way, he meets an aspiring actress played beautifully by Veronica Lake. They quickly hit it off and slowly start to fall in love. Oh, but Sullivan is already married to another woman. He married her because it would save him tens of thousands of dollars on his taxes. What's a guy to do? The whole storyline of this is played to great comedic effect. Lake and McCrea sizzle on-screen together, and Sullivan's butlers provide a lot of comedic relief. It kind of reminded me of a French farce where the butlers know all! It was also cool to see that the Coen Brothers referenced this movie in their films. There's a scene where a picture of the \"man of the house\" keeps changing expressions, similar to the Coens' \"The Ladykillers\" and the title of \"O Brother Where Art Thou?\" is used in their 2000 film starring George Clooney. The movie also changes tone to great effect towards the end where Sullivan is actually forced to work as a poor man. We definitely see his change in attitude when he no longer has his \"rich man safety net\". It's a great contrast to the rest of the film, and definitely helps hit the satirical elements home.\r\n\r\nWhile this movie plays up its cheesiness a bit in a satirical way, there are some instances where I felt it was just cheesy 40s comedy without the satirical overtones. There's an instance where all of the characters in the scene throw each other into the pool (its a little much), and some of Sullivan's lines just come across as pure cheese. It's kind of a forgivable flaw considering this was made 68 years ago, back when comedy was a lot different, but it was just kind of a shame to see that not all of the scenes aged as well as others.\r\n\r\nOther than that, this is a wonderful satire that you should definitely check out. I haven't seen Veronica Lake in any other movie so far, but this is supposed to be one of her best roles, and she is just so sexy in this film. Her line delivery is full of sarcasm, and it's just a fun character for her to play. See this film!",

These films are known for their sophisticated verbal wit, uproarious physical comedy, and their affectionate portrayal of eccentric, scene-stealing supporting characters. But Sturges's work is also consistent in its exploration of the possibilities and prospects of upward - and occasionally downward - mobility. In what may be his finest, most complex film, Sullivan's Travels(1942), Sturges brilliantly mixes broad humor with sharp-edged cultural commentary, once again - as in The Great McGinty(1940), Christmas in July(1940), and The Lady Eve(1941) - revealing social identity to be a highly unstable proposition, capable of hyperbolic transformation through such prosaic means as disguise, confusion, and self-deception.\r\nJohn L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea) is a can't-miss Hollywood director who specializes in lightweight entertainment, exemplified by broad comedies such as the 1939 film Ants in Your Pants. Naive and sheltered by a solicitous staff who have no interest in seeing their meal ticket change genres or become overly ambitious in his cinematic pursuits, Sully nonetheless sets his sights on directing an epic social commentary picture about tough times in depression-era America, to be entitled O Brother, Where Art Thou? (a fictional title eventually used by the Coen Brothers for their own 2000 film, in a clever tribute to Sturges). To research his topic, which involves such unpleasantries as suffering, deprivation, and racial inequality Sully insists on disguising himself as a hobo and making his way across the country to experience \"real life\" firsthand.\r\nOnce on the road, assorted adventures, meetings (notably with Veronica Lake's down-on-her-luck ingenue), and mishaps - some hilarious, others surprisingly poignant - transpire before Sully eventually comes to terms with his true calling as a lowbrow moviemaker with a gift for making people laugh. The lesson here is that strained seriousness and forced profundity have far less benefit for the masses than good old-fashioned humor, with its power to help people forget their troubles, if only for a while.\r\nThat Sullivan's Travels possesses an autobiographical dimension is impossible to deny, with Sturges affirming the value of what he himself did best - making smart comedies with the power to lift viewers' spirits - while ripping the pretentiousness of Hollywood's more sober and \"socially committed\" filmmakers. Personal statements aside, however, the tour de force script brings together a remarkable range of genres, including slapstick, action, melodrama, social documentary, romance, musical, and prison movie. Though it failed to garner a single Oscar nomination, Sullivan's Travels is the most remarkable film in the career of one America's greatest filmmakers.",

But in its second act, abruptly changes pace, becoming more of a wrenching drama as the protagonist is submitted to misfortune after misfortune, which, giving his earlier self-righteous quest to \"find real trouble\", feel strangely fitting though hard to watch. Finally, the film's ending abruptly flips to an ending celebrating the importance of film comedy, which feels simultaneously heartwarming and a smarmy joke at once. It is difficult for the most part to decipher exactly what Sturges' motivation for approaching his subject matter from such unconventional angles is, but the power of his work cannot be argued, and the flipping from comedy to drama feels far more functional than imbalanced, strangely enough. An oddity worth seeing, but better to approach not expecting it to be a comedy.",

Sullivan.  Sullivan has made his mark in Hollywood directing profitable, yet lightweight comedies.  Fed up with an \"out-of-touch\" Hollywood, Sullivan decides he wants to make a socially conscience film entitled \"O Brother, Where Art Thou\" about poverty and human suffering.  His producers balk at this idea, but that only fuels Sullivan's desires more.  Since Sullivan has never experienced the human suffering he wishes to write about he decides to pose as a hobo and live among the \"real\" people of America.  His studio, realizing they can't talk him out of it decides to turn his journey into a publicity stunt, following him around everywhere he goes.  Sullivan tries to shake them and ends up at a cafe where he meets a struggling actress (Veronica Lake) who thinks he is a bum, not a Hollywood director.  She buys him lunch and decides to join him on his journey soon discovering his real identity.  The pair experiences life among the poor and then it's time to return to Hollywood.  Sullivan decides to make one last visit, this time to pass out hundreds of $5 dollar bills to the tramps he encountered.  Unfortunately he is mugged and left unconscious in a railyard.  The thief also steals Sullivan's identity and is run over by a train leading everyone to believe he is dead.  Meanwhile Sullivan, unable to prove his identity, is arrested for assault and sentenced to a chain gang.\n \nMy first experience with Sturges was definitely positive.  [i]Sullivan's Travels [/i]is easily one of the best comedies of it's era.  Sturges liberally uses elements of screwball, slapstick and drama, but at it's core it's a biting satire.  Nobody is immune, but his ultimate target isn't the tramps and hobos, it's Hollywood's elite and Sullivan himself.  What really elevates this above other comedies of it's era is the writing.  The dialogue is clever, witty and often quite insightful.  The early scene where Sullivan tries to convince his producers to fund \"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou\" is a classic example of Sturges' fine writing.   Just when you think it's headed for typical screwball territory, Sturges changes gears.  He pauses just long enough to show real human suffering, for example the scene where McCrea and Lake are stepping over bodies searching for a place to sleep, which adds a needed dramatic element to a film that mocks almost everything.  The result is a hilarious comedy with a social conscience and one of the finest satires of Hollywood ever made.  It's influence is apparent from the Coen Brothers to Robert Altman's \"The Player\".  A must see.",

The protagonist, who is not so well acted by Joel McCrea, is an absolute douchebag, and I didn't give a damn what happened to him. Surely that was the intention of the film, but Sturges can't expect to hold my attention that way. Veronica Lake was the only saving grace for the majority of the film. She's beautiful, charming, and loveable. The major flaw of the film is that the message Sturges is trying to communicate doesn't come into focus until the third act. The movie just lolls around in pretentious yuppie land until the beautifully cinematic ending. Things take a turn for the dark as the protagonist unwillingly reaches the dismal low point he'd been trying to discover all along. It's a powerful, dramatic climax that delivers the final thrust into poignancy. There are some rather incredible shots and great supporting characters. A decent film with a wonderful message.",

Made in 1941, it is very impressive for its time. I think it has a good mix of over the top action sequences that end in comedy as well as quick, witty humor. I really liked this film. It has made it to AFI's list of the best 100 American films of all time which is worth noting. I laughed a considerable amount for a movie made so long ago. It goes to show that the film definately withstands the test of time easily.\n\nThere is nothing spectacular along the lines of effects although some of the stunt work is pretty nice for a film made in the 40's. I think the performances by McCrea and Lake were key. They share such a touching chemistry that we can't hel but feel sorry for their misadventures. The writing was brilliant. The story of a director setting out on a trip to experience hardship in order to be able to make a good film that deals with hard times makes for a very funny scenario. In the end, SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS are definately something you don't want to miss out on! It is a lot of fun and I garauntee that you will laugh more than once throughout this comedy.\n[/color][/font][/size][/color][/b]",

His new film, O Brother Where Art Thou, needs plenty of it and that requires research as McCrea has had a life of comfort.\n\nHis travels are somehow less adventurous and more circular than he had hoped, and the film is pleasant enough through these early scenes but it's when Veronica Lake appears the film hits its stride.  She gives a fantastic performance, full of warmth, wit, innocence and cynicism, and the sex appeal you'd expect from one of the inspirations for Jessica Rabbit.\n\nThe message is two-fold but not contradictory: that ours is a difficult world and its problems and people shouldn't be ignored, but also that there is value in comedy and frivolity in a world that has few things of its own worth laughing at.  What a charming film.\n\n(Also, I intend to build a time machine and marry Veronica Lake.)",

            "content": "In this Preston Sturges romantic comedy, Joel McCrea stars as John L. Sullivan, the famous Hollywood director of lighthearted comedies who wants to make some serious movies.  Like most Sturges films, this one covers a lot of ground\u00e2\u0080\u0094literally\u00e2\u0080\u0094but this one, especially, is about a journey.  \r\n\r\nSullivan meets \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Girl\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Veronica Lake) and goes on his travels as a hobo to learn what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like to have troubles so he can make his serious movie.  Thus, the first three-quarters of the movie is classic Sturges: good dialogue, fantastic editing and directing.  Then it sort of slows down a little bit and shows some real hard drama\u00e2\u0080\u0094hard to swallow stuff.  \r\n\r\nSturges still skips the right things and ends wonderfully.  However, I thought the ending was slightly padded.  It left an awesome feeling, a glorious feeling, but I think the same thing could have been achieved by cutting to the chase.  Basically, I would have established earlier that Sullivan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife was now married to the business partner and she would have to divorce Sullivan.  Then, rework some of that dialogue in the end on the plane, maybe even chop it all out.  End on \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Girl\u00e2\u0080\u009d running into Sullivan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms and a kiss.  You would still have the same emotional impact, even better.\r\n\r\nOr, you could just leave it as is and add a kiss after those laughs.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.  It just seems like it needs a little more closure, and a kiss might do it.\r\n\r\nIn this movie, Sturges mutes the sound and dubs in music for a couple sequences, making something of a silent scene\u00e2\u0080\u0094which are all very effective.  \r\n\r\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really the only thing that I would change.  \r\n\r\nThe message is a profound one.  Sturges does seem to get a little preachy towards the end, but it is necessary and the message is great.  Boil it all down and you get something like this: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may be best where you are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Or, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf God has called you to make funny movies, then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to make serious ones.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  (Replace \u00e2\u0080\u009cfunny movies\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cserious ones\u00e2\u0080\u009d with anything else you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like.)\r\n\r\nNote that this was made during the middle of WWII and the director, Sullivan, slightly parodied Capra and his movement from romantic comedies to preachy social movies.  Sullivan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Travels is much better than Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.\r\n\r\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.  At first I felt like, oh boy, this ending was a little abrupt and needed some closure, like I said, a kiss.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong, I still agree with that.",

I do, however, have enough awareness of them to know what John L. Sullivan's [i]Ants in Your Pants of 1939[/i] must have been like.\r\n\r\nVeronica Lake gets dubbed \"the girl\" in this movie.  She never actually gets a name.  Also, she was 4'11.5\", which I didn't know.  A tiny little thing.  Beautiful, of course; the movie's almost worth watching just for the acting talent of its stars and Veronica Lake's beauty.  But Joel McCrea was very nearly a foot and a half taller than she.\r\n\r\nOur hero, John L. Sullivan, is a boy-genius film director a la Orson Welles.  He's trying to make the great, dramatic feature of the familiar title, [i]O Brother, Where Art Thou?[/i]  However, it's pointed out to him that what he knows of suffering could pretty much fit in a paper cup.  So he dresses himself as a tramp and goes wandering, almost immediately accompanied by Veronica Lake for no good reason.\r\n\r\nAfter shaking Veronica Lake, he evenutally finds out that what the world needs is comedy, not drama, and that--despite some two weeks on a chain gang--he still doesn't know much of anything about suffering.  So instead, he'll make [i]Ants in Your Pants of 1941[/i], because what the world needs is stupid comedies.\r\n\r\nI saw this movie years ago, so I was one of those rare people who caught the joke of [i]O Brother[/i].  The Coen Brothers are compared to Preston Sturges quite a lot, after all, and rightly so.  \r\n\r\nSturges has gotten compliments for this movie's portrayal of its black cast members--from the NAACP, no less.  Despite the slapstick nature of the scenes in the \"land yacht,\" the black characters are shown with as much dignity--and having more generosity, I think--as the white ones.  Then again, this movie is screwball enough so that dignity seems a bit out of place.  And did anyone else notice that the projector at the black church must be [i]really[/i] old to show the cartoon without sound?",

One can see themes and ideas from this film in movies that the Coens have done, bits of this movie almost make BARTON FINK look like an extremely dark retelling of the theme.  The movie is about a Hollywood director named Sullivan (Joel McCrea) who is tired of churning out lighthearted musicals and fluffy screwball comedies.  Convinced that nobody wants to laugh when war and poverty plague the nation, Sullivan wants to make O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?, a movie about the common man that will speak to everyday people.  However Sullivan wants to tell a story he knows nothing about, as he realizes he knows nothing about being poor and living day-to-day, so he sets out on the road to leave L.A. and live the life of a depression-era hobo, and what he will find will no doubt surprise him.  Hilarity (and sometimes horror) ensues.  \n\nWhat Sturges has cooked up here is a satire of Hollywood's condescending brand of liberalism.  Ever since film production began, studio producers and directors have been putting their idea of what it is like to be poor on screen, often unintentionally glamorizing the experience.  It also shows that Hollywood often doesn't get what people want to see when they go to the movies.  Like the titular character in BARTON FINK, Sullivan is earnest in his desire to make a movie that speaks to everyday folk, but in doing so he unintentionally offends those who are or have been in that situation.  However Sturges respects his main character, and seems to love all the buffoons he depicts in his screenplays.  The movie is never mean-spirited, it has moments that are unrelentingly hilarious, and bits of ecstasy when character arcs come to fruition.  I've only seen a handful of Sturges' films, but this is certainly one of the best, if you haven't seen any of his movies, this is a great place to start, especially if you like the Coen Brothers.",

While fun movies are definitely necessary, I don't think a someone who has always been involved in the comedy industry should be limited to that kind of role. Look at Jim Carey in Eternal Sunshine and Adam Sandler in Punch Drunk Love.[/color][/size][/font]\n \n[center][font=Times New Roman][size=4][img]http://www.beckerfilms.com/SullivansTravels.gif[/img][/size][/font][/center]\n \n[font=Times New Roman][size=4][color=white]Regardless of the 'message', the film was fun and enjoyable, which is what it set out to do. Joel McCrea is good and convincing in his part. I haven't seen much Sturgess so I don't really have anything to compare this to. If all of his films try to push this 'movies should only be fun' agenda, I could see myself turning away from his work pretty quickly. As for now, I'll give him more chances.[/color][/size][/font]",

After all they made Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?, the movie that never gets made in this film.\n\nI think I've only seen one other Sturges film, The Great McGinty, and I noticed social issues seem to be a favorite theme.  He pokes fun at the Hollywood machine.  There is lots of great dialog, some of which I didn't appreciate till I saw the clips again in a special feature doc.  There are quite a few laughs, but it turns at times to thoughtful drama and a touch of romance.  Then it also deals with the darker side of society, the danger of giving charity to the poor too freely, the treatment of chain gang prisoners, and a particularly grisly death for the time when this movie was made.

However, Sullivan soon discovers that it's going to be harder than he thought to get the experience because the producers and film crew are following him around every step of the way! Soon he meets an aspiring actress, played by Veronica Lake, who ends up joining him as he tries to become acquainted with \"the hard life.\" Eventually, however, Sullivan gets into real trouble, and then he realizes that in hard times like the 1930s, a nice laugh is the best medicine a person can have. \r\nIt's funny and serious ( a good mix) and Veronica Lake's character is really lovable.

It is an incredible film that just grabs a hold of you and will not let go for its entire duration.  Apocalypto is brutal, relentless and mesmerizing.  Watching this in the theaters is the definition of a true visually astounding cinematic experience.  Everybody seems to want to talk about the violence.  There is much violence but it is not distracting, rather completely essential to the film.  This is a primal story set in an alien cultur.  The violence is a facet of their lifestyle that has become commonplace.  \r\nI love how the film doesnt dwell on the culture of the Mayan civilization but takes a minimalist approach in telling the story of a young village dwelling man and his attempt to save his family.  We get a peek at the great towers and pyramids but we don't get to see it for any longer than Jaguar Paw does.  Further we, like Jaguar Paw, are distracted by the constant sacrafices and beheadings of the prisoners.  Apocalypto barely gives you a moment to breathe, and it certainly doesnt spend time superfluously dazzling you with glorified architecture and practices of an ancient civilization.  I admit that before seeing the movie I expected, or at least desired, an extensive look into civilization and daily life of city dwelling Mayans.  After being treated to this more human story I feel it could not have been done any other way.  The minimalizing of civilization did so much to add to the realism.  The film treats the viewer as one already aware and familiar with the city who would be much more interested in the intense physical and emotional journey of a single man.  Imagine if a film explored modern day New York City with an atitude of wide eyed awe, as though it were the work of some foreign and mysterious empire?  Instead we get countless films that just take the city for granted and focus on the story of individuals.  I love how it is evident that Mel Gibson did not simply want to make a movie about Mayan Civilization; sensationalizing its ancient culture for a modern audience was not his intent.  He had a story to tell and that was the ultimate priority.  Apocalypto is the work of a brilliant storyteller and is an enormous triumph.\r\n\r\n(9/10)\r\n\r\nmini:\r\n[I]Sullivan's Travels[/I]\r\nIn the year of Kane came this delightful and insightful comedy from Preston Sturges about a silver spooned director who wants to taste first hand the reality of American poverty to get material for his first socially responsible picture. It co-stars the electricifying Veronica Lake.\r\nPS The Coen Bros. picked up the name of their film \"O Brother Where Art Thou?\" from ST, it being the title of Sullivan's proposed conscientious film.\r\n(8/10)",

Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck do a very good job, and the story line is very enjoyable.

I'll probably be rewatching this one over and over again.\n \n Rating: 96/100\n [b]  \n  [i]Eyes Without a Face[/i][/b]\n  This movie is simply amazing.

Okay, I'm exaggerating. But Ocean's Twelve is still filled with hollywood circle-jerking and apart from the cast, nothing ever really works in it.\n   \n   ==Evil Dead Trap==\n A dumb japanese reporter is sent a snuff tape with directions on how to get where the killing took place. She decides to go there with a crew of 3 other women and a nerdy dude. Various gory deaths ensue. And two sex scene. And a flying fetus. There's some good gore 'n boobs in there but until the very end, everything is a bit cliche and the characters are too stupid to be believed. But... it has a flying fetus.\n   \n   ==Sullivan's Travels==\n Some director who makes funny movies wants to make a sad, profound and pretentious movie about poverty. But since he doesn't really know what poverty is, he decides to pretend to be a bum for a while. Then he meets Veronica Lake. Up until that point, the movie was hilarious. After that, I couldn't concentrate hard enough to understand the jokes. Veronica Lake... hot.\n   \n Anyway, the movie turns around at some point and the director must suffer real pain for a while. There's a nice twist of atmosphere in the movie from that point on.\n   \n   ==The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou==\n Hit & Miss experiment on Anderson's part. The hit part is that the basic idea of the movie works, the part where it misses is with the characters, who are never as funny or entertaining as the ones in his previous movies.\n   \n   ==Alone in the Dark==\n Ah, Uwe, you crazy fool. Following House of the Dead is no small feat and while Alone in the Dark has its fair share of incompetence, overall, it's still clearly a better movie. Better special effects, better plot (and basic) continuity, less idiotic dialogues and better acting might make this a disappointment for those expecting another Uwe masterpiece. Note that there are still massive plot holes, an action scene almost worth to be compared with HOTD's iconic center-piece, the worst sex scene I've seen in a long time and plain Uwe goodness.\n   \n The commentary track with the man himself doesn't disappoint though. The man lashes out on the movie industry, Tara Reid, chinese people, every horror movie that has been released in the past two years, dumb audiences, his own movie, IMDB users, Keanu Reeves (he calls him static and flacid (or flat, not sure) and parts of his own crew. The part where he complains that you don't see Tara Reid's boobies is nothing short of awesome too.\n   \n The best part is that, most of the time, the man is completely right. He is spot-on when he says that the movie industry's way of doing things is rotten to the core. He is 100% right when he says that the audience have been going to see the same movie over and over again for the last couple of years. When he's analyzing his own ending, an open-ended one which he preferred to a big, dumb fight against a some super-monster, which the dumb audience might've prefered, he's right again.\n   \n He also compares his own work to David Lynch's, german expressionism (The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, no less) and Equilibrium. Yup.",

            "content": "[b]THE STRAIGHT STORY\n \n [/b]I still haven't decided whether this is the best David Lynch film or not.  I fell in love with [i]Mulholland Dr.[/i] the first time I saw it, and it's gotten better the second and third time.  It would be hard for a film to surpass it, but if any film can it's this one.  This is better than [i]Umberto D.[/i] and [i]Wild Strawberries[/i], two films that deal with aging and death, and only a step behind [i]Ikiru[/i].  It's that good.\n \n [b]PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (1925)[/b]\n \n I initially had a hard time adjusting to this film because I'm such a junky for the musical.  I've seen it three times live in Toronto, so as this film was progressing, I found myself missing the music and songs I had grown so accustomed to.  That said, this is a phenomenal silent film, and Chaney deserves all the credit he receives.  This also has one of the most memorable scenes from any silent film I've seen yet, and that's the scene on the rooftop when Christine tells Raoul about the Phantom with him perched on the roof above.  It's just brilliant.\n \n [b]KEY LARGO[/b]\n \n This film should be used as an example for great atmosphere.  The hotel during the hurricane is a great setting and served as another character of the film, one that helped generate nearly all of the suspense.  This was a solid film that was bogged down by some bad melodrama and a very slow start.  Even so, it's well worth seeing and Bogart and Bacall are great as always.  The scene stealer, however, is Robinson, who plays the banished gangster perfectly.\n \n [b]HE LOVES ME... HE LOVES ME NOT\n \n [/b]Sure it's a gimmick film, and not only one gimmick but two.  The first was using Tautou in such a dark role, and the second was the two part story.  It played on those two gimmicks, as well as some pretty big and unbelievable coincidences, but it was still pretty damn entertaining.  It should have ended five minutes before it did, as I didn't care for the final \"twist\", and thought it would have been perfect to end during the musical montage a bit earlier.\n [b]\n SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS[/b]\n \n This Preston Sturges film suffered from a drastic and awkward tonal shift.  I was loving this film, almost solely because of the relationship and chemistry between Veronica Lake and Joel McCrea.  They were great together, and when the film abandoned them and put McCrea in his unfortunate position, the film fell flat.  Really flat.  It's a shame, because this could have been up there with [i]The Lady Eve[/i].",

            "content": "Every few years...\r\n\r\nIt seems rare that I discover one of what I would call the \"Great Movies\", but as stated, every few years, one pops up along the road. \r\n\r\nThis time around, it seems that a film I've wanted to see for many years now, and finally rented and watched tonight, has made the cut. This film served as my introduction to Preston Sturges, whom I'm told is one of the truly great comedic directors. \"I wanna make a comedy, Make people laugh. Did you know that's all that some people have? Boy...\" states John Sullivan as his plane carries himself, \"The Girl\" (Lake) and a multitude of doctors, maids, chefs and business advisors from the American south back to Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nSullivan's Travels is a film that doesn't just touch on humanity, it drives it into the ground with a sledge hammer. The underlying motive states that one cannot run away from himself, no matter how hard he tries. Of course, like everything else about the film, by about 70 minutes in (its only 90 minutes long) we are even questioning that- the one thing which is solid in Sully's desired mayhem-filled reality.\r\n\r\nThe real thing about Sullivan's Travels that gets me, hooks me, and seems to keep me locked in is just that basic idea. The dialogue doesn't hurt either, of course. Sturges' one-liners have such classics among them as \"How can I be alone if you go with me?\" and \"Don't keep saying no or I'll poke you in the nose.\" The brilliance of it all really can be described by how much your stomach churns as the second act begins to unfold. The entire first act is spent much like the story of J. Thaddeus Toad (aka MISTER Toad), as Sully takes the audience with him on a wild wanderlust tour of adventure. Nothing seems to be able to quench his thirst for that adventure, until finally he is granted (in a strange way) his wish- to become a part of the story which he desperately wishes to tell. The world he becomes a part of is shocking enough both to him and us, but how he gets there, after the dark side of humanity has all but vanished from the picture's horizon, is the truly shocking moment. Of course, this moment comes at the end of a long montage, which in and of itself is perhaps the truest that cinema has ever witnessed. \r\n\r\nSo much story is revealed simply via music (which also serves as the real informant of Miss Lake's character and her backstory) and image (see: a sign in a shelter reads: \"Have you written home to mother lately\", telling us simultaneously that Sully is headed for even worse trouble and reminding us of Lake's central role in the film, as a comforting mother-type figure for Sully). \r\n\r\nSo, a few thoughts there...This film is seriously one of my new all time favorites. It maintains a sort of screwball, off the wall effect throughout, all the while examining the human condition which Sully so desperately desires to make a film about. Of course, the movie's (and Sturges') best joke is on us: The very film that Sully wishes to make in Sullivan's Travels (suspiciously titled O Brother, Where Art Thou?, begging the answer \"Right Here, in front of you!\") is the film WE are WATCHING, not the one HE is MAKING. Perhaps that really is the funniest gag in the film: and the audience gets that they/we are being duped around the time the horrific incident with the bum occurs (including a nice model shot, a POV from the train...I can just see the PA running alongside the camera with a flashlight to give the effect of the train's headlight on the tracks as it tears toward a \"helpless\" bum; Being that we have just seen him \"kill\" the hero, or atleast derail his dream, and now we are rooting for him, you know you are watching the work of a great filmmaker)\r\n\r\nWow, that got way off track...... Damn train metaphors! I can't help it! It isn't even on purpose!!\r\n\r\nAS I WAS SAYING...! \r\n\r\nWe understand that the film Sully wants to make IS the film we are watching around the time the second act goes full steam ahead...On that note, the reason this is one of the truly great movies is that it manages to keep us totally enthralled. Around 75 minutes in, you can look back at 70 minutes in and say \"wow, I never had any idea I'd be HERE in 5 minutes!\"...And thus you can laugh at all the people who haven't gone through the loop yet, not knowing where they will come out on the other side...And that right there is also the very reason that Sully is doing what he is doing. This film is often called the best film about filmmaking ever made, but it isn't even a film about filmmaking. \r\n\r\nIt's a film about humanity. In the sense that Sully DOESN'T know where he is going to end up, and that is precisely the way he wants it. Stating that you cannot run away from your dreams, because the universe will track you down and place you right back where you belong, all the while not allowing us (along with the main character) to see where that place may be, Sullivan's Travels is one of my new favorites!!\r\n\r\nQuote: \"Waring Hudsucker never did anything the easy way.

Hayden Christensen and Peter Sarsgaard give stellar performances in this wonderfully written & directed story pertaining to the yeppers that is the notion of journlism ethics. I love this movie. Woooo!!! (This [i]is [/i]the worst mini-review ever)\n \nand...\n \n[b]Sullivan's Travels (Sturges, 1941) - ****[/b]\nPretty much the original Hollywood satire, except for the fact that it isn't really making fun of the movies. It actually states that the main purpose for cinema is escapism. In the film, a young director aims to learn true human suffering, so he can make a film entitled [i]O Brother, Where Art Thou[/i]. Amazingly enough, as an inside joke, the Coen Brothers made this movie that the director aimed to make. Because in the end, he decides that comedy (and people's laughter) is all that some people have. Other Hollywood satires to watch are [i]The Player, Adaptation, Mulholland Drive, [/i]and [i]Cecil B. Demented[/i].",

However unlike Sullivan's Travels, This Gun For Hire was a tight, hard-hitting story of love existing in the midst of great trials.  Sullivan's Travels is a slight comedy that becomes insulting in the way it tries to handle social commentary.  It betrays the initial idea: that this filmmaker, Sullivan, ought not to make a film about hard trouble because he has never been in hard trouble, and then the film turns into a movie about trouble, and one can see in the mechanics of the plot and such that its creators obviously know nothing about real hard trouble.\r\n\r\nThis is because it contains one of the stupidest, shallowest and fully lame depictions of the chain gang in film.  Sullivan goes through what feels like a cursory amount of pain, just enough to let the picture slide on that account.  Not only that, but even here there still gets to be comic relief.  The scene where they all go to the picture show starts out well, but ends hamfistedly, and quite obviously as a set-up for some hokey revelation that Sullivan will have at the end.  And his revelation?  Oh, we can't really do anything about suffering, but we can make them laugh!  So let's make comedies for those poor shmucks in the chain-gang.  \r\n\r\nApparently, no-one told the crew over at \"I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang!\" - because they made a film so powerful in its construction, so moving in its characterization (and a movie that is, frankly, funnier than Sullivan's travels, at times) that not only did it free one man from the chain-gang, but it helped set in motion the wheels of progress to abolish the system altogether.\r\n\r\nSullivan's Travels is a satire of silver-spooned filmmakers with entirely too much sympathy for silver-spooned filmmakers, and obviously made by silver-spooned filmmakers, from the top down.  The stars are babealicious, the humor is slight and innoffensive and the outcome comfortably conservative.  The only reason this film gets as many points as four is because of the charming central romance and a few inspired, beautiful scenes.",

    "rt_summary": "Successful movie director John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea), convinced he won't be able to film his ambitious masterpiece until he has suffered, dons a hobo disguise and sets off on a journey, aiming to \"know trouble\" first-hand. When all he finds is a train ride back to Hollywood and a beautiful blonde companion (Veronica Lake), he redoubles his efforts, managing to land himself in more trouble than he bargained for when he loses his memory and ends up a prisoner on a chain gang."
