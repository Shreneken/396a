            "content": "Honestly, I can't help but notice all the people who once again are rating this movie without seeing it and just because they suspect the movie is going to be bad, they rate it anyways as a one. Well, I'm going to once again give you an honest review, I saw this movie last Saturday and honestly enjoyed it. I know I'm going to receive a lot of bashing, but I always look at movies as what they are supposed to be, this was meant to be a children's movie, it's meant for fun. Remember how we all had those cheesy animal movies when we were kids as well? Well Beverly Hills Chihuahua is no different, it's just updated with today's world. I thought it was a good idea, we see all these rich people now-a-days with the way they just lavish their dogs with jewels that cost more than people's houses, it takes a little joke at it. The story is recycled, but it's still a lot fun to watch and has some really fun scenes.Chloe is a Beverly Hills Chihuahua who is just so pampered, with clothes, jewelery, and a life style anyone would die to have. Her owner, Vivian, has to go away on a business trip and leaves her party girl niece, Rachel, to watch Chloe. When they go to Mexico, Chloe is kidnapped and put into a dog fight... she is then saved by another dog, Delgado, who is going to help her get back to Beverly Hills. But when the man who runs the dog fights finds out that Chloe is worth something, he sends his Doberman dog, Diablo, after her. Rachel, the land scaper, Sam, and his dog, Pepi who is also in love with Chloe, are on the hunt to find her and get her home safe and sound.Beverly Hills Chihuahua is a fun movie if you give it a decent chance, I thought it was a nice chance from the constant CGI we always have with these animal stories. I was also impressed that the talking didn't look so fake with the dogs. I tell you though I'm convinced that the dog that played Delgado is the same dog from I Am Legend, that dog just deserves an Oscar, lol, come on, you gotta agree. Well, Beverly Hills Chihuahua is a great family film, as for seeing it on your own or with a friend, I would say that it's worth the rental more so. It's a silly movie I admit, but I had a fun time watching it and I wish IMDb users would give this movie the fair chance it deserves.6/10",

Still i found myself liking this movie.And no I am not suffering from any mental illness or something like that. Honestly the nerve of people to say something like that. I wonder if most of the reviewers actually have seen the movie. If so what did these people expect from a movie like this. A talking Chihuahua reciting a poem from Shakespeare or just a cute dog mixed up in some little adventure. Compared to previous Disney movies about animals it is on the same level. So what if it isn't original. What movie is these days. This movie hasn't got one dull moment. I sat through the movie without ever looking at the clock. And I can tell you that a lot of the big titles that came out this year wished they had the same effect on me.Most of the box office titles made this year have disappointed me much more because I had high expectations. For \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" i had no expectations whatsoever and got rewarded with fun.",

When I saw a film preview that included a pug, I just had to get my wife to this movie. (She will rarely go to a movie - many are just plain bad). We had a GREAT time. It is a comedy, so let's not worry about the misplaced geography which I did not notice until reading some of the negative views here. I am a great admirer of the film-making art. The freight train episode is an amazing piece of film work. The attack of the mountain lions is quite convincing. Both of the latter we found quite convincing. Every pooch in this film deserves an Oscar as do the humans and the writers. This is a fine family movie, for both children and adults. Don't take it seriously. It is a comedy. It is an entertainment, and we just felt we needed something like this to get away from the depressing news - economic disaster in America, fires in California to the North and South of us. This film is just what the doctor ordered for an evening.",

            "content": "I have been using IMDb to obtain feedback on movies for several years now, and what I find is that people here tend to be a little too bias toward A-list, blockbuster movies. Chihuahua does not fall into that category by any means, but that does not warrant dismissing it outright. It is true that the film's cast could have been put to better use, but given the parameters set by the Disney-style writing, they did what they could and it was enough to let me enjoy their performances. I read a review on here that commented on the inaccuracy of geographical information. I agree that if Disney is going to make a film like this, it is unfortunate that they do not take the time to educate their young audiences a little. We wouldn't be talking doctorate level research here, just basic fact-checking.The plot of this movie was not deep, but not many Disney movies NEED to be in order to cater to their young audience and family demographic. I am a twenty-something and I am able to tolerate Disney's material, because I accept it for what it is: shallow, vapid entertainment designed to convey squeaky-clean ideals to impressionable youth. Sometimes, they take that squeaky-cleanliness too far, like making light of the dog fights, but overall, it is all rooted in the same objective: to maintain their target demographic and intake revenue.To the people who reference the different caliber of Disney's entertainment ten or more years ago, I concur with you. It would be good for Disney to trace its roots a bit and return to basics, but it would take a lot of cutting through green to accomplish that.I enjoyed this movie. There was a comment on the discussion board mentioning that the trailer distorted people's initial impression. I am one of those people. Once I got into the movie though, I applied my usual preconditions for judging Disney films and had a good time. It was cute and in Disney's typical fashion, it contained half-baked attempts to teach the kids a thing or two (inaccurate or vague as they were).Go into it knowing it's Disney and will thus inherit the characteristics of all their work, and you'll be fine.",

There are many others where they were bored and wanted to leave in less than 30 minutes.To the people voting it so low (especially ones who vote without viewing) - GET A LIFE!",

But hey for a family movie I think it worked. I am a 19 year old girl, and have a soft spot for family movies, so this was ideal and I enjoyed it. The scenery is superb, the soundtrack is suitably upbeat, the dogs are pitch perfect with the lip movements surprisingly not too sloppy, Drew Barrymore and George Lopez are touching and believable together and hearing the amazing Placido Domingo as the voice of Monte is a major plus and make anybody's day, whether you are an opera fan or not(by the way, I am). All in all, I liked it very much for what it was. It is hardly Oscar-worthy, but it never tried to be, it aimed to be undemanding fun and that's what it was. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

I was not expecting to enjoy the film, but was truly amazed by how well done it was. Sure the dogs were cute & it definitely has appeal to children. But I found the messages (about finding your inner strength, being a good friend, not being stuck up, and about the importance of adopting stray animals & caring for those that are lost or abandoned) very well-executed, they were clear without bludgeoning the viewer on the head repeatedly as so many children's films do.I have to say the fact that the \"coyote\" who was meant to smuggle Chloe across the border was actually a Coyote, and the line about \"say hello to my little friends\" made me laugh long after I had left the theater.I plan to buy this film on DVD when it comes out & enjoy it with my family for years to come.",

It sounds like this movie would be about chihuahuas in Beverly Hills and their luxurious lives and basically a 'Clueless' with doggies instead. And it is, for the first 10 minutes or so.But then, it transitions into something completely different than where I thought it was going. I liked how it eventually talked about cultural identity and not forgetting where you're from, which was a good direction for the movie. With that, it was good how the human girl and the girl chihuahua both become less ignorant as the film progresses. And, come on, it was adorable how this was basically a chick flick with little doggies instead! It was pretty hilarious in some parts (George Lopez as Papi!) especially with some interesting song choices, lol. My only quibbles were the slight sappiness with the whole Disney has-to-have-a-moral dialogue and that Drew Barrymore's voice was annoying after a while as the lead chihuahua with her whining... Still, it was pretty great and it got the whole theater laughing at several points.It's nice to have a movie that doesn't take itself that seriously once in a while :] So basically, go see this before you condemn it to a rating worse than \"Gigli\"'s!",

So coming from that utterly neutral position, I can say that this movie isn't nearly as terrible as others have implied - often for their own jaundiced reasons.First, unlike the contemporary Wall-E, this movie isn't preachy about anything. It's just a silly minor adventure with talking animals where all things work out pretty well in the end - as they must in a kids' movie from Disney. Sure, I was bothered by depictions of the excesses of the super rich of Beverly Hills; the way they lavish excess not only upon themselves but their dogs. However, this does exist. There are people who piously attend charity events for starving strangers and then go home to feed their dogs Kobe beef. That's the world and this movie did not make that world.I would prefer being upset about watching the reality of such excess than watching the superb and factually accurate Hotel Rwanda. I found that movie unwatchable due to the pain it evoked in me knowing that these events actually occurred during my lifetime.So given a choice - do I wish to feel pain at real or even a pretend horror depiction or contempt at the super rich's folly? I'll take the latter.This movie is silliness with some amusing CGI. Let's not get overly concerned that it should be more than that.",

The theater was full of couples without children, which was surprising to me, but it seemed like everyone enjoyed the movie and no one walked out!!!

She goes to Mexico and Chloe gets out and picked up by dog fighters and taken to Mexico City. So, Chloe makes a friend there, Delgado, and they have an adventure while he tries to get her back to Beverly Hills. She gets tricked by a rat and iguana for her Harry Winston collar and is being tracked by Diablo, a dog sent by the dog fighters. They think Chloe will be worth some reward money. They are finally found up in northern Mexico by the niece. Chloe learns there is more to life than just being pampered. She gives Papi, the gardner's dog, a chance.FINAL VERDICT: If you love dogs, then I would think you will find this movie entertaining. It was cute and actually had a decent story that made sense and had adventure. It's a lot better than a lot of films that come out now days. So check it out.",

            "content": "This is one of the most hilarious movies I have ever seen. One reviewer from Mexico has pointed out that in the film they take a train to Tijuana, which has no train station, that they go the wrong way to Chihuahua, that they get their Aztecs and Toltecs all mixed up, and so forth. Yes, that is all true, and it is also true that Americans have never been any good at geography (except that they know that California is west of New York somewhere, and that Mexico is 'somewhere down there', like the bowels). But never mind. It is all in fun. Nothing about this film is meant to be in any way serious. It takes comedy to new canine heights. Nothing is more effective in comedy than to treat the ridiculous as sublime, and here we have the utmost expression of that technique. I suppose, for all I know, that there really are silly women in Beverly Hills who carry their Chihuahuas around with them covered in diamond necklaces, booties, and jewel-studded caps. No human folly ever surprises me, especially those of the spoilt rich, and above all, those of Tinsel Town. But nevertheless, the excesses of Chihuahua fashion seen in this film, which transcend anything ever dreamt of by Dior or Chanel, must surely trespass upon the borders of fantasy? (Or am I being na\u00efve, and it is all even more extreme than that in real life?) But, accepting as normal the wildly extravagant as the film's opening premise, we go on from there to the most hilarious and bizarre adventures of a spoilt Chihuahua ever recorded in canine annals. Not since the first pet was adopted by the first cave child have we ever seen anything like this. Words fail us. So do barks and woofs. There is just no way to describe it, you have to see it. The voices used for the animals are uncanny. Andy Garcia's voice of a sad, world-weary Alsatian (German Shepherd) is a triumphant achievement worthy of a Vocal Oscar, if such things existed. Drew Barrymore as the spoilt heroine Chihuahua is, oops, so convincing that, well, what must her friends think now? The dogs all deserve Dog Oscars, Golden Dog Bowl Awards, etc. The amazing rat and iguana characters in the film, carrying special effects into new realms, are pure Disney genius. I have no idea how they made this film. The dogs' lips move and words come out just like George Bush. Was Dick Cheney a production ventriloquism adviser? The deleted scenes on the DVD are a 'must' for viewing, and should not be missed. I would not call this film corny. I would not call it cute. I would call it a brilliant comedy achievement in every respect, and a special effects and production triumph, giving us 91 minutes of non-stop hilarity and reminding us that even when the world economy is collapsing, we can still laugh until we cry.",

Take it from me, I'm only 15 years old, and even I was holding my forehead with my hand and shaking my head, wondering: \"Why??...

Everybody seemed to enjoy themselves; the kids liked the animals and the parents chuckled at the romantic lines uttered by the love-struck Papi to his \"mi corazon.\" This film is not about silly Beveryly Hills dogs-- it mostly takes place in Mexico as the dog-napped Chloe encounters various colorful Mexican characters and tries to make her way across the border. The non-human characters are voiced by Latino actors familiar to most American audiences, including George Lopez and Cheech Marin as a rat. Even the venerable Placido Domingo is on hand lending his beautiful voice to the character of Monte, king of a wild tribe of Chihuahuas who come to Chloe's aid.The actors lending their voice perfectly fit the role, the Mexican locations are a nice touch, and George Lopez gets off some cute one liners like \"We're MexiCANs, not Mexican'Ts!\" People had a good time watching this film.

For example, the saga regularly changes actors for continuing character, a sign u might say reflects a decreasing casting budget reduced from the first movie going on general release, to its successor which went straight to DVD...... not the case for this saga, as the creators use this change in continuity to demonstrate how, as humans we are continually changing in mind set, political views, and often appearance as we age through life. The very concept of ageing and time is also presented for the viewers consideration as we see the characters of chloe and papi mature and develop throughout the saga, guided of course by the wise Delgado who demonstrates that and old dog considered to be on the scrap pile can not only prove his value, but regain much of the lustre which was dulled through doubt and shame. Finally, the strongest theme this saga explores is that of the traditional class system, the film highlights that although class division is very much still in play throughout society, there is hope and progress that allows a pedigree up market dog from Beverly Hills, to fall for a mixed breed Mexican stray.",

After that they go to Puerto Vallarta, where they take a train to Tijuana (note that there are no train stations in Tijuana) and somehow they arrive to Chihuaha (If you see a map you'd know that Chihuahua is in the opposite direction) where they find a chihuahua's civilization (also note that the principal chihuahua Moctezuma is not a chihuahua) where they are descendants of the Aztec people (there were no Aztecs up in Chihuahua).

While Rachel tries to find Chloe with Vivian's landscaper Sam (Manolo Cordona) and as well as Sam's pet Papi (Voiced by George Lopez), a Mexican chihuahua. Now Delgado is guiding Chloe back home, while El Diablo and his master are hot on their trail.Directed by Raja Gosnell (Home Alone 3, Big Momma's House, Never Been Kissed) made an watchable if disappointing family comedy/fantasy from Walt Disney. Sure, the premise is cute but the script is pretty weak. It is nice to see Curtis in a movie but she's wasted in a small supporting role. Although this movie was a box office success, since it was well marketed to kids. But the teaser trailer promises so much but delivers so little. But the strong point is the vocal talented cast certainly helps. Thanks to the voice talents of Barrymore, Garcia, Lopez, Olmos, Cheech Marin as a Mexican rat and Paul Rodriguez as a Mexican iguana have their moments. \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" is the kind of movie, where it gets worse before it finally gets better.The DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD has an running commentary track by the director, a short animated feature, deleted scenes and a hidden feature. The young children will love this, the adults will find a few laughs but nothing more. If it wasn't for a bad script, this movie could have been something more. It's certainly an odd-ball curio from Walt Disney Picture. Leslie Mann voiced one of Chloe's Beverly Hills friends appears uncredited. Super 35. (***/*****).",

But what made me buy this movie, more than any other reason, is the voice of the King of the Chihuahuas ... none other than Placido Domingo. The reviewers I guess have never heard of him, but it was a pleasant surprise for me. The portrayal of the real Mexico is sort of strange, as is the inaccurate geography. But I've seen many movies that were written as if the authors didn't know much about the subject. Anyway, I love the idea of expressing your chihuahua with a great bark and emphasizing the regal chihuahua character. I'm glad Montezuma, the chihuahua King, turned out to be the greatest singer of all. It's also wonderful thinking about the possibility of a protected mountainous Shangri-La for those often-maligned little dogs -- although I wonder what they eat! The other animals were also well done, especially the mouse and iguana.",

But not by much.This new Disney production features talking dogs, thieving rats, a meek iguana and the overshadowed acting talents of Jamie Lee Curtis and Piper Perabo (\"Cheaper By the Dozen\").On a scale of 1-10, this effort does not rate very high. In fact, the most interesting aspect of a movie like this will be trying to figure out some of the animal's voices.To help with this, let me explain the very weak plot line: Curtis is Vivian, the super rich owner of a cosmetics company who lives in a sparkling, opulent mansion and owns a spoiled white Chihuahua named Chloe (voice of Drew Barrymore).Treating the pet better than any child would ever be, Vivian is forced to go to Italy on business. She decides to leave Chloe in the care of her irresponsible slut of a Chloe-hating niece, Rachel (Perabo), but the ditsy girl loses the pooch in Cabo San Lucas.For some reason, the two-ounce pup is nabbed by some of Michael Vick's dog-fighting friends and taken to Mexico City, and then put up \u0096 inexplicably \u0096 against a huge Doberman Pinscher (Edward James Olmos), who is owned by the evil Vasquez (Jose Maria Yazpik).A disgraced police dog, Delgado (Andy Garcia), however, saves Chloe and the two escape to various Mexican locations before finally working their way back to Tijuana.Of course Rachel is now repentant and with her Latin gardener, Pedro, and his Chihuahua, Papi (George Lopez), is in hot pursuit all over the Yucatan Penninsula.Aided by the Manuel the pack rat (Cheech Marin) and a pit bull named Chico (Paul Rodriguez), Chloe and Delgado make their way north only to be attacked by cougars. Some fun, huh? But thanks to Placido Domingo (as the voice of the Mighty Chihuahua, Montezuma) and thousands of such dogs, the day is saved.One may read this and wonder why I'm spending so much time describing this silly film. Well, it's currently No. 1 at the box office, millions having already paid to see it, so why not read an unbiased review.The theme of talking animals has been a staple of comedy films since Francis the Mule mouthed off to Donald O'Connor and Mr. Ed wisecracked with Alan Young. The difference here is that most of the beasts being Chihuahuas, there's a Spanish appeal. Plus, most of the picture is a travelogue showcasing the more beautiful parts of Mexico.The human acting is fairly abysmal, while the dogs should keep little ones entertained for awhile. Like all movies of this ilk (i.e. \"Shaggy Dog,\" \"Dr. Dolittle\") the goings-on are basically harmless and there are one or two somewhat humorous moments.Not enough to ever pay full price to see, however.",

Having no children or spouse, Viv pampers the little dog in many ways, including giving her pooch gourmet meals, fur-styling sessions, and a diamond necklace. Working for Viv is a handsome and talented young gardener, Sam and his own chihuahua. Sam's canine has a big crush on Chloe but she generally brushes him off because his owner is not as rich as hers. But, one day, Viv needs to go to Europe for a sales trip and she leaves Chloe in the charge of her somewhat irresponsible niece, Rachel (Piper Perabo). When Rachel's friends persuade her to take a short trip to Mexico with them, Rachel agrees and takes Chloe along. But, when the group of gals go partying, Chloe is despondent and decides to run away from the hotel. From there, the beautiful white chihuahua is kidnapped by dog fighters and taken to their horrible abode for a future fight. Happily, there is a German Shepherd there, too, named Delgado (Andy Garcia) who helps all of the dogs break out of their cells. But, the evil dog fight leader is very angry and asks his tough Doberman dog, Diablo (Edward James Olmos) to hunt down the little dog and return her to him, for dire consequences. Rachel, too, soon learns that her aunt Viv's prize companion is missing. Soon, everyone, for good and for evil, is out to find Chloe as quickly as possible. But, who will get there first? This is a darling, darling movie that puts the \"wow\", as the script states, into chihuahua. All of the dogs in the film are mucho talented and voiced wonderfully by the topflight actors, including Barrymore, Garcia, Olmos, Cheech Marin and George Lopez. The human characters, while not the main focus, are very nice as well, with Perabo becoming more likable as the film progresses and the handsome actor playing Sam charming viewers, too. Curtis' role is very limited but she does a nice job, also. Of course, the scenery in Mexico shows only the most lovely places, in general, and it is quite wonderful. Costumes, photography, script and direction are most worthy, too. But, for animal lovers, it doesn't get much better than this, for the movie's canines are out to steal many hearts and do they succeed! Even in these difficult economic times, do support this wonderful family flick by buying tickets or purchasing the movie when it is available. You will be sending a message to Tinseltown that we want more films like this one. And, boy, do we ever, for this little wowfest banishes the gray skies with every frame!",

We were rolling in the aisles from start to finish, and they were begging to buy the DVD once it comes out.Gotta mention, though, that a lot of people have complained about Mexican stereotypes in this film.

I could enjoy the film because I can suspend a sense of reality as the plot unfolds.A wise film goer should never expect reality from talking animals. Especially from Disney studios.The movie is shot from the view of a wealthy Beverly Hills resident going into Mexico for the first time as a tourist. She does not speak Spanish, and is unfamiliar with places where people live on a dollar a day. So the film is filled with the false perceptions that a totally clueless and wealthy tourist would gain. We get to laugh plenty at her childish nature.Politically-sensitive viewers should avoid this film, especially pro-Latino sympathizers. The lack of Political Correctness falls on both sides of this border. Although some aspects of Hispanic life are portrayed negatively, it is somewhat equalized since the heroes were Mexican (both humans and dogs) and the Anglo Americans were portrayed as clueless rich folk.Go see it if you have small kids, enjoy animal adventure flicks, and are not upset by unrealistic portrayals of ethnic groups.",

            "content": "OK, so first of all I recognise that this film is not aimed at me. Nobody sat down and came up with this film thinking that it would play well with the 29-34 year old geek demographic and you would be within in your rights to suggest that I brought this on myself as a result. That argument would hold water if I didn't love Babe as well as many of the Pixar films. Reading the criticism of this film it was possible that there was just a lot of hate levelled at it because it was, superficially, horrid, set in a rich and pampered world of the \"haves\" and apparently offers a plot where a \"have\" dog has to escape from the world of \"have-nots\". This I could believe but it is not true because the criticism for this film is mostly deserved.Starting with the plot it is important to note that the film uses, as its narrative starting point, dog fighting in Mexico City \u2013 yes, and this is a kids film apparently. And even if you manage to ignore the bad taste in that, there is plenty more to go round as we get social commentary that is simplistically offensive and are expected to care about the most fortunate and spoilt of characters while the poor Mexicans form a backdrop of people/dogs keen to do all they can for their \"visitors\". I'm probably reading too much into that but the point is that I had time over the 90 minutes to think of such things because the film put little else on the table in front of me. There is little in the way or warmth in the main character and it is telling that she never changes as a character, remaining the spoilt little valley dog that she is. Personally I have nothing against such people but it makes it hard for me to care about the character when she is as obnoxious as she is.The comedy and entertainment value here is meant to come from the animals talking like they are peoples and this I suppose gets some chuckles early on but not much more than that. Technically it is all very impressive (aside from some so-so CGI/real world blending) but this is not enough. The material is where it is meant to be at and, even when it tries to do that old fall-back of pop culture references it does it with so little imagination and creativity that even that falls flat (a Scarface line \u2013 really?). The voice cast all do the basics and impressively everyone throws themselves into it with energy. Barrymore has the hardest job of this silly little dog but credit should be given to the lovely Perabo, who must have thought that it will all come out good in the final edit. Garcia, Lopez, Guzman, Olmos, Cheech Marin and many others take an easy piece of work in the recording studio but nobody can lift the material beyond the basics on paper.The end result is a pretty basic adventure that will distract kids who won't read much into it and perhaps will be happy with cute animals talking like people and running around with jaunty music playing to tell them to enjoy themselves. For adult audiences though there is nothing at all here, with even the few adult references falling flat by way of being lazy and obvious, while the material is made less appealing while trying to watch it in the shadow of the recession.",

            "content": "I used to love Disney movies, simply because they made you laugh and cry, all while holding the title of a family movie. But now, most Disney movies are being defined by fart jokes and break-dancing animals. Seriously? Okay, the first fart joke may have been funny, but using it in every movie gets bland. And why in all new Disney movies do they have some kind of animal with a weird quirk about it that somehow ends up break-dancing at the end? (College Road Trip, Bedtime Stories, and now this) Disney is able to redeem itself with Pixar movies and movies like The Princess and the Frog, but it won't last. Why am I making a big deal about this? Because many people out there are saying that we should just leave it alone because it's a kids movie. Bull crap. The Lion King was a kids movie and it won over audiences across the world! Up was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars! And all this was achieved without fart jokes and break-dancing animals! Therefore, being a kid's movie does not exonerate it from sucking royally! And another thing, if The Lion King and Up did not use those things I have mentioned before and accomplished a spot on our movie shelves and in our hearts, shouldn't that say to Disney \"Hey! Maybe if we make more movies like that, without farts and lame jokes, we'll get more audiences!\"? I don't know, but I think it's sad that kids are now relying on bad humor to entertain them instead of good, old-fashioned, sturdy plot-lines. But why does this movie suck? Lame jokes, potty humor, break-dancing animals, bad plots, and horrible acting. I never thought it was possible to overact when all you're doing is a voice-over job, but this movie showed me up. The moral of this story is skip this movie. Nothing about this movie is good, even though it has an all-star cast. Like I said before, being a kids movie doesn't exonerate it from the crap category. 2 out of 10, and the only reason I'm not giving this a zero is because I still have faith in Disney (plus, IMDb doesn't have 0/10 on it's scale).",

In fact, I think if you showed it in many poor countries, you'd get EVERYONE to hate Americans and assume we all treat our dogs far better than we'd treat human beings!So, despite all this, is the film any good? No.The story is about a super-spoiled Chihuahua who is kidnapped by a Mexican dog fighting gang. There, she meets all sorts of dog and all the usual stereotypes are presented. During dog fighting, running away, not having food, etc., this dog talks about how sad it is she no longer smells like Chanel!!Overall, a bunch of annoying voiceovers and so many worthless and irritating people and dogs. I found nothing to like about this film...and found it particularly irksome that a huge and successful studio made THIS....and marketed this bowl of dog drool to the public so heavily. Imagine...spending $20,000,000 to make THIS!!! Ugh!Rarely has a movie left me this angry and frustrated.",

It's not my typical fan fare, one usually consisting of international dramas and intellectual plots. And on all of these measures, this movie utterly fails. But somehow I was OK with this and have come to slightly appreciate the film through the lens of it's audience.It is a quaint family film which transcends our four legged friends celebrating the love and struggles in life. The movie is a triangulation of ideas - It plays on the differences in people, it's a coming of age story, it plays on loyalty, and has an innocent love dynamic. These themes are portrayed allegorically through some of American's purist companions - dogs. This is a painfully light hearted film about a \"stuck up\" female dog who ends up on an unexpected journey in Mexico which leads to love and change. It's an tired old theme, and as it delivers laughs very sparingly, but it still manages to deliver family fun and has some redeeming qualities.This movie at best is seen through the lens of a 5 year old's mindset and aptly was aimed at and delivered to that demographic in spades. We have grown spoiled with \"childrens\" movies containing complicated subtexts for adults, this one does none of these things, if you want something better, watch WALL-E.",

Jamie Lee Curtis was perfectly cast for her role as Aunt Viv, loved her in the movie. Also, Drew Barrymore was awesome as the voice of Chloe! I'm a big Barrymore fan! George Lopez was alright as the voice of Papi I suppose, honestly he wouldn't have been my first choice though. His voice was kinda annoying to be honest. The movie was pretty entertaining overall, humorous at times, and it had some adventure in other parts. There was some lagging in the middle of the film, it stalled a little bit and lost momentum.

            "content": "I expected this movie to be nothing but childish antics to make the kiddies laugh. Fart and burp jokes, bathroom humor, and nothing more than another movie propaganda that lies to audiences on how great a certain breed of dog are that then get people to impulse buy it, and dump it 6 months to a year later at the shelter (ala 101 Dalmations). Apparently Disney finally listened to the 100s of letters and petitions asking them to stop making the same cookie-cutter dog movie.First, the trailers make you think Papi is the top dog in this movie. Its actually Chloe, the female chihuahua that the movie focuses on. If not for the supporting cast, the movie would have likely sucked. I was surprised at the heavy issues they dealt with in the movie and how well executed it was.For one...Chloe is lost and found by a man who brings her to a dog fighting ring. Yes, dog fighting in a Disney movie. Though don't be getting memories of White Fang. This dog fighting ring is not shown so bloodthirsty. You KNOW its a bad place. There are all sorts of dogs there, of several breeds. Pit bulls, German Shepherd, mastiffs, and dobermans. One of the pit bull mixes is sadly praying in Spanish. One of the other dogs says, \"he always prays before a fight\". Chloe was brought there to be a bait dog. They never use the words \"bait dog\". But they put her in the ring with El Dialbo, a bad-ass doberman. Delgado, a German shepherd breaks out of his cage, and releases the rest of the dogs, then he saves Chloe and all the dogs run for the hills. The owner of the fighting ring notices last minute that Chloe is wearing a diamond collar and knows she's worth money and sends El Diablo to find her.Papi and his owner, as well as the woman entrusted to care for Chloe go to Mexico to find her. They come upon two of the former fighters, a mastiff mix and a pit bull mix and they join them. On their journey, both dogs get adopted. We also find out Papi is adopted too. And at the end of the flick, a message to the audience about researching a breed before you get it and adopting over buying.On stereotyping Mexicans, as a Hispanic American, I was not insulted in the least. You have the hero (human), who is Mexican, working as a landscaper, yes...stereotype, but they used that stereotype deliberately to show you how wrong people are. The heroine (human) insults him by assuming he can only speak Spanish and talks down to him in her own form of Spanish. He goes along with it. But with Jaime Lee Curtis character you see he is not just the hired help, but a member of her family as far as they are concerned. The millionaire seems to look at him as a son or nephew. And she treats his shelter dog, Papi very well too. In Mexico itself, you see people helping them out all the time. Yes, some of the places they go are not the nicer sides of town, but the people are good. I think the only people who have anything to complain about here are Dobermon owners. They kept from stereotyping all the other \"dangerous breeds\" but them.It was no award winner, it was never meant to be. But it was a great family flick that doesn't talk down to youngsters and its side stories were fantastic. Hopefully this movie makes future adopters out of kids and parents.",

Being a kids film it can get away with some really odd things and it doesn't have to have a difficult story. It needs a quick story with a number of good jokes and some funny bits and a villain that is dangerous but not too scary. And, this film does just that. It delivers all of that and some more and adds it all together in a quick moving series of action sequences that have a lot of dogs in them. A lot of lot of dogs. The story starts in Los Angeles and then moves to Mexico and then back to Los Angeles and it just keeps rolling with its super-predictive but fun play around a kidnapped dog, newly made friends and growing up to be better than before.7 out of 10 dogs barking madly",

Now don't get me wrong, there are some excellent kids movies, but it seems like Disney was so worried about the demographic of children there that they dumbed it down for them. A lot of the voice overs almost sounded like they were talking down to the audience as if it was all supposed to be for kids. I thought it would be better because George Lopez was one of the voice overs, and I really like him as a comedian. However, it wasn't that great.With that being said, I don't know if I'd say I totally hated it. There were some funny moments in it. There were two characters in particular that were actually funny and they were an iguana and a rat. I noticed that one of those characters was voiced by Cheech Marin who everyone will recognize. As I mentioned above, George Lopez was in it, and I must say he did have some funny lines also. I actually think the worst voice actor in this movie was Drew Barrymore, I just think she should stay out of voice acting and stick with live action movies, because she really didn't do it for me.I do realize that voice acting is kind of a weird thing to be judging, and I usually never notice it, but a lot of the voices-the beginning in particular-just felt like they were talking down to me like I was a little kid. I felt like some all-star cast was trying to read a bed-time story to my little sister.So overall, it had some funny moments, but it was kind of forgettable. I probably won't see it again unless I can catch it on Disney Channel one day. I would say don't waste your money, but if you just want to see a movie to watch with your kids and make them entertained for an hour and a half, go ahead and see it.",

We really enjoyed this film. This evening I revisited it on Amazon Prime Video (formerly LoveFilm Instant) and while I found it as entertaining as I did first time around, I noticed a couple of flaws such as the same piece of Mexican-inspired incidental music being played at least four times throughout the film and the pacing becoming slower in the latter half.Despite these flaws there are several advantages such as the incidental music being majestic before the trip to Mexico and then becoming more authentic and sometimes poignant thereafter; and the rest of the soundtrack consisting of well-known songs such as Gwen Stefani featuring Eve's 'Rich Girl,' Kylie Minogue's 'Wow (Its use in the film makes me think of former BBC Radio 1 breakfast show DJ Chris Moyles's parody of this song called 'Chihuahua '),' Right Said Fred's 'I'm Too Sexy,' Arrow's 'Hot, Hot, Hot' and 'Hero' by Enrique Iglesias. Megan McCauley's 'Porcelain Doll' was moving and suitably fitting for the part where Chloe realises she's alone in Mexico while the Chihuahua song was also a fitting choice for Chloe being introduced to more of her breed. There were some funny moments such as Chloe putting dog food in Rachel's shoe and Rachel pretending to bark like Chloe over the phone to Aunt Viv. The script has some memorable lines and has some great uses of dog puns plus also a worthwhile mention of 'Beverly Hills 90210.' The scenery is beautiful and often colourful while the cinematography is effective, especially when the shopkeeper tries to chase the rat and the iguana out of his shop. Moving on to the performances, Drew Barrymore was instantly recognisable as Chloe and gave her the same charm as Olive in 'Olive, the Other Reindeer.' Piper Perabro's portrayal as Rachel was her best performance since Nora in the 'Cheaper by the Dozen' films. While Jamie Lee Curtis was given less to do, she was a decent side character nonetheless.All in all this is a delightful doggy flick that any dog lover is sure to enjoy albeit the somewhat slow second half and the repetitive use of one musical piece. 8/10.",

It wasn't funny. It wasn't cute. It wasn't clever. It was brutal. It was pathetic. It was drivel.My son found several scenes quite funny, but mostly sat in silence as we watched this disgusting vomit fest unfold before our eyes. Bored and nearly comatose, I sat back in the chair pondering the least painful way to gauge my eyes out with the tools I had at hand...soda straw, car keys, fingers...The \"plot\"...oh God to even call it such a thing is to completely mislead you....became more asinine with each ticking second. First, rich spoiled chihuahua with an owner I found myself genuinely hating with all the red fiery anger of Hell gets a babysitter (some woman who rapidly became the only reason I even occasionally glanced at the screen). Next the somehow wind up in Mexico or something because at one point, the spoiled rat dog wound up in a cage preparing to fight a Doberman or something. All I know is that I was FERVENTLY praying to God, Allah, Zeus, Buddha, Johnny Carson and anyone else who could hear me to PLEASE let the Doberman shred that dog like a steak. To my complete and total disappointment, that did not happen.

One which involved heavy amounts of gratuitous violence against practically every character I saw on the screen....perhaps Tarantino stepped in at the last second and gave that film a nice swift kick where it needed to be kicked.......But what I saw damaged me.

These friends include lonely and grouchy German Shepherd dog Delgado (Andy Garcia), and male chihuahua Papi (George Lopez) who has an attraction for her, and meanwhile Rachel and her love interest, and Papi's master, Sam Cortez (Manolo Cardona), are searching for the lost dog. Also on the search for Chloe, and more specifically wanting to bring her back for her priceless diamond collar, is evil Doberman Pinscher dog El Diablo (Edward James Olmos), but by the end all the stray dog friends find owners, and Chloe is brought back to Aunt Viv in time to never know anything. Also starring Luis Guzm\u00e1n as Chucho the Great Dane, Cheech Marin as Manuel the Pack Rat, Paul Rodriguez as Chico the Iguana and Ugly Betty's Michael Urie as Sebastian the Pug. Even a good variety of familiar faces and voices for the lovable animals can't save this film in any way, the story is far too simple and predictable, the special effects are wasted, the characters are stereotypical, the jokes are unfunny, and the cuddly animals are too cutesy and will only appeal to the youngest of viewers, I can agree with the amusing comment of another form of animal cruelty LOL, it is absolutely atrocious fantasy comedy. Poor!",

We get a mini-travelogue, moderately accurate, of off-main-street Mexican culture and scenery.There are several sub-texts, including dog-kidnapping rings and dogfighting, but nothing graphic. This is a very bland film, very little to trigger a parent's 'inappropriate!' radar. If they meant to make a safe picture, this is pretty safe. I watched Beverly Hills Chihuahua on a Digital screen - the photography was very good. The staging of the animals was generally excellent.But the story line is astonishingly young. Like, maybe toddlers. Early toddlers. I don't mind paying to see this, but I won't need to see this one again.",

Certainly not the best 'Doggy Film', but it does have it's moments and the storyline isn't at all bad.So, the movie is about a Chloe, a spoilt Chihuahua, who is left in the hands of her owner's niece,and gets dognapped when they go to Mexico. She makes friends with a German Shepard named Delgardo and they try to get back to Berverly Hills before a Doberman finds her to take her to his greedy owner, while her owner's niece, a landscaper and Papi, a Chihuahua who seems to be in love with Chloe, try to find her. Through this adventure, Chloe is becoming to realize how spoilt she had been.Well it's better than you think, and is totally harmless. The characters could use a bit more work, but it is funny and you'll have a good time watching it. It's predictable, but strangely enjoyable at the same time.So, to clear things up, Beverly Hills Chihuahua is a film for basically anyone. You'll enjoy it or think it's lame. I give it 8/10 for storyline, comedy, and good moments.",

They were surpassed only by the large list of stars lending voices to this movie. I have seen this movie 3 times now. Once in the theater with 1 grandchild (age 5), who loved it. The second time at the house on DVD with 6 family members aged 5 to 65 and everyone loved it. The last time the grandkids played the movie one morning on their own. When that happens then I know a movie has entertainment value. Now I may recognize the actors lending voices to the animals, but I don't believe my 5 or 6 year old grandchildren do. This means they are more entertained by the movie itself and they even at times pulled for the star chihuahua named Chloea (Drew Barrymore) a few times.I rate this movie a strong 8 because of its entertaining value. It also isn't just a children's movie. My teen Gchildren watched and enjoyed it. Not every movie has to have an explosion and gunfire every 5 seconds. Not every movie needs a monster exploding out of someones belly. Not every movie needs a man with a hatchet, chainsaw, or machete.

            "content": "Before seeing 'Beverly Hills Chihuahua' I was expecting a completely insipid comedy strictly for ten year olds. Boy was I wrong. 'Chihuahua' is one of the best comedies I've seen in the last few years. It's got an 'A' story with a cast full of talking dogs and a 'B' story consisting of a supporting cast of humans. The star is 'Chloe', the cutest little Chihuahua you'll ever meet, expertly voiced by Drew Barrymore. Chloe is a prissy, pampered Beverly Hills doggie diva owned by a highly successful cosmetics CEO, 'Aunt Viv' (played by a still good-looking Jamie Lee Curtis). Aunt Viv's only sin is that she indulges her precious Chloe but is basically a very good person. That's evidenced by her warm treatment of the newly hired Hispanic landscaper, Sam (warmly played by Colombian actor, Manolo Cardona). Sam's Chihuahua, Papi (hilariously voiced by George Lopez) falls in love with Chloe and later figures in her rescue.Chloe's counterpart is Viv's niece, Rachel, who also needs to learn a few life's lessons by not talking down to people (Rachel assumes that the 'lowly gardener' Sam, can only speak Spanish). Meanwhile Chloe's uppity attitude is exposed from the very beginning. She's \"born to shop, not fight\"\u2014and proudly proclaims she's an heiress; only to be met by one of her buddy's retorts: \"a hairless\". Chloe objects: \"Not a hairless...I have a trust fund.\" When Aunt Viv has to fly to Italy on a business trip, she leaves Chloe in Rachel's charge. Disaster strikes when Rachel impulsively drives down to Mexico with some of her friends and Chloe ends up getting 'dog napped' by criminals who hold dog fights in Mexico City. The head of the dog nappers is the nasty Vasquez who has an evil Doberman, El Diablo, (menacingly voiced by Ed James Olmos), who all the other dogs fear.Despite all her spunk, Chloe manages to remain out of touch even when she finds herself in the middle of a dog ring about to be chomped on by El Diablo. First off, she mistakes the applause of the seedy crowd as approval when in fact they're laughing at her, expecting her imminent demise. Chloe has some great lines though, inside the ring (\"Clearly I'm not in the right place\u2014call the concierge\"; along with telling El Diablo that she knows a great dentist in Beverly Hills who can clean up his yellow teeth!). Chloe is saved by a former police dog, Delgado, a gutsy, world weary German Shepherd voiced by a perfect, gravely voiced Andy Garcia. I was in stitches when Delgado dumps Chloe in the muddy puddle of water and proclaims Delgado has got her scent\u2014and she replies \"Of course he does, it's Chanel #5\".Rachel realizes the big mistake she's made and leaves her friends to find Chloe. There's a very funny scene when she gets a call from Aunt Viv at the police station and she has to pretend she's Chloe barking into the phone. Meanwhile, Chloe, now all muddied up, returns to her hotel and gets a taste of her own medicine: a bunch of snobby poodles want the horrible mutt immediately evicted from the premises. Chloe stares in horror at herself in the mirror and exclaims: \"I'm hideous\". Now she's beginning to realize that she's not so special.When Rachel meets up with Sam at the police station, the police only have limited information on the dog ring's whereabouts. Sam wants to wait for more information, but Rachel insists on continuing the search for Chloe on their own. Papi states he's with Rachel and utters the film's #1 iconic line: \"We're Mexican, not Mexican't\". Soon Chloe discovers the ever so cute con men, Rat and Iguana, and I almost fell out of my chair laughing when Chloe observes them fighting and exclaims: \"This is just like Animal Planet\"!!! Then when El Diablo confronts the rat after he pilfers Chloe's diamond collar, the rat has that great line: \"Please don't eat me, I've got a wife and 300 kids to feed.\"Wouldn't you know it but coyotes smuggle the dogs over the border! Eventually, Chloe and Delgado find themselves in the desert where Delgado reveals his dark secret: he's lost his sense of smell. Then our doggie heroes have their 'dark moment' when a bunch of mountain lions are about to have them for lunch. The film is just full of so many incredible surprises\u2014there's a sandstorm, kicked up by a pack of Chihuahuas, led by the mighty Montezuma (aka Monte). It's Monte who gives Chloe a dose of 'Chihauhua pride' and the film's loftiest moment is when the Chihuahuas loudly proclaim: \"No mas, no mas!\" Rachel still needs to learn a lesson when she and Sam come upon some strays and she says with disdain: \"Just what we need\u2014stray dogs\"; and it's Sam who wisely points out: \"Papi was a stray dog\".Things are neatly wrapped up when Chloe and Delgado aid in their own rescue by gaining the attention of a couple of Mexican Park Rangers. Soon, the evil Vasquez appears on the scene and snatches Chloe again (he's figured out that Chloe's owner is worth a lot of money). Delgado's arc is complete when he regains his sense of smell and leads the police to Vasquez, saving Chloe in the process.Both Chloe and Rachel have improved their lives after their great adventure. And they're both rewarded with true love along with their respective honeys (Papi and Sam). The further reward is that they get home just in time to prevent Aunt Viv from learning of Rachel's big faux pas.I don't know how Disney does it, but the direction of man's best friends in this film is superb (undoubtedly some computer enhancement helped things along). 'Chihuahua' is not only funny but it's touching due to the underlying message of tolerance it so successfully conveys.",

This is the story of Chloe (voice of Drew Barrymore), an annoying twit of a chihuahua who one day gets kidnapped in Mexico thanks to her lazy (and lucky temporary) owner, Rachel (Piper Perabo). So, it's up to Papi (George Lopez), a dog who has a crush on her to save her. It's so painfully boring...no plot, no sense, doesn't have a brain. It tries pathetically to make someone in the audience laugh, and yet never succeeds. The movie is so painfully slow you forget you're watching a movie, and instead think you're being tortured.

It's much better than the last couple of Disney dog films, but still pretty awful - and I fear given that there are two sequels, I have worse times to come.Aunt Viv (Jamie Lee Curtis) leaves her beloved and spoilt pet Chihuahua Chloe (Drew Barrymore) in the hands of her niece Rachel (Piper Perabo). Rachel takes her to Mexico, where she is dognapped and falls onto the radar of Vasquez (Jose Maria Yazpik) a gangster. Chloe is rescued by Delgado (Andy Garcia) who attempts to get Chloe back to safety but Vazquez's Doberman El Diablo (Edward James Olmos) is hot on their heels.I mean, lets not kid ourselves - this is hot garbage. A dull, lifeless story, in which the dogs are voiced by actors and use a weird CGI muzzle replacement effect to do their mouths when they are talking - it looks bad, it sounds bad and it's definitely more for kids than for families, with nothing for any adults who might be forced into watching. It's starting to date now too, with the era of tiny dogs on vapid airheads seemingly a thing of the past, and with terminology like \"bling\" making it feel like 2008 was 15 years ago!In its favour is that it wasn't as clawingly earnest as say \"Because of Winn Dixie\" but replacing that with unfunny jokes and shouting can barely be considered an improvement.

            "content": "Kid's films several varieties these days. There's the fairly good fantasy book adaptations (Harry Potter), Oscar worthy Pixar films, middle of the road animated fare from Dreamworks, and cheaply made garbage that will make money because there's no other family fare. Beverly Hills Chihuahua is almost of the latter variety, saved by good voice cast and couple clever jokes.So this is one of those films I saw because I was with children and wouldn't have watched it any other way. The setup was not promising, featuring dolled up dogs in LA, a locale that is all but nauseating to see on film. The human cast helped very little. Jamie Lee Curtis (who seems to have a contract with Disney for this type of fare) is the rich, snobby owner of Chloe (voiced by a whiny Drew Barrymore). She needs to leave for a bit and leaves her daughter played by Piper Perabo in charge of the dog. While Curtis is away, Perabo and a couple friends go to Mexico to party, Chloe escapes and our adventure ensues.The film is predictable from this point on and this is one of those \"grin and bear it\" ones for adults. The redeemable moments come in the form of a talented voice cast, at least the Hispanic side. Barrymore whines her way through this. But the rest of the voice cast, led by George Lopez and Andy Garcia seize the moments and make it slightly enjoyable. Oddly, the filmmakers have Chloe get kidnapped by people who put on dogfights (a scary reality these days). They manage to introduce it in a nonthreatening way to kids and actually give a humorous moment in the cages that I think got a good laugh from the entire audience.But y'know, that's about it. Andy Garcia does some good voice work as Delgado, the former police dog and Cheech Marin makes a memorable voice cameo. But the quality voice fare can't save a very mediocre script that goes through the motions of kid films. While I will say this isn't as bad as it could've been (Does anyone remember Cats & Dogs), it's not much better. It undeservedly made a lot of money. The problem with this and some of Disney's other non Pixar fare is that the storytelling is uninspired and the way many of these films are shot seem to feed into the fears that such films and TV shows may cause ADHD. This is lightweight diversional fluff. And while it's not horrendous, it lacks the artistic merit and multidimensional characterizations that actually stay with kids and actually challenge them to think about what they watched. So far, it seems like Disney's cohorts at Pixar have been the only ones to rise to that challenge.",

The title is the worst ever, absolutely the worst. I personally know that everyone i told to see this movie hadn't planned to because of the title, but they were all impressed.

But if you don't get that each central character has gone through a journey and come out on the other side, then you are just seeing the cover of the book.",

I went into the movie thinking it was going to be bad. But it turned out that i did not fall asleep in it. The movie is definitely a children's movie but i thought it was okay. This Disney movie surprised me. It was kinda of like a long Saturday morning cartoon. Its gags weren't hilarious but i smiled through most of it. It was for the most part cute in its own way. I also found that Jamie lee Curtis character was kinda funny. The whole time i watched the movie i half expected Micheal Myers to jump out and go surprise.",

I feel perhaps that the cast that the movie has is the reason for the films overall rating.

Though it doesn't deserve the punishment it gets for previously holding a place in the bottom 100, I didn't think it was that great anyway.Beverly Hills Chihuahua felt like a mediocre dog adventure. (This was one of the choice movies while I was sitting in my airplane, so out of boredom I felt impelled to watch this). Clich\u00e9d in its own adventures of traveling cross country with the Chihuahua, I was okay with that. I thought the animal training and direction was actually pretty decent since it is always a challenge to keep them disciplined. The human characters were deliberately corny for Disney's standards, namely Piper Berabo, Manalo Cordona, and Jamie Lee Curtis. The voice overs from all the dogs, the rat and the iguana were okay at first, but became progressively unbearable as time went by. I found myself turning the volume down, and fast forwarding it whenever conversation became a little too much between the dogs. Overall I can't recommend this movie, unless you're a child or an avid dog lover. Anyone else would get annoyed, like me.",

It doesn't work well as a geography lesson, or a lecture on modern cultural issues, or any of the other things that people here are complaining that it isn't, because it isn't trying to be those things.It's a feel-good movie with laughs and adventure, with top-notch voice work and live acting, an absolutely perfect soundtrack, and writing that has real heart. The effects used to suggest that the dogs are talking, combined with some amazing training combine to become unnoticeable so that you can ignore them and enjoy the story.I'm nothing like the target audience for this film. I'm a middle-aged guy who watches plenty of gritty dramas, hard-hitting documentaries, and edgy comedy. I am definitely not a fan of \"talking animal\" movies that are thrown together with insipid stories and kid actors, just to make a fast buck. (I can't even stand \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2\", as it falls squarely into that group, unfortunately.) Trust me, this one is different.When you're in the mood for a light, breezy, romantic adventure that will make you laugh and feel good, give this one a chance, and you will be rewarded.

Sure, there's good voice acting and there are moments where you can tell that the animal trainers were taking the job more seriously than the screenwriters or Raja Gosnell did but this doesn't stand out amongst other forgettable family comedies. From a cookie-cutter story to flat gags to good old \"soundtrack that will most definitely not become outdated in a few years' time\", this movie is so forgettable that apparently, it's not even on Disney+. Ouch. But hey, very little kids will be distracted by it, I guess :/",

If the high society lady's fully-grown children in Douglas Sirk's \"All That Heaven Allows\" bought their lonely mother a chihuahua instead of a television, the lapdog and the gardener's hunting dog might have suggested to Cary Scott(Jane Wyman) that she belongs with Ron Kirby(Rock Hudson). \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" stands on the periphery of the 1956 melodrama that inspired Todd Haynes' \"Far From Heaven\", as Papi(George Lopez) the landscaper's dog, falls for Chloe(Drew Barrymore) the high-maintenance chihuahua, but the film is too timid to take that extra step. Chloe's poolside friends drool over the hunky utilitarian canine because he's the forbidden fruit(the dog you don't take home to meet your master), but what would these pampered pooches say if the queen bee-otch(remember: a female dog is a bitch) declared her love for Papi. Ostracization from dog society? Even more daunting: Imagine Chloe's dilemma if she had to choose between Papi and her owner Viv(Jamie Lee Curtis). One suspects that madame wouldn't want Chloe to birth puppies with an unregistered dog. Although \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" is mostly informed by girly films such as \"Clueless\" and \"Totally Legal\", it does manage to smuggle in a reference to Rainier Werner Fassbinder's \"Ali: Fear Eats the Soul\"(German title: \"Angst essen Seele auf\") when Viv explains to Rachel(Piper Perabo) that Chloe doesn't like Berlin. In the German reimagining of the Douglas Sirk sudser, it's not just class warfare, but also a divergence in race(she's German; he's Moroccoan), that keeps the lovers apart. Chloe, quite pointedly, is identified as a \"gringo\" by one of the stray dogs down Mexico way, while Papi unmistakably sounds Hispanic in nature. Predictably, being around mutts, a rat, and inexplicably, an iguana, Chloe learns how the other half lives, and loses her elitist mentality. But how does one explain Viv's transformation? While Delgado(a German shephard voiced by Andy Garcia) regains his sense of smell which allows him to rejoin the police dog force, Viv's nose suggests a more tolerant worldview when she smiles and voices her approval about Chloe's new \"earthy\" smell. Unless Viv is some sort of dog medium, and relives Chloe's adventures in Tijuana, the privileged woman's newfound well-roundedness seems largely unearned; completely out of the blue. Do you know what's Pixar's secret? They make children's films that go a little too far. That's why they achieve transcendence. \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\", on the other hand, plays out like \"Far From Heaven\" with a happy ending, sans the Brechtian distanciation.",

It's a well-meaning film that should provide plenty of fun for your kids, but ultimately, that's the only crowd I can truly recommend this film to.",

One part of the movie is about the annoying rat of a dog finding its bark and another part where it losses its dog shoe and tries to make that a dramatic moment. It is one of the worst movies I have ever endure if you can even call it a movie I call it legal torture. If you have to watch it take a blindfold and some ear muffs.\r p.s I only had to watch this movie with a relative and I didn't spend any money but I would have spent some in order not to see this movie",
