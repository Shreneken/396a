            "content": "I was so excited my theater got The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, from the moment I saw this trailer, I knew I was in for a treat. This movie just looked incredible, even though it's a touchy subject with the holocaust, it still looked like it was going to be a great story. Everyone always makes a comment about the innocence of childhood, what it was like to just not have reason, to just go with the flow of things before adults tell you what you have to do. So I watched The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas today and this movie seriously is one of the saddest films I have ever seen, but I felt it was very maturely handled. The actors are great and the story is very touching, to watch these two boys from two completely different worlds who come together just to have fun, be boys, not because of the difference of their background.Set during World War II, a story seen through the innocent eyes of Bruno, the eight-year-old son of the commandant at a concentration camp, whose forbidden friendship with a Jewish boy on the other side of the camp fence. The boys have a great friendship talking every day, enjoying the company. But when the father gives Bruno a Nazi propaganda loving tutor, Bruno becomes confused, is his father an evil man or is his friend the evil one? Love his country and do his duty or don't judge and just stay true to his friend? Bruno must decide all this with some scary consequences ahead of him.The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is a fantastic film, though if you see it, I do recommend bringing the tissues. I couldn't believe the chemistry they had with these two young actors, they worked so well together as these innocent boys who both have no idea what's going on. Bruno doesn't know why his friend is behind fences, and his friend doesn't know why he's there either. The ending is extremely powerful and the story keeps you interested. I do recommend seeing The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, it's a treasure from 2008.9/10",

            "content": "This was truly one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. I can't imagine the friendship story having any semblance of historical fact to it, but it makes one think about the randomness of existence and how tenuous it can be to be on the 'wrong' side. The character of Bruno (Asa Butterfield) is the epitome of childlike innocence, and his view of the world is one of total acceptance to a young mind incapable of inhumanity and horror. The film skillfully contrasts his character with that of sister Gretel (Amber Beattie), somewhat older and already under the influence of Hitler Youth propaganda. The conflicted portrayal of the mother Elsa (Vera Farmiqa) is also set against the subdued brutality of the Commandant father (David Thewliss).With a title like \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\", I really didn't know what to expect, and even well into the picture I didn't have any idea how the story would be brought to a conclusion. When it finally became apparent how this was going to end, it was all I could do to steel myself for the unthinkable and the unconscionable.It's a constant source of confusion to my mind how this world can contain such disparate elements leading to heroic examples of humanity contrasted against unspeakable acts of horror and depravity. By any measure of good fortune, maybe a movie like this can convince even a single person with hate and prejudice in their heart that it's a random whim of the universe that any single person is born the way they are.",

            "content": "I can't speak for other people, but for me The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas is a film that can be seen once and once only because the impact is so shattering. Not even a stone statue can be not moved by this film, this child's eye view of the Holocaust.Bruno is an 8 year old German kid whose father David Thewlis is an officer in the Wehrmacht. They're living a nice life in the beginning of World War II in metropolitan Berlin. Thewlis gets orders however shipping him to a command in a nice rural area of southern Germany, presumably Bavaria. Like any other kid he's upset at being dislocated from his friends and his school, but he certainly hasn't much to say in the matter.So the family is uprooted to a lovely pastoral area where Dad's been put in charge of a concentration camp. Not one of the bigger ones like Auschwitz and Dachau, but a small one that his superiors expect Thewlis to run efficiently. Young Bruno has absolutely no one to play with and he wanders over to the camp. His parents feel he's way too young to understand about these things and he makes friends with a kid on the other side of the barbed wire, a young Jewish boy named Shmuel who wears those funny striped pyjamas like everyone else in the camp.Two things struck me about The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas. When I did a review of The Diary Of Anne Frank, the biggest impression I got out of the film was the ordinariness of that small group of Jews hidden in that attic. Who could possibly think these people were any kind of threat to civilization simply for being and believing in their faith? We get to see the other side of the looking glass here, a view of this very average German family, besides young Bruno and Thewlis, there's mother Vera Famiga and daughter Amber Beattie. Famiga is not happy one bit with her domestic situation and it's slowly dawning on her that the politics and policies of the Third Reich is the root of her concerns. As for Beattie, she's really buying into the whole Nazi thing, partly because she's going through puberty and a young and handsome aide to her father played by Rupert Friend is stirring up those first womanly feelings.But to all intents and purposes this is your average German family, not too much different than the Frank family in that attic, but that this regime of hate has made Thewlis a death merchant.The second thing that struck me and it's what gives hope to this crazy world is what passes between Asa Butterfield as Bruno and Jack Scanlon as Shmuel. If all we are as humans are reflections of our parents prejudices there would be absolutely no hope for mankind. But we do grow, we do question, some of us just don't accept everything that's fed to us. We don't see Shmuel's world of the camp until the very end, the boys mostly have contact with a barbed wire fence between them. But we see Bruno and his sister being now home schooled in Nazi teachings and his innocent contact with that kid on the other side of the fence makes him question what's going on.The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas is one of the best films of 2008. You will not forget the performances of Butterfield and Scanlon and the adult cast members. The end will shatter your mind, but the film's depiction of friendship growing in the worst possible circumstances is also a message of hope.",

            "content": "There have been more than a few films on the subject of the Holocaust, possibly the daddy of them all being Steven Spielberg's \"Schindler's List\" based on the book \"Schindler's Ark\" by Thomas Keneally. Much better, however, in my mind is Costa-Gavras' \"Amen\" based on Rolf Hochhuth's play \"Le Vicaire\". Now Mark Herman's \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\", itself based on John Boyne's novel, is fit to mentioned alongside these two great films.I was initially doubtful at the premise of this film since my knowledge of Holocaust history suggested that 8 year old boys would have been sent straight to the gas chambers on arrival rather than set to work in a camp (obviously I am happy to be set straight on this point if I am wrong). And having seen the film, I also doubt that the boy in the camp (Shmuel, well played by Jack Scanlon) would be able to sit at the camp fence undetected long enough to meet and talk to Bruno, the camp Commandant's son (an astonishingly assured performance by newcomer Asa Butterfield).There has also been some criticism of the fact that all the actors speak in Received Pronounciation English accents (even American actress Vera Farmiga, whose English accent is completely faultless). This is true, although to be completely accurate, all the actors would have to speak in German and the film would have had to be subtitled as a result.In truth, however, none of these criticisms actually matters a damn. For even though all of the above is undeniably true, the film still works. And my, how it works. When it finished, I sat in my seat stunned (I had the same reaction after watching \"Disaster Movie\" last week, but most definitely not for the same reason, I assure you).The Holocaust as seen through the prism of 8 year old German boy is a novel approach and although we all know what is happening at the camp nearby, at the beginning, he does not. And every step he takes, he gets closer to discovering the truth, losing his childhood innocence in the process.What I liked about this film is the sophisticated and multi-layered portrayal of the German characters. None of them are one dimensional wholly evil characters but nor are they wholly good either (not even Bruno who tells lies on several occasions, one occasion which results in brutal punishment for one of the prisoners as a consequence).With good performances from Asa Butterfield as Bruno, Amber Beattie as his sister, David Thewlis as his father, Vera Farmiga as his mother and Jack Scanlon as Shmuel, this may not be the first film about the loss of childhood innocence in the Holocaust (Roberto Benigni beat Herman to it with \"Life is Beautiful\" and whilst Benigni's film has a powerful end of its own, even that does not compare to the powerful shattering ending which this film possesses) but it is the best and most effective to date.With restrained direction by Mark Herman and a similarly restrained score from James Horner, if this film does not win the hat full of Oscars next year that it surely deserves, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will have shown itself to be completely irrelevant.",

            "review_title": "A very good film",
            "content": "When my son (nearly 12 years old) read the book he was awake until 5am that night thinking about the story and what it all meant; he had some penetrating questions too. A day or so later he said that he thought that it would make a good film, and imagine his delight when he saw that there was a film of the book.I have taken him to see the film; and was riveted. I think that the style of the film is really that of an old fashioned family film, however the subject matter is emotionally very demanding and all the better for that. It does what good drama should do - makes you think and feel. As the credits ran, at the showing that I saw, no one moved or spoke for a minute or two. The Holocaust is a difficult subject, but to tell a story in such a way that it is accessible to a 12 year is a great achievement.There have been some comments that the cast speak English (rather than, presumably, German) and that this is somehow a bad thing. What are the alternatives? Either sub-titles or daft 'ello 'ello accents. In some ways the ordinariness of the Nazis and the family points up the horror of what happened \u0096 that ordinary people can do the worst of things to fellow human beings.",

The unique approach taken by Mr Boyne put the subject matter across in a fresh and, if it is possible, even more heart-wrenching fashion. When I heard they were making the book into a film, I was very anxious, as I thought that they couldn't possibly convey the book onto the screen appropriately. I am delighted to say that I was entirely wrong. I have just this minute returned home from seeing the film and I am absolutely stunned. The film is practically identical to the book, which was wonderful to see, and I thought that the acting was superb. Vera Farmiga and Asa Butterfield were, I thought, exceptional. The film was handled fantastically and I believe that the feel of the novel was not lost in the translation to screen. Seeing the film was a lot more intense than reading the book and, even knowing what was coming, I found myself sobbing at the end, as were my father and step-mother, the latter of whom had never read the book, and was utterly shocked. This is the first film I have ever seen in which the whole audience were silent from beginning to end, and then, when the film ended, not a single person moved for a long time afterwards. The film is an incredibly powerful, moving story, told superbly well by a stellar cast and crew. I would recommend it immensely to everyone.",

            "review_title": "The Holocaust Presented as a Grim Children's Fable",
            "content": "It's official. The award now goes to the British for making the most depressing film I have ever seen. For the first time in my movie-going life I witnessed an audience member's physical reaction to a film when a father was observed outside the screening room for \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" collapsed against the wall with his child emotionally distraught and crying in his lap. With the rest of the audience, including myself, stunned into silence after the film and exiting the theater a communal internalized wreck, I don't know if I was more devastated by what I had witnessed on screen or by that poor little child out in the hallway whose father for some reason thought this film would provide a history lesson his child could stomach at such a young age. As the film proves, the innocent are not cut out for war.That being said, I would recommend \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" to anyone emotionally prepared to sit through it. The film's climax will hit you like a sucker punch to the gut\u0085but there is a lesson to be learned for those in the right frame of mind and mature enough to handle it. In adapting John Boyne's novel, director Mark Herman envisions the Holocaust as a grim child's fable, and in doing so, presents the historical events from a daringly simple new angle. Yes, \"Life is Beautiful\" attempted something similar not so long ago, but that film was told from the point of view of a child-like man trying to shield his son from horrors and had abrupt tonal shifts that sank its dramatic impact. \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\", however, keeps a powerfully consistent tone, and until the harrowing final act, is entirely told from the point-of-view of the young son of a German commandant assigned to run a concentration camp.Herman directs the film fairly well, utilizing visual motifs and not so subtle foreshadowing (that left me with a sinking feeling in my gut as the film progressed), and he is aided greatly by the wonderful cinematography by Benoit Delhomme. The script, though contrived in parts, is tight and moves at a brisk pace, and the normally sappy composer James Horner shows great restraint with his score that is both haunting and reverent to the events that unfold. The mostly British cast is stunning. As little Bruno, Asa Butterfield successfully permits us to relate to the child's na\u00efve innocence without ever allowing the character to become cloying or blissfully ignorant. David Thewlis commands attention as his tortured and misguided father, and Vera Farmiga is dynamite as his distressed mother. She gives a powerhouse performance and proves yet again to be a gripping chameleon of an actress nearing the level of a Cate Blanchett.With its slim run-time, \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" seems a sound choice for a future generation of teachers to show their high school students in lieu of an epic like \"Schindler's List\". It also makes a good visual companion piece to Eli Wiesel's literary \"Night\" as it shows a fictionalized flip-side to the same tragedy. As the real survivor accounts sadly fade with the passing of time, the horrors of the Holocaust will remain firmly in place in the world's historical fiction for centuries to come long after the last person who actually witnessed it has died. These stories will forever be screaming at us, and we would be wise to listen. Fault the film if you wish, but in its bold child-like simplicity it shows the insidious evil of the Nazis as two-fold. Yes, they slaughtered six-million innocent Jews, but it was an act of murder-suicide as in doing so they also sentenced themselves to death.",

What this film showed to me was how when you remove the political, racial and cultural issues from people there is potential for us all to get along.The main character played the role of 'innocence' beautifully and his non judgemental eyes just made my heart flutter at the thought that during such barbaric times compassion still lived within humans.The film maintained fascination throughout, seeing how the effects of what were going on around him effected the rest of his family, which led to the finale. For me it showed the ultimate idea of 'shoe on the other foot'... how in life we can feel OK about handing it out but when taking it back we realise what kind of twisted evil beings one can be.I highly recommend this movie for any adult, though this film is based around Nazi Germany and the Jews, the ideas behind it can apply to any destructive situation that is going on in the world today.Overall this is a 10/10, powerful stuff.Andrew Barbarash",

We see the lead characters as both humans and monsters we see internal conflict and how they each come to terms with their conflicts, above all we see how futile their conclusions were.There will be the predictable comparisons with Schindler's List but you might also want to compare this movie to \"The Counterfeiters\" which also deals with the conflicts necessary to survive. Watching this movie I kept being drawn back to Primo Levi's book \"If This is Man\" the story of his time as a prisoner suffering from this evil.The great success of the film is its simplicity, it does not seek to over analyse but simply allows the development of the characters to tell the story.One of the contributers spoke of how he was in screen 9 (if I remember correctly) in Cineworld Dublin - I was in Screen 11 and I can had the same experience, the film ended and no one moved, all were in a state of shock, no, sorrow. This is not a film for young children, but older children and adults familiar with the evil addressed in this movie should go and see it. This movie deserves great success. I rate it 9 out of 10 and would have given it a perfect score except for some small technical questions, but none that take away from this fantastic piece of cinema - All associated with this movie should be rightly proud of there work and if any of you read these comments - Thank You!",

After relocating at the will of the German Army, the film then centres on the friendship between Bruno and Shmuel (Jack Scanlon). I will end it there as I don't wish to spoil the rest of the film.Putting to one side the fact that everyone has a flawless English accent (which does make it difficult to hate them at first), the cinematics, sound, editing and above all acting are a credit to the British film industry.Asa Butterfield is fine young actor and I'm sure will be destined for even greater things in the future.As I mentioned above, I won't give anything away, but I will say that this is the first time I have been to the Cinema and everyone sat quiet right up until the end of the credits.Please, please see this film.

            "content": "If you want the definition of ironic, it would be the plot to The Boy In the Striped Pajamas. Everybody knows the story of Hitler and 1940's Germany. A military man moves his family out into the country so he can work at a concentration camp. His eight year old boy wanders off and finds the camp and befriends a Jewish kid from the other side of the fence. A combination of the child's naivety, strong story, and somber music makes this movie very powerful and brings a new insight to WW2.The main force behind this movie and what really keeps it going is Bruno. He is the eight year old boy and the main character. He is forced to move away from his friends in Berlin and is looking for a new friend. He meets a Jewish boy in the concentration camp and he has no idea what is going on. He is young and knows little of the war and the terrible things his father and countryman are doing. There are moments in the movie where he asks stupid questions and it makes the audience just go, \"oh, no. I know the answer, how can you be so blind?\" Then I remembered he was eight years old and has no business knowing what is going on. His older sister is twelve and she gets it. She talks about joining the Hitler youth and she becomes war driven. She is being brainwashed and corrupted by the adults around her. Her whole existence is the show the vile works of the Germans in that time. It's odd how each character in the family is completely different, obviously it is on purpose. We have Bruno, the main character who is completely blind and innocent. It is his blindness and innocents which makes the movie. Then we have the father, Ralph, who is also Professor Lupin in Harry Potter, just a side note. He is the definition of evil. He works at the camps. My favorite scene is when they are all at dinner and he basically interrogates one of his officers and finds out his father was Jewish. On the spot he has the man taken into the other room, beaten, and killed. It is a powerful scene and shows the reality of the situation. One could argue that it's not his fault because he is just following orders and Germany was corrupt by one insane tyrant, but that's not the point. This movie isn't about the war or Hitler or even the Jews. It is about the relationship between the two young children battling the odds Then there is my favorite character in the entire movie, and that is the mother. She is special so she gets her own paragraph.Elsa is the mother of this family and she is protective of her children. She knows the danger bit is also blinded by her surroundings. She knows what her country is doing with the Jewish people but she has no idea that they are dying. She finds out that they are being gassed and burned and she flips out. This says a lot about her character and how she did not approve of her countries actions. This is a bold move by the director because he disproves the stereotype that everybody in Germany hated the Jews and approved of Hitler. She is a strong character an gives the movie a different edge.The movie is a little slow at first and it takes a while for the backbone of the plot to kick in. This movie is 94 minutes and it takes a while before the two boys even meet and build their friendship. Another problem is the little screen time the little Jewish boy is in the movie. The title of the movie is about him and he isn't really seen as much. When he is on screen he tries to tell the truth to young Bruno. He is eight years old and he knows and understands everything that has happened to him. There is one point in the movie where Bruno messes up and it almost costs him his life. I like Bruno as a character but he was a coward and he made foolish mistakes. As the movie progressed I began to realize there were only two outcomes to this story and both are very sad. Pacing problems, limited time with a main character and my major problem is the lack of character development. Every character with the exception of the mother is the exact same from the opening credits to the end credits. The father is a jerk. The boy is foolish and his sister is corrupted. This made the movie a little boring and even though it was a short film it felt really long. I wanted to see more but I can't think what else could have been seen. The strengths definitely outweigh the weaknesses but the weaknesses are still substantial.Overall, I did enjoy The Boy In the Striped Pajamas. The music added an emotional touch throughout and one thing you need to understand is that the main character is a kid and you need to think like a kid to understand what he does. By no means is this a happy movie, but more tragic with a few glimpses that would make any parent proud. Watch this movie but be warned, it is not for the faint of heart. The acting isn't anything remarkable, the characters are strong but have little development, but overall enjoyable. This movie gets the WillyT Honorable Mention.",

Let's start with a complaint I've heard; the children do not talk like adults. My guess is that whoever thinks they do is affected by the fact that they speak British, not American, English; yes, some of it is upper class and such, however, offspring of these people would be using those words. As Ebert points out, it fits, it shows their level in society. I also want to say that the accuracy(the lack of German language notwithstanding), is impressive(other than the outspoken mother... not after '34). Before, I believed that the music early on was not the sort that would be heard there, but I asked my father who's an expert on the subject, and he confirmed that it could and would. This tries to cram in a lot of information about the Nazis and their propaganda; I couldn't help notice how awkwardly shoe-horned in a lot of it was. The feminism is downright misplaced; there was still only a little support for equal rights for the genders in the rest of the Western world around the 1940's. Most of what this tells us is true, though; the issue is that the thing is not long enough for it to come naturally. In general, this doesn't seem to realize that it's a mere 90 minutes, only the last twenty of which are all that engaging. I can't claim that this really captured me. The kids, for how well-behaved they can be, are annoying(you need to sell me on why I'm meant to care about these people, regardless of age). It's not their perspective that bothers me; I *love* Let The Right One In. The bonding footage is oddly placed late in this. Bruno isn't that appealing, both as a character and based on the actor. The performances are good. Editing and cinematography are nice. The writing varies... is it just me, or are these people kinda stupid? Take the dinner scene, for example. There is brief and intense disturbing content(and an underlying tone of it in other portions), and instant nudity in this. The DVD comes with an interesting commentary track by the writer, author and director, a featurette that I will review on its own page here on the site, and 6 minutes of deleted scenes with the option of hearing the thoughts on them. I recommend this to those who want to catch every well-made movie about the Holocaust. 7/10",

But I was so wrong! The lady sitting beside me was crying like anything. Finally we ended up with the move and it started showing casts on its black screen. But, not a single person moved from his seat or probably lost their (including myself) power to move. The only sound I heard was the sound of people's emotion. Guy sitting one row before me hugged his girlfriend who were crying like a little kid. The guy himself was also in tear. I saw a girl from Cineworld cleaning staff with horrifying red eyes. Everyone was spellbound there! I am talking about the movie THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PYJAMAS, unexpectedly a too good movie. I didn't have a single clue about the movie itself and just tried to explore something new. Fortunately or unfortunately, Bruno (main cast of the movie), a young 8-years old kid who love to explore new world explored too much for us that made us all cry while leaving the cinema. I just don't want to spoil your entertainment by giving hints about the story. Rather, I would suggest you to watch the movie and discover some critical facts that sometime we forget in this heartless world.THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PYJAMAS, a movie from an Irish writer and an English director; everyone must watch.

It has stuck with me ever since, and still to this day it leaves me speechless.The story is told from the perspective of 8 year old Bruno, which provides the audience with a different perspective to the war that isn't seen too often. From an innocent mind. This only helps to make the movie's ending so much more powerful. Without giving anything away, this movie will stick with you for a long time.The movie itself has been created beautifully. The cinematics, sound and editing is amazing and really helps create the perfect picture. I want to mention separately how good the actors were though. Some of these scenes wouldn't have been anywhere near as effective if it wasn't for the acting. 10/10. Makes me so proud of the British film industry :')I highly suggest you watch this movie.

            "content": "\"The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas\" is a romanticized version of a time in history that had nothing romantic about it. The title itself is an indication that this movie is going to depict the horrors of World War II through the innocent eyes of a little boy, an approach that I already despised in the similarly out of place \"Life Is Beautiful\". Personally, I don't believe in the natural goodness of children or in their naive innocence when it comes to befriending others, but that's not even the main problem I have with this movie.From the beginning, \"The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas\" is only looking for ways to dramatize the story. The main characters are a family that consists of two children, a high-ranking Nazi-father, an apparently quixotic mother and a rebellious grandmother that questions Hitler's party in public. Sounds pretty realistic, right? I bet there were hundreds of families like this in Nazi Germany.Anyway, when Nazi Dad gets a promotion the family is forced to move to Auschwitz, where they live just a few minutes away from the infamous concentration camp. Now, this is where we learn a couple of things about the family. At the age of 8 and 12 respectively, the kids apparently have never really been in contact with any kind of Nazi Propaghanda at all. Only now are they being told about \"The Jew\" and the \"great ethnic cleansing\" by a private tutor. Wouldn't you think that the children of a high ranking Nazi would have been brainwashed from the day they were born? What's even more unbelievable is that their mother apparently didn't know or care what her husband's beliefs where, either. Only now she starts to find out about what's being done to the Jews and, of course, she totally opposes to it. Of course! She's only been married to this guy for years. The man probably has lots of lovable character traits that totally overshadow the conformist, sadistic, mass murdering side of his personality.Anyway, the family starts their life in Auschwitz and the son Bruno starts exploring the area. He soon gets to the concentration camp and strikes up a friendship with Shmuel, a little boy who is imprisoned there. Shmuel just happens to sit around at the fence most days relaxing. Apparently concentration camp was bit like a schoolyard, where everyone could just move freely without ever getting mobbed by guards or anything (actually, by that description schoolyard was even tougher).So, that's pretty much the situation from which the whole drama arises. It's a totally constructed and unbelievable set up, a movie made to appeal to the Rosamunde Pilcher-loving housewife. The stage design, the kitschy cinematography and the score all add up to a Hollywood-version of the Holocaust that is far removed from reality. The Twilight Zone-esquire twist ending is almost offensive. It feels like an exploitation of real life tragedies for the purpose of a cheap shock moment, and that's just tasteless.Good performances by the child actors and Vera Farmiga couldn't save this movie. I'm surprised that it received such a high rating on IMDb, and I expect my review to be deemed \"not useful\" by countless users soon. My judgement remains, though: \"The Boy In The Stiped Pyjama\" is an inappropriate fairy tale of horrific historic events that are still too recent to be distorted into a polished Hollywood tearjerker.",

            "content": "The Boy in Striped Pajamas, aside from it looking mostly like a slightly upgraded TV movie (it's financed by BBC) and featuring British and non-British actors not changing any of their accents for their characters, is also too obvious for its own good. Holocaust = bad is the basic message of the picture, and a message that apparently never sinks into the head of Bruno, the 8 year old boy who befriends Shmool, the boy of the title who befriends him across the fence of the concentration camp. It also seems to be a movie pitched at children more than adults, which would be fine except that it's not even a very good children's movie, unless they don't know much at all about the holocaust- which, perhaps is likely. Maybe my standards are too high after so many countless films regarding Nazis and the holocaust, but among the many of them (Schindler's List by far the masterpiece and others like Jakob the Liar remake worse), this one is just... meh.Does it provide a look at how innocence had little place of the Nazi's plans against the Jewish people? Yes. Does it have a point regarding good versus evil? Maybe. It's scope is mainly centered on Bruno's experiences around the family house where his father (barely one-dimensional David Thewlis) is the Nazi soldier and his mother (Vera Farmiga, almost two-dimensional but not quite) who is horrified by what she finds out goes on at the camps. And, as well, about the kindness of some people who could not comprehend (or just weren't up on the facts or too young, like Bruno) the evil possible with the Nazis. All of these ideas and perspectives are fine. It's the execution of these on film, in drama, that counts, and the performances and the direction just don't add up.On top of this are some contrivances to the plot that keep things a little too thick for comfort. Maybe I just wasn't as emotionally invested in the ending as some other critics have been, but it starts as being pretty stupid - for Bruno to just casually dig his way into the camp and then slip on the camp clothes without anyone noticing is one thing - and then, the final straw, with the big lesson being delivered as a manipulative sucker punch to the parents as Bruno and Shmool are shuffled off to the gas chamber at just the exact moment they go into the one bunker. This is just a cruel twist, something done to drive tragedy into a story that doesn't provide much except for a feeling of \"... what?\" If it touches other people who don't see any of the obvious lines drawn in Herman's script or direction, good for them. For me, it's a total emotional sham.",

After a farewell party, he moves with his wife (Vera Farmiga), his twelve year-old daughter Gretel (Amber Beattie), his eight year-old son Bruno (Asa Butterfield) and their maid to a huge house nearby the concentration camp that Bruno believes it is a strange farm with the locals wearing pyjamas all day long. The lonely Bruno feels bored without his friends at home and decides to explore the area without the knowledge of his family. He goes to the \"farm\" and befriends the prisoner Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), who is also eight years old, and they meet each other everyday but separated though an electrified barbwire fence. Bruno lives a conflict about the Jews while having classes with his tutor and at home with the German officers; when Shmuel's father disappears in the camp, Bruno digs a hole and wears pyjamas to help his friend to find his father with tragic consequences.Yesterday I watched the heartbreaking \"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\" and I am still moved with this touching and tragic tale of two pure boys and their sight of war and holocaust through their innocent eyes. The performances are top-notch, highlighting the expressive Asa Butterfield in the lead role and Jack Scanlon; inclusive I intend to see \"Son of Rambow\" very soon because Asa Butterfield works also in this movie. The unusual approach of the holocaust is original since it is seen and felt by a young German boy and his naive mother, and the reaction of his mother when she discovers what the smoke is indeed is impressive. The sets, decoration and costumes are also magnificent. The very sad conclusion recalled me \"Hair\", when the lead character is in the wrong place in the wrong time and I doubt a viewer can see it without feeling any emotion or even crying. Last but not the least, \"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\" is never corny or manipulative, and I have just included this movie in my list of favorite.

The two boys meet on opposite sides of the barbed wire fence that encloses the camp. Thus, the set up for endless banalities.You have to be very careful in dealing with the genocidal program of the Nazis because the historical events are so moving that they are easily exploited and cheapened. And you have to be careful with children on screen. They're so often childish. They so often seem to be there in order to be abused or get sick and need a kidney transplant.These are onerous problems, but this movie manages them fairly well until the very end.We see a relatively normal German family through the eyes of Bruno. Dad (David Thewless) is a little distant, perhaps, by our standards, but Mom (Vera Farmiga) is in charge of the kids anyway. Kinder, Kirche, Kuchen, you know? Dad is mostly around to make major decisions regarding the household.Their house is in the countryside, far from home, but near the prison camp. Alone and friendless, Bruno wanders through the woods until he meets and befriends Shmuel. He asks Shmuel the kinds of questions an inquisitive eight-year-old might ask. \"Why are you wearing striped pajamas?\" Bruno begins to question his father's probity too, which is always a bad idea, especially in a traditional German family, especially when Dad is an Obersturmbannfuhrer in the SS and is killing and cremating Jews, like little Shmuel, by the thousands.It's well photographed and nicely acted. The lead performances are fine. David Thewless isn't presented as a bald, bespectacled monster. And Vera Farmiga, with her strangely askew features, does a nice turn as the mother who discovers, all at once, that people are being murdered next door.Some of the moments are more expectable than others. When Shmuel is discovered in some mischief, he's hustled off by a stern SS officer for a talking to. The next time Bruno meets Shmuel at the fence, Shmuel's head is down -- and we know instantly at the shot that when he lifts his face it will be battered. That's pretty cheap.In fact, except for the family dynamics and the colloquy between Bruno and Shmuel, the trajectory of the plot is fairly predictable, at least until the very end when it falls apart completely.It's unbelievable that Bruno could get a gander at a propaganda film produced by his father, portraying the camp as a kind of Club Med resort with games and music -- and still believe it. He has, after all, been talking at length with an inmate. It's even less believable that Bruno and Shmuel would giggle with delight as Bruno transforms himself into an inmate and crawls under the fence only a few minutes before the two of them, along with a horde of others, are swept up for extermination.We see Farmiga reduced to hysterical weeping and Thewless stone-faced and distraught, as if, \"There, that will teach them a lesson about humanity.\" It would have been more realistic and ending, more demanding, and equally tragic, if Bruno had said good-bye to Shmuel for the last time and left with his mother and sister for the safety of Heidelberg. The existing ending is too easy. Moral lessons aren't forced on us with such easy drama in life. As it is, the fundamentally decent Farmiga has learned nothing, and the self-disciplined Thewless will never admit to the evil he does.",

There Bruno befriends another small boy named Shmuel( Scanlon) , rarely dressed in striped pyjama and behind an barbed wire. The film is well paced under point of view of an innocent boy.This haunting modern tragedy is an artful, immaculately performed and resonant drama developing harrowing events. Interesting film is sometimes slipping into banal sentimentality or outright melodrama, two things that in this powerful portrayal are well combined. Brooding movie full of fine character studio , but over-all this is an engaging look to infancy friendship with periods of heavy-handed sentimentality. The first part on the movie focuses on the love father, son and wife but after that, emerge the differences . The second half shifts to the friendship among them, a German and Jewish boy who lives behind an electric fence. The documentary film the Nazis prepare to deceive Allied is based on real event, in fact 'Theresienstadt', the Czechoslovack ghetto city used by the Gestapo to persuade the outside world of their humane treatment of the Jews. Packs a chilling observation of the \u00a8banality of evil\u00a8, including Nazi officers dealing with the best utilization of crematoriums. The atrocities are depicted matter of factly as by-products of sheer Nazi evil. Exciting and excruciating final scenes into the gas chambers with use of Zyclon B poison. Excellent acting from adult actors as children players. Astonishing and commanding acting from two small boys as Butterfly and Scanlon. Vera Farmiga gives the performance of his career as understated and affecting mother. David Thewlis is watchable, convincing and versatile . Good secondary cast as Richard Johnson and Sheila Hancock as the grandfathers, furthermore David Hayman as Jew servant and Rupert Friend as cruel Nazy lieutenant.From the best-selling novel by John Boyne which the same director adapted the play and realized this magnificent picture.

I couldn't get over the premise of \"What if you took the young son of the commandant of a death camp during the Holocaust and he met a little Jewish boy?\" The whole relationship and the lack of basic security kind of throws me. The boys seem to have the run of things. When they meet, except for the siren that forces one of them back, it's as if they are ignored. Now, if we accept the premise put forth and can believe in it, it becomes, of course, an indictment of blind loyalty and a tragedy. I just never got there.

The father was happily married with an 8 year old boy and 12 year old girl.And the family (wife and mother in law) had some conversations that I am sure resonated in at least a few German family households during that era. The father justified his work with the rationalization heard over history with genocide that \"they aren't really people\".I will have to say that given the usual mindless entertainment on the silver screen this movie will stay with you.The main theme of the movie is how 2 innocent 8 year old boys are affected by evil, and man's inhumanity to man.I had heard some detractors say that all of the \"Germans\" are speaking with English accents, including the American actress Vera Farmiga (I suppose to stay consistent with the other British actors) - their contention that somehow this detracts from the authenticity.

The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas comes at us through the eyes of a child, it's a different approach that works beautifully. The innocence to the horrors being committed out yonder of young Bruno's back yard, hits home like a bolt from the blue. This innocence is reciprocated by the young boy, Shmuel (Scanlon), sitting on the other side of the fence, their innocence, puzzlement and yearning for harmonised exploration is a bastion of what is great in the world. There is no distinguishment between race, creed or colour, they just see another young boy looking back at them through the barbed wire. And crucially the dialogue given them is unfettered, fresh, pure, simple and believable in its youthfulness.Elsewhere, Bruno's parents are carefully written and performed. Thewlis' father character, the commandant of the camp, is overseer of crimes that still send hate ripples through the world today, but we see him as a human being, a loving father, there's juxtaposition nagging away at the viewer. Farmiga's mother, perhaps guilty of naivety? Yet she's very torn between loyalty to husband and the family life and condemnation of death camp atrocities. The Grandma (Sheila Hancock), too, is not shy in coming forward to oppose such vile \"politics\", these are potent narrative spurts, do not tar with the same brush springs to mind. The tutorial education (attempted corruption) of youth factor is played, deftly, while nationalist propaganda via Theresienstadt like video film ensures history has been taken notice of.Invariably there are distressing scenes and passages of dialogue, but since the story is shot through a boy's world view, we don't need to see up close an assault or have the obvious hit us over the head. The off camera sound of a boot connecting with flesh, the hushed voice of a Jewish servant telling of a life he once lived, or a shot of smoke from furnace chimneys, it's all we need to feel sadness and disgust until the finale, where although Herman is careful and astute, he shocks the senses, and then closes with a silent pull away shot that cuts like a knife as we reflect on the story just unfolded before us. Emotional manipulation? Not a bit of it. A brilliant and worthy film, one that parents should seriously consider watching with their kids. 9/10",

            "content": "All right: the movie is a fable, not a realistic representation of real events. So I can forgive some of the many, many unrealistic events and situations in the story. Judging by other reviews here, the movie clearly works powerfully on many people. The young actor who plays the lead role does an excellent job.Still, as I sat there watching the film, wanting to like it, I found that I could not suspend disbelief. The English accents probably played into this more than I wish, because I can never watch a movie like this without remembering my friend Martin who said years ago: \"I'm always uncomfortable when the Germans in a WWII film speak better English than I do!\" Couldn't they at least have tried German accents, if they felt they couldn't shoot the film in the German language? But even past the accents, I just found so many parts of the story hard to swallow. Hard to believe the boy could take that many trips to the camp without his mother noticing he wasn't in the swing in the front yard. Hard to believe he could sit there at the fence for hours on end without being noticed. Hard to believe he could dig right under the fence on a moments notice. Hard to believe he just didn't chuck the shovel and climb THROUGH the fence, since this movie fence had the widest weave I've ever seen. And the list goes on and on.And in the end, the story drops everything for the sake of a shocking ending that involves just as much coincidence as everything else. Even the build-up has the parents oddly prescient the some kind of serious danger is afoot...It IS a great idea to look at the holocaust through the eyes of an (initially) uncomprehending German child. But in all the literature available, wasn't there a REAL story available? I can't help but think that a real story would have been even more powerful than this fable-made-concrete. Perhaps it worked better as a book. Too bad they didn't leave it alone.",

This is true, although to be completely accurate, all the actors would have to speak in German and the film would have had to be subtitled as a result.In truth, however, none of these criticisms actually matters a damn. For even though all of the above is undeniably true, the film still works. And my, how it works. When it finished, I sat in my seat stunned (I had the same reaction after watching \"Disaster Movie\" last week, but most definitely not for the same reason, I assure you).The Holocaust as seen through the prism of 8 year old German boy is a novel approach and although we all know what is happening at the camp nearby, at the beginning, he does not. And every step he takes, he gets closer to discovering the truth, losing his childhood innocence in the process.What I liked about this film is the sophisticated and multi-layered portrayal of the German characters. None of them are one dimensional wholly evil characters but nor are they wholly good either (not even Bruno who tells lies on several occasions, one occasion which results in brutal punishment for one of the prisoners as a consequence).",

Okay, it may be simplistic and a tad pat but its heart is in the right place and it is acted superbly not least by the American actress Vera Famigla as the mother. Try not to miss it.",

            "content": "THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS is a 'compleat' motion picture: even the title states the vision of the film in a subtly powerful way. Based on the excellent novel by John Boyne and adapted for the screen by director Mark Herman, this film has the courage to re-visit the Holocaust from the child's perspective. Not that it covers up the atrocities of that horrid event and time - quite the opposite: in electing to examine that period in history the stance is that of two children, one German son of an officer in Hitler's armed forces and one son of a Jewish captive living with his father in a concentration camp. The juxtaposition of these two eight year old boys separated not only by a fence but by an ideology neither of them can fathom the other's side makes for not only a brilliant film but also an unforgettable emotional experience. Bruno (Asa Butterfield in an extraordinary performance) is eight, his sister Gretel (Amber Beattie) is twelve and the two live with their parents in 1940 Berlin - father (David Thewlis) is a Komandant in Hitler's army and mother (Vera Farminga) is a popular socialite and loving mother. Father is 'promoted' and will be in charge of a new 'position' that means moving from their beautiful Berlin home to a 'home in the country'. Though Bruno doesn't want to leave his friends the family does indeed move - to a cold house next to what Bruno perceives is a farm. The father is forbidden to share his role and the meaning of it with his family, but it soon becomes obvious by the smoke stacks spewing hideously smelling odors into the atmosphere that the 'farm' is a concentration camp. The house servant Pavel (David Hayman), though abused by the father, becomes Bruno's friend when Bruno sustains an injury: Pavel quietly admits to Bruno that despite his 'pajama' uniform from the 'farm' that he practiced medicine in the past. Bored, Bruno explores the forbidden area outside his home confines and finds a barbed wire electrified fence behind which sits Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) who becomes Bruno's friend. Neither lad understands the differences between them until Shmuel is sent into Bruno's household to polish glasses for a party: the armed forces chauffeur Lieutenant Kotler (Rupert Friend) beats the 'little filthy Jew' for eating pastries Bruno has shared with him - a fact that the terrified Bruno denies. The mother discovers the truth about the 'farm' and the smoke stacks and sinks into a depression, loathing that her husband is in charge of such atrocities. Gretel becomes transformed as a Hitler youth under the influence of the children's tutor (Jim Norton) and there are obvious philosophical schisms in the family. Bruno, regretting his treatment of Shmuel, continues to sneak food to him and plans to help his young friend save Shmuel's father: Bruno digs into the 'farm' and the results bring the film to a terrifying and abrupt end. Both young actors give enormously moving performances and the manner in which Herman directs the action underlines the blur of perception many German's had about the reality of the Final Solution. But for what this viewer perceives as the reason the film sustains the powerful message it does is the manner in which it ends. There are no attempts to 'sanitize' this film: it simply ends with a lightning bolt jolt that is one of the most powerful statements in all of the many films about the Holocaust. It is simply a brilliant masterpiece of a movie from every aspect of judging it - acting, direction, music, cinematography, editing - and why this film failed to make an impression on the critics and public (and the Oscar folks!) when it was released in the theaters remains a conundrum. Highly recommended for all audiences. Grady Harp",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: The Boy in Striped Pyjamas",
            "content": "At the risk of sounding stupid, while I knew that this was based on a book by John Boyne, not having read it meant I had initially thought that it would be one of those childhood based film on fantasy. And I guess so did many parents in bringing their little tykes in what they thought would be a weekend filler in between activities. Little did I and they know of course that it packed such a powerful emotional punch in not wanting to be just another movie set in WWII Germany and the Holocaust, showcasing the horror of that era seen through the eyes of a little boy who couldn't understand the gravity of the dire situation he's plunged into, making it all the more painful to bear witness to.I was glad that director Mark Herman didn't dumb it down for the audience in masking the horror of the atrocities committed, as are the cover ups and the matter of fact manner in which the Nazis went about conducting their persecution of the Jews in concentration camps. Asa Butterfield stars as Bruno, an eight year old boy from whose eyes we witness the chain of events unfold. Having the family uprooted from Berlin to the countryside in order to follow the father (played by David Thewlis), an officer in Hitler's army, we soon realize the true nature of this assignment, and that's to oversee the activity of building horrendous gas chambers and managing a concentration camp that's just a stone's throw away from their family mansion.To Bruno, being in a new environment means a severe lack of friends his age, and from his room he spies a farm where farmers mill around in their pyjamas. We see the world through the eyes of an impressionable, innocent boy who has yet to be exposed to the evil of the world, and this presents itself a number of avenues for the corruption of his mind, starting with the family home tutor indoctrinating Bruno and his sister Gretel (Amber Beattie) in lies against humanity. However, Bruno's sense for exploration and adventure sees him sneak out of his house and toward the \"farm\", where he finds a boy his age Shmeul (Jack Scanlon) across the other side of the fence whom he befriends.This sets up some major conflict within Bruno especially when what he's being taught, told and observed within the household, being in direct conflict with his first hand experience with Scmuel, and becomes totally confused, though still afraid of speaking up for obvious reasons. This theme of standing up for what's right (or the lack thereof) and betrayal of the highest order has been explored in similar vein in films such as The Kite Runner and The Reader, but it doesn't mean that this film had its thunder well taken away from it. It still resonates thanks to the excellent portrayals by the kids in roles where their innocence has no place in their world gone mad, having rationale folks like the Mother (Vera Farmiga) shouted down and out.James Horner gives this film a wonderful score, and became a character on its own highlighting the various dangers lurking beneath the seemingly happier notes. Such as a scene where a screening of what goes on inside the camps was made, but totally for propaganda purposes, in stark contrast to what we know would and had happened, but here fabricated for the mass public. To Bruno, it seemed like his dad is a national hero, though there's this sense of karmic retribution permeating and waiting on the wings to pounce. We also see how double standards can be applied within family, and a general culture of fear being bred no thanks to the Oath that each officer had to undertake.Despite the dark content, the film is beautifully lensed, and I haven't read any qualm about the actors here all having to adopt an English accent (in contrast with the stark complaints with Valkyrie, which is much ado about nothing). The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is an extremely moving piece and I had to admit I was quite affected by it, especially when the final reel came rolling. The last time I was this affected and moved by a \"children's\" movie was The Bridge to Terabithia. This film firmly joins it in that list of surprises, and a natural contender in my shortlist for the top movies of the year. Highly recommended!",

            "content": "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is based off the novel of the same name by author John Boyne. Right of the bat, it's uniqueness stems from how the film's perspective is set. Rather than having the story be centered around adults in the Concentration Camp, or even Nazi officers, it's set through the eyes of a perky eight year old with an open mind and a curious sense. Having never read the book, I can't say if it follows the story pin-point detail, but it sure seemed like director Mark Herman knew what he was doing from the start of production.The Holocaust is a tender time, and I'm not always in the mood to watch a film about it. I did see the 2004 documentary about a school in Tennessee, Paper Clips, but never saw the 1993 Schindler's List. Because The Holocaust is a tender historical event, I don't always want to watch something about it and sometimes avoid films that's plot is centered around it since I'm easily emotional. Though whenever I watch a film about The Holocaust I usually wind up enjoying it, but better safe than sorry.The plot: Bruno (Butterfield) is an eight year old boy forced to move from Berlin to the countryside with his mom Elsa (Farmiga), SS officer father Ralf (Thewlis), and his twelve year old sibling Gretel (Beattie). While getting acquainted with the changes, Bruno finds a Jewish boy of the same age on the opposite side of a barbed wire fence. The boy's name is Shmuel (Scanlon) and he opens up to Bruno, telling him that him and his family are forced to wear \"striped pajamas\" because him and his family are Jewish. Bruno of course has no clue what all of this means, but winds up becoming close with Shmuel and ignoring his parents dislike of Jews.The film is deep in some scenes, but one thing that let me down was that Bruno and Shmuel don't have many dialog scenes together as I would've thought. They have quite a few, but not as many as one would hope. Striped Pajamas however changes around the middle of the film to focusing more on the parents than the boy. Very cool set up here that we aren't faced with so much.How sad the film will make you depends on the kind of person you are. I've been known to get extremely emotional to films, but this one didn't bother me so much because I predicted the ending about halfway through. It's still definitely an informative movie and a very interesting, unique look on The Holocaust itself. After all this time I put off the movie, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas proves to be more than meets the eye and the title. Whats one supposed to think when they read the title The Boy in the Striped Pajamas? A five year old kid's trip to K-Mart?

Herman's humanity shines through again in this compelling tale of a concentration camp seen through a child's eyes.The power of this work lies in the fact that it is told, and shot, as a children's film, yet the story covers the darkest period in modern Western History. The central figure is eight year old Bruno, son of the Camp Commandant.He builds up an innocent youthful friendship with child internee Shmuel against a dark backdrop of implied and overt maltreatment of the other Jews.This light, simplistic tale on the one hand is as lightly told as \"The Sound of Music\" but comes with a twist as dark and profound as you could wish for.I found the plummy English accents grating set in an all German environment. Yet sub-titles would have massively reduced the film's marketability and cod - German accents could have been just as irritating.Vera Farmiga delivers a marvellously nuanced performance as Bruno's mother,and David Hayman's Pavel, the Jewish Servant is achingly tragic. This film is a wonderful introduction to any child to the grim reality of this part of human history.At times it teeters close to being too twee, pandering to the kids audience on one hand, then doesn't quite swing the hammer blows that the story deserves, yet still triumphs through understatement.A classic that will be shown for years to come.",

            "content": "It appears that filmmakers have an appetite for Holocaust films these days. I don't know if it has to do with the political strife occurring all over the world, America's involvement in the Middle East, Republicans comparing Obama to Hitler, or what, but the constant influx almost has dulled me to the point of avoiding them. How many different versions of the tale can be told before you become numb? So, I will admit to entering The Boy in the Striped Pajamas with much trepidation. It is adapted from a novel and the trailer makes it look like your run-of-the-mill tearjerker of luck and overcoming the greatest tragedy in recent history, if not ever. Oh was I mistaken. This film is the boldest, most ballsy take on the Holocaust I have seen yet \u0085 but maybe I say that only for its powerful ending.This story never shies away from the emotional toll that the Germans' decision to kill their prisoners takes on all involved. Characters are constantly having their eyes opened to the truth of the matter or shielded from it by lies and deceit. Right from the get-go, you know you're in store for something unexpected. When the Commandant throws a party for his promotion and subsequent move to outside a concentration camp, you assume it will be all \"Heil Hitler\" and that nonsense. Yes, that is there, but it is not unchecked. Instead we are given a glimpse of heart and compassion from the Commandant's own mother, a staunch and vocal detractor to the cause. She gets in her jabs to head shaking of all those around her, as well as the confused looks of her grandchildren, unaware of what is really happening around them.One of the best characters is Vera Farmiga's wife to the Commandant and mother to his children. She is aligned with the cause and the call for a return of brilliance for the Fatherland \u0085 that is until her world is turned upside-down by the gigantic slip of the tongue from Lieutenant Kotler about what that smell actually is. The drape is released from before her face and she finally sees through the lies of it all; at once disgusted by her own na\u00efvet\u00e9 as well as the realization of how her husband has become a monster. It truly is a devastating scene watching her breakdown in front of her husband, played with stoic perfection by David Thewlis, made all the more powerful that their son witnesses it through the open door. Her reaction is exactly what I believe this film is striving to bring out of the audience. We are to look at these monsters with contempt and disgust, wanting revenge and blood for what they are doing\u0097an emotional state you will need to feel when experiencing the unforgettable finale, needing to decide whether that bloodlust is just as bad once it's fulfillment is at hand.With all these thoughts of politics and German hubris running amok, there is also the tale of the little boy, oblivious to it all, being dragged in both directions at the same time. There is the duty to his father and love of family in direct conflict with what he sees with his own eyes at the camp. He knows in his mind that these \"farmers\" are not living the life his father's propaganda film portrays, but his unquestioning love for that man makes his heart play tricks on the truth. Young Bruno never is quite certain about what is happening. All those he loves tells him of the Jewish evil and inhuman ways while he watches those same people commit those same acts on those they accuse of it. How can his friend Shmuel be such a bad person? He hasn't done anything. Someone must be mistaken about the whole ordeal; it can't be as bad as Shmuel makes it to be, but it obviously isn't as good as the soldiers say either. Therefore, what harm can come of going inside to help his friend find his missing father? The Boy in the Striped Pajamas quickly becomes a blindsided assault on our own sensibilities. What begins as a diatribe of Nazi ignorance and brutality, not told by the Allies, but instead seen through the actions of the German people themselves, soon becomes a journey to redemption of the \"eye for an eye\" sort. Yes the hypocritical moments strike home, (Thewlis is quick to reprimand Rupert Friend's misguided soldier for protecting his sympathetic father's escape to Switzerland yet will not disclose his own mother's opposition to the cause), but it really all comes down to the two eight year olds playing as friends, hoping to meet in the future once \"everyone is getting along again\". Asa Butterfield is great as Bruno, the conflicted boy trying to juggle both worlds, but it is Jack Scanlon's Shmuel that will truly break your heart. His Jewish boy, with truths being withheld by the adults, afraid of what may happen if he plays catch or is caught eating contraband food, is completely authentic. His performance is so natural and true that you must wonder how much these young actors actually know about what they are portraying. If I was their parent, I don't think I could let them be involved in a film as strong as this, especially with the imagery at its conclusion. I really didn't think they'd have the guts to go through with it, but I applaud them for it absolutely. There really isn't any other way to end it; the devastation and retribution by the hand of fate was the only way to stay true to the tale. It is one you will not shake soon afterwards.",

Just read some of the accounts from survivors at Auschwitz (the unnamed camp in the movie) and you'll understand exactly where I'm coming from.Beyond that, the story itself is a bit sterile and clean, with far too many plot holes, though the acting and cinematography were wonderful. Once again, regardless of what movie she's in (such as the wonderful \"Dummy\" or the pathetically awful \"Running Scared\"), Vera Farmiga shines brightly.There has been much debate as to the accuracy of Holocaust films.

To that point, I thought this was a very well done movie, depicting the innocence of an 8 year old boy growing up in the Third Reich who finds himself in the midst of some ugly history-making when his father becomes commandant of a concentration camp. Up to the end I thought this featured great performances, especially from David Thewlis as the cold as ice, duty bound officer who goes about the business of running a concentration camp as if it were like running any business enterprise. The brief scene in which he's sitting at his desk calmly discussing plans for additional crematorium ovens for the camp is especially chilling, because by then, finally, we kind of know what's going to happen. I was also impressed by Vera Farmiga as the angst-ridden mother who wants nothing to do with this gruesome business. Bruno, played by young Asa Butterfield, came across as perhaps a bit too naive, never really figuring out what's going on in the camp even after he begins to be taught by his virulently anti-semitic tutor. His sister Gretel becomes the portrait of an indoctrinated child, who buys the Nazi propaganda fed her by the tutor hook, line and sinker. Until the end, it was pretty good. My biggest criticism of it to that point was that I felt it presented a far too sanitized view of life in the camp, from the glimpses we saw of it. When the final scenes come, though, it ratchets up a couple of notches beyond very good. The ending (which I won't give away) is haunting and chilling and sobering - I can't list all the words that might describe it.

Beside the unrealistic plot already noted by others, its climax is morally unacceptable.*** SPOILER *** In the end the son of the Nazi murderer is accidentally sent to the Gas chamber together with his Jewish victims. The film manipulates you into feeling particularly horrified about this accidental murder, simply by giving the German boy more human depth and family background than to all those murdered intentionally along with him. In this way the film actually dehumanizes the real victims. I think that you need to be morally bankrupt to do that.",

            "content": "English accents coming from the mouth of Nazi soldiers; suggestions of kitsch, exploitation, and Oscar bait; factual incongruities that lead to serious head scratching. These are among the obstacles faced by Mark Herman's The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, a story of the loss of innocence of a young boy when confronted by the atrocities of the Nazi regime. Yet in spite of these questionable attributes, the film is handled with great sensitivity and delivers a powerful and disturbing movie-going experience that is difficult to shake. Based on a novel (called a \"fable\") geared to young adults by Irish author John Boyne, the narrative is told from the point of view of eight-year old Bruno, the son of prominent Nazi officer Ralf (David Thewlis).The film's joyous opening sequence gives no hint of the dark night to follow. Bruno, brilliantly performed by Asa Butterfield, runs through the streets of Berlin with his friends, spreading his arms like wings, unaware that he and his mother (Vera Farmiga) and teenage sister, Gretel (Amber Beattie) will soon be moving from his comfortable surroundings to a villa in the countryside, overlooking a \"farm, walled off from the house. In reality, the farm is a Nazi concentration camp, most likely Auschwitz, and Ralf has been promoted to act as commandant. Bored and without playmates, Bruno disregards the many warnings from his mother and adventurously explores the forbidden territory beyond the wall.When he discovers an emaciated young boy his own age Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) sitting next to a barbed-wired fence wearing what he mistakenly identifies as striped pajamas, Bruno only sees the opportunity for a new friend. Even when Shmuel tells him that he cannot leave to play with him because he is a Jew, he does not draw logical conclusions, nor does he understand why a servant who helps him after he falls from a swinging tire would give up his profession as a doctor to peel potatoes. His mother is aware of the camp but, like millions of others in the world during that time, pretends not to notice and makes no attempt to explain it to Bruno. Her rebellion ultimately takes the form of tears when she learns that the smell from the nearby chimneys is not the burning of rubbish as explained by her husband but something unspeakable.The numbing conformity imposed on the younger generation is brought into focus when a tutor brought in to school the children in Nazi-oriented history tells Bruno that if he ever found a nice Jew, he would be the greatest explorer in the world. It is also evident when his sister falls for Kotler (Rupert Friend), a brutal German Lieutenant, and plasters her wall with posters of Hitler. To his credit, Herman does not create monsters or stereotypes but recognizable human beings. Ralf is a devoted father who loves his family but is seemingly unaware of the incongruity between the nurturing of innocence at home and destroying it in the name of country. This disparity is made brutally real by the heartbreaking and unforgettable conclusion, which, by allowing us to experience personally the true inhumanity of the holocaust, has the power to point us towards a true awakening.",

Some of the things I have seen would horrify my mother. Still, go and see it.I wont give away too much of the plot here but I was left sobbing and shaking and actually couldn't get up at the end.David Thewlis has always inspired me as an actor; he seems to choose roles that don't always appear to suit him at first. This one, a Nazi commander, must have been immensely difficult to produce but he manages it. The way he is so brutally cold- there is truly nothing behind his eyes. Even with his children it is hard to see the fatherly love. He is, just as his wife says, a monster. In the end I fought hard to see any good in him. This is the let down at the end- even in the face of such tragedy he acts more shocked than horrified, not quite the way a parent would react.His wife on the other hand (played wonderfully by Vera Farmiga) is constantly believable eventually going mad at the thought of her husbands barbarity and the way in which it is warping the minds of their two children.The camera work could have been put to better use- this was a wasted chance for some exploratory shots. There is use of shake and zoom to give us a feeling of connection with the characters (especially with young Schmuel) but why not low angle to show a loss of power? Same goes for the sets. Here was a chance to be very dark and daring with buildings (the most striking of which is the 'Nazi' house which reeks of evil in civil clothing) but the stairs to the chamber just weren't symbolic enough for me of the terror awaiting within.You want confusing characters? Kotler is your chap. Reduced from power crazed mad Nazi terrorist to weak and pathetic in less than a scene and then back again. I was utterly terrified by him; there were times when my hand raised to my mouth after his mouth opened to speak.All in all, considering the BBC had so much to do with it, I left wondering how on earth this only got a 12 certificate. If I was a parent I don't think I would be sleeping tonight. Scratch that- even knowing I'm not a parent I may not sleep anyway.",

I had read that people had been sitting silently in cinemas after the film was over and i really didn't believe that people would, but we all did. Everyone in the cinema was silent and stayed at least until the entire cast had gone up. I would recommend this film (and the book), but i do think the 12A certificate it got here, in the UK, was too low. The end was traumatic and it should have been a 15.

            "content": "When the camera finally fades, one is left with a sense of loss that is impossible to overcome, there should be shock, anger, or some other intense emotion to counteract the final minutes of the film, but unlike films involving children and death or evil, \"The Orphanage\" comes to mind, this one lacks complexity because of the perspective taken by its director. It is a serious film that asks to weigh the beauty of innocence and unawareness of the horrors that become become so embedded in our nature when we're adults. It recalls the fact that many children will call any type of meat chicken because they're unable to understand what categories are. Bruno is beginning to develop his understanding of good and evil. He understands less than he feels, and he can pick that something is wrong; yet not enough to help him do enough for himself and his new found friend.There is fine work in \"The Boy\", particularly the mother whose existence is shattered when she realizes how horrible her connections to Nazi Germany truly are. Her is husband is too self involved in his crusade to realize the harm he is causing his family, and at the heart of the story, Bruno's life is still basically, a game.There some illogical developments in the movie, as we have very little tension in some of the scenes involving the children's meetings at the camp's fence. The chemistry between the two boys is perfect, as both of them are representatives of a world that does not have any room for them, and the metaphor might become a bitter reality if the adults fail to recognize the scope of their mistakes.Maybe the film would have been more successful had it been treated as a fantasy, a dream, or a comedy in order to infuse with the contrast that it lacks here. as it is now, it's very simplistic and a bit underdeveloped, yet there is no denying its intended impact.",

Everything looks fake, from the uniforms(which look like fancy dress)to the 'extermination camp' which Is totally inaccurate. As for the storyline - come on,have you ever seen anything so ludicrous and unbelievable? It does'n't take a Historian to know that concentration camps were guarded at all points 24-hours a day and that no-one was allowed within several meters of the fence - on BOTH sides! Furthermore,the camp on the film - an 'extermination' camp as opposed to a 'normal' concentration camp - would have been especially heavily guarded, as the Nazis wanted the systematic killing of Jews to be kept from the public. ALL such camps had a Double-layered fence with a three-meter 'no-mans land' In- between, a far cry from the single,flimsy fence through which,It seems,inmates can pop In-and-out of at will(but apparently choose not to do so!). We are left to believe,then,that In THIS camp, people break In but DON'T break out!! And a little boy at that,who goes In and out seemingly at will!(The naivety of the two boys borders on idiocy,to boot!) I mean,come on - the makers weren't being serious,were they? Add to this debacle the simple fact that In reality all external fences In the camps were ELECTRIFIED and what we have here Is a load of historically inaccurate twaddle - and that's putting It very mildly - with a storyline which would be comical were It not for the serious nature of the subject. Such sensitive matters should be dealt with In a sensitive way - not made Into some kind of ridiculous parody as this has been.

            "content": "With the number of films based on/around/about the Holocaust/World War II, it's hard to find something original. \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,\" a historical fiction film gives the perspective of an 8-year-old German boy whose father is in charge of running a death camp, unaware of what's going on at all. To put it simplistically, it is a loss of innocence tale, though it is really quite more than just that. As the boy learns more of what's going on, so do we through the images of the film and actions of the aware characters. That's what makes the film a really good way to break an older child (though no less than 10 years old) into learning about the Holocaust. In this regard and in its very mature storytelling, \"Pajamas\" is a very good film.The boy's name is Bruno, played by Asa Butterfield, a talented young actor very much in the mold of Freddie Highmore, the young English child star. When Bruno's father (Thewlis of \"Harry Potter\") and mother (Fermiga of \"The Departed\") move them to the country, Bruno's curiosity leads him to discover a death camp is only a mile or so away. Little by little, Bruno learns exactly why his parents have been telling him to stay away, though it doesn't stop him from meeting a young Jewish boy named Shmuel on the other side of the fence. This perspective from a non-Jew is unique to Holocaust films for sure.Adapted and directed by little known British director Mark Herman, \"Pajamas\" unravels as a family film about a serious subject matter but ultimately turns into a tragedy of unnerving proportions. The dialog is light (in quantity only) but Herman really tells it quite well, getting us in Bruno's perspective while occasionally letting us into the adult world where things are more explicit about the horrors of the Holocaust. It's \"Schindler's List\" without the violence but all the emotional pull.The film's only fault is in its validity. Most Holocaust stories are based on truth at least. \"Pajamas\" is entirely fictional and in fact the plot is quite preposterous. That doesn't, however, make it less gripping, because it really sells itself under Herman's direction.It must be warned that this is a very hard, tragic film. That's all that can be said without spoilers, but it must be said. This combination of Holocaust through a child's eyes and tragedy could potentially really open up the eyes of some young people. This film has the potential to be a very powerful experience for a young person and will certainly open up dialog in families about the Holocaust.",

            "review_title": "Considering the subject, why wasn't I moved or even shocked?",
            "content": "As a film about childhood, \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" seems to me neither patronizing nor condescending and is equipped with an intelligence rare in films of its kind. Its target audience appears to be children of a certain age, (the age of its protagonists, perhaps, or a few years older?), though, God knows, in this age of dumbing everything down, where so-called 'grown-ups' are presumed to have the mental age of eight year olds, did the makers of this film really think it would play to that target audience? So should we be grateful that Mark Herman has made a film that doesn't insult us or at least treats an 'adult' subject in a user-friendly manner that will also appeal, though appeal hardly seems to be the right word, to children? Up to a point, yes. There are good things in this film, things that raise it above much of the run-of-the-mill fare that fills our multiplexes today. But this is also a film about the Holocaust; indeed, it is the Holocaust, rather than childhood, which dominates and in this respect I found the film, finally, both trivial and banal, or rather I found the ending trivial and banal since it reduces the horrors and evils of Nazism to a melodramatic clich\u00e9.For a good deal of the film I was persuaded by Herman's view, (though really it is the view of John Boyne who wrote the book on which the film is based), of this period in history, which we know to have been an abomination. It's a simplistic view which is as it should be, since everything that happens is seen through the eyes of Bruno, the impressionable and likable eight year old son of a concentration camp commandant. (That is the first of the film's virtues; it lets us see that the evils that men do does not necessarily transfer to their children or even their wives or mothers).Bruno has the naivety of true innocence and his very slow grasp of reality is disturbing. (You hope that some semblance of the horrors that are all around him rub off on him if only to harden him enough to save him). But this is a child's view of the world and the view of a child from a much earlier, much more innocent time. Yet the four years that separate Bruno from his older sister are telling. She is twelve but with all the precociousness and budding sexuality of a young woman anxious to please. She is easily lead and you fear for her.The film is also good at the even-handed way it tells us that not all Germans were tainted by Nazism. Despite being married to the commandant of a concentration camp, Bruno's mother seems blissfully unaware of what is actually going on. Not only is she kept in the dark as to the exterminations in the gas chambers but she also seems unaware as to the whole programme which the Nazis developed for the extermination of the entire Jewish race, (to her, they are just prisoners). The realization, when it comes, disgusts her but she, like so many others, is powerless to do anything about it. (Dissention can lead to incarceration or even death). Even the young lieutenant is victimized for his father's failure to support the Party.Where the film fails is in establishing any kind of convincing relationship between Bruno and Shmuel, the little Jewish boy he befriends behind the wire, which would make the ending devastating or even poignant rather than simply contrived. Shmuel is the boy in the stripped in the pajamas but he fades into the background and, despite being well played by Jack Scanlon, his character is never convincing. Still, I might have forgiven Herman this, (or Boyne, assuming Herman sticks to the novel's plot - I haven't read it), if he had not felt the need to go down the obvious, predictable route. I could see the ending coming a mile off, (or at least from the film's mid-point). What I couldn't see coming was the cack-handed way Herman handles it, depleting much of the good work he had done earlier.Always a good director of actors, (\"Brassed Off\", \"Little Voice\"), Herman again draws fine performances from his cast. Asa Butterfield is excellent as Bruno, capturing both the boy's fragility and wide-eyed wonder. As Shmuel, Jack Scanlon is fine but it's an under-developed part, which is something of a pity. Vera Farmiga also manages to make credible the frankly incredible role of the incredulous wife and mother, although again I wish the part itself was not so formulaic, and there are nice cameos from Jim Norton and Sheila Hancock.Other criticisms levied at the film from other sources are that it 'Disneyfies' the Holocaust and also that it looks like 'a BBC film'. I can't subscribe to the first. There is a much harder edge to it than Disney would ever have given it and while it may feel very much like a BBC production this, in itself, is no bad thing. No, the main fault with Herman's movie is that it is bland for too much of the time and hysterical just when it needs to be focused.",

Some people, including me, can't understand why people still believe that being from one religion or one color of skin are considered better or worse. Sometimes it's difficult to understand why some people are so hateful like Bruno's father, but the truth is, there are lots of people like him; in Brazilian military, there are lots of guys with these kind of thoughts.

            "content": "Dark pages of history have been analyzed by many historians; hidden intentions saw the daylight; statistics shocked people but soon they all have been forgotten within the dust of history. In the face of war, humanity gradually becomes mute to the cry for justice and indifferent to individual tragedies. Later, \"Be reminded and remember\" occurs more a slogan than a heartfelt message. However, what are we without emotions? What are we without the ability to be moved by the smallest ones? Do children have their word within the monstrous might of war and divisions where merely 'history is in the making?' Before seeing this powerful and touching movie, a viewer must make friends with nothing like facts, historical chronology, thrilling atmosphere but with the word 'EMOTIONAL' - a human feature that reaches the climax here in spite of the fact that all the background story seems to prove otherwise. These emotions are as if brought out from the grave of times, the grave of history, they make you understand, they make you feel, they make you a human viewer not a machine-like consumer who only waits for effects and ego-centric pleasure. Why so many emotions? Because it is a story of two children within the harsh reality where division crawls its way of destruction. Two boys, Bruno (Asa Butterfield) and Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), are so similar to each other, they have similar interests, they like similar games; yet, they are forced to be made separated, unequal and distant by the monstrous ideology that governed the Third Reich during WWII. As a young German boy, Bruno would probably grow to the man his Nazi-blinded father wanted him to be: proud, vainly indefatigable, powerfully treading on dead corpses...yet, he has a wonderful gift: the ability to explore the world around. He looks for petals of flower on earth, something genuine, creative, overwhelming, something that makes life brighter: friendship. Yes, he looks for it and finds it in the most unpredictable circumstances. By making friends with the boy in striped pyjamas, he knows no 'borders' no divisions. While Shmuel appears to be shy and shocked at the beginning, Bruno experiences a unique journey, the journey of exploring innocence, affection, inner freedom and sacrifice. And he shares this gift with his timid friend. This friendship changes them within, makes them grown up within themselves but it also makes Bruno alienated among some members of his own family. Ironically and dangerously, Bruno proves something that has always been impossible for his own professor and tutor: he becomes the best explorer in the world because he finds a nice Jew...Where will this exploration lead him? to failure, to bad coincidence, irony of fate or somewhere beyond the fence of death...to the victory of a little yet divine friendship? Except for the wonderful plot of the boys who provide us with the most touching and memorable scenes, the film nicely executes the situation of the family and divisions within the family. In 1939, they are forced to leave the dreamlike Berlin for a country where Ralph, the father (David Thewlis), has a new duty to fulfill for his nation...this is the strange place where 'farmers wear pajamas.' Kids grow in a new reality and new challenges occur. The father, being blinded by the ideology imposed in the Germany of those years, remains to parrot the widespread propaganda until the very moment it touches negatively his own family and, consequently, his own life. His daughter, Gretel (Amber Beattie), absorbs the machine-like visions of life and upper class starting to cherish the ideals of Hitler and his 'mighty army of Hakenkreuz.' But not all the members of the family are blind and fanatical. Except for Bruno who 'explores' rather than 'knows' open minded characters are the Grandmother and Mother Elsa (Vera Farmiga). The Grandma (Sheila Hancock) clearly disapproves with the Nazi attitude of her son and, when she dies, her daughter-in-law, Elsa, remains loyal to her and rejects any Nazi honors at the funeral. She suffers most because she has a clear concept of justice, she realizes the wickedness that corrupts her country, even her own family, yet, these struggles and views occur to be considered as nothing more than sheer 'female weaknesses.' Yet, these characters manifest a positive side of the nation which, though shaken by monstrosity, did not lose its true spirit, the real greatness. Ms Farmiga is given some of the catharsis scenes in the movie, including her 'thank you' said to Pavel, a Jewish servant, an ex-doctor who has dared cure Bruno's leg.However, it is important to state that not many words will help before seeing this profound film...Artistic merit... I think these are the performances. All the cast portray the characters in a captivating manner. They stay in our memories. I was particularly touched by Asa Butterfield who does an excellent job as a young boy, he gives so much emotionality and so much vitality to his performance.Moral merit...is the greatest...for all viewers, esp. the young ones. This is our moral imperative to reflect upon... what worlds we make for ourselves...built upon bridges or fences...one is the civilization of love, the other is the horror of destruction...the choice is ours, yours and mine. All who carry weapons of death in their hands should see this film and stop for a while, stop before A CHILD! (reference to John Paul II's words)And the rest...except for striped pyjamas and smoke...what remains are silence and tears...yet, I do not advise you to prepare many handkerchiefs. This movie is not just a tearjerker...it's an inner cry. I wish you reflections and I wish you experience... 8/10",

So, his curiosity (BRUNO claims himself as an explorer!), takes him to go next to the camp borders and meet a new friend, SHMUEL, a Jewish kid. Without the consent of his parents he starts visiting his new friend regularly, taking him some food. Their friendship starts growing until one day that SHMUEL's father disappears and BRUNO decides to help him to search his father\u0085 It's a story of innocence set in a time and place of cruelty and completely disrespect for the Human life.I think the plot is very well built because it starts leading us to think it's just child' playing, completely innocent and harmless, but in fact it takes us to an ending of tragic and dramatic events.The characters are also good. There aren't plenty in this movie, but each one of them represent very well a different type of \"person of that period\". I mean BRUNO's father, the commandant, is a man of the regime. He's a convicted Nazi that thinks the elimination of the Jews will make Germany stronger and prosperous. His wife, in opposition, is the kind of person that is submissive, but is against Nazi's ideals and its cruel methods. BRUNO's sister, GRETEL, is the typical young teenager that is start \"waking up to the world outside\", leaving childhood, but she's educated under those rules and those Nazi ideals, thinking any Jew is an enemy just because he's Jew; she represents those who belonged to \"Hitlerjugend\". PAVEL, a Jewish prisoner that works as a slave in their house, he used to be a doctor and now he's just treated like a dog! SHMUEL, the Jewish kid, represents all the prisoners and the Jewish victims; and finally BRUNO, a little kid, too na\u00eff to understand the cruel reality that surrounds him. He represents the innocence and the goodness that exist in the Human soul when it's not corrupted by absurd ideals.As told the end was quite dramatic and intense, but I appreciated it though. In my opinion the final scene was a nice way to \"shock\" the viewer and to let us thinking that just the innocents always pay the price",

The actual premise about a child not understanding the Nazis was quite good at first, but it just got stupider by the minute.What we got was a TV level budget. Don't build an actual Concentration Camp, just go to an old RAF base in England and film one corner of the fence. Behind the Jewish boy was a pile of broken concrete stanchions from the derelict base. - In every shot! Why were there no double wire, electric fence, booby traps and machine gun towers (on the corner - doh! The most obvious place to put one ! )? Answer - so that the kids could sit and play unseen by the guards. Utterly preposterous. Then it had to get really stupid. The only person in history to break INTO a prison. Then he gets taken into the gas chamber without getting his ID number checked ? Unbelievable. I have seen more believable plots on Smallville or Charmed.Oh, and I've just noticed the box art. The ridiculous tower-free fence corner is misrepresented as a straight fence, and the broken stanchions from the derelict RAF camp are not shown. Did the artist realise how stupid it was ?",

            "content": "What if a boy whose father was a high ranking Nazi officer started looking in on a concentration camp, and befriended a Jewish prisoner his own age across the fence? That's the premise of this English film shot in Hungary based on a bestselling young-adult novel by Irish writer John Boyne.The film shows events primarily from the point of view of the eight-year-old Bruno (Asa Butterfield). He and his mother and older sister are swept away by his ambitious Father (David Thewlis) from their posh Berlin mansion when he gets a promotion. A big farewell party evokes all the creepy grandeur of Nazi power. Not all Bruno's family love it. Just the way Father descends the stairs and slowly returns the Heil Hitler salute radiates squishy moral dishonesty and greed. Bruno leaves friends and school with the family to live in an austere Bauhaus fortress in view of a \"farm.\" That's what Bruno thinks it is. The people on the farm are peculiar, though. They all wear pajamas.Bruno's forbidden to go out back. But he's an explorer at heart, and he's also bored and lonely. Before long he's sitting on one side of the electrified fence and Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), a sqinty boy with shaved head and pajamas, is sitting on the other.This relationship--spurred by the innocence and tact of both boys--and the audience's awareness of what situation Shmuel is really in and what kind of place Bruno's father is really in charge of, create a powerful tension that is at the core of this heart-breaking tale. But it's what happens in and around the house that shapes our feelings. Bruno's teenage sister Gretel (Amber Beattie) listens to the tutor brought in to indoctrinate the two siblings with \"history\" (Nazi propaganda). She puts up posters and photos in the bedroom and becomes a more and more enthusiastic Nazi, while Bruno ignores it all--he prefers adventure books--and focuses more and more on his meetings with Shmuel, his single, forbidden and hard to reach and therefore very special friend, to whom he brings food, questions, and a checker board.Bruno finds out a man named Pavel (David Hayman) working in the kitchen who bandages his cut leg used to be a doctor and thinks it an example of the oddity of adults that the man would give that up to peel potatoes.Gretel flirts with Lieutenant Kotler (Rupert Friend), a blond Arayan type in lieutenant's uniform who works at the villa and joins the family at dinner. But Father's questioning reveals that the Lieutenant's own father fled to Switzerland because he didn't like the way things were going, and Kotler gets in trouble for not reporting his father for that. A remark the young lieutenant makes reveals to Mother (Vera Farmiga) what the foul-smelling smoke from the \"farm\" means, and she breaks down, and eventually demands that she and the children be sent back to Berlin. Lieutenant Kotler seems to overcompensate by being particularly brutal to Pavel, but he is sent to the front. Father's own mother showed her lack of sympathy for the Nazis at the going away party before the family moved. She refuses to come to visit. Bruno begins to question whether Father is a good man, as Shmuel says his is. He has tried to ignore the tutor's propaganda but he realizes that Pavel and Shmuel are Jews and that they're supposed to be enemies. At one point he betrays Shmuel, but he regrets it deeply and pays a great price to compensate. News that against his wishes Bruno's going to be taken away from his secret friend leads him to take more drastic action, leading to a shocking climax.The film, immaculately shot and subtle in its unfolding, reminded me of 50's classics like Carol Reed's 'The Fallen Idol' and Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment's 'Jeux interdits' ('Forbidden Games)', haunting depictions of a father figure whose perfection becomes suspect and the twisted secrets the horrors of wartime force upon the very young. The idea of children's concealments becoming far more serious than they admit also suggests Andrew Birkin's amazing film version of Ian McEwan's 'The Cement Garden.' Herman and his gifted cast and crew--the settings are rich and impressive--are treading on virtually sacred ground with hardly a misstep. In their essential roles Asa Butterfield is a subtle young actor and Jack Scanlon is touching and real as his counterpart across the Holocaust divide.Beautifully done as it is, 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas' risks at times seeming merely a conceit. In its rethinking of the War from a child of Nazis' privileged (because innocent) perspective it is somewhat contrived, as a young-adult book on such a special subject risks being. The finale, though harrowing, would seem far-fetched if it were not so sudden and overwhelming. This film hasn't the intensity and veracity of 'Fateless,' Lajos Koltai's Hungarian film based on Nobel winner Imre Kert\u00e9sz's autobiographical novel and screenplay about a teenager surviving concentration camp life. But on the other hand, this film, being all in English, strangely takes on an even more universal quality, and provides a unique experience full of dark ironies only the perky English voices and the generally comfy settings can evoke. For some of us the horror of the Holocaust seems exotic and remote. Wishful-thinking complicity in evil-doing is much closer to home.",

            "content": "Around Remembrance Day I like to think about the sacrifices that have been made, and also the horrors of WWII so I'm drawn to films set in that time period. The trouble is that I often find myself surrounded by my family at the time and some of my nephews and family members are a bit sensitive. \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" is a movie about the holocaust that is tame enough to be seen by children and works as a drama that will appeal adults as well. I suppose in retrospect I have some mixed feelings about the fact that the movie is at times very sweet and does go out of it's way to tug at your heartstrings a bit, but I have to give it credit for being emotionally effective. Based on the book by John Boyne, it's the story of two 9-year-old boys separated by a fence that become friends. Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) is a Jewish inmate in a Nazi extermination camp. Bruno (Asa Butterfield) is the lonely son of the camps Commander.The picture is very approachable, which is weird to say about a film dealing with the Nazi concentration camps, but I feel like it works in its favor. Some people might not watch this film if it had been rated R or didn't have children as the protagonists. Because the whole thing is seen through the eyes of children and their parents, it makes It easier to digest for younger viewers that can't (and shouldn't) see harsher R-rated films about the horrific events. This different viewpoint also offers a unique perspective that keeps the material fresh, even if you are familiar with the facts. The acting is very good, especially from Asa Butterfield and Jack Scanlon. Even though part of the film's emotional resonance comes straight from the non-fictional truths that anyone coming into the film already knows, these wouldn't have the same impact if it was handled by amateur performances. Director Mark Herman also does a good job by making all of the characters human. Although a lot of people in this story do evil things, none are without any redeeming characteristics and this serves to remind us that what happened wasn't some kind of alien invasion; it was human beings doing these things to one another.I think people are going to be split about the ending. Yeah it's touching, but it's also kind of an \"easy\" ending in the sense that it'd would be very hard not to be emotionally affected by It. Considering this is a fictional story I think it's meant more as a metaphor than an actual possible outcome for people of the time so it works for me. If you want a tasteful film about the holocaust that young audiences can enjoy, this more than does the job. My suggestion is that you keep the remote handy to answer some of the questions that will come up, but if your 7-year-old is wondering what Remembrance Day and World War II was about, this is a good jumping point.

            "content": "The dreadful and horrendous events of the Holocaust have been tackled by many films, the best of which have been Spielberg's \"Schindler's List\" and Polanski's \"The Pianist\", both of which were appropriately bleak but offered at least some message of hope. With \"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\", director Mark Herman has adapted John Boyne's highly acclaimed novel which sees a small part of this greatest of crimes through the eyes of an innocent and oblivious child.Bruno, the central character, is an eight year old who moves with his family to their new home in the country. His father, unknown to him, is no ordinary soldier but an SS commandant, in charge of the camp which borders his new home. All around him, events occur which he thinks nothing of. He merely wonders about the strange \"farm\" next door, and why all of the farmers wear pyjamas all day, every day. Fond of adventure and bored in his lonely home, he sneaks into the back garden and comes to the edge of the camp where he befriends a young boy, Shmuel, who lives inside it.The handling of the Holocaust is very well done here, with the dramatic irony brought on by the audience's foreknowledge providing many questions about the people who carried out this crime. The central relationship between the two boys is incredibly touching. Asa Butterfield and Jack Scanlon deliver two fantastic child performances, adept beyond their years. They provide the emotional and tragic heart of the film.Around this is the family situation, with the increasingly strained relationship between the boy's parents. The father, who is this almost unbelievable mixture of loving family man and orchestrator of mass murder, is brilliantly played by David Thewlis, whilst Vera Farmiga is excellent as the mother.However, this film is all about its ending. I'm not going to give anything away here, but I cannot remember an ending this bleak and distressing for a very long time, if at all. There will be very few dry eyes in the house as the full horror of this chapter in history is driven home. This film should be watched by younger viewers, but there shouldn't be anyone younger than eleven coming to see this and David Thewlis has said that parents should go with children of this age and only take those who will be able to have a conversation about it afterwards.What this film has to offer for older viewers is an impressive, well-made, moving and powerful piece of drama, though it will be a tough watch. What younger viewers will also take from it is the terrible reality of this event. This may not stand up with the aforementioned great films about the Holocaust, but the fact that it is aimed at a young audience is important. After all, \"He who does not learn about history is doomed to repeat it\".4 stars out of 5",

            "content": "During World War 2 Bruno (Asa Butterfield) , a German of eight years, leads a somewhat sheltered life in the comforts of wealth in Berlin. When Bruno's father (David Thewlis) is promoted to a high ranking officer of the Nazi regime, Bruno and his family have to relocate to his father's new post, which happens to be nearby to a concentration camp. After many frustrating days of boredom Bruno journeys to the concentration camp, thinking it is a farm, and starts up a friendship with Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), a Jewish boy.From the very start the story is displayed in a very linear and uncomplicated fashion. There is no extravagant story telling, no attempts to make the story more then it is. However this is not to say that the film is devoid of depth, because it has plenty and can stir up many symbolic and thematic explanations which help enrich the viewing. But the simple process of the story is more the directors attempt in keeping with the innocence of Bruno to help relate the viewer to him. The reason this is perhaps done is because while the film is relatively faithful to the original novel, many details have been altered. One such is the literary device of a process of discovery from the reader into the true context of the story just as Bruno begins to learn more of the real world. As such the film adaptation will inevitably make it more difficult for the viewer to relate to Bruno because we become the out- group to his innocence. The simple storytelling works though it could have been more complex, including many details that were omitted. But the film's crowning moment comes in it's final 15 or so minutes in what is a harrowing, emotionally poignant affair, and perhaps one the most draining, yet overwhelmingly crafted endings ever to grace cinema. It alone is worth the admission of seeing this film. Authenticity also becomes a slight problem once again in regards to how the concentration camps would have actually worked, but this is never the point as the film bases itself merely on thematic elements.The level of acting is not astounding by any means. but its is generally favourable. Each actor and actress seems to aptly suit their respective character, but Butterfield must be commended for doing a great job of making the innocence of his character appear so real. It must be said that none of the characters speak in a German accent though they are portraying Germans. While this seems like a setback, it really is not much of an issue as it does not make the experience any less riveting as it already is, but for those truly adamant on authenticity they might be a little disappointed.There is no sex, nudity or language. Violence is more figurative then literal as the film's subject matter pertains around a concentration camp. The final scene is haunting though not visually shown. While the the PG-13 rating is apt, it is difficult to think that any child at that age could truly comprehend the film's content.The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is a cinematic wonder which easily deserves a watch from any avid moviegoer. While there are a few niggles, none of which truly affects the overall quality unless you allow it to do so, the film is laden with reasonable acting and story-telling at it's very best with director Mark Herman cementing this with a conclusion so filled with brilliance that's its difficult to think of anything of late that quite matches it. In fact there are few films of late which can even match the cinematic wonder that is The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas.",

Movies have a trick of making you try to anticipate what is going to happen, and putting your own wishes into that conclusion. I realised after the end of this film that the tragedy lies in thinking that anyone's life is worth more than anyone else's life. In other words, who is more precious and whose death is more tragic? Surely in that situation, the final scene was terrible, no matter who was involved. The challenge of this film is to see the holocaust from a different perspective and try to see it through a child's eyes. The film has a matter-of-fact approach, but that helped me to see events through the child's eyes and imagine how what happened would appear if you were a boy who doesn't know what is going on, who has a spirit of adventure and a open mind. If you could be like that, what would you think about war? Does it make any sense at all? Being able to challenge the dogma that is being forced upon you is the spirit of freedom.I hope that some people seeing this excellent film will come away with some innocence restored and some faith in the power of friendship and love to overcome violence.",

The most all-encompassing indoctrination was directed not to adults, but to children, especially to children like Bruno, sons and daughters of the \"racial elite\" who served as officers of the SS. The premise of this film is so ludicrous it amounts to an insult to the memory of the slaughtered millions. A realistic Bruno would not have befriended any Jew, especially one already imprisoned.

            "content": "I know people will get upset when I say this but this film bored the ever-living hell out of me. Personally I think that we need another three hour (actually it was 90 minutes but it felt like three hours) dull-fest about the holocaust like we need a hole in the head.Don't get me wrong, I think that the holocaust was an atrocity of proportions so staggering that it is difficult to conceive. And that is partly the point. I cannot empathise with the people in the death camps, surely no one who wasn't there could. I understand on a purely intellectual level that the suffering was unimaginable - UNIMAGINABLE, as in not possible to imagine, at all, ever. The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas follows Bruno, the young son of a senior Nazi, as his family moves to the country where his father put in charge of running what the boy initially thinks is a farm of some kind. Exploring, Bruno meets (through an electric fence) a Jewish boy of his own age and the two talk. Despite fine acting on the part of the two central child actors the film is meaningless and unrealistic. Sadly it follows the unerringly \"safe\" route of so many films of its type by showing us the horror with none of the insight. It has the usual cast of \"goodies\" who are unaware of, shocked by or victims of the holocaust and the \"baddies\" who are monstrous almost inhuman figures whose motivations remain unknown and unexplored. Even as he is being led to the denouement the protagonist remains wilfully ignorant of the nature of the camp that his father is running which is not only stupid but actually quite insulting.The mistake that lies at the core of films like Boy in the Striped Pyjamas and Schindler's List and twenty other films about the holocaust is that they concentrate on the suffering of the victims of the holocaust to the exclusion of all else. Implying that we can, in even the tiniest way, empathise with people who went through this experience diminishes the pain of those who did. They place us in the metal position of the victim, unable to affect the outcome of this terror while ignoring the far harder truth, that what we should be frightened of is not victimisation but becoming the victimisers. By showing us only the horror of the people in the camps films like this one run the risk of allowing us to forget the horror that we could be the ones running them. The central message of the film appears to be that the holocaust was bad - really, really bad. Good God, it's sixty years afterwards, is there anyone out there who doesn't know that by now? Is there a man, woman or child on the planet who wouldn't recognise a picture of Aldof Hitler as The Most Evil Man Ever (TM) and be aware of his attempted murder of an entire race? I somewhat doubt it.If you want to see a truly gut-wrenchingly terrifying film about the holocaust watch the little known HBO TV movie Conspiracy (2001) starring Kenneth Branagh and Stanley Tucci. That film contains not a single gunshot or image of the holocaust and yet can, quite justifiably in my opinion, claim to be both the best WWII movie ever made and the most coldly horrifying examination of humanity's capacity for evil. Stacked against that, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is quasi-feel good holocaust tourism.",

The question is: Is the story plausible? The answer to that question is yes. Children did live in these concentration camps. Not many, but some, and inmates did interact with people outside. There were literally hundreds of concentration camps located throughout Nazi occupied Europe and given the number of camps and the huge number of people detained, interacting was not only possible, it was inevitable. Maybe the movie stretches matters a bit regarding how the two boys meet, but the idea on which it is based is valid. Should the audience feel any sympathy for the Nazi family? Why not? Maybe not for the husband, the commandant of the camp, who is hardcore Nazi, but certainly for the wife and daughter who clearly are victims too. This movie should be treated for what it is: a work of fiction that deals with certain themes that are universally applicable. These themes include friendship, culpability, loyalty, indeed the whole question of consciousness and morality. The wife's outrage is enough to show that she for one did not accept what was happening in the camps and did what she could to make her feelings known. Yet the most pathetic character is the commandant himself whose destructiveness and brutality is matched only by his stupidity which has tragic consequences and which he realizes to be the case after it's too late.",

Jack Scanlon plays the boy of the title who discovers friendship despite the cruel conditions for which he lives. David Thewlis plays Bruno's Nazi father who will learn the hard way regarding the sense of loss, and Vera Farminga plays his wife unaware of the situation at hand.

            "content": "Not only did this film strongly depict the novel, but took it to the next level by giving the story more of a plot and giving some of the characters more depth. The locations were perfectly chosen and beautifully shot and strongly carried the film's storyline as a result. Many of the actors were perfectly cast, including Asa Butterfield as Bruno who emphasised the innocence of youth, Rupert Friend as Lt Kotler who gave the film that sense of danger, darkening the film's plot, and David Hayman as Pavel who made great emphasis on the overall suffering that was taking place. Vera Farmiga deserves the most appraisal, as she gave an extremely powerful performance as the distraught mother dealing with the aspects of the Holocaust and the ordeal that she is going through when she learns of her son's circumstance ends the film with an orchestratic climax. Nevertheless, David Thewlis was wrongly cast as the Father, as he lacked the presence of a Nazi officer and was not at all convincing with his acting. Jack Scanlon was also not at all convincing as Shmuel, either in presence or when acting, which let the film down considering his importance in the plot.Some scenes were done better than others, the emphasis of the incinerators was all most too painful to watch and the questioning of Lt Kotler at the dining table gave the film more of an edge. Unlike the novel though, many aspects of the Holocaust were briskly skimmed over, which was due mainly to the lack of screen time of Shmuel, which made the overall concept somewhat casual at times. Overall, an interesting concept of The Holocaust that definitely worth viewing.",

            "content": "Accidentally or not, this film is not about lost innocence. It is terribly tragic, sad and even depressing but it is not about lost innocence. It in many ways celebrates innocence in the most horrible of circumstances. Whether that is what the writer intended, I do not know. But that is the result. I had life long studies of the Holocaust. This is certainly an excellent film concerning the Holocaust. The goodness of the characters is stunning amid the horrible darkness of the Holocaust. Both children retain there innocence through every moment of the film and even hold hands at the worst. They play and have fun no matter what the circumstances. They don't need money, cell phones, video games, big houses or mountains. They have they innocence and imagination that all people are meant to have. This is clear in the scene in which one of the boys is offered a chance to leave the area. He refused to leave. This seemed to bewilder some of the people in the audience. But the boy had a great friend and had great fun on a daily basis with his friend. He refused to even consider leaving to go back to his great world in a nice city or anywhere else. This reminds me of the way kids can play in the worst refugee camps in the world and still have fun. It is not how long you live but what is in a person's heart that matters. This is another deep meaning of this film.There are a number of fine people in this story who show their goodness as ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. The worst and best of humanity is often seen in real life in war or genocide. The mother is a fine woman who rejects her husband's involvement in the Holocaust. The Grandmother is another who rejects the evil philosophy of the Holocaust. Pavel is a very good man as the slave houseman and shows incredible decency. In contrast, we see the worst in human nature in the father who is the commandant of the death camp. Also the immature and pure mean young Nazi soldier is a cruel man. This film also illustrates the importance of empathy, sympathy and the ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes. There is also the 12 year old daughter. The 12 year old daughter is copy cat entirely brainwashed by Nazi propaganda. She is the utter opposite of the historical figure Ann Frank. Even this girls affection for the mean Nazi soldier is nothing like the genuine affection by Ann Frank of a teen boy in the tremendous old film Diary of Ann Frank. The young German son of the Nazi commandant slowly comes to terms with the evil system of the Nazi's. He is, in effect, an 8 year old member of the German resistance without even knowing it. He also has the ability to know when he is wrong in the scene in which he apologizes to the inmate boy for not telling the truth about something to the mean soldier because of fear. He is also blessed with the ability to see truth. His young rationality allows him to see through the lies that Jews are somehow not human. He comes to see that his father is consumed by evil. Yet, he balances his enthusiasm with truth. We also, see the great respect the prisoner boy has for his own father. Power, status, and money mean nothing to these children.Ultimately, this film is terribly tragic. It reminded me of Anne Frank who was a real life person who maintained her strong heart in the midst of terrible circumstances. It is this belief that sustains good verses evil. As long as someone believes in this spirit these people were ultimately victorious. The old saying of \"never again\" can also include \"never forget\" these individual people who had so many tragic stories and so many moments confronting incredibly powerful evil forces.",

The movie starts slow and it gives us time to understand the whole scenario and premise of the movie. The best part of the movie that it has successfully captured the emotions, fears and commotion during World War II. There are little little things in the movie which indicates the seriousness and violence happening around in Germany. Asa Butterfield (Bruno) provides the utmost innocence & charm to his character and it's his brilliant portrayal which left me speechless in the end. Vera Farmiga is heavenly talented and exquisite. Her elegance and brilliant performance leaves a strong impact. The real surprise for me this time was Rupert Friend, I always think of him as just Keira Knightley's finance but again and again he proved me wrong. first in \"The Young Victoria\" where he stand next to Emily Blunt neck to neck & gave a superb performance and now in \"The Boy in Stripped Pyjamas\" he completely left me speechless, he was so powerful & brilliant in his expressions, dialogue delivery that I was actually stunned every time he screamed in the movie. I think he is absolutely underrated & I hope he gets his due very soon in Hollywood. Jack Scanlon (Shmuel) and David Thewlin did a respectable job.

            "content": "Unplanned but quite coincidentally I have seen three fine but different movies with a Nazi German theme the past couple of weeks. \"Valkyrie\" is about one of the failed attempts to assassinate Hitler, \"The Reader\" is about a former German SS guard, a lady being tried post-war for crimes. And now this one, \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas.\" Unlike \"The Reader\" where characters spoke in English but with a German accent, or \"Valkyrie\" where the characters initially spoke German then faded to English, this one makes no pretenses. The cast is heavily British and they simply speak in a straightforward British accent. This threw me a little at the beginning, but then went with it with no problem.At the center of it all is young Asa Butterfield playing 8-year-old Bruno. They live in a usual neighborhood but his dad, a German officer, gets transferred. His new job is as the head of one of the concentration camps, one where Jews are killed then incinerated.Young Bruno doesn't understand any of this, and when he sees people in the distance, looking from his second-story bedroom window, thinks they are farmers. Especially because one of those \"farmers\" works at their home, often peeling potatoes. When young Bruno falls and skins his knee the prisoner bandages him up, and tells Bruno that he is a doctor, which he was.Eventually young Bruno explores, and comes upon the barbed wire fence enclosing the compound. He sees a small boy, also 8, in a secluded corner basically hiding out, but when the whistle blows takes his wheelbarrow and goes to meet the others. The boy wears a prison uniform, and that is what Bruno takes for \"Striped Pajamas.\" Good movie, of a very difficult subject. The message is rather surprising.MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW: While Bruno is simply becoming friends with the imprisoned boy, and still not understanding the gravity of the situation, nor his father's job, he catches a glimpse of a propaganda film being shown to officers in his house. It was made at that very camp, and depicts the prisoners living well and having a somewhat enjoyable time. So Bruno decides he will join them and be able to play with his new friend. He digs under the fence, puts on a prisoner uniform and hat, and goes with the boy. As fate would have it, that was the day the boy and others in his dormitory were to be marched to the chamber, gassed, and then incinerated, to make room for new prisoners. Dad was too late, his own son died along with the prisoners. You reap what you sow.",

I found its implausible, no make that impossible plot line acted wholly against the credibility that such a serious subject deserves and found myself by the end of the film with that awkward feeling of having been manipulated which should never be part of a truly satisfying cinematic experience.Yes, it's well shot and the attention to period detail is satisfactory, but that should surely be taken as granted in modern-day films, particularly after Spielberg put down the marker with \"Schindler's List\". Some of the actors look right, particularly the \"only following orders\" German P.O.W. Commandant husband and his ignorant, unwilling wife, but others don't. Maybe I'm just too familiar with David Hayman in his brilliant white shirts in TV's \"Trial and Retribution\" but here he appears miscast and overdoes the nervous mannerisms and tics of his character. Sheila Hancock gets a brief useless cameo as the grandparent with a little bit of a conscience but again why an English actress in the part? Most glaringly and not for the first time in a war movie with child actors, the audience is expected to accept the kids talking in the plummiest English accents, whilst everyone else in the movie is in the correct German dialect - I can't believe there aren't competent German child actors who don't have a mastery of English - this anachronism, coupled throughout with oddly jarring use of familiar English language phrasing and syntax, further weakens the necessary veracity. And while I'm in a kicking mood, I'll put the boot in too to an over intrusive musical soundtrack. Far too many scenes are overdecorated by the composer's background piano-based trillings - again, for me, for films on this theme, less is more and silence invariably speaks louder than almost any kind of musical accompaniment.Worst of all is the sheer ridiculousness of the plot. Like the much-praised and in my opinion, equally over-rated \"Life is Beautiful\", the central premise of the eight year old German and captive Jewish boys meeting and striking up a relationship is too fantastic for words plus they're too often given adult lines to speak. You can see from a long way out that a big tragic finish is in the making and sure enough, we're not disappointed. To be fair, the scenes where the Jewish prisoners, (plus one) are herded like cattle into the gas chambers are sensitively handled but again am I the only person who was mildly offended by the climactic scene where Bruno's parents are shown frantically failing to find and then bewailing afterwards the loss of their beloved son, while hundreds of Jews, mothers, fathers, sons and daughters, equally beloved of their own families share the same fate?Sentimentality and incredible plotting always weaken war movies, no matter how well-meaning their intent and serious the message. This particular movie is guilty on all fronts as far as I'm concerned and failed to move me accordingly.",

            "content": "World War II and Nazism are themes that cinema has explored abundantly, and the list of good films grows every decade. The particularity that makes this film remarkable is that it takes us to see everything through the innocent eyes of a child, who cannot understand what is really happening, and to what extent his own family is involved in the atrocities that we know happened.Bruno is a child who lives a sheltered and carefree childhood. He is the son of a German army officer, and the family is wealthy. He knows that his country is at war and that his father is important, and he is helping his country to win the war. But this is basically all he knows or understands about what goes on in the Germany of his time. When his father is ordered to go to the countryside, Bruno is very sad to leave his house and his friends, but he meets a strange child, who wears striped pajamas and lives inside a fenced enclosure, which his mother does not wanted him to see. She's the only one in the family who really understands what her husband is there to do, and the only one to protest it all.The film is based on a novel written by John Boyne, but despite the source material and the film's fidelity to it, I wonder how immune a ten-year-old could really be to the avalanches of Nazi propaganda, considering that his father was a high-ranking official and the family had natural political connections to the Hitler regime. I don't mean to say that I disagree with Bruno's innocence and the way he doesn't know what's really going on, but it just seems hard to believe, since the Nazis used all means, including youth organizations and public education, to convey their ideology to younger people.The cast does a truly remarkable job. The spotlight naturally goes to Asa Butterfield and Jack Scanlon. The two young actors knew how to work perfectly and created a very good working relationship, which gives credibility to the friendship of their characters. It's their effort that makes the film particularly touching and human. David Thewlis also did an extraordinary job, incarnating in his character the contradiction of a loving and caring family man who is responsible for the planned and meticulous slaughter of a huge number of people. Is he a monster? Was he turned into a monster? In clear contrast, Vera Farmiga gives life to a courageous mother and wife, who finds herself in the need to protect her children from a reality she cannot agree with, and in which her husband is totally immersed. She is, like Bruno, able to see the human and innocent side of the people her husband says aren't \"really people\", even though she eventually has to silence what she really thinks about German politics in order not to suffer. Its consequences. Amber Beattie, on the other hand, shows us what happened to many German children and young people, victims of massive Nazi propaganda from an early age. Nevertheless, she is human, and her love interest in a young SS man reveals it, though it sends her further into the Nazi frenzy. The film also has the very relevant participation of Rupert Friend and David Hayman.Shot mostly in locations around Budapest, the film has a very beautiful, vivid, colorful and luminous cinematography, which fades and shadows as the film moves towards the end. There is a remarkable contrast between Bruno's house in the city (warmer colors, more light) and the gloomy house he goes to later (washed out colors, shadows, less light and a much heavier and more tense environment). The sets, costumes and props are good and in keeping with the time and context. I didn't see any anachronism errors. The soundtrack, signed by James Horner, is memorable and stays in the ear.",

I was also interested in the different view of a very well covered subject and I'm yet to see a bad performance by David Thewlis.Quite quickly I noticed it's not going to be as sincere as I figured it would. You can easily spot so many underlinings that I knew it's not gonna be too subtle. Kids playing war, bleak new house, rain when appropriate (you even see the sun is actually shining) .. the list goes on.Some have praised the child actors, but I wasn't convinced. I can't quite pinpoint what it was, but I didn't find them very believable. I'm quite sure the script played it's part here.David Thewlis makes an OK performance with what is given to him, but watching (the now very popular) Vera Farmiga as his wife is a painful experience. Her performance was way over the top at most times.This movie felt like it was just going for the Oscar's by being politically correct in every sense, but there is nothing that would really grab and twist your mind to think of the holocaust any differently than we are used to. Maybe we are not supposed to either, but I just felt the movie didn't serve much purpose, other than dig for a cheapish emotional response from the viewer.

In Germany I will neglect the side of the Commandant of the camp who is a SS and yet also has a personal life, a wife, two children, parents, a father who is on the good side and a mother who is clearly critical. A promotion for a SS officer is to become a camp Commandant and do, under strict secrecy, what is expected from him: to build a better German nation without any Jews, and if possible a world in the image of that German nation.The film shows very well how the whole ideology is built on propaganda, which is a pack of lies, or ,if you prefer a pack of lying wolves that are after you to get your souls down into hell, in the name of the Greater future of the German nation. There is not much to say about the details of that machine. The details are there, clear and obvious. No comment, just cry with rage at such dumb inhumanity, really for both sides, the German nation itself and their victims.The film is a lot more interesting with the eight year old son of that SS Commandant who escapes from the home of Herr Kommandant to explore the forest behind the mansion and come to the fence where he discovers an eight year old Jewish boy who is hungry and sad, Shmuel. Shmuel has nothing to learn about the life outside the camp, but the other boy, Bruno, has to discover what the camp is and that it is no YMCA simmer camp. That takes time and a treason in the middle, but boys will be boys and they will invent a project to come together. Since Shmuel cannot come to the outside why not Bruno going into the camp.And that will be the drama. No survivors please with the final solution, and frankly it's better like that. Which of the two boys could have survived without being damaged for life, or till death ensues.And the film can end on the tears of the mother and sister and on the despair of the SS Commandant of a father. We will not be given the logical end for him after such a tragedy. Death at times can be sweet and desirable.This is a masterpiece of poignancy even if suspense (who cares about suspense in a subject we all know by heart and regret with all our hearts) is rather light because boys will be boys and boys have always been boys. And love, or call it friendship if you prefer being a prude, has no limits, no divides, no abyss in the middle. Love is unified by definition and love comes no matter what and is for life and death. Happy are those who can share a life full of discoveries and then a death full of satisfaction. I am afraid the two boys met in death with apprehension and fear but a lot of courage in their acceptance of that fate as being a fate in which they can hold hands, and they did, naked under the fumes of the death-inflicting shower.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",

Through the camp's electrified fence, their friendship grows and Bruno gradually learns of the sinister nature of his father's work.What the film drives home is that not all Germans approved of the Nazi regime's plans and ideals. Is it a sad movie? Of course it is (particularly for mothers. hint hint). The Holocaust is such a grim subject that it's impossible, and beyond the point, to make a film about it that isn't sad. What is important is what this film does differently from prior Holocaust films. It's a story about friendship, redemption and fulfilling oaths. The exact events are fictitious, but does that really matter? There were millions of deaths and there were some German sympathizers, so the story rings true in any case.Asa Butterfield gives a genuinely sweet performance as Bruno. He is imaginative, good-hearted, and almost entirely in the dark about what is going on, as would any 8 year old. And though he is in the dark, he sees clearer than many people around him because he's such an innocent. As such, we often see things from his perspective. Vera Farmiga has an interesting character evolution as Bruno's mother. She goes from ignorance and obedience to rebellious as she quickly sees her husband and the 'camps' in a new light. David Thewlis is cold yet not uncaring to his family, though he seems to always put his duties before fatherhood. It is interesting to note that Nazis did try to keep their families in the dark about what was going on, much as they 'believed' that their actions were the correct ones.One minor performance that was actually the most moving for me was the part of Pavel the Jewish servant (David Hayman) who was previously a doctor. He says practically nothing, but you can see it in his eyes just bursting to come out of him.The end of the film is telegraphed and seems to come in terribly slow motion. Much as the film is light and has self-aware humor at the beginning, it's often terribly dark. It's a good film, and a decent tearjerker.Heavy, compelling, sensitive and sad, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas gets a B+",

With a fairly accurate treatment by the director of the film, Mark Herman, the story of an innocent boy in the middle of one of the worst moments in history, offers us a view of what it was like to be in the middle of a conflict in the eyes of a lad who knew nothing about the horrors.Bruno's world, as he knew it, comes to a complete stop when he is informed he and his family will have to leave Berlin on account of his father's promotion. One can imagine how devastating it is for the little one to part with childhood mates. What Bruno didn't count on was the absence of playmates in his new surroundings.Bruno's father has been promoted and is now in charge of a labor camp, an euphemism for Auschwitz, the place where Jews were exterminated. The boy spies people behind the barbed wire dressed in what appears to be striped pajamas. Little does he know the horrors performed in that place. The only thing he notices is the strong smells and the smoke billowing into the country air. Bruno has a first hand look at one of those people when Pavel, a slave-like servant comes to help in the kitchen.One day Bruno goes near the fence of the camp where he sees a boy about his age dressed in the striped garments. They like one another right away. The only problem is Shmuel, the boy behind the fence can't get out to play with Bruno. Their friendship is put to a test when Schmuel, who is brought to replace Pavel, is caught eating a pastry. Bruno, when questioned, denies he has anything to do with it, when it was at his insistence Schmuel took the cake.The boys continue to bond at the remote corner of the compound, both on opposite sides of the partition. Bruno's mother who catches on to what is really going on in the labor camp, gets sick upon knowing the truth. The father determines it's better to send his wife and kids away to a relative to get them out of the way. Little prepares the old man to realize the fate that awaits Bruno when he and Schmuel finally device a way to play together.Mark Herman, the director, got good performances, in general, out of his English cast. Asa Butterfield who portrays Bruno does wonders as the confused boy whose loyalty to a new friend is questioned, but who ultimately does the right thing. Vera Farmiga and David Thewlis are seen as the parents. Jack Scanlon appears as Schmuel. David Hayman, Rupert Friend, Richard Johnson and Sheila Hanckock, among others, do fine work as well.",

This was an event that has influenced modern Western Culture, helping to dismantle the ideas of racism and empire, though obviously those issues still exist. There have been some great films about the Holocaust such as Schindler's List, The Pianist, Sophie's Choice and Conspiracy. The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas can join them.Bruno (Asa Butterfield) was eight-year-old boy living happily with in Berlin during the Second World War. His father (David Thewlis) a senior SS Officer get a promotion and his family, mum (Vera Farmiga) and older sister Gretel (Amber Beattie) move to the countryside. Bruno quickly feels lonely, with no friends and his family placing restrictions on him, like not going to the strange 'farm' where people are only wearing 'pyjamas'. But Bruno defies his parents orders and goes to farm where he meets Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), a Jewish boy from a Concentration Camp. The two become friends and through the innocent eyes of a child the evils of Nazism are explored and challenged.The whole point of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is tell a story about the Holocaust through the eyes of a child. A young child would not have an concept of prejudicing someone and can question the groundless basis for these views. This could have been a story that could have worked period, such as Apartheid South Africa, the Deep South of America, Greek and Turkish relations in Cyprus, Israelis and Palestinians, etc\u0085. The director Mark Herman handles this subject with great skill and really does capture the mind of a child brilliantly. As well the Holocaust which focuses on the children on both sides of the divide, Herman takes care to show other elements of Nazism, such as the education which was another wing of propaganda to indoctrinate the youth. This was shown with Gretel who became more hardcore about believing in the ideologies and shows the lengths individuals and dictatorships would go to pass on their beliefs. But I'm sure this theme and other sub-plots were developed more in the novel then it was in the film Herman shows he understands the subject and the period. There was great set-designs and show the different ideologies with a high-ranking Nazi family. He was obviously a talented director.Herman also wrote a brilliant screenplay and with top-notch acting the film set out to show three dimensional. It could have been really easy to show the father to be a monster but it took the more braver and realistic move to show that he was a loving father to his children, yet was committing the most unspeakable evil for his work. A harsh junior officer played by Rupert Friend was given more reason why he was a horrible person to the Jews: he was also someone wanted to be good with the children. Butterfield and Scanlon are both excellent in their roles and are heart-breaking and compelling performances. Beattie and Thewlis too were very good. Farmiga at first seemed a bit too glamorous as the moment, but she too showed her range as an actress and offer a decent English accent.It was a bold effort to make the film more accessible to children, but it is very hard-hitting about the subject. It should only be watched by children around 10-year-old plus. This is a brilliant film, one of the best of 2008.",

There are few films which can accurately describe or even come close to the 'Final Solution' or the full horror this maniacal regime created.

The story as taken from the Boyne novel is of a German Officer (David Thewlis, superb acting) who with a promotion is assigned to be the Commandant of Aushwitz Concentration camp. There his innocent son Bruno (Asa Butterfield) befriends a Jewish boy, named Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) who is the same age. Unknow to his family, Bruno becomes curious as to the real world behind the barbed wire and decides to learn more.

What Bruno fails to realize at first is that what he believes to be a farm behind his house is actually a concentration camp and across the fence is a Jewish boy (Zac Mattoon O'Brien). There are so many interesting things brought up in this film that it's hard to believe that director/writer Herman got everything in under 90-minutes. The movie is devastating, shocking, depressing and it never holds back any punches in showing what horrors were being done due to hatred. I've seen message boards where people asked if we needed another film that dealt with the Holocaust and after seeing this I'd have to say yes. What I loved most is that often time serious subjects are held away from children and parents will debate when children are old enough to knows the horrors of the world. The Holocaust here is seen and learned through the eyes of a kid and the movie does a masterful job at showing everything as innocent as it can as if a child was seeing it. The German boy is being taught to hate Jews even though he's not sure why. The boy sees a broken down Jewish man being beaten yet he doesn't understand why. He doesn't understand why his new friend has to stay behind the fence. The German boy only knows that he's suppose to hate yet he's curious as to why. Not only are the two kids characters fully written but so are the German parents. The father risking everything to be a good soldier and his wife (Vera Farmiga) a person against the slaughter of the Jews. Both are given their reasons in believing what they do and they will have to face these thoughts at the end of the movie. The effect is also seen through Bruno's older sister, someone who doesn't stop to think about why she hates and instead just hates those different than her. I won't spoil the ending but I will say it's downright shocking how everything plays out and I couldn't help but walk away from the film feeling devastated and sick to my stomach. The amount of guts the director shows will be the reason this movie will probably be around fifty years from now even though there are a few shortcomings at the start of the film. The performances by the main four characters are all brilliantly done and should be remembered at Oscar time, although I doubt they will be. This isn't an easy film to watch as the majority of it is downright depressing and the only uplifting moment, shared by the two boys, happens in the most horrific event.",

            "content": "Films like Life is Beautiful (1997) and The Boy in the Striped Pajamas (2008) shock. They shock more by suggestion than by clear exposition. They are shocked by the contrast between childhood innocence and society plunged into the chaos of intolerance. Lacking maturity to understand the reality that surrounds them like adults, children can be, even without knowing it and unintentionally, sources of questioning about the pillars of that same reality.Written and directed by Mark Herman from the book by John Boyne, the screenplay set during World War II revolves around little Bruno (Butterfield), an eight-year-old boy who, the son of a Third Reich officer (Thewlis) ), has the typical concerns of an ordinary child: bored with the family's move to the countryside, where the father will manage a \"work camp\", he soon finds himself bored by the lack of company - and thus, it is with joy that he meets a little boy (Scanlon) who, living on the other side of the electrified fence of the \"farm\" next to his house, seems to wear \"pajamas\" all day.In The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, horror and innocence join hands and form a play whose effect for the spectator is a mixture of delight and repulsion. Mark Hermann strategically scattered elements such as soldiers, dogs, flags with swastikas in the scenes (something similar to what you see, by the way, in The Book Stealing Girl). In the first few minutes, the contextualization of the historical period portrayed takes place. Innocence is reinforced by the soundtrack that evokes relaxation. What will come, however, is the horror. An implicit horror, but, perhaps precisely because of that, intense.Upon being promoted within Hitler's regime, a commander (David Thewlis) moves his family to the countryside. The impact of the move is greater for son Bruno (Asa Butterfield), who finds himself in front of a huge house, but without friends. One day, he meets a strange boy on a strange farm inhabited by people wearing strange striped \"pajamas\". A fence separates them. Or almost. Bruno and his friend Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) ease the physical separation with dialogues that bring them together, they who are from such opposite worlds. One enters the other's universe and the friendship that is established is charming. As the relationship deepens and consolidates, the viewer is invited to recover what he knows about Nazism and to put together the pieces of the horror panel that contextualizes this approximation of the two children.It is easy to see how this premise could quickly turn into a Manichean and artificial melodrama with the clear purpose of flooding the viewers' eyes with tears, but to Herman's credit, the film gains strength precisely because of its restrained approach, which even avoids even casting two excessively \"funny\" children to play the main duo, privileging the spontaneity of the little performers who, thus, appear believable and, for that very reason, more touching. Likewise, the filmmaker doesn't try to hammer the cruelties of the Nazi regime into the public's mind, aware that we are already more than familiar with the horrors perpetrated by Hitler and his cohorts. This strategy, by the way, is already clear in the initial sequence of the projection, when the director's camera follows some German boys as they play carelessly around the city, eventually encountering dozens of Jews who, under the brutal supervision of Nazi soldiers, are forced to empty their houses in order to be taken to the concentration camps - something the merry children, absorbed in their games, obviously do not notice (and even if they did, they would not be able to understand the implications of what they saw).His, by the way, is the key point of The Boy in the Striped Pajamas: throughout almost the entire narrative, we witness that terrible period from the point of view of children, who, naive or immersed in their own uncompromising world, often do not perceive or understand what is happening.Furthermore, the contrast between the realities of Bruno and Schmuel (which, in a way, refers to the two friends in The Kite Runner) could not be greater: while the former is a healthy and happy boy, the latter appears with his teeth rotted by malnutrition and with an air of painful tiredness to witness in a child - and it is even more touching to hear his first question when discovering that Bruno lives in the house located nearby: nothing about his toys or his parents, but if \"there are food there\". Bruno, on the other hand, upon hearing the information that his new friend is Jewish, reacts with a fright that is a consequence of the dozens of terrifying stories certainly narrated by anti-Semitic adults. Still, with the openness that only a child can exhibit, he soon discards his preconceived ideas when he realizes that, Jewish or not, Schmuel is a boy like him - and therefore an ideal playmate. In the same way, although the fear provoked by a repressive adult causes a serious disagreement between the boys, it is the childish sweetness of both that allows them, even when they are hurt, to be able to forgive themselves for the lie that, they know, was just a form of protect themselves from the cruelty of the world of elders.Mark Herman eventually also starts to focus on the eyes of adults, something almost inevitable for the course of the story - and, thus, we start to follow mainly Bruno's mother's growing disillusionment with her husband as she realizes the dimension of his actions. If initially she exhibits an equally revolting anti-Semitism (at one point, when she sees a Jewish prisoner in her house, she complains, as if she had come across a mouse: \"There was one of them in our kitchen!\"), the woman lived by Vera Farmiga eventually comes to realize the obvious: the humanity of these people. As if that weren't enough, she witnesses, terrified, the indoctrination of her eldest daughter by a Nazi professor, who actually brainwashes the impressionable girl - just like the \"shepherd\" I quoted in the first paragraph has been doing with his young followers (and with the disapproving acquiescence of parents, who thus become directly responsible for the prejudiced adults they are turning their children into).But if the film resonates well thematically, it is in its dramatic aspect that it really proves to be remarkable: with an impactful conclusion in its merciless irony, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas efficiently builds its climax through Michael Ellis' nervous editing, which switches focus. Of the narrative with surgical precision between the boys and the adults, and the great score by James Horner - who, normally so inclined to excess and self-repetition, here finds a great balance in commenting the plot without trying to lead it through excessive dramatization. . With this, Herman builds an ending steeped in pain and terror, reminding us of something that adults who take their children to follow sermons of intolerance and hate should always keep in mind: in the end, it is our children who pay - and dear - For the errors of judgment we have made. In the end, the film draws a strong critique of human ignorance, as it shows that children, without prejudice, without formed opinion, end up simply mixing for pleasure and for the company of another person. As we grow up and become involved with so many cultures and illusions, we become intolerant, irrational, and mean.The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a case in which the film adaptation of a literary work ends up being as or more involving than the book itself. The transposition to the big screen sought to have the greatest possible degree of fidelity to the original work, but gained some additions that enriched the story. It is the case of details in the final scenes and about the maturing process of Bruno's sister. Due to its many qualities and historical importance, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas proves to be a film for posterity.",

This film reflects the novel in that in comes off as a children's movie and not just because of the acting of Asa. This is a children's view of the Holocast totally in the way it is presented.At slightly over 90 minutes, I am glad that I have looked at the DVD of this film. The DVD features several scenes cut from the final film. At least 2 of those scenes should be put back into the film to make the film better. This is a case where the film editor went a little too far & there is no reason to shorten the movie this much. Adding a couple of these scenes would improve the film, particularly one sequence which has Asa & his sister looking out the back window of their new home at the internment camp in the distance. It is a conversation that needs to be back in this film.What reflects the book is that the adults are presented with the view made popular as a defense at the Nuremburg Trials, that they were naive or just following orders. The fact is that any German who read Mein Kampt knew the final solution. What this film is excellent at is bringing this story to a kids level.The trouble is it loses the adult level in the process. As an adult, you feel manipulated & I could see the ending coming a mile away. While it is emotional but unless your a child, there is no surprise here. It leaves the adult level of the film rather empty.The location shooting in Eastern Europe and the camera work are excellent, but without an adult level, I could only find half a film here. Trouble is it is shot too complex to be a children's film, & at way too low a level to be a serious adult film. It is a shame as this film could be so much more.",

In the end I could not hold back tears.As a German for once I thought, wow, here is a German family in the Nazi period in a British film that does not look and sound like a caricature of Germans. The fact that all actors talked in accent-free English made it sound the way Germans sound to Germans: normal and without accent! The characters are even likable, in the beginning even the father.And that is what makes the Holocaust all the more horrific. That there were so many \"normal\" people involved who, under different circumstances, would have led an unremarkable life, and would have been (more or less) nice and good colleagues, neighbours, family people. Only that, when their moral conscience was demanded, they were not able to see, to feel, to say 'no', out of a fear to stand up to 'authority', out of a misguided sense of 'duty', out of career ambitions, out of a lack of self-confidence that seduces one to follow the crowd, to use those that are singled out as 'enemies' and scapegoats to look down upon, to mistreat them, and in the end even to kill them. (The fact that it were your own people, sometimes your own grandfather or other family members who were involved in these crimes--and who you have known as friendly, lovable people in your family--is not easy to come to terms with for Germans who were born after the war.) Hats off to all the actors, but in particular to the two boys who played Bruno and Shmuel.",

            "content": "(Spoilers) I liked the first third of this movie that focused on the family life of a high-ranking Nazi official living in Berlin in the 1940s. Initially the action is seen through the eyes of Bruno, the eight year old boy in the family. The father has just been promoted to commandant of a death camp and the family is to move there. We follow Bruno's experience in moving from a comfortable life in a big house in Berlin to a walled house in the country where Nazi officials frequently meet. The new house is presented to Bruno as a farm house, the house being far enough from the concentration camp that the camp can be seen only from Bruno's room on the second floor. Being an adventuresome sort Bruno finally makes his way to the camp and, across the electrified barbed wire fence, befriends Shmuel, a boy his age in the camp.The movie goes seriously wrong from the point of the meeting of the boys. The guards at the camp would have been on this Bruno/Shmuel relationship in about one minute and that would have been the end of that. Given that the essential premise is pure artifice, all that follows is the result of a false premise. There are too many wrongheaded events to list and I will give only a couple. The fact that touching the fence would result in serious injury, and likely death, was never addressed directly. In their exchanges across the fence both boys did not seem to regard the fence with proper respect. Even at the age of eight Bruno seemed to be a little dense--did he really not sense the evil that was going on behind the fence? Kids usually pick up on those kind of vibes pretty quickly. Improbably Shmuel shows up at Bruno's home to clean the glassware because he has small hands. Really? Later we see the housekeeper doing this job. The one plot hole that really got me was the digging of the hole under the fence. First of all that could never have happened--do you think the camp guards would not notice that this was going on. It would take a lot of time for an eight year old boy to dig a substantial hole using a flat spade that was not even designed for digging. As presented this was a quick and tidy job. And how was the hole on the opposite side of the fence completed from Bruno's side? Whoever wrote this scene had never dug a hole in the ground.After the setup and before the boys meet, the movie could have gone in a lot of interesting directions. It could have concentrated on Bruno's continuing to discover the truth and his gradual recognition of the evil that was being perpetuated. Or it could have pursued the conflict between the truth and Bruno's indoctrination by Nazi propaganda. An investigation of how the family was going to react over time would have been interesting. The mother was already moving away from the Nazi party line--how was that going to be resolved? The family dynamics over time would have been very interesting to follow without the intrusion of the unbelievable relationship between the two boys.I was encouraged to identify with Bruno by getting to know him and his background well. The effect of not having gotten to know Shmuel or any of the other prisoners hardly at all created an imbalance in the impact of the final tragedy when in fact the enormity of Shmuel's tragic life should have played a more central role. Some flashbacks of Shmuel's life would have helped to more fully identify with him. I found the acting to be uniformly good, particularly the young actors. Resting the movie on Asa Butterflied as Bruno was a risk, but he rose to the occasion. It is frustrating that such a good cast was stuck with such a dog of a screenplay.The original score by James Horner is pleasant enough but it often seemed at odds with the developing tragedy.If you want to see a movie about the impact of war on innocent children, watch \"Ivan's Childhood.\" It establishes a totally different mood taking place in the Soviet Union during WWII, concentrating on twelve year old Ivan.",

First, I was a bit put off by the fact the Germans were all obviously British with British accents. Perhaps having actual German actors might have made more sense (even if they spoke English).

But of its many powerful elements, the most effective is the portrayal of the family. Here is a man who runs a concentration camp yet he is a loving father and caring husband. (It's said that Josef Mengele used to feed the birds.) Nor are the military characters the stereotyped jack booted Nazi shouting in bad German accents. Indeed, the characters are restrained and speak in slight British accents. That technique doesn't always work but here it does. It also paints an interesting portrait of \"the good life\" in the Third Reich in 1940-41 when they had occupied most of Europe and were winning the war. One of the great scenes is when Bruno falls off his swing and a concentration camp inmate working in the commandant's house bandages his leg. His mother, brainwashed to believe that Jews are non-human, has a great struggle with herself before saying a halting \"thank you\" to him.

I wasn't disappointed, it's a very though provoking and, at times (for me at least), a very emotional experience. The setting is Germany during World War Two where a family live in Berlin.Eight year old Bruno is quite happy living in Berlin, he has many friends to play with, a sister, Gretel, a loving mother and his father is a soldier. When father gets a promotion, however, things are about to change dramatically for the boy. They move to a big house in the countryside where Bruno is initially not happy. He spots what looks like a farm from his bedroom window. All the people working there seem to be wearing striped pyjamas. He asks his mother about it and at first she seems OK with him making new friends, but once she learns the nature of her husband's new job she changes her mind. Eventually Bruno becomes bored and goes off to explore. He finds his way through the woods until he comes across a high fence behind which is a boy of his own age called Shmuel. Returning often, Bruno soon becomes friends with this strange boy. But all is not what it seems, and things are about to take a very drastic turn for two friends.Even though it has quite a slow pace I found this film quite absorbing. The music, under the direction of music editor Dick Bernstein, is excellent and fits the mood quite perfectly. Great performances from both Asa Butterfield as Bruno and Jack Scanlon as Shmuel. Also very creditable performances from Vera Farmiga as Elsa (Mother), David Thewlis as Father, Rupert Friend as Lieutenant Kotler and David Hayman as Pavel.I found it quite a difficult film to watch, but given the subject matter it was never going to be an easy watch. Having said that, the film did portray the innocence of youth very well which is all credit to all involved. The ending is quite dramatic and not for the feint hearted.

It is more, however. It is a morality play about the development in the boy of a moral sense and the loss of that sense in nearly all the other German male characters, military and civilian alike. So it tackles the plight of six million Jews from both points of view, that of the victims and of the society from which their oppressors sprang. Unlike one reviewer, I didn't see the fast-paced ending coming, and that ending made an already fine film excellent and memorable.To add a footnote to what others here have said, the period costumes and sets were enjoyable without being overdone, the casting (especially of the boy Shmuel) was first-rate, and the score was perfectly reminiscent of Brahms' German Requiem, an appropriate touch in this requiem for two peoples.Don't hesitate to see it.",

Nevertheless, we are horrified, feeling in our bones the ensuing tragic end.The \" New York Times\" film critic seems took a personal affront that movie is devoid of blood, feces and sweat.In my opinion, the images that are in our minds, far outweigh the graphics.",

            "content": "There have been many films over years that have told about the Holocaust but how many i wonder have been told from the side of the Germans or in this case a German child ? Although \" The boy in the striped pajamas\" has a brutal subject matter it is a surprisingly gentle movie ( apart from the climax of the film) and without a doubt this is one of my favourite movies of 2009 so far. Bruno, is the son of strict commander of a Nazi concentration camp. He has a strong headed sister, Gretel. They live in a five storey mansion, but are one day suddenly moved to a place called Out\u0096With (Auschwitz). Bruno, outraged by his father's decision to move to Out\u0096With, and desperate to go home, spends his time in his room with no friends. He is also annoyed by the fact that they live in a three story house instead of their old five\u0096story mansion, and with such a small space, there isn't any room for exploration to be done. He also misses sliding down the banister in their old house.From his bedroom window, Bruno spots a fence with people in striped pyjamas behind it. These are the Jews, and they are in a concentration camp. One day his parents come to an agreement that both Bruno and Gretel need a tutor for their education so they hire Herr Liszt. To Bruno, Herr Liszt is the most boring teacher one could ever have \u0096 because he teaches science instead of the arts, which Bruno prefers. So, in boredom and confusion he wonders what is going on at Out\u0096With and why people are always dressed in striped pajamas there.It takes a great writer to tell a story about such evil especially through the eyes of a child and Mark Herman's screenplay of the novel by John Boyne is a fantastic adaptation.The dialogue is delightful and only enhanced by some stunning acting. Asa Butterfield is fantastic as the Bruno the son of a Nazi officer and his scenes with Jack Scanlon (Shmuel) are deserved of the highest praise. There are also great performances from David Thewlis ( The Nazi Father) and David Hayman ( The Jewish Servant). This is a film about childhood innocence and friendship and how children are taught to hate and are not born thinking that way. The final ten minutes is a stunning example of film making .It looks amazing yet is still horrific and it's hard not to feel deep emotion in what is unfolding in front of your eyes.I'm not sure how much of a distribution this movie got in the States ( not much i suspect) when it was released in November but so far it has grossed $31m worldwide which is fantastic achievement for a fairly low budget BBC film and just goes to show what a great film this really is. The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas ( UK Spelling) is released on DVD on March the 9th here in the UK. Highly recommended . 9 out of 10",

            "content": "There have been notable movies on holocaust featuring the harrowing experiences of the Jews Concentration Camp like \"Schindler's List\" (in which a businessman saves a huge number of Jews from gassing in the concentration camps), \"Life Is Beautiful\" (in which a Jews father saves his son in the concentration camp by pretending they are in a picnic), \"The Pianist\" (a real story of a pianist who hides out to remain alive in the Warsaw Ghetto). Well, 'The Boy in the Stripped Pajamas\" doesn't have the enough power to hold you for its slow pace and a blatant narrative. But the approach with which it views the holocaust is pretty different and touching. It views the terrors of holocaust through a friendship between eight year old Bruno with a Jew Boy and the unexpected consequences of the friendship. The film at the beginning feels a bit a cold attempt in reviving the atrocities of holocaust but by the end it turns into a touching story of humanity and innocence which fell victim to war.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",

What Jews went through they should have been the most compassionate people on earth. I am not saying that Palestinians must not have gone wrong but the whole world is a witness it is Israel who in fact are the perpetrators but with power they are Potraying themselves as victims.

            "content": "It is odd to watch this film because all at once I felt it did a good job while also feeling that it was simply nowhere near as horrific as it needed to be. The story sees a young boy move into the country with his family, his father being a senior soldier in Hitler's Germany. At his new home the boy is bored without friends to play with, but meets a young boy on the other side of a fence who is sitting around in his pyjamas; over time they become good friends.The film is aimed at the family audience; parents with older children who can deal with the subject matter but perhaps are coming to it for the first time. As such it is very well pitched because it does unfold gently and it does explain things and show things in an accessible, understandable but yet still upsetting way. By focusing on the character of Bruno we get this perspective and it allows the rest of the film to be delivered in this same way \u2013 through a certain innocence and lack of understanding which comes with being a child. I mostly liked this approach because it is true that nobody is born hating or fearing anyone \u2013 these are things we learn or develop and Bruno is sitting in that area before this happens. The downside of this approach is that the film does feel a little softer than the reality and the general delivery seeks to upset but never shock, meaning that visually and tonally the film is a lot gentler than many adult Holocaust films. This is a flaw for an adult viewer, but it is a necessary flaw because it is aimed at a wider audience and as such it works, but it does feel weird to watch the film as an adult (knowing the reality) and yet find it accessible and innocent in its tone.The cast match this, mostly playing light and allowing suggestion to be their tool. Butterfield and Scanlon are very good; natural and chatty despite the material and convincing as children in the middle of this terrible hate. Thewlis is solid in the father role while Farmiga provides an accessible reaction to the horrors of the reality and as such is a key performance in the film to deliver this. The supporting cast are all decent but really the film is the two boys sitting with only man-made things between them.Overall this is an accessible and emotionally impacting look at the Holocaust, using the innocence of childhood well. This creates the flaw of being more accessible than the subject really should be in reality and I did feel a certain discomfort while watching, feeling that I shouldn't be finding bits of it easy to watch. This does pay off though by being easier for more viewers and by highlighting the innocence and in the end the emotional impact is the same. Not a perfect film by any means, but one that sets out its goal and achieves it.",

A viewer who has the slightest idea of how things worked at that time, like me whose 'favourite' historical topic is World War II, start to feel unpleasant while watching the oncoming scenes. It's like the screenwriters had no historical knowledge whatsoever.. On the other hand they handle the emotional equalizer very well, the whole movie is so touching (for those who have no idea of its historical stupidity) that even I would've cried if I didn't knew its story was impossible.. Instead it made me periodically facepalm. I suggest for those who liked this movie to read about the KZ Lagers and think about a bit how the storyline of this film could've been possible under the actual circumstances.The saddest part for me was that many hungarians have been in the staff. If one nation the hungarian should know the best about this topic. I only recommend this film for those who don't know anything about historical facts and want to see another 'sugarized' movie about a tragical incident from the past and to say \"Jesus Christ no\" or \"oh how tragical\" while wiping off his/her tears. For the others this movie will surely cause a demolishing serial-facepalm and some short cynical laughs.",

Bruno soon notices \"the people wearing striped pajamas,\" or the Jews, and goes over to investigate without his parents' knowledge. He meets a Jewish boy his age and begins a friendship which involves playing games through the electric fence that separates them, bringing him food, and asking him questions about the camp.This is different from most Holocaust films because it is seen through the eyes of the young boy, Bruno. He does not fully understand why he cannot be friends with the boy he met, why he must read history books and not adventure books, and why these Jewish people \"decided to leave everything behind and come work here.\" This perspective really made me think about good and evil in general. All the soldiers and many of the Germans were doing these terrible things to the innocent Jewish people and hating them, and yet this little boy knew that it was evil. Are we all good at heart and does society make us evil?The acting performance by the young Asa Butterfield is incredible. I recently saw him in Martin Scorsese's 3D family film, Hugo, and thought he was terrific in that as well. He comes off as so innocent and naive and confused as to what is going on.Another thing I really liked about this film was the characterization. Every character was different, multidimensional, and believable. This made the film flow so much faster and easier, as you were not watching the same characters do the same things over and over again as you roll your eyes in annoyance.This is an incredible film that really shows the life of the son of a German soldier during the Holocaust, and what he is feeling when he is seeing these terrible things. The ending is tragic and one of the toughest things I have ever had to watch. But it has a perfect setup and is a perfect conclusion to this depressing film.",

The mother represents Denial: until the violence appears in here home where it can no longer be ignored or tolerated. This is sympathetic stating that not all Germans were \"all in\".

Like another commentator, I was surprised that no-one in the audience left straight away at the end - like my wife and me, they may well have been composing themselves and drying their tears before going back out into the real world.I was especially impressed by the two young actors, Asa Butterfield and Jack Scanlon, who I thought were superb.

The fact that this film could have happened, and the fact that we cannot detract from the fact that 6 million people were murdered, seems to have been forgotten whilst the whiners moan about minor trivialities. Shame on them!I had never heard of this story (Holocaust movies are a particular interest of mine) until my teenage son brought the book home from school, he had to read it for a history essay on children in The Holocaust. He read it in one sitting and emerged from his bedroom with reddened eyes and a heavy heart. He said quite simply \"That broke my heart\".Bruno and his family move to a new home after Bruno's SS Commandant Father us given a new post. The Father is the head of a labour camp, housing countless Jews. Bruno, becoming increasingly bored and being the usual kind of nosey young boy, decides to explore the woods surrounding his new home. He walks through the woods and eventually comes to a fence, where he spots a little boy, Shmuel, wearing striped pyjamas. The two lonely children strike up a friendship. Bruno visits Shmuel every day and Shmuel gradually tells Bruno that he and his family are being held in this camp, and have to work.One day as Bruno leaves to visit Shmuel his Mother asks where he is going. Shmuel tells her, and she begins to realise exactly what her husband's new job entails, much to her horror. She forbids Bruno to visit Shmuel again. Bruno ignores her.To go any further would spoil the film. Needless to say, any film depicting the atrocities carried out by the Nazi's is always upsetting. However the climax of this film is quite simply one of the most heartbreaking things I have ever seen. It took my breath away and left me quite stunned.These other reviewers who are crying that the film is a 'chick flick' and that is was rubbish obviously get their jollies from the more visceral images of The Holocaust. The sheer implication of the horrors of the concentration camps impacted on me more than blood and guts ever could.I hope the heartless critics can one day find a film that satisfies their craving for in your face suffering.

However one might feel at the end of the movie, the story, acting, character development, cinematography, the music, and everything else was first rate. I believe that this movie should do very well come Oscar season. Possible nomination for Screenplay at the very least. As stated above, there was a Twilight Zone quality about the plot. It centered around a Nazi Concentration Camp Commandant's son, eight year old Bruno, wandering up to the perimeter fence of the camp & befriending another eight year old child prisoner, Shmuel. Anyone even remotely familiar with holocaust history realizes this is a highly unlikely scenario. Yet a suspension of disbelief is required to appreciate the story, as this remains central to the plot. The interaction between Shmuel & Bruno is mesmerizing to watch. The rest of the cast was superb.Even though the movie is ostensibly about children, I'm not sure it would be wise to bring a child to see this movie.

An extraordinary story, a strong plot, well-played roles. The picture is remembered for its drama for a long time, and I put the film for myself in the list of those that, after watching once, you will not dare to review again, because the vivid emotions of the initial viewing remain forever in the soul. This is a heavy emotional movie, but it is definitely worth watching for all adults if they are ready for a heavy narrative and a memorable story.This story revolves around two boys who become friends. One of them is Bruno, a young boy and the son of a high-ranking Nazi. The other is Shmuel, a prisoner in a camp where people are killed in a gas chamber. But young children are not yet ready to understand the \"games\" that adults play, they do not make these terrible divisions into people and inhumans, into true Aryans and everyone else who did not deserve to live. Children remain children, for them there is no difference in origin or skin color. They have not yet been imposed these worthless concepts that were the basis of the Nazi regime in Germany.And I, as a spectator, perfectly understood how complex our world is. History clearly demonstrates this when children of different origins, essentially no different from each other, may find themselves on different sides of the barbed wire. And even that damn wire won't stop them from becoming friends. Adults would like to learn from these children, to look at reality in a different way, so that there would not be that terrible war and ideology that destroyed tens of millions of lives. But that's not possible. After all, this is an adult world. Children do not have access to it. As with adults - to the children's world.The acting is good, the direction is excellent, the story is memorable. The film definitely makes you think about who we are. Who are people to each other at all? How is it that, having grown up, having learned something from their life teachers, people harbor so much hatred for others? After all, if you just look at the two guys, you can see that everything is much simpler and there is nothing like that, some good reasons to kill other people. This is worth remembering at any time. A man is a brother to a man, and people who create precedents lead to tragedies with which our planet is strewn.The film is an instructive story, an excellent picture from all points of view. This movie remains in the memory for decades, I'm even sure that forever. The picture will once again allow you to understand what dangerous confluences of circumstances sometimes are, and the utopian ideology of killing other people is a real crime that has no statute of limitations.9 out of 10.",

Yes, the ending is extremely memorable, but the important theme to dwell on here, is not how it ends, but how the friendship between the two boys started in the first place, and how they put their relationship ahead of the selfish greed of man.It is a well-made film, there aren't really any quarrels with the cinematography, the editing, sound, music, directing, nor acting. As any serious period piece on WWII, it's a harrowing lesson on how low mankind can get.The film itself, along with the two boys' relationship in the perspective of all the characters in the story, serves as a constant reminder on how we SHOULD treat our fellow man, regardless of religion, race, creed or sex. These types of reminders often comes from a most overlooked source: children. Without deliberately attempting to \"preach religion\" here, this film exhibits the BEAUTIFUL nature of a child's will, something that Jesus himself cautioned to the world when he said: \"Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God\". Children are an authoritative figure on human nature. That is what this film is about: War is horrible, but even in the most horrific events of despair and chaos, you can find examples of love, peace, and good will.This is one of those films EVERYBODY should see. And may we all learn from these boys and the true terrors of war, and be kinder to each other.",

            "content": "For one, it is a childhood tale produced and distributed by the Disney subsidiary, Miramax. And like the Dreamfactory's animated features, The Boy In the Striped Pyjamas, which is based on a children's book, is a morality tale and a film which both kids and adults can enjoy.The film tells the story of two eight-year-old boys who are at either side of Auschwitz's fence. The one wearing the 'striped pyjamas' - Shmuel - is a Jew destined for the gas chambers. The other boy, Bruno, is the son of the camp's newly-appointed commandant. The two boys strike up an unlikely friendship.Even after weeks of hanging out with Shmuel by the electric barbed wire fence, playing checkers and eating sandwiches and cakes \u0096 which Shmuel wolfs down \u0096 Bruno still doesn't realise that the pyjamas are, in fact, uniforms for death camp inmates. He still believes Shmuel lives on some kind of farm for Jews with low ambitions. For example, he observes that one of the 'farmers', Pavel, who often comes over to do grunt work at Bruno's house which is near the camp, 'used to be a doctor, but now he just peels potatoes'.Bruno doesn't get what that smelly smoke coming out of the chimneys is all about or why his dad's subordinate beat Pavel to death just because he spilled some red wine while serving dinner. He never questions why soldiers with barking Alsatians shout orders at the emaciated 'farmers' as they build a wooden hut. And, strangely, Shmuel is rather chubby and manages to get a lot of 'alone-time' by the fence which, in reality, would have been closely monitored by SS soldiers in watchtowers.The question of whether or not the story line and the film's details are plausible might seem petty. After all, the full title of the book it is based on is The Boy In the Striped Pyjamas: A Fable, and so the moral message takes precedence over realism.In depicting the Holocaust through the eyes of innocent children, who are seen as untainted by the evil that apparently lurks in all grown men, John Boyne, the author of the book, and Mark Herman, the film's director, can avoid addressing the historical as well as moral complexity of the Holocaust. They simply urge us to feel the pain of innocent children growing up during the Second World War. The injustice suffered by millions of Jews and others appears inexplicable.The film is simply the latest manifestation of how the Holocaust has been turned into a simplistic fable. It has become a moral absolute for our relativistic times - the one tragedy that we can all agree must never happen again. To this effect, the Holocaust is now evoked in debates on everything from the conflict in Darfur to animal rights and schoolyard bullying.As the film's producer, David Heyman, says, while The Boy In the Striped Pyjamas is 'a Holocaust story set in 1940s Germany, for me it is timeless'. He then cites 'such contemporary horrors as Rwanda, Darfur and Somalia' (4). In conceiving of the Holocaust as a historical horror story that keeps being repeated in different forms, we lose sight of the particularities of each of those events and this reduces our ability to properly understand any of them.Many well-intentioned initiatives to maintain the memory of the Holocaust end up relativising it and belittling the experiences of those who were persecuted, enslaved, gassed to death or forced to flee their home countries under the threat of extermination in Nazi concentration camps.Consider the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust in Britain for example. Each year, the trust comes up with a new theme for the memorial day, and these are conveyed to the public through simplistic slogans. This year's theme was 'Imagine, remember, reflect, react', while 2007's key message was 'same - but different'. The idea that the millions who perished in Europe in the 1930s and 40s were killed 'just because they were 'different\"', as the trust put it, means reducing the anti-Semitism that gave rise to the Holocaust to just an extreme form of social exclusion.The New Labour government initiated Holocaust Memorial Day in 2001 and the trust's literature is littered with New Labourite buzzwords such as inclusion, crossing cultural barriers, celebrating difference, engaging disaffected youth, building respect and addressing bullying. Taking action on these issues has nothing to do with remembering the Holocaust, and everything to do with the government's crass community cohesion agenda.Yes, there are lessons to be learnt from the Holocaust and we should not forget that six million Jews and others were systematically slaughtered at the hands of the Nazis. But the reduction of the Holocaust to a political prop, to a morality lesson for the masses and a mere symbol of evil only serves to diminish the memory of its victims.While The Boy In the Striped Pyjamas takes a childish approach to the Holocaust, it seems most initiatives today to spread awareness of the subject treat us all as children who are incapable of understanding the political and moral complexity of this great atrocity.As for Grant, she only doubts the validity of making a Holocaust film for children because she believes that not even adults can be expected to understand it. As she puts it: 'We are ourselves too childlike to understand much of the great opaque experience of the Final Solution, with only occasional windows breaking through the stone walls of history. How can we expect children to understand what we do not?' (5) The mainstreaming of this demeaning attitude poses a greater threat to historical awareness and to the memory of the Holocaust than any single children's film could ever do.",

Eventually, he decides to enter the camp (excavating a tunnel through it!) to help his friend find his father. Their destiny is (spoiler ahead) the gas chamber, in a jaw dropping awful scene. Unabashedly sentimental and terribly manipulative, this movie makes Roberto Benigni's famously awful \"Life is Beautiful\" a model of taste by comparison. Maybe in the original book (which I have not read) this works as a fable, but I'm not exaggerating by saying that there is not a single moment in this film that is believable. For starters: If it was so easy to enter the camp, with just a shovel, how come the inmates didn't escape?. And the scene where the mother cries as the rain is pouring when she realizes the fate of her child and the camera moves upward is a textbook case of cinematic manipulation. Avoid this at all costs.",

The story shows the friendship between two boys, one a Jew, one a Nazi son as they make friends while separated by the fences of the camp. Yet as their friendship deepens, so does the hatred growing around them, putting their friendship at risk.

The beauty of the city and countryside scenes, the ambiance of the homes and elegance of the lifestyles these people lived, all the while realizing that this family is deeply flawed by the father's position. Slowly but surely we begin to experience the contrasts when we see an emaciated old man acting as servant/slave. He is a gentle, kindly, but worn out character and we feel for him as does the youngest, innocent member of the family. The film gradually turns from elegant and beautiful to heartbreaking and horrific. As always in Holocaust themed films we are again asking ourselves what kind of people can perpetrate such horrors on other human beings? This film is difficult to evaluate because it starts out in one direction and turns to horror and probably one of the most difficult to watch scenes ever put on film. Some people will hate the ending but the point it makes is, ultimately, extremely important for everyone to see and discuss. I would recommend it for everyone over 13 years of age.",

The characters have been so well enacted and shows different kinds of people with different views about the War and the tactics. People who disapprove of it, a small girl who blindly begins to patronize and a soldier who is torn apart between his family and reputation. This gives the story the essence of reality.The casting is fantastic be it the Mother of Bruno, the Jewish Doctor, Bruno himself and especially Schmuel.This one is the most powerful movie I have seen in recent times, if not ever.",

            "review_title": "The effects of evil",
            "content": "In the decades immediately following the Second World War there were many films about the war itself, but relatively few about its most infamous episode, the Holocaust, which seemed to daunt film-makers by its very enormity. Alan Pakula's \"Sophie's Choice\" was one of the first films to broach the subject, and since then there have been several more, of which Spielberg's \"Schindler's List\" and Polanski's \"The Pianist\" are perhaps the best.\"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\" takes a fresh look at the Holocaust by presenting it through the eyes of an uncomprehending child- not Jewish, but German. The child in question is Bruno, the eight-year-old son of a senior German officer. Bruno's life changes when his father is appointed Commandant of Auschwitz, but the boy himself is quite ignorant of the nature of his father's work; all he knows is that he had to leave his comfortable Berlin home and all his friends and move to a remote location in the countryside, where there are no other boys to play with. He can just about see the camp from his bedroom, but assumes it is a farm. He is, however, puzzled by the fact that all the farmers wear striped pyjamas. Bored, and in search of playmates, Bruno wanders over to the camp, where he meets a Jewish boy named Shmuel sitting listlessly by the wire. Assuming that Shmuel is the farmer's son, Bruno strikes up a conversation with him, and the two became friends.I will not detail the plot any further, as I do not want to give away the final, shocking twist. I will, however, say that there are two main strands to the story, one dealing with the growing friendship between Bruno and Shmuel, the other with the relationship between Bruno and his family. Although the two boys played their parts well, I must say that I did not find the first of these two subplots altogether satisfactory. Security at concentration camps was extremely tight, and the guards would never have allowed one of the inmates to sit, on a regular basis, so close to the perimeter fence that he could hold a conversation with an outsider. Particularly unconvincing was the scene where Bruno manages to crawl under the wire to join Shmuel inside the camp. If security at the camp was so lax, why had the inmates not all escaped? The Bruno/Shmuel storyline was clearly developed for maximum emotional impact, but for me this impact was blunted by the realisation that such a thing could never have happened in real life.One thing about the film which has aroused controversy was the use of accents; all characters in the film, whether German or Jewish, speak English with British accents, normally educated, cultivated ones. To my way of thinking this was the correct decision. The best way of making English-language films about foreign countries is to represent foreigners' use of their own languages by the use of native British or American accents rather than foreign accents. In the case of this film there is, moreover, a special reason why German accents would have been inappropriate. Ever since 1939, German accents in war films have been used to stress the \"otherness\" of the German characters, to emphasise their villainy and to set them apart from the heroic British or American ones. The stereotypical German in these films (and in the war comics which were so popular in my youth) was an ugly thug, generally distinguished by jackboots, cropped hair and a harsh, guttural accent. Even when his English was otherwise fluent he could be recognised by his complete inability to pronounce the \"w\" and \"th\" sounds correctly.It seemed to me that \"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\" was trying to get away both from this stereotype and from the idea of the Germans as being \"other\" from ourselves. The film's thesis is that the Holocaust was perpetrated by people who were not only very like ourselves but also quite convinced of the moral rightness of what they are doing. There is a very good performance from David Thewlis as the Commandant, part mass murderer, part devoted husband and father, all the more frightening precisely because he cannot see the contradiction between these two sides of his character. He is not the typical cartoon Nazi of the war comics, or even a power-crazed monster like Goetz in \"Schindler's List\". He is rather a man whose soul has been so warped by ideological zeal that he has come to regard the murder of millions of people as noble work, carried out to build a better future for the rest of mankind.This will be a controversial viewpoint. We find it easier to see the Nazis as devils in human form than as perverted idealists, although we have no problems with accepting the idealism of Stalinist or Maoist Communists who were just as willing to commit mass murder in what they saw as the greater interests of humanity. By refusing to play the Commandant as a stereotyped villain, Thewlis forces us to confront our preconceptions about the Nazi period.The film also shows us the way in which the war affects the other members of the family. Bruno's elder sister Gretel, who believes implicitly everything she is told by her father and her tutor Herr Liszt, becomes an enthusiastic Nazi. Bruno himself, perhaps because he is too young to understand what is going on around him, perhaps because of a greater innate scepticism, does not; unlike Gretel he still sees the Jews as fully human. Their mother, when she realises the full implications of her husband's work, goes half-mad with horror. Unlike the scenes between Bruno and Shmuel, the scenes involving the family were all too believable as a study of the effects of evil. 7/10",

The young boy denies his friend and so experiences his first sense of responsibility. Instead of playing games of fantasy and wish-fulfillment, he enters a world where true friendship means solidarity with another. This story transcends the setting. It is not focused on the cruelty of man to man, the mindless destruction of the holocaust, but is focused on the more meaningful relationships that bound people. That the young boy is the commandant's son is a profound irony that affirms the common humanity of us all, before society has brainwashed us to hate.",

            "content": "This movie insults history in so many ways. So, we see this boy Bruno play with his friends, as they run home from school, running and pretending to fly. And I mean ALL the way. Seriously, whoever did this movie; kids don't find this THAT fun to do. So when Bruno comes home, he gets to know they will move away from the house the next day. This boy shows his frustration over this, by showing absolutely no facial expression at all. Yeah, you could almost tell immediately, the actor of Bruno is a joke. So, they then have a nice party on the evening, as the boy looks down on the others, loitering from the second floor. Because he is, what? No idea - once again, the actor is too stale. And by the way, his dad works for the Nazis, as this takes place in Germany during WW2. Here, I must also mention, that even though this takes place in Germany - EVERYONE TALKS English!!! What?! If it takes place in Germany, they should talk German!!! So the next day, they move to the new house. As Bruno is in his new room, he looks out the window, sees a Jewish camp, and takes for granted it is a farm... right. So, his parents tell him to not go there, because they are \"different\". And he asks why they wear striped pyjamases... okay. So, as the boy is bored in the house, and he has no friends to play with, he sits in his bed and plays checker for himself. He is told to try to have fun though. And what does he do? He gets outside, and pretends to fly again... this kid is so dumb, the only way he knows how to have fun apparently, is to pretend he flies! So, then he tries to go to the backyard, as his mother notices it, and tells him to come back inside. Why? Because he gets to see the \"farm\", of course. And this mother is so stupid, she actually tries to stop him from going there, which will obviously lead him to run over there sooner or later. So, then the boy puts up a swing made of a tire.... ON THE BACKYARD!!! And appearantly, his mom does not mind! Can his mom make up her mind?! So, then Bruno swings, and falls. He then gets a slightly bloody scratch on his one knee. Appearantly, this was so serious, the jew helped him to put on a band-aid. And the boy is so stupid, he asks if he will bleed to death. So, then Bruno finds out the Jew is a doctor. But guess what Bruno says: \"Well, you can't have been very good at it, since you peel potatoes now.\".... this obviously makes the Jewish person cry. That blasted little evil kid... This kid is a ignorant, arrogant, selfish, mean, brainless little devil! So then, this \"adorable\" little boy sneaks out to go to... \"the farm of the people with pyjamases\", as he sees a kid on the other side of the electric fence, sitting down there doing nothing, as the others work hard in the background, and they are all adults. Two fails here: One, no one would EVER get the chance to sit in a corner and do nothing in a Jewish camp. Two, kids and adults where NOT in the same camps! Do some research! So, they then talk to each other there. And of course, they found the saddest person ever to play the jew. So, Bruno asks some stupid questions. And also, we get to know the Jewish boy is named Shmuel. So they then get to leave each other and such. I actually might from now on tell things out of order, by the way.Here comes the worst, and most stupid line of Bruno. He once talks to Shmuel about occupations, as he says \"Yeah, sometimes adults can change their occupations because they change their mind. It's like someone I know; he went from a doctor to peeling potatoes\"........ HE WENT FROM A DOCTOR, TO PEELING POTATOES?!!! WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH THIS EVIL KID?!!!! Oh, there's also a funeral scene in the movie. Which one? Bruno's grandma, who... we only see in the movie for about 2 minutes, and learns literally nothing about, which means this scene is entirely pointless. Oh, and the mom involves politics when she is there, as she tries to stop her husband to drop some flowers from Hitler on her grave. Even though Hitler is a evil douche, she fails to understand this is still a very nice thing of him to do.I will now get to the last, and pretty stupid scene. *SPOILER ALERT* As the family decides to move away from the house, and as the dad still wants to stay, Bruno walks to Shmuel, as he tells he lost his dad. So, Bruno then gets the idea he could get a shovel and dig, so one could get to the other side of the fence! And then they run away, right? Nope. Bruno comes in and dress up like them, and helps Shmuel in the camp to find his dad.......... PERFECT, THEY ARE BOTH UNBELIEVABLY STUPID!!! When Shmuel finally sees a chance to run away, he thinks it's a much more genius idea to make Bruno get in, so they can try to find his dad in the Jewish camp? These two kids are both so stupid now, and Bruno such a mean-spirited and stiff character, I don't care if they die. And they do... convenient enough, they all get gassed, the same day the family decides to move, and the same day Shmuel lost his dad. Makes total sense... *SPOILER ENDS*I guess you could say the message of the movie is good. But thanks to the author, this entire thing was doomed to begin with anyway. This movie, is pure crap.",

            "content": "The numerous negative comments on the cast's \"British accents\" leave me disappointed in my fellow Americans who are still in denial that the world no longer revolves around them (if it ever did).A country a few thousand miles east, across the Atlantic ocean, happens to have made this film (notice \"BBC\" in the credits?) and they did not set out to speak in a \"British accent.\" They talk in the film the way people talk in that country. And why not? What were the alternatives? Should they adopt an American accent just to please us, leaving their own countrymen to wonder, with a sense of the surreal, just what (beyond the infamous gulags that our society seemingly needs to maintain order) America has to do with the story? Should they contrive German accents? What would be authentic about that? Germans don't normally speak English in a German accent; they speak German. So maybe everyone in the movie should have used German and given the audience subtitles to read? One can imagine how happy that would have made these critics.No possible \"accent\" could be transparent for all Anglophones, but how the cast spoke was at least natural to themselves and to their primary audience. Why they were right to do so goes much deeper than convenience. Asked how he would portray the Nazis in his film Der Unhold (The Ogre), Volker Schlondorff replied, \"as the most exciting people in the world, of course.\" Hence he showed them not as strange or alien in any way, but in living color. That Abel, his childlike hero, would be immediately converted to their cause was almost inevitable. How slowly did disillusionment ensue with innocence lost and uncomfortable facts accumulating.The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas calls for a similar approach to the allures of Nazi images, ideologies, and institutions, because (among other similarities) they share a theme: a na\u00eff's loss of innocence amidst unpleasant truths gradually emerging. The question is not so much \"how did this happen to the Germans?\" but more universal: \"how might it happen to us?\" As the historian John Lukacs wrote, understanding history requires self-understanding.To be sure, Bruno, more than Abel, had early reasons for ambivalence. He never wanted to leave his home and friends in Berlin. He noticed that his grandma didn't approve of these new developments, either. The new house in the country didn't appeal to him, nor did his confinement to the walled front yard. The regimen of his tutor predisposed him to resist the propaganda he was fed. Mark Herman has apparently read his Dickens, whose _Hard Times_ had the poor Gradgrind children subjected to precisely the same grim pedagogical philosophy: out with fantasies and adventures, in with facts and almanacs. Our little explorer felt imprisoned mentally as well as physically. Is it any wonder that he could just as easily greet the camp's barbed-wire fence as another restraint upon himself, rather than upon anyone he saw on the other side? Set against all this privation was a child's natural trust in his parents, that what they were doing was right or at least necessary. We see that this trust was not always absolute and was sustained in part by lies. Bruno seemed surprised when Schmuel said that he never doubted that his own father was a good man.Most of the critics and commentators I have read tend to treat Bruno as an ignorant, confused little boy. This may be true at first, but let's not overlook the developments that show him becoming a resolute and courageous hero. I'm sure that when you see this film, you will not miss a brief moment at a dramatic halfway point in the story, which is almost as shattering as the much adumbrated ending. Among the evidence for the pivotal significance of this scene is when, after having sulked for weeks over living in this house, he amazes his family by voting to stay rather than leave. Does any earthly rationale explain this change of heart? The only rationale is heavenly: he is intent upon staying for Shmuel's sake.However coincidental, it is extraordinarily apt to have seen this film on the Feast of Christ the King, in whose Holy Gospel Jesus discloses the contents of our final exam.

This movie is a wonderful exposition into a German officer's family and how the react to discovering what the Nazis' ultimate goal is.David Thewlis and Vera Farmiga was absolutely perfect, from their personal conflicts to their parenting. The two main boys, Bruno and Shmuel, show that even in the worst situations you can find support. Every scene was important and all of the shorts were good.

Then I went to go and see it just to see what all the hype was about. From start to finish I was engaged in the storyline. The acting was excellent. The writing was perfect. The scenario couldn't have been better. Now I haven't read the book yet, but when I do, I hope that it is as engaging as this film. There was such a powerful message in it. It really shows us how cruel Nazi Germany was. I mean the way the Lt. assaulted that Jew because he spilled some wine, and the way the Dad just sat there. At that moment I just wanted to go into the film and help the Jewish person out. But the ending was where the real tear jerker was. Bruno (the boy) goes to the concentration camp to help Shmall (the Jewish boy (sorry if I spelt his name wrong)) find his father. He dressed up like the Jews so he wouldn't stand out. And then, just when you didn't think anything bad was going to happen, they get sent to the chambers. At the point I was in tears. It was really a sad and upsetting film. The only flaw I thought was the fact that they were all speaking English instead of German. Just to comment on the debate about that this film should be shown in schools for education, let me just say if you showed this film to kids aged under 15, you'll have a classroom of people sobbing and wishing that the war never happened. Another thing is that it should really be rated a 15 instead of a 12A. This is NOT for kids. Seriously. Never the less, I'll still watch it again. It is that good.",

You can pretty much guess where it's going from the outset, and each unbelievable scene is a step closer to that inevitable outcome. There's a kind of subtle, mawkish sentimentality hanging over the whole production that ended up spoiling the experience for me. I didn't care for the characters at all, particularly Bruno, who seemed a selfish, spoilt little brat throughout.It doesn't help that David Thewlis and Vera Farmiga both give unsatisfying performances that feel staged and self-conscious. But the real problem is that ending, which deliberately goes out of its way to push the viewer where it wants them to go emotionally, while at the same time trivialising an entire part of history.",

One of the inmates spills wine while serving at the dinner table(very plausible?).He is then hauled off by one of the Nazis and beaten to death without anybody turning a hair!!This same Nazi then just happens to mention that his father left for Switzerland 4 years ago instead of serving the fatherland,so he is packed off to the front.(Oh really?) Even more annoying was the terrible Bruno,who couldn't act and was completely stupid even or an 8 year old.Didn't he look like Hitler,especially at the funeral with his hair parted in the same way.

It was so unnecessary; so counter-productive. And how come that Shmuel, the Jewish kid in the concentration camp, was fatter than Bruno? How come the servant from the concentration camp looked better fed than the Nazi family? How come there was just a single, poorly constructed, non-electrified fence where Bruno and Shmuel met? How come there were never any guards patrolling the perimeter fence? How come in wartime did the commandant's wife have access to a seemingly endless supply of designer clothes? (And to nit-pick, where did Bruno get a modern-day, zip-up shirt?) And so the questions could go on. Not least how and why we are expected to believe how easy it would have been to penetrate the fence as the film moves towards its conclusion.To be fair, the acting was mostly excellent, though I'd loved to have seen it made in German rather than English. And I am immensely relieved \u2013 and a little surprised \u2013 that there was no cop-out with the ending. But as for the rest\u0085 Oh dear.Movies often require the suspension of disbelief \u2013 never more so than in, say, the James Bond flicks \u2013 but to undermine such a serious, important, compelling story with a contemptuous approach to so many realities was seriously disappointing.

We've had the return of the Caped Crusader, and seen a gigantic monster attack New York City.It's very likely that everyone will remember 2008 as the year of The Dark Knight and Cloverfield, but with The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, we have a film I feel deserves to stand aside these two Hollywood blockbusters. There have been many films based on the Holocaust over the years, most notably Schindler's List, and many people will feel that maybe they've seen enough of one of the darkest chapters in human history. But The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is very different to its predecessors. Based on the best-selling novel by John Boyne, the film is told through the eyes of Bruno, a young German boy. Bruno's happy care free life is turned upside down when he's told he has to move from his home in Berlin to a desolate area on the outside of the city. What Bruno doesn't know is that his father, a German Commander, is being sent there to take charge of a Concentration Camp, which is holding many innocent Jews as prisoners. Bruno quickly becomes subdued and bored with his new surroundings, where there isn't too much exploring to be done and no one to play with- until he meets Shmuel.Shmuel is one of the prisoners being held at the camp and he and Bruno quickly strike a friendship. The connection between the two boys is a touching contrast from what is taking place all around them, but the friendship becomes more and more dangerous for the two youngsters with inevitable tragic consequences.Despite not having the scale of film making that Spielberg produced in Schindler's List, this is a film that is very well made. It features some fantastic cinematography, and has great acting all around, especially from Bruno's mother (played by Vera Farminga, from the Oscar winning The Departed). The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is touching, shocking, horrific and tragic rolled into one. It is the story of innocence up against one of the world's greatest tragedies. One that will have you talking long after the credits have rolled.",

His young son Bruno is against the move but children must accept. Looking out of the window of his room he sees beyond the garden and the forest the 'farm' with its smelling smoke from the chimney. In La Vie est Belle it is the father who \u0085 in this movie we see what Bruno and his friend Shmuel, the boy in 'stripped pyjamas', sees. Pavel, also dressed in stripped pyjamas, tells Bruno, taking care of his wounded knee, that he was a doctor before and now a kitchen help. We understand: Auschwitz. Why again holocaust? Here it is different. Seen with the innocent mind of a 8-year-old boy. Beyond the fence of time of which we are part of (the small-scale genocide, wars by lies, the crash that stripped people of their savings, their pensions, their homes, their jobs, their hopes of providing for their families). Shmuel is Bruno's friend: \"There is such a thing as a nice Jew though, isn't there\" he asks and the teacher Herr Liszt answers: \"I think, Bruno, if you ever found a nice Jew, you would be the best explorer in the world.\" Bruno asks Shmuel: \"What have you done?\" and Shmuel answers: \"I am a Jew\" \u2013 their fathers the mirror: Bruno's father for what he 'does' (courtsentenced after the war for prison \u2013 Shmuel's father for what he is, whatever he answers, he is still what he is.

If it had been just one man, I'm sure something would've been done about him.\" S Zizek describes with the help of John McCumbers 'The Company of Words': (dirty, intricate, greedy) \u2013 Jew. The Jew is (dirty, intricate, greedy) / JEW. To me said at work 2008: One German is a German (ex Bruno, but not! Shmuel?), two Germans are Nazis, three Germans claim 'Lebensraum'. SS officer Aldorfer in Il Portiere di Notte to his friends: \"I have a reason for working at night. It's the light. I have a sense of shame in the light\". Children think different as long adults are not around. Bruno lets down his new friend: \"Lets go and find your dad. I wish I could helped you find your dad. I really want to make up for having you down like I did. That would have done it, wouldn't it? Helping you find your dad\". Bruno hears what Herr Liszt says, senses the importance of fathers work, sees his looking-away-mother, having a break down when reality is undeniable... . As Aldorfer is Hanna in The Reader unready for life after release, unable to cope with her shame in daylight. The same for the boy, the student and adult 'Jungchen', passed long ago the point-of-no-return, surviving the daily life the shame by denial. The judge answers Hannas question \"What would you have done\" with: one should not put himself in such a position. She did not! Whenever offered promotion she moved on, ashamed to explain why. She had to choose what happens in Sophy's Choice, they never saw the trap (which Sara avoids in Worlds Apart: neither love or religion but she herself. The same for the boy Bruno. It was his idea to find Shmuels father, do it as a 'secret mission'. Childthinking, just do it. For us others: shame, guilt, excuses and the stand-in Weisse-Rose-students ('as our better part') who saw and did not look away. So good and easy that others do what I should do and not do. The author says in his letter that those inside know how it was which we outside only have a fantasy of. Only a child can come a little nearer (with what Wim Wender means in Himmel ueber Berlin, communicating with the child within, able to listen to the angel beside). But still today, the letter of the author, exists the Bruno-Shmuel-fence. And valid what is said in The Reader: \"People ask all the time what I have learned in the camps. They where not therapy. Do you believe it was a university? We where not there to learn something. What do you want? Forgiveness for her (Hanna). To feel better yourself? Go to theater if you want catharsis, go to literature, don't go to the camps. Nothing comes out from the camp. Nothing\". When seeing the inside of the farm, Bruno remembers that supper waits with roast biff. But too late: \"It's a shower\", both holding tightly hands.",

The adaptation from the book is one of the most poignant and relevant pieces of cinema in a very long time. Why has this movie received no awards? Why was it not given a BAFTA, Oscar???? It beggars belief. The reason this story is so masterful is because it takes the position of viewing what happened from the eyes of children and therefore the symbolism of lost innocence is particularly moving to anyone who watches this film. It rips into the dark heart of human evil; politics and war, racism, genocide and how human beings can grow from being innocent children into adults that create havoc on a beautiful earth. Every character portrayed in the story has a facet of this dilemma to fulfill - from the SS officers to the family, to the women of the film , to the young budding Nazi girl to the grandparents, to the servants in the house and of course the relationship between the young German boy and his Jewish friend.

It is sometimes slow moving but the story indicates that the evils of the world can invade a simple childhood idyllic world itself.First, you meet one of the main central characters, Bruno, son of a Nazi officer. Bruno seems to be a cloistered child, usually in books or his own imagination. One can argue that he is somewhat naive not seeing the Jewish hatred earlier with his sister joining the Hitler Youth or racist discussions at the dinner table.Bruno out of boredom and loneliness meets Schmuel, a Jewish child who is imprisoned in a Concentration camp near Bruno's home. It is somewhat a wonder how Schmual survived the selection process when he first entered the camp (history shows that children were murdered quickly or taken for \"experiments\") but a friendship eventually forms between these two. Bruno does not see him as a Jew but just another child to talk too. And it seems thru this relationship Bruno is finally opening his eyes and seeing the hatred against the Jews because he does little things to try to help Schmuel--smuggle food, listen to stories, play some games....Finally, He tries to help Schmuel again by smuggling himself in the camp and sees all the hidden horrors. The ending is very sad and tragic. All of this story is thru the eyes of two children......And the horrors witnessed thru a child's eyes brought his family to full circle by seeing their wrong racist views against the Jews",

Overwhelmed by guilt, Bruno attempts to help his friend but winds up with him in a gas chamber, the two little boys holding hands as they die.Whew!

In contrast, there is something incomprehensibly good about this film. I watched the DVD during Christmas, the holiday commemorating the birthday of a Jew who died trying to save the world for Gentiles. Inversely Christlike, Bruno is a Gentile who dies trying to save the world for Jews.Critics complain that Bruno's story is pure fiction. Nevertheless, real life heroes do exist. Miep Gies tried to save Anne Frank. Miep and Anne live on in our consciousness.

Just how a person such as the father could be both good ( to his family and friends ) and totally evil to others.( The Jews ) This dichotomy is also seen in the young SS soldier. The innocence of both children shows how stupid the whole racist argument is. The women in the film show that not everyone agrees with the evil being done but have the dilemma that they are married to their men and cannot come to terms with them doing or believing such evil things. Young Jack Scanlon who plays Shmuel,is outstanding as is Asa Butterfield as Bruno, the camp Commandant's son. But all the actors play their parts exceptionally well. Did this film win any Oscars? It really should have won in just about every category since it is one of the best films you will ever see. Much better than Schindlers list because it doesn't show the gore and violence in any graphic way, but you are left to use your imagination, which can be much more horrific.

But the holocaust really happened, you see.I can just imagine Ellen or Oprah promoting this film in their mildly sociopath style, becoming just perfectly tear-filled in a perfectly calculated way and then everyone in the audience gets a copy of this film on DVD.This movie has a strangely inauthentic feel to it and according to all documentary sources I have witnessed, it also IS very inauthentic. I think you cross a line when you set a film in and near an \"Auschwitz-y kind of concentration camp\" and then decide to make some things really authentic (like Zyklon-B crystals being blue, for instance) and some things, like the camp perimeter, sort of what you need them to be to make a fictitious story work. In fact some revisionist would probably love this picture, because it turns concentration camps into a fairytale.I also found this film strangely unmoving. I don't know if its the music, the acting or the camera work, but it didn't really touch me in the slightest way. I found it mildly pleasant and entertaining to watch, which is completely wrong, when you think about it.If you want to see a truly great movie about the Holocaust, you should watch \"The Grey Zone\". This is a deeply disturbing and chilling piece that portrays the stark and utter horror of Auschwitz like it should be portrayed. Its not a good cry. It doesn't provide any answers. Instead it rips something out. It leaves you feeling cold, numb and terrified. Sure, The Grey Zone has its flaws, like some strange casting and inconsistent acting, but its not a borderline debacle like this one.",

It appears the only thing that scares our 8-year-old are Nazis. He lies openly to his mother and shows disdain for his sister and tutor but fears men, including his father, when they are dressed as Nazis. Does the writer have some unresolved parent/child thing going on? The family has some very contemporary dynamics going on it: a child who enters a room where his parents are fighting and without knocking first is reasoned with and not punished for doing so. According to authors such as Alice Miller in the 1940s Germany such a child would have been instantly and severely punished as would he would have been for repeatedly disobeying his parents.In Auschwitz, at the height of the Final Solution, children were gassed when they arrived and not housed with their parents. In addition, are my partner and I the only ones who noticed Schmule is the only child in the camp? Also, the building the prisoners are working on never gets any further along in completion although we see them working on it through out the movie. Also, where are the guards who have been patrolling the perimeter? The movie uses cheap tricks including misleading promos, melodramatic music and totally unrealistic situations (e.g. a child burrowing under a fence to get into a death camp) to heighten what could have extremely painful moments.Redeeming qualities of the movie include excellent acting and some very nicely furnished houses.",

His son secretly gets to be friends with a Jewish boy.And thats all the depth you will find in this story. There is no personal change, no evolving, no philosophical findings, no lessons to be learnt and it doesn't drag you into the main event of the movie, the end, where you should be in tears, i guess. I honestly didn't feel bad for the boy, which indicates something is very wrong with this movie.So it's just a bad story, trying to score on a major recent historical event.

            "content": "For me there were many subtle, poignant pleasures in this film. Early on we see Bruno, sleepy and petulant at being displaced, wearing striped pajamas; as soon as we meet Schmuel, we think - aha - THIS is the boy in the title. But when the devastating ending begins to unfold and Bruno puts on the prison uniform, the sinking realization comes that the title in fact did refer to Bruno all along.Many reviewers lament the lack of development of Schmuel as the title character - to me, they've missed the point.It also didn't seem improbable that Schmuel could have a few stolen moments to talk through the fence. Bruno was so extremely lonely and bored after being taken from his close group of pals, it wouldn't have taken much time or conversation for him to form a strong dependence on even fleeting contact with a playmate.I liked that Bruno wasn't romanticized as a saintly child. It was entirely believable that he would, under threat of punishment, betray his friend. He was bitterly sorry afterwards, and wanted to make amends by finding Schmuel's father. This also appealed to him as a lover of adventure stories, \"knights in shining armor.\" At a great but understated turning point, you so want Schmuel to crawl out of the camp (as he tentatively suggests) rather than Bruno crawling in - to him the logical action since he's naively confident he'll succeed like the heroes in his books.During the last harrowing sequence, I was on the edge of my seat, hoping Bruno would be shown in an epilogue, still friends with the rescued Schmuel... that the Commandant (he WAS after all a loving father) had seen the light and taken everyone to Switzerland like the von Trapp family! That would have been a trite cop-out, but it would have been an outcome suitable for a kid's movie. Though this is from a child's viewpoint, it's way too sad and disturbing for children - the 13 part of the PG-13 should be strictly observed! Those small, clutching hands of friendship and comfort in the most desperate situation made the tears flow. That image will stick with me, a symbol of children everywhere who don't deserve to be caught up in horror and violence; and also that both sides in a war have the capacity of our human nature to choose common ground and humanity. Maybe that's what is meant by becoming as little children, because then we can easily see what's truly logical and important.",

When the unspeakable truth of the Holocaust then became known at the end of the war, all too many of us claimed that they had not known anything about it or even suspected anything.Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker, President of West GermanyI never thought I would see the fictional equivalent of Alain Resnais' Night and Fog, the harrowing documentary that juxtaposes a current pastoral crematory site with original footage. But I've seen The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, a seemingly benign story of a German boy, Bruno (Asa Butterfield), living with commandant dad (David Thewlis), clueless mom (Vera Farmiga), and emerging Nazi teenage sister (Amber Beattie) adjacent to an Auschwitz-type concentration camp, which the eight-year old initially sees as a farm. The story is powerful because it is a fiction and therefore open to interpretation and representation. As Steven Spielberg made memorable images in Schindler's List, notably the girl in red, so too does Mark Herman dot his visual narrative with images of imprisonment (latticed stairway, for instance) and flight (the boys play at being airplanes). But the most powerful images are in the face of a mother (Vera Farmiga), who slowly realizes what her husband oversees in the camp, and the eyes of the way-too-wise Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), Bruno's eight-year-old friend over the fence. The film's power is in the details such as the contrast between the well-cared for commandant's home and the starkness of the camp seen through Bruno's high windows, between the stolid loyalty of dad to the purification scheme of Hitler and the disaffection of mom coupled with Bruno's growing skepticism about the campaign against the Jews. At no point did I feel I was being preached to, but at every point I was aware of the enormous guilt the German people would eventually feel upon liberation.Because The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a fiction, it might be easy to discount its power as it stands next to Night and Fog. Nevertheless, the representational aspect of taking a microcosmic situation and applying it to the greater understanding works here. The growing awareness of the boy is parallel to Roosevelt's; the subtle ambivalence of dad as he realizes what his command will cost him personally and professionally is emblematic of any Nazi officer with a conscience. But most of all the mother's accelerating understanding of the Holocaust as she sees it in her husband is unforgettable, in no small measure thanks to Vera Farmiga's performance. However, the denouement is \"unforgettable.\" I have rarely if ever seen an audience sit quietly while credits ran with just a dark background and no hint that more information would ensue. The denouement is so vivid it made me see anew the horror that was the Holocaust. Just silence on and in front of the screen. \"It makes worries like what you wear today seem stupid.\" Eighth grader after visiting the Holocaust Museum",

I watch the news to learn that. A tragedy is supposed to make the audience see the mistakes of the tragic hero and say to themselves \"man what a terrible thing, I will never make those mistakes myself\". Either that or the hero sacrifices himself to save someone else. I mean don't get me wrong. I understand that this is a film about a concentration camp in the middle of the holocaust and it is going to be a sad movie. That is not what I am talking about. I'm talking about the fact that there isn't really any hero in the movie at all other than the naive little boy who gets himself killed because his parents and country lied to him about what was really going on in the camp. OK we already know that the Nazis were bad and should be ashamed of what they did. Do we really need a story that exploits that point? I don't know. Maybe I'm the one being naive. Maybe I'm wrong.

For once the protagonist is not on the persecuted minorities' side, but on the well to do German side.Bruno (Asa Butterfield) is a happy eight-year-old boy living in Berlin. When his Nazi officer father (David Thewlis) is transferred to a new home closer to a concentration camp, Bruno is upset about leaving his friends. He quickly becomes bored in the isolated country home, and believes the concentration camp he sees from his window is a farm. He is fascinated and confused by why the people there wear \"pajamas\", and is determined to find out more about them. His mother (Vera Farmiga) tells him not to go in the back of the house, but Bruno manages to sneak through the woods, and find the edge of the concentration camp. There he meets Schmuel (Jack Scanlon), an eight-year-old Jewish boy living in the camp. The boys become fast friends, and Bruno comes to visit, bringing food and toys as often as he can. Despite the fact he visits a concentration camp, Bruno is still oblivious to what's really going on there. His friendship with Schmuel makes him question the anti-Semitism in his tutor's curriculum and father's military duties. Both young boys learn about friendship, betrayal, loyalty, courage and common decency, with some parents learning harsh lessons as well.This movie is stunning, absolutely wonderful. I have never seen a film set in the Holocaust that was told from a German perspective, and I know I'm not alone in that. While most other films demonize all Germans during WW2, this film depicts the difference between Nazis and the everyday German citizen who was unable to stop the horror happening before them. What I find fascinating is that while the movie is first based off of Bruno's innocence, it slowly morphs into denial as he begins to learn more about his father and new friend. The acting in this film is superb. Asa Butterfield is a fantastic child star. One scene that stands out to me is one where he is dealing with guilt in his bedroom, which is both beautifully acted and realistic. Rupert Friend did a great job as the typical cold-hearted Nazi, and Jack Scanlon also gave a great performance as Schmuel. David Thewlis is great as usual. Unlike other WW2 films this shows the horror of the Holocaust by the people suffering through its tortures, this shows the evil of it through the point of view of people who stood on the sidelines watching it happen. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a great story of friendship, and how children are often braver and more virtuous than adults.",

            "content": "I just watched this after seeing a trailer for it on another DVD and it's one of those films that I think will stick with me a while yet. The movie succeeds on every level. It's a parable based in the Holocaust, a fictional morality tale told against the backdrop of that great atrocity (and, though a fictional story, in most ways true to the reality of the time and place, including the oft-inaccurate diversity of German uniforms), but its also a story of the human condition, independent of setting, for both the better and the worse. Hope, friendship, unconditional love, family, exploration and curiosity about the world, deception, self-deception, lying, propaganda (the Big Lie), rampant nationalism, unquestioning obedience to authority and their policies, racism and other bigotry, unconditional hate: it's all here. The guts of the story could be set anywhere. Again, this is true on several levels, including that of a family eventually torn apart through deception and betrayal of trust, that of friendship between two people of very different backgrounds, as well as the cold hard reality of genocide (though rarely plotted quite as coldly, logically, cynically, and dispassionately as by the Nazi hierarchy) being a human tendency that is still very much with us.Yeah, I didn't see the ending coming. I think it's perfect. Not what I wanted, of course, but that's what makes it so apt. I think the film may have been just as effective with any one of a number of outcomes, including that likely to be criticized as a 'Hollywood' ending but the piece as it exists is certainly a stark piece of testimony to the reality of the Final Solution and, ultimately, the broader and more all-encompassing sweep of human nature's dark side. The fact that it's a fictional story is basically irrelevant to these points.As for the acting, set dressing, costuming, and cinematography; like the writing, it's all top-notch. In particular, the two boys at the center of the film are nothing less than supernatural in their portrayals, not only each possessing compelling command of facial and other gestures and unspoken language (and, yes, both have extremely expressive eyes) but each able to make the viewer totally forget that they're watching an actor at work on a set. That is not always easy for an adult to do, let alone a less experienced kid.Pretty heart-wrenching stuff. I think it should be seen by everyone, not just to remind us of what happened to those deemed untouchable subhumans (Jewish and otherwise) by a bunch of power-mad authoritarians decades ago but to remind us of who we are: the good side of us and the other side, the side regarding which our kind are inevitably too often surprised by the ease with which it's possible to slide that way. The German people, 1933-1945, and even most of those in the Nazi machine, were not necessarily inherently evil people; likewise (as well depicted in Bruno Ganz' stunning portrayal in \"Downfall\") even Hitler himself was not a monster, he was just a man. Sociopaths aside, these people were not inhuman but all TOO human. The point here is that not only COULD this happen again but, in different ways and on different scales, it already HAS, just as it (close to home, think US Cavalry vs the locals here in the USA) had already happened time and time again in centuries past. Rwanda, Sudan, East Timor, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Bosnia, parts of Central and South America, the 'Democratic' Republic of Congo...the list of recent and ongoing centers of mass atrocity, not to mention the attitude of hate and xenophobia and lust for aggressive war and its spoils that is rampant in many countries (including my own), is depressingly fresh and vital.",

I have seen many powerful movies at the theater (Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List and others) but I have never seen people sit so absolutely motionless and quiet for as long as they did in this theater. Every one sat there for almost the entire credits without speaking or even moving. It was a testimony to the power of the film itself.On to the movie- yes... they all had British accents, but then this is a BBC production so I expected that. After all, having everyone speak German & have subtitles would've kept some people from seeing this movie. Besides, the accents don't matter, it's what they say & how they say it. I thought this was a great point of view- to hear the story of the Holocaust through the eyes of a boy who is the child of a commandant of a camp.

It is true that this movie is difficult to watch, and had it been made more realistic, would likely have been watched less. In a cultural environment where beautiful costumes, special effects, and happy endings yield big profits for film makers, and big trophies with notoriety for actors, making and acting in a film like The Boy in the Striped Pajamas requires a great deal of courage on the part of the cast and crew. I was surprised by the harsh review from the New York Times, and no longer view that reviewer as credible. For me, this movie succeeded in illustrating the quiet evil of the holocaust - the worst kind of horror possible - the quiet, calm, understated kind that incrementally pervades until it's accepted as the NORM, then gets close enough to JUMP OUT and suffocate the screams of the victims. In this movie, Innocence is personified by little Bruno (played brilliantly by Asa Butterfield, small and wide eyed, and Evil is personified by Bruno's father (played by a remote and expressionless David Thewlis), a German career officer who is committed to his military duty and Party loyalty demonstrated by doing bad things to innocent people. Berlin is beautiful, but ugly things are going on in the middle of Berlin's streets, as Jews are being loaded into army trucks amidst German children running and playing on a sunny afternoon. Bruno's mother, Elsa (played with restraint and dignity by Vera Farmiga) is a loving mother who wants to protect the innocence of her two children, yet, despite her nervousness, she is forced to ignore the brutal treatment of an elderly Jewish servant being bludgeoned in her own home during dinner with her children present. Lieutenant Kotler (played by the elegant Rupert Friend) is the release valve for the building tension in the movie, as a sadistic brute who is prone to change from being conversationally affable to psychotic in .5 seconds, striking like a snake. This film is full of extreme contrasts layered one on top of one another, giving the viewer hope, then no hope for each character, until the end when the viewer realizes there is no hope for anyone because those who are NOT innocent are as doomed as those who ARE innocent. This movie is mild compared to some movies about the Holocaust, yet equally grave in exploring the possibility of turning the tables. Here is this affluent German family, with servants and chauffeurs moving to their new country home, next to a \"farm,\" inhabited by \"farmers\" wearing striped pajamas, where an unpleasant smell permeates the air now and again. And though the audience can see a flicker of realization in the eyes of each character, the audience will also witness the unmistakable danger of cognitive dissonance creeping around in the midst of this otherwise good German family, under the constant scrutiny of the \"party,\" so that no character asks too many questions, but slips under the comforting blanket of denial while thousands of lives slip away silently over on the \"farm\" a hundred or so yards away. In this movie, those who believe they are fighting monsters realize they have become monsters, thus, this film illustrates the fundamental value of the Golden Rule as a cure for racism: treat others as you would like to be treated. Even monsters love their children.",

            "content": "Perhaps the most important concern of the story is naivet\u00e9. Not simply childhood naivet\u00e9 but the childlike version in adults. It is this that is not only one of the most interesting aspects of the picture, but its most problematic. It manifests itself here in Bruno's initial perception of the \"farm\" and the workers in their striped PJs, which is one thing. More sadly, but less believably, it also is reflected in the fact that the depth of the systemic hatred and lack of humanity in Bruno's father (David Thewlis), not to mention the dark details of his new job, barely register at first with Bruno's mother (Vera Farmiga), an innocent, then concerned, then indignant woman with some shreds of humanity that she fails to act upon until she sees her children become too exposed to the cruel philosophies and actions of their father and his henchmen.As the story progresses, the level of ignorance of the two boys at its center regarding the circumstances that envelop them becomes less and less plausible, especially considering that they each witness and experience some of the abuse of the soldiers first-hand. Late into the film, Bruno has seen some of the rougher side of his father, yet, when asked by Shmuel if he is proud of his father, Bruno responds in the affirmative with seemingly a minimum of hesitation. Further, Bruno seems to have little if any doubts about his family, even in the face of his sister's rapidly increasing phobia, militancy, and hatred. Most profoundly, despite the fact that Shmuel himself toils in the camp, he does not even come close to suspecting that the explanations he is given about his and his parents' predicament, why he was transported there, and why people in the compound keep mysteriously disappearing may be weak attempts to mask something that is wrong. It's nearly impossible to accept that, when he realizes his own father is missing, he starts searching the camp for him, oblivious to the notion, despite where he is, that he may have been murdered. It isn't until the final, waning minutes in the film, when the boys\u0097Bruno especially, but to an extent even Shmuel\u0097begin to better comprehend the wickedness of the camp. These may be kids, but I doubt real children in similar circumstances would be as clueless as the film assumes they would be, no matter at which side of the fence the sit.The basic conceit of the film is certainly engaging and there are many scenes that are memorable for their drama, tension, and horror, but, in its realization, the filmmakers attribute so much permanence to childhood innocence that much of the story's credibility is undermined. They assume that such innocence can continue to survive, will not erode, even under circumstances as difficult and raw as these.",

            "content": "Very rarely does a film take it upon itself to detail the horrific facts of the holocaust during World War II whilst simultaneously trying to maintain a child-friendly approach. The Boy in Striped Pyjamas is one of these few, and while it's insistence on at times painting the era in children's colours (for the sake of conveying how the main character sees his innocent life in the midst of all the evil that is going on around him) can distract from the real emotional and thematic core of the story, there's enough heart and intelligence present here to manage a story with integrity as one would expect. Detailing such themes as anti-Semitism, war, death and domestic abuse, Mark Herman certainly doesn't make a mockery of his audience and history here, despite the inconsistent tones that he uses to paint such a melancholic, bleak portrait. Stark in its message and touching in its emotional core, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is a powerful, albeit slightly unfocused criticism of one of the cruellest acts in the recent history of man; and it does so through the eyes of an eight year old boy.This boy isn't the one mentioned in the title however, that would be an imprisoned Jew, living in a labour camp not far from our main character's new home. Bruno (Asa Butterfield), a boy of eight and son of an important Nazi soldier, has recently left his home in Berlin to live with his father, sister and mother in their new home which incidentally is near a concentration camp. Mistaking the imprisoned Jews for local farmers, what follows from this opening premise is a story of childhood bewilderment at how the adults of his world treat each other. Told through the eyes of Bruno, the movie can at times take on a light-hearted tone, throwing in small glints of humour and airy whimsy, and while these moments have their importance to contrasting the reality of Bruno's world and those around him with his own bright-eyed existence, their presence always seems perfunctory. Director Mark Herman shows that he knows how to contrast, but when the script demands that he try and blend the two natures of his world, problems arise.Working far more effectively are the scenes in which Bruno is faced with the harsh reality of his situation, even though he never quite grasps what is going on. Confused and always questioning his superiors and elders, Bruno gives way to many criticisms of the holocaust, without relying on any deep, thought-out questioning. This child-like approach to such a heavy topic can at times wear thin when the script relies on it exclusively to grasp at the heart of what is going on, but there are plenty of moments which work far more effectively, despite the abundance in which they reside. What propels the story even further however isn't within Bruno's interactions with his family and tutors, but with his new friend; the boy in the striped pyjamas, Shmuel (Jack Scanlon). Through their friendship, the movie achieves its most poignant message of how pointless and absurd the holocaust actually was. Bruno and Shmuel may never have any real time to bond and become close friends, but through their mutual isolation they find solace in each other, regardless of the electric fencing between them and whatever race of people they may be descendant from.Both child actors Butterfield and Scanlon do very well in their positions, and although they suffer from a distinct lack of true connection to the historical setting in which they find themselves, their inherent sense of ignorance brings the film a much needed air of innocence. As actors, both often avoid the usual awkwardness which usually afflicts thespians of their age and responsibility. The remainder of the cast hold their own just as well, with Vera Farmiga and David Thewlis providing some domestic dynamism as Bruno's mother and father adequately with enough resonance to further their son's personal story.In the end however, it was indeed the film's final ten minutes which won me over. As I mentioned previously, this may be a 12A film, and it may have been made with younger audiences in mind, yet in addition to the film's heavy themes and less than flowery characterisation, the film also closes on an extremely ballsy note. There's no doubt that the director could have copped out and went for something a little more pleasing, and it's actually surprising that even the studio let it slide given it's wide-demographic, yet when an ending like this arises one has to sit back and admire such a move. In essence, there is no other way that the movie could come to a close without losing its thematic and emotional core's poignancy to the less than successful whimsy fa\u00e7ade, so while such a closer feels surprising, it also feels completely welcome. Hard-hitting at its greatest moments and amusing in its lighter ones, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is an intelligent and heart-felt family film that is too often at odds with itself in terms of its tone, but in the end does enough good to achieve an air of significance amidst the bloated genre.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",

But cannot you realize that this film, while maybe fudging some accuracies, has delivered a powerful punch that illustrates the horror behind the whole master race thing?? I wasn't expecting the ending until the very last ten minutes and then I was appalled. I noticed the comment on here from someone who took issue with the fact that Bruno's mother was weeping for her lost child and asked what about the millions of Jewish parents who wept for their children? Hey, that was the whole point! Can't you see the parallel? It was also very unique to see this event through the eyes of a child and to see a typical German family and how they responded to the events. Not all in sympathy. I agree that we must never forget the \"monsters\" who perpetrated the Holocaust. But I've always been more intrigued by the \"good\" people who went along and wondered about what was going on in their heads at the time. Coming from a German/A,American background, it's a very personal question. How did they cope? I don't think this film could fail to awaken anyone to the misery and horror of the Holocaust. If people want complete accuracy, they can view the films taken of the camps after they were liberated.",

Even my favorite action drama film Pearl Harbor haven't made me shed tears from the beginning, but this film made me so. I felt lamented for the part of Bruno.As the movie progresses, it made me feel sadder seeing a Jew jailed in a camp. I really felt guilty for the Jewish boy even if I never had an encounter with a Jew. The audience impact was quite good and is very commendable.The screen portrayal can be rated above average, because I would be lying if I say that all acting done by the characters were perfect.

I kept thinking, \"Something will stop this,\" but it didn't.The script, the research behind the story, the strength of the two young leads, the adult supporting actors, the paradox of joviality and cruelty in the same house... it all made for an amazing piece of film.

It was good that Bruno didn't believe the Nazis about the Jews being evil, but he was still very naive. He thought that the camp was a good place to be because of the fake video that he saw his father and grandpa watching. He only got a small picture of what it was like in there. I don't see how he could have only got a small picture of it which also took a long time. I don't see why it took him so long to see that something was not right and to know that putting the striped clothes on and going in there was not a good idea.

Firstly, I couldn't engage with any of the characters - something not helped by the fact that most of the actors spoke with middle-class English accents. This was a big oversight on the part of the director, and detracted hugely from the any sense of authenticity the film was meant to have. German accents - or, at the very least, idioms - might at least have made things seem more believable. And that was the other thing... I simply didn't believe any of it. I'm sure the book is not based on any actual historical happening, but I'm perfectly willing to suspend disbelief in that regard. With the film, though, I couldn't do it. It just all rang false: the meetings between the boys, the nature of the friendship, the dialogue... none of it worked for me.At best, this was a parable about man's inhumanity to man, as demonstrated through the innocent misunderstandings of children.

The first few minutes were a bit boring but then the movie picked up and i was glued to my seat (my sofa at home) till its heartbreaking end. I was so stunned, I did not move for several minutes after it ended.This is an extraordinary film. I knew it would have a sad ending because it was about the holocaust, but I was totally unprepared for what happened in the end. The characters feel so real. The musical score is haunting. It is well acted. I never thought Vera Farmiga could do this kind of role- innocence turned into shock, bitterness, anger and the final devastation, from which she would probably never recover.Through the tutor of the children we get an understanding of how people in Germany were brainwashed those days to hate the Jews. Bruno's 12 year old sister is a good example of how children were influenced. Bruno is a more adventurous child, and he cannot hate the Jews because he has met some good ones (Pavel, a former Jewish Doctor who puts bandage on his wound, and his 8 year old friend Schmuel). The short film shown to the soldiers, and one that makes Bruno believe that the 'camp'is actually a pretty nice place, with a cafe and entertainment. Obviously the world was fooled by this propaganda until the truth came out. The innocence of the children is heartbreaking. I cannot get out of mind the images of Bruno and Schmuel. If the movie has a flaw, it's only a very small one. The children playing (hands like aeroplanes) at the start was a bit overdone. However, rest of the movie is so fluid and so intense that it can be easily forgiven.I found this movie more powerful than 'Life is beautiful'. It's one of the best holocaust movies I have ever seen.I am shocked that a beautiful movie like this got less than 8.0 on TMDB. I recommend this to anyone that cares for truly artistic films that are not just meant to entertain, and are not sci fi movies, but are meant to bare the souls of us humans.",

Asa Butterfield as Bruno simply cannot be bested here. The kid who plays the Jewish boy is almost as great.

            "content": "The large fence which separates a young German boy Bruno from another young Jewish boy named Shmuel, whom is imprisoned in a concentration camp, is the sole physical barrier blocking off contact and physical play between the pair of them. Where running; mischief and make believe misadventures with other people of his age were the order of the day when young Bruno lived at his prior address in another part of the nation of Germany, his time in the countryside with his family and distinguished father of the Army sees him only ever come face to face with one child of his age. The obstacle that is the perimeter fence of this camp forces Bruno to sit down and talk with another boy, and therein lies the core of a really affecting from British director Mark Herman, a lone stranded journey into the persistent unknown for a young protagonist as his discoveries and new found sense of adventure builds to a somewhat gut wrenching finale.The opening shot of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas encompasses the then German flag of the Nazi emblem on a red background and the apparent transparentness these flags carry as we vaguely see the figures of those whom occupy the space on the ground directly behind the flag. It's fitting, as the film is a sort gazing through into the standard-bearing Nazi family and furthermore into the lives of a cluster of people during The Second World War in Germany. The study is headed by young eight year old Bruno, played really well by English child actor Asa Butterfield, whom himself begins to see through all of what's around him through the bond with the aforementioned Jewish boy grows stronger by each scene they share.The film begins in Berlin with Bruno and a batch of his friends charging through the public streets of a German town that is seeing its Jews extradited and evicted, they re-enact war games and pretend to be fighter planes when they aren't mock shooting one another like soldiers; the activity around them bearing no significance nor much interest to Bruno or his friends. While hundreds of people around him are feeling the full effects of a war, something Bruno is ignorant to at this time, he plays out mock war-games with his friends for pure amusement. The boy and his family are due to be extradited, too. His father, Ralph (Thewlis), is a higher up in the German Army and along with mother Elsa (Farmiga) and sister Gretel (Beattie) they venture off to the countryside so that Ralph may take charge of a nearby Concentration Camp. Once there the family takes board in a large nearby house which is isolated from the rest of its surroundings, but Bruno is disenchanted by this new place of dwelling; his prior exposure to many kids his age and his need for expansive locales in which to play gone. One day, he tries to find excitement and adventure beyond the complex's limits, despite being warned not to go beyond them, and amongst the nearby wood separating the camp from the grounds.It is Bruno's tutor himself whom tells him he needs to move away from fiction and more into fact. They are, of course, talking about the books Bruno has a habit of reading but the greater extent of this statement from the author parallelling the lead's arc is fairly obvious. Refusing to heed the advice from his stern faced mother, Bruno heads out into the woods and stumbles across that large looking establishment the film has already shown us out of a window through young Bruno's gaze. In the far corner, sat behind some large construction items, is the titular boy in striped pyjamas Shmuel (Scanlon), who is to Bruno at last a human being his age. As mentioned, the large wired fence separating the two disables an ability to bond in a manic and playful manner more resembling the Bruno of old; instead the film opting for the two to partake in exchanges linked as to why Shmuel is named as such; why he wears what looks like the titular pyjamas and what he's doing in that large outdoor zone. He had friendships back in Berlin, but through Shmuel he learns the true meaning of the word.The film's distinct tone and atmosphere arrives by way of the obvious sensation of having seen the sort of content explored in the film before, ie; The Holocaust, but always with that knowing sense of tragedy and sadness as adults try to comprehend what it is they're facing or going through. Here, it's what you know disturbingly but effectively filtered through an initial perspective of naivety, before things gradually become more obvious for those at the centre of the film. The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is a well made and meticulously observed piece, unfolded with exactly the sort of mature attitude required and never for one moment dragging as it progressively revolves around an issue the audience is immediately savvy to filtered through a viewpoint which needs time and natural progression to catch up. The film is an edifying character piece, documenting a specific time in history and the specific, now infamous, beliefs from said time without ever falling back into the sort of groove something passable but ultimately underwhelming such as Goodbye Bafana or Imagining Argentina resembles. Its build to what is a terrifying and distorting finale due to its sudden insertion of a more rapid pace, is equally affecting; a rounding off of a film thoroughly worth seeing.",

            "content": "For a while, I hesitated from watching this movie. I had read the book and had really enjoyed it but the movie reviews said the movie was a bit slow and took time to get off the mark. I have just watched this movie as I had nothing better to do.In all honesty, I am glad I delayed watch it. 4 and a half years ago I would have been only 12 and would not have been able to handle it. I would have sobbed, perhaps I would have had a few nightmares and I would have beaten up the German kid at school! This movie has had a real in impact on my perception of the world and of historical events in the time of the World Wars. I know that current day Germans have no part in their past, however I cannot hold back the feeling that I want to take some sort of revenge even though I am an unbiased observer with no particular interest in either side.This is one of the most emotive movies I have seen since I was a child. The cries of a distressed mother was enough to make me choke up, besides the thought of what would have happened to Bruno. The film leaves you to add in the rest and use your imagination to fill in the gaps and think of what happened to the men and children of the holocaust! This movie explores the impacts of misguided perceptions and apparent bias/racism has on entire cultures and the innocence of the blameless children caught up in it.Although I previously said that I am glad that I delayed watching this movie, I am also VERY glad that I did end up watching it. Right now I just want to punch a German however I understand that it is not appropriate and am able to withstand my emotions now that I am a 17 year old.I recommend this movie to all and any person above the age of at least 12 with strong parental guidance recommended for anyone younger. Even though there is no violence, swearing, drug or alcohol abuse or any sexual content, it is the subconscious aspect of the film that makes you think \"What if...\" that really makes the movie an adult film only (recommended).Any movie that can move a grown man like it moved me deserves the highest praise. I am really glad I watched this movie. I do not regret it and it is now one of my favorites.8/10",

Firstly is the camp an Extermination, Concentration or Labour Camp. If its an Extermination camp then the children, the sick and elderly would have been gassed within hours of arrival. and yet the ending obviously points to it being just so. We are meant to believe that this little Jewish boy,escapes an initial selection, and can spend his day sitting by the external fence - presumably not electrified, and only at the end of his shift runs back with an empty wheelbarrow. Its just so absurd for anyone who knows anything about The Holocaust.The little Jewish boy doesn't mention to his German friend that they live in fear of beatings, torture etc.The wife knows nothing about the Final Solution, nor the position her husband will be taking up.The whole premise is just too absurd for words. And to those reviewers saying that the ending was so emotional, it was just so predictable. Yet we are meant to feel such sadness for one aryan death compared to millions of Jewish deaths...Total nonsense as a film and a waste of 90 mins",

Truly children are the truest form of humans not corrupted and divided by lies, religion, caste, creed, race but unified and pure by friendship, love and simplicity.Kudos to everyone associated with this project, it is truly inspiring. I wish filmmakers work into more scripts like this. A must watch for everyone above the age of 14 (I guess a little maturity is required to understand the simplicity}. Wow I miss my childhood.

I don't know what, but yes I found a strange similarity between these 2 movies...This movie has a backdrop of world war II.

Although as others have said the two boys could not have met unobserved for so long, if you are prepared to overlook this you have a wonderful film. Almost as painful to watch as the inmates' suffering are the terrible effects on Bruno's family as it becomes harder for them to be able to ignore what is going on around them. The Lieutenant seems to be a stereotype until the dinner scene, when suddenly even he becomes a real human being.Nearly all the horrific events are implied and off-screen, but the constant understated references are very clever: the black clouds blowing over the garden, and the chillingly brilliant scene with Gretel's dolls stored in the cellar, so innocent in itself but so evocative of what was really happening.I would not class this as a children's film, but the way it is done from Bruno and Shmuel's perspective means that (older) children can relate to the characters. Nobody in the cinema said a word when the credits rolled when I saw it, it is so powerful. See this film.",

            "content": "Watched an appalling film last night called The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\u0085 Literally if I had not seen the Moth Man prophecies (a film where actually nothing happens) it could have been challenging for worst film ever.It's about this little kid in Nazi Germany called Bruno set in World War II. Anyway of course it would turn out that his dad has a new job that they have to move to the country for leaving their nice house in the city, and the job is\u0085.. wait for it, being in charge of a Nazi death camp that regularly burns 'rubbish'. Anyway nothing at all happens for about 80 minutes until Bruno who has been playing where he shouldn't be (naughty boy) out in the back garden which seems perilously close to the actual concentration camp, befriends this Jewish boy through the electric fence of this camp. When he hears that the boy's father has gone 'missing' he goes and gets a shovel digs his way under the wire fence, climbs into the camp and merrily goes off with his new found friend in search of the missing father. Now unfortunately enough (and you might see where this is going) this turns out to be a classic case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time the optimistic Bruno and his friend Shmuel get rounded up when looking in one of the buildings with a load of other Jewish prisoners and are hustled along to a shower block where they are all told to strip as its 'shower time', even at this point our bewildered Bruno's face only gives a brief flicker of apprehension before being reassured by a guard that its only a shower and he'll be fine, right after the guard slams and bolts the door shut\u0085. Meanwhile back at the mansion they've been living in, 'mother' looks out of the window to check that the illustrious Bruno is gaily playing on the swing, which he's not. And so ensues a frantic search demonstrated by cut scenes between the dad, mum and sister looking under the odd table or chair in the house - this bit is entwined with a few flashes of lightening and shots of a thunderstorm starting, just to subtly emphasise to the viewer that maybe everything is not alright. \u2013 Anyway, of course the dad gets to the gas chamber a little bit too late for poor old Bruno and although there is no explanation as to how he exactly knew that Bruno had definitely been gassed anyway, it set the filmmakers up nicely enough to have him fall on his knees into the mud and scream BRUNOOO as the rain lashes down around him the mum somehow hears the cry of anguish even though she's distant and starts shedding tears\u0085..OK so they basically thought of an emotive scene and worked everything backwards from there. The plot was thin, and threaded together completely out of convenience without any care as to whether there was any realism or viability to it. The actors all spoke in very well spoken English and acted like English people. A seemingly random decision the filmmakers took would be that they sporadically used Jewish prisoners from the concentration camp as staff around the house, to polish the glasses or peel potatoes even though they had maids\u0085 It just looked and seemed completely ridiculous. There is a scene where this young Nazi officer, grabs the Jewish prisoner that is serving them at a formal dinner (the prisoner from the camp is wearing his concentration camp clothes which looked like striped Pyjamas which Bruno hilariously through the whole film keeps asking why they have the striped pyjamas on??) because he spilt the dessert wine while pouring it for him, and drags him to the side of the room and starts pummelling him in front 'of the kids' during the meal he also somehow manages to blurt out that his father was a defector which proved to be a bit of foot in mouth moment for him as he was sent of to the front line the next day for not informing the Nazi's of this.The direction of photography was poor, with abrupt cut to a face on shot used pretty much every time someone speaks. The gassing of the feckless Bruno at the end is a blatant attempt to jerk tears out of retarded viewers who can't see that it was coming all along, the scene ultimately leaves them feeling sad for him rather than all the Jews which have died. Really really bad. I can see how they sold it though, they got Eric Cartman into the studio director's office, and Eric starts off it's the beautiful story of two friends, no, life companions who meet against the backdrop of one of the worst man-made atrocities of our time, one is a Jew in the concentration camp and the other is the son of the guy in charge of murdering all of the Jews, much hilarity ensues as this odd duo battle against all odds to keep their friendship and the trouble oblivious Bruno has understanding why they have prison numbers on their clothes, why they have to stay behind their fence, why Shmuel keeps asking him for food, why there's a funny smell in the air and why on earth are you wearing your PJs (BRUNO you little rascal that joke just won't ever get old \u2013 kinda like you!!! -Ha ha ha)\u0085. Blah blah blah Bruno accidentally gets gassed in the chamber with the other Jews. THE END.",

They really resemble our own thoughts when they think people can't possibly harm other people like that.

            "review_title": "More Inside The Third Reich Than Ever",
            "content": "This movie is something of a pancake; it has two sides.One side is the excellent technicals; no one will argue that any of the actors turned in superb performances, or that the costumers, editors or cameramen produced anything less than excellence.On the other side, it's one of the first movies to show what it was like to live in the Third Reich, to constantly look over one's shoulder \u2013 \"der Deutsche Blick\" \u2013 to see who might be listening. The kids, free or slave, all do it, but so do the adults, even those who seem to be in most power. The film reverberates across many of the questions our societies are facing today. Watching it doesn't end with the credits; it goes on in questions raised in the mind of the viewer. The best films write in mental prequels and sequels and off-camera scenes. \"Pajamas\" produces whole scripts in the mind.Within the film is another film: a re-created version of an original camp film, made by the Nazis to prove how well their prisoners were treated. It's silly and amateurish, like most propaganda, but it seems very much a reflection of the American Happy Darky tradition: films that portray black people as happy with their lot, either as slaves or as second-class citizens. The American versions were much more polished and ingrained in the society. One of John Ford's early films, \"Judge Priest,\" offers such an ex-slave, portrayed by the legendary black actor Stepin Fetchi (Lincoln Theodore Monroe Andrew Perry) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepin_Fetchit).It was as though the Nazis had attempted to import the slave America of the 1840's into a modern country a century later. The scenes where the ex-doctor shivers before his new masters calls to mind the terrifying performances of Fetchit, whose shambling, cringing slave was a ghastly indictment of the society that had put black people into the position of being forced to cower simply to survive.The German family mirrors almost exactly descriptions of slave-owning Americans. Slaves are to be invisible, and can be beaten or even killed with impunity, while some family members act as though nothing is happening, others are aghast, and children look to the adults for guidance. The mother's (Vera Farmiga) reaction echo incidents in the American south, as described in diaries and letters, when a woman from a non-slave area married into a family in a slave state. The mother's is the sudden shock of a civilized German when faced with a growing slave culture as a part of her country's military. It's one thing to hear about things that seem to be an accepted part of the culture or the public good, even angrily or fearfully warning children to avoid a group of people, such as gypsies or AIDS victims \u2013 it's another to see these actions in their naked brutality. Torture was \"necessary\" for the safety of the country until the videos and photographs hit the internet.The Lieutenant's fury at the slave is portrayed as re-directed rage and an attempt to demonstrate his own part as a complete member of his society. The film is not clear about the point, never making clear whether or not he is afraid of being punished for his father's actions under the all-encompassing Sippschaftsgericht (blood-relation laws), or if it was his own Jewish blood he was attempting to distance himself from. The happy-families propaganda film was made for internal consumption, to demonstrate to Germans who were half or part Jewish while being legally Aryan \u2013 to the point of serving in the army \u2013 that their imprisoned relatives were being treated humanely. Up to the point the camps became death camps, these legal Germans were allowed to visit their relatives. The Lieutenant's fury could mis-directed self defense, of himself, and even of his mother, who, it is hinted, has committed the sin of breeding with a man of Jewish blood. Did he hint at the burning bodies to the film's mother to distance himself from his Jewish background \u2013 or unconsciously to open her eyes? Or even to gain an emotional ally? Might his posting to the eastern front come as a relief? Again, this reflects John Ford's used of mixed blood in his movies. In \"Judge Priest\" a foolish, mean-spirited suitor is what in the America south would be considered black, because of his small proportion of black blood. The \"misceginated\" were adjudged scheming and troublesome, unlike blacks, who were expected to be simpler and tamer. The word was used for the same purpose in \"Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou.\" By the time Ford made \"Sergeant Rutledge\" \u2013 startling for its attempt at its time to portray black men as differentiated human beings \u2013 the virginal, murdered rape victim is a very light-skinned black girl, sending out further resonances in a film about what happened to a black man if he was suspected of \"white woman business.\" That her officer father owned a plantation before the war raises more questions.The child actors in \"Pajamas\" are focused, intent, naive, but not saccharine. Both of them express snotty fun of each other's names. Both of them betray each other when faced with a ranting adult, demonstrating how all little children must beware of fearsome giants in their lives. In the additional actor interviews on the DVD, Jack Scanlon (Schmul) says that when the actor playing the Lieutenant \u2013 who had not raised his voice in rehearsals -- yelled in his face, he didn't expect it, and felt real fear. Starling or angering another actor to produce a genuine emotional affect goes back to the hand-cranked days. Hitchcock was notorious for using abusing actors to get a raw performance.",

            "review_title": "A morality tale on the Nazi era",
            "content": "For most of this movie, you get the impression that it might have been based on a true story. It concerns a German family during the Nazi era. The father is an officer with the SS, I think, and has to relocate his family to run a 'work camp' for people, including Jews, when he receives a promotion.The father (played by David Thewlis) has a young family...a young boy and a slightly older daughter (she is 12 years old in the story, the boy is 8 years old). The story is told from the perspective of the boy, Bruno, played by Asa Butterfield.The period detail of the era seems very good, and the central family is human...just because the father is an important Nazi does not mean he is caricatured as an evil villain. Some of the Nazi propaganda/paraphernalia which the daughter becomes taken with seems genuine.From the perspective of Bruno, the 'work camp' is a farm where the farmers wear strange attire (striped pyjamas). Exploring that farm's boundaries, he meets a young boy about his age, called \"Shmuel\", played by Jack Scanlon. Shmuel looks like an urchin from a Charles Dickens novel...grubby faced, and with rotten teeth. Bruno and Schmuel form an unlikely friendship, one which is unknown to his parents and sister.Despite the grim setting of this movie, Bruno's naivete is charming and provides much of the humour which this movie possesses. However, despite being very naive, Bruno is faced with some serious moral dilemmas, and these provide some of the most dramatic moments of the movie.Any thoughts I had of finding out if the movie was based on a kernel of truth went out the window towards the end of the movie. It's here that the movie obviously goes into 'morality tale' mode. The movie is intended to be manipulative here, which isn't a bad thing. It's just that I felt that manipulation was not successful, as it needed to be, given the turn of events. In fact, the strange turn the movie took distracted me from the intended manipulation...I was formulating hypotheses on where the movie was given...even wondering if there was another, hidden level to Shmuel. My working hypothesis went out the window, as the turn was in keeping with the preceding events.Despite being an art-house movie, this movie has been in Australia's top 10 movies at the box-office, I think, for a few weeks, meaning that it has found a mainstream audience.Overall, Bruno and Shmuel are captivating characters...ones you will be glad to have known. For me, it's a pity that the movie lacked more of an emotional punch...but others may feel it succeeded splendidly on that level. Perhaps the denouement was a little too sudden for me.",

            "content": "Firstly, I would like to say I have not read the book, so I would not pretend to compare the book with the movie.I watched the movie 2 weeks ago and I immediately wanted to write this review. But I found it hard to rate the film. Giving it 1 or 2 would be an insult to the brilliant cinematic experience of this movie. Giving it 9 or 10 seemed like celebrating the tragedy presented in the film and an insult to the surge of emotions that swept through my body after watching it.The movie shows a German soldier's kid Bruno befriending a boy, Schmuel, from neighboring Jew concentration camp. He is unable to understand why the boy cannot cross the barbed wires or what is he there for. He is unable to understand why Jews are taught to them by their tutor as evil. He fails to grab that his father is not the hero of a war and just another puppet of the dictator who has been assigned to the eliminate the same people he is trying to befriend. Bruno also does not understand why Jew doctors are peeling potatoes and Jew watch makers fix machines.Bruno's lack of understanding of events stems from his childhood innocence who desperately wishes to see his father as a heroic figure and who cannot see evil in anyone or anything. His innocence and love for adventure is bound to lead him to his doom in Hitler's Germany.In the end, as soon as he removes his clothes and wears pajamas, he digs his own grave, metaphorically and literally and ends up being just another victim of Jewish persecution.The movie presents the idea that the only difference between Germans and Jews were the clothes they were forced to wear, otherwise no one could differentiate between the two, just by looking at them. Hence, the whole point of Jewish persecution by the Nazis was a ridiculous ideology that cost millions of people their lives.Apart from the Germans speaking in English with a flawless British accent, the movie completely nails the tragedy and doom of holocaust and how ridiculous it seems from the eyes of kids.Truly children are more smarter than adults!",

They amplify the dramatic-ism of the shock of their death with that slow track out of the gas chamber, but provide no aftermath? The last shot of the mother is of her crying hysterically, which she obviously would be, but what does she do as a result? -Same thing with the father, he realises what has happened and screams out \"Bruno!\" in shock and horror - but what becomes of his duty at the camp? on his viewpoint of the war?They didn't even have the opportunity to see what Bruno thought of the conflict with the Jews, firstly because he didn't tell them, and secondly because they didn't even know that he had a friend at the camp. In their mind their child would have just wandered off, found the camp, dug in and got himself killed. They didn't establish any moment where their son's actions had influenced their view on the war.Also, there were central characters who played needless roles in the movie, such as the young blond soldier, who's ultimate purpose in the story it seems, was to discipline Shmuel. This, the father could have done. They also made it look like something would happen between him and the girl, which nothing did, redefining his pointlessness. Most of his scenes made little or no contribution to the narrative.Now, I haven't read the book. I'm sure there were deeper explanations to some of these points, but this was a movie adaptation - so as that, I feel that although it had potential to be great, it left much to be desired.",

I could even say that the tuneful music is the best part. In the same lines, the story takes off. How a lively kid, away from his friends, enclosed in a Nazi mansion tries to find solace in his newly found friends who also happen to intrigue him. This, as a result, creates ripples in the family. And eventually, things turn ugly.What the makers have done here with adaptation is that they have given ample time to create character depths. Their auras are well-defined, mostly because we know the war time. The cinematography is excellent, with least to no anachronisms. I was stunned by the performance of the lead boys. Vera Farmiga is terrific, as always. The whole shebang looks very good.It simply tells a moving story and makes us abhor the war more and more and the climax will make you turn on the waterworks.

I couldn't fault the acting, but the only thing I would say is please do not take a young child to see this. Its so upsetting even for an adult. Personally I would say no child under 12 should see it. The only other film where everyone sat quiet and still until the credits had finished, was Schindler's List. I was speechless afterwards and I am someone that has known about the holocaust all my life as I was born just after the war finished, but every time I see something like this, I find myself just not being able to fathom out how human beings could treat others in this way. I could see what was going to happen (re: the ending) and most people I imagine would, but it didn't make it any less terrifying. OK, this was fiction but it was easy to see how this could easily have happened for real. This happened in a civilised country. I am afraid that I can never, ever forgive what these people did - to me, its almost in my lifetime and certainly in my sister's and my parents of course. Of course these films should be shown, but the only thing I would say is that they do rake up old memories and make it difficult to forgive or move on.

Set in World War II, the story sees eight-year-old Bruno (Asa Butterfield) moving house with sister Gretel (Amber Beattie) and Mother (Vera Farmiga), because of his Nazi-officer Father (Harry Potter's David Thewlis) being promoted. They have relocated to the countryside of Germany, where the Father, unknown to Bruno, is the commanding officer of a near prison camp. A mysterious man dressed in what seem to be striped pyjamas, named Pavel (David Hayman), who is actually a Jewish prisoner (and ex-doctor), talks to Bruno a little. But Bruno is curious of the \"farm\" he can see from his window, and disobeying his Mother, he explores what unknown to him is a concentration camp, and he forms a friendship with eight-year-old Schultz (B\u00e9la Fesztbaum), also dressed in striped pyjamas, like many others behind the electrified bard-wire fence. Both being young and naive, they don't realise the reality of the situation, with Shmultz and many others in the camp being Jewish and seen by the Nazis as an enemy. In the end, Bruno dresses in some pyjamas, and he and Schultz attempt to find his missing Father, and when Bruno's family realise where he may have gone to, by the time they get there, he, Scmultz and many other Jews have been exterminated. Also starring Richard Johnson as Grandpa, Sheila Hancock as Grandma, Rupert Friend as Lieutenant Kotler and Jim Norton as Herr Liszt. It is heartbreaking to see the children befriending each other without knowing the truth about what is going on, and you really realise the tragedy and cruelty of events that occurred back then.

He sneaks up to the fence outside of the camp and meets a Jewish boy, whom he befriends. Slowly, he comes to realize that something awful is happening, and that his father is partly responsible for it. It's a great concept. It's not a great movie. I'm unsure if the fault lies with the original novel or the screenplay (by director Herman, best known for a couple of '90s indies, Little Voice and Brassed Off), but the story eschews interesting moral philosophy in favor of a more base emotionality. This is especially true in the ridiculously forced climactic sequence, with its swelling music and completely illogical cross-cutting. There's an earlier sequence in which Bruno informs on the Jewish boy in order to get out of some trouble. This should have formed the climax, similar to Louis Malle's Au Revoir les Enfants.

I felt from the start that the film lacked that authentic feel that other Holocaust film like 'Schindler's list' had. This was probably due to the fact that 'The Boy in The Striped Pyjamas' was set in Germany but all the characters, including the Jewish boy and all the soldiers had ridiculously British upper class accents. Even a bad German accent would have been better! Also, Bruno, who was the son of a soldier, had been brought up in Berlin in Nazi Germany but yet the audience are supposed to believe that Bruno had no previous understanding of the situation whatsoever, which is completely unrealistic, since by the time concentration camps were in use, practically every school in Germany would have drummed in to the children that \"Jews were responsible for all the problems\". Furthermore, the boy that Bruno befriends (a Jew working in the concentration camp) manages, with no problems from the guards, to regularly meet Bruno, play board games and eat food which he passes through the fence. I just found the whole thing incredibly hard to believe. The only way that this story would be at all plausible is if the Jewish boy was simply an imaginary friend, created by Bruno to replace those he lost after leaving Berlin. Bruno is always portrayed as being an explorer, is it possibly that his curiosity alone lead him to enter the concentration camp? Who knows...but for me, imaginary friend or not, unfortunately this film was just not as realistic or engaging as I had hoped.",

It was so captivating that you will feel like you are there seeing, smelling, and hearing all that the characters are sensing. The writing is powerful, and the acting is superb. The suspense is so subtly brought forth that you don't see it coming in that you don't realize that the entire film is one big suspenseful build up to the end. Overall, this film is incredibly well done. The message about the horrors of the holocaust will stay with you, as the film is hauntingly memorable.",

This story revolves around the 8 year kid called Bruno who is instinctively an explorer and he depicts it (in nazi Germany). A set of events lead the family of this boy to leave their city Berlin and move to a far away country side of Germany . This journey gives you clues that the place is in some sense haunting (won't reveal any more ). Bruno continues with his pursuit of adventure over there through which he finds a 8 year old Friend . The climax is for you to see . This movie is not as much about the Holocaust but about human emotions, about the innocence of children ,why the grace and good nature of women is taking care of this world , the monster in every men and how life can be a Frankenstein . This movie will stay with you for a long time , will anguish you , will hearten you and will make u ponder .Must watch . Go with 4.5/5 . PS: I would suggest that you watch Schindler's list and pianist before watching this . Will help you appreciate this movie better",

The movie stayed with the book very well. Of course it wasn't exactly the same but it was very close.I was very impressed with the cast selection. I enjoyed the fact that non of the actors were well known, it somehow made the acting more believable. I also noticed that the actors looked as I imagined them while I was reading the book.The thing I was most impressed with was the acting itself. It was so convincing and realistic it was as if these things were really happening to these actors.The only critique I have for the movie was the accents the characters used, It was much more of an English accent than a German one. I am German and speak some and have many friends with German accents and I'm afraid that the accents in this movie are not anywhere near what I recognize to be a German accent.Overall I was VERY happy with the movie and can't wait to watch it again. 9/10 !",

This is a film about two boys who become friends in unusual circumstances. One boy is in a concentration camp and the other whose father is a member of the German army and leader of the concentration camp become friends in the most unlikeable of circumstances.This, as films go, is not a feel good movie. Yes there are bits in it that may bring a smile to your face, but no, overall the film is a harsh kick in the pants of the sort of atrocities that happened during WWII. To diagnose this film is rather difficult because it does have two lights on it, the beautiful innocence and friendship of two lonely boy's friendship and yet it is still clouded in dark due to the story that we know is basically unfolding.Overall a great film, sad as I have said, but I highly recommend seeing it! If you do manage to get the opportunity to watch this film, I suggest doing it with someone who you don't mind cuddling or at least crying with. I reckon this film will bring all parents to tears and I dare to say some of the \"tougher\" men too.On what seems to be a lower budget (US$12,500,000) than most of Hollywoods releases.

            "content": "I saw this film at home shortly after completing the book, so obviously the plot and minor details were all still fresh in my mind. And I have to say that while I did find the film very moving, there were a few glaring things I noticed that didn't seem to match with the book. I'll just get those out of the way first; 1) The characters look quite different to how I pictured them. Bruno in particular looks like a mini-Hitler, with the perfect haircut and big blue eyes which he doesn't seem to blink. I expected his father to have a big curly moustache, not that that matters! ;) 2) The friendship between Bruno and Shmuel didn't interest me in the film as it had done in the book. Bruno actually regards Shmuel with disdain at first, and doesn't seem to like his name much. 3) Smhuel actually looks about the same size as Bruno, and a lot of the people in the camp at the end look rather well-fed. I found I was able to watch them without feeling too distressed, as they didn't look particularly unhealthy - just dirty and forlorn. 4) The meeting point for the two boys was set in a forest, and not too far away from Bruno's house. It is a walk of a couple of miles in the book, and I expected it to be more open, barren. Shmuel is actually within sight of the soldiers and fellow camp mates, and yet they happily play Chess and throw balls to one another over the fence. 5) Bruno not only already has a pair of striped pyjamas, but he also doesn't shave his hair! And he takes his cap off before entering the gas chamber, yet no-one notices him!However, these points aside, there were some excellent parts which I - well, not enjoyed, but was deeply moved by. 1) When Kotler lost his temper with Pavel, the looks on the faces of the children really broke my heart. I couldn't believe the father was sitting there eating calmly, while his family were almost in tears! 2) The mother gave an outstanding performance - I could really feel her distress when searching for Bruno, and when Kotler accidentally revealed the source of the 'awful smell', I joined her in horrified shock, she conveyed her emotion so well. 3) Aside from his Nazi-ish looks (and the rather shaky start to the friendship), I thought Bruno did a wonderful job too. At the end, as he was comforting Smhuel in the 'shower', I was willing them to escape, to survive - and of course his childish innocence was well delivered. 4) Gretel did a good job of playing the bratty but there-when-you-need-her sister, and the scene with her sitting in bed with Bruno as their parents argued was very moving. 5) Of course, the final, dramatic scene with the gas chamber - all the banging and panic, and then just silence. Words can't describe how incredible that scene was. It was just so awful... All in all, if I hadn't read the book previously, I would've given this about a 9, but there were just a few parts here and there that I was uncomfortable with. The cast delivered excellent performances however, and I would definitely watch this again.",

The film was moving, and the message is one that I shall stick by; friendship and love can be found in the most darkest of times.The musical score was also fantastic - James Horner is a genius.I HIGHLY recommend the film, but I must insist (by not revealing much) that you should keep a box of tissues handy.",

In principle, the Holocaust is a very important part of history and many films have been made on this topic, but it is \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" that stands out from the rest of the films. And this is not a movie with a happy ending. It was extremely sorry for the boy and his father at the end. And most of all, it is sad from the misunderstanding on the part of the German boy, since he did not understand why he was forbidden to communicate, in fact, with the same child as he was. During the entire film, we can observe a sincere, childhood friendship that has no boundaries, no rules, as in adulthood. From this film, I received a maximum of warm emotions from the relationship of the kids, and also felt very sad.",

It is undoubtedly about the war, but about the war shown through the eyes of a boy who has never seen evil in his life. The main thing is what the film takes for the soul (as well as the book) this is the naivety of the main character. Bruno does not divide people, as does his father, his sister; his world is full of amazing discoveries and adventures.Little Shmuel's life is completely different. But he is not broken. He's in a cage, his family is being tortured by soldiers, but he's stronger than them. Because he has faith, simple childish faith. The end is unspeakably terrible, but not even because what is happening is happening, but because you look into Bruno's eyes, you seem to be among these people, his calm compresses your heart, you want to scream: Run! Only there's nowhere to run. That's what it is. This is a dead end. Cruelty is a dead end.Dad, who are these people in striped pajamas?Bruno, they are not people at all.To be remembered.10 out of 10.",

(Source: IMDb)The Boy in the striped pyjamas is \"A story of innocence in a world of ignorance\" and one of the most emotional movies I have ever seen, although I think it was a bit boring and not quite the best but I do recommend everyone to see it, great story and emotional ending.The movie could have been a really great movie especially that it's based on a book by John Boyne that's so famous and so emotional, so they had a great story but I felt like the script was so weak and the way that the movie was telling the story wasn't what I expected, I also felt like it could have won \"Best adapted screenplay\" if the script was so good which is going to take me to the directing too that was good but not great, felt like the movie could have had so many great and memorable frames which it did but they were very few.The cast was good although I felt like some actors and actresses would have fit the role better, Asa Butterfield as Bruno was a great choice, he always puts on a great performance although he was young. Jack Scanlon was so amazing in playing the role of Shmuel, you can feel the chemistry between the two young actors which I think what made the movie so great, David Thewlis as Commander Ralf and Rupert Friend as Lieutenant Kotler were so amazing they both gave us these dirty and evil characters that you will hate after watching the movie, and Finally, Vera Farmiga as Elsa who I felt like in some scenes she was trying so hard to just fit into that character but could not, the only scene I liked was when she was fighting with her husband Commander Ralf, but other than that her facial expressions and acting were not that great.The music score was not a problem at all, it added a great touch to a few scenes and it even made some scenes more emotional.The movie showed us what life was during \"The Holocaust\" in such a genuine, dramatic, and emotional way because \"The Holocaust\" is a difficult subject for sure that many people suffered during it.\nHighly recommend this emotional / sad movie that will touch your heart and will leave you in tears after watching it.My rating is 7/10",

There is a sense of innocence in his performance that lends itself beautifully to the utter despair one feels while experiencing this film for the first time.

I took my 10 year old son to see this.I thought it would be a film about friendship arising in bizarre situations more than anything else, and with a happy ending.The promo poster, with the 2 boys sitting near each other under an attractive colourful sky is quite deceiving, too. The ending, which happens very quickly was a real shock to me, because I understood it. My son, however, didn't understand it, as, to him, it was just a bunch of naked people going into a shower. When the credits started rolling, he said he didn't understand it. I was really quite choked up. It is a brilliant film. Of coarse, the cinema was dead silent for a couple of minutes. So I told him I'd explain it a bit later, which I did when we left. I wasn't quite prepared to tell him about the Holocaust, (I don't believe a 10 year old should know of the appalling things that have happened),and I don't think he really understood it afterwards. At the Imperial War Museums' permanent Holocaust exhibition, they do not let children younger than 14 in. I believe this is more appropriate. How can a child understand this subject matter? So I think it should have been given a 15 certificate, at least. As I said, the film is great. The German characters speaking English was a good idea. It made them appear more like people we may know. More like \"normal\" people, which, of coarse they were. Anyone can be brainwashed. The German population had it all through the 30s. Can any one person among us say they would have been immune to it? The music score, usually so overpowering and overdone in most modern films, was very subtle. There was one scene with a very effective contrast, during the first encounter of the 2 boys, the very healthy looking German on the one side of the barbed wire (which wasn't shown during his shot), with the green trees and blue sky behind him,all very peaceful, then the shot of the Jewish boy (dirty, missing teeth, shaved head, wire in shot),with concrete and dirt around him, and people shouting in the distance.The film also succeeded in keeping EVERYONES' attention the whole way through, a rare thing, and the way nobody spoke at the end, was uncanny.

Really, this is a very cruel reality of which Bruno is completely unaware of, and may not be able to fathom even if he is told.Bruno's sister Greta, a 12 year old, is also fond of Hitler, and may become a fascist in the future. This story is about the friendship of two naive 8 year old German and Jewish boys. Bruno's domestic help Pavel, a Jew is a doctor, but still their servant. Bruno thinks he must not be a good doctor, so now he peels potatoes. Schmuel also doesn't know what is done in the camp'.The most impressive aspect about the film is the dialogue between the two boys, who are completely unaware of the ghastly things going around.You do get very much idea about what is going to happen in the end, but the film in the climax will still shock you and keep you stunned for a while.",

I won't say any more as it would spoil it for everyone willing to watch it.The movie is fantastically scripted and acted. In my opinion the actors did a wonderful job, especially Bruno (Asa Butterfield)as you see the movie unfold through his eyes. He plays his part with such innocence and is not entirely sure what's going on at first, he is very confused about his Fathers area of work. His father (David Thewlis) plays the part of the Father wonderfully. You can tell he cares very deeply for his family but also has great pride in his job and comes off as a cold emotionless character. The Mother (Vera Farmiga) is very much different from her husband as we can see her character crumbling when she discovers the grim truth about her husbands work. You can really put yourself in the picture and feel how disturbing it would have been to be a part of the holocaust. At first we would think that Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) is the Boy in the striped Pyjamas,as we see him and Bruno form a friendship even though they are divided by the barbed wire. but as the devastating ending draws near we realise it is indeed Bruno. As we go through the film seeing the holocaust through Bruno's eyes it makes us realise that we are all innocent human beings, just like Bruno and Shmuel who are very different people but are supposed to be enemies separated by the fence. It is only when we are Adults that we have our own beliefs and take in life that we are no longer as innocent and can become 'monsters' The adaptation of 'the boy in the striped pyjamas makes us realise that many people were separated during the holocaust, not by a barbed wire but by ignorance and we forget what a cruel time this was. The film can be upsetting and shocking but is also not one to miss. I would definitely give 'the boy in the striped pyjamas' 10 stars, and recommend it to everyone!I also wouldn't recommend letting young children see this film. Im 18 and was disturbed by it. I think they should greatly consider raising the certificate to a 15.",

I am normally one to blubber at all films, but this film moved me so much i could not even cry, all i could do was shake in despair as i watched it happen on screen, i felt helpless just like many people living during that time period must have. Afterwards when the credits started rolling, everyone sat there staring at the screen and even when walking out, not a word was spoken. The atmosphere was a real indication of the effect of which the film had on every single person in that cinema.I really would recommend this film to anyone, but it will affect you for a long time afterwards. I took GCSE Modern World History, and nothing could have prepared me for the reality shock which this film has shown me. A real eye opener, i think that both John Boyne (who wrote the novel) and Mark Herman (Screenplay) have done themselves proud, a sensitive topic which they have delicately (and successfully) handled.

The cinematography and the costumes are absolutely amazing and very close to the atmosphere of the decade that the movie takes place. Also Vera Farmiga gives and amazing performance.

Also good (of course) was David Thewlis but here is the first big BUT about \"The boy in the striped Pyjamas\"...The British accent of Thewlis and not only ruined a very big amount of the film cause felt so out of place! I understand that this was a BBC production, but again! Thewlis playing a Nazi was way Britisher than it was acceptable!My last BIG bad point about the movie is the music! The score is absolutely out of the spirit! In the first scene with the same happy tune that it presented the German Kids go over to the poor Jewis... and in the closing scene, Jesus! Nothing emotional in a very good scene!that's all for me!!",

            "content": "This week, I sat through 3 films centred on the Nazis and Jews during WWII - \"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\", \"Defiance\" and \"Good\". Of the 3, this is by far the superior movie. \"Good\" just wasn't very good. \"Defiance\" suffered from being overlong, of dubious historical accuracy, and from a typical Edward Zwick Boys' Own Adventure ending, a throwback to the old Cowboys and Indians battles with the cavalry riding to the rescue.\"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\", on the other hand, contained a gut-wrenching, powerful ending. The film provided insight into the psychology of Nazi concentration camp commanders. To Bruno's Dad, the Jews are \"not really people\" (in \"Good\", they're called \"items\"). Like a factory manager, he pores over plans to expand the gas chambers and \"triple the throughput\". I've read of Nazis at the train stations, separating families, tearing children from their parents, regarding the beings under their control as simply animals.It's a typical protective psychological response, apparently. Battles in the Pacific were more vicious and caused proportionately greater casualties, because the Americans and Japanese each convinced themselves that their enemy was some kind of sub-human species and should be obliterated from the face of the earth.Executioners and abattoir slaughtermen use the same mechanism, concentrating on the process of disposal, upon the technicalities of the job, rather than on the fact of the living being that they are dealing with, who will soon no longer be living.Only at the end does the horror and suffering and inhumanity of the gas chambers strike home to Bruno's father. The film's been criticised for not tying up all the loose ends, but I think it's irrelevant. Will the Dad strike out at the Jews in revenge? Will he throw over the job and end up in a shallow grave with the rest of his family? It doesn't matter. The film's point has been made, extremely well in my opinion. The ease with which the kids can conduct their relationship may stretch the bounds of credibility, but the basic premise is a good one, and the acting is terrific. An 8/10.",

They do not act like Germans, the feeling just doesn't come across... At all. It seems more like a bunch of Brits with Nazi costumes on, exactly what it is. Once we get past the bad acting, you'll notice that the storyline is utterly ridiculous. It's awful how the Holocaust is still being used as this money machine for film makers, and this movie in particular was a shameful failure. The weak attempt of getting emotion from the audience at the end was really disappointing (However it apparently worked for some).This movie needed a fat dose of heartfelt drama and emotion, but even then i don't think it would ever get away with the over-coincidental ending that will leave many thinking \"Are you kidding me?\". I can't imagine that this film would trigger much of an emotional response from people capable of any sort of independent thought and reason and critical analysis. People who leech from the notorious holocaust vein make films which are generally so \"old\" and rehashed. If they have the nerve to do it, they ought to at least make something half decent and worth watching. The million dollar movie concoction: Holocaust, Jews, furnaces, magical showers.Overall, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is a film that was lacking. It lacked in substance, in plot, and most importantly, in authenticity. I don't really recommend it.",

            "content": "'The Boy In The Striped Pajamas (2008)' focuses on a young German boy who, during WWII, moves out to the country with his family so that his Nazi father can oversee operations at a nearby concentration camp. The picture focuses on putting its audience in the perspective of its na\u00efve protagonist, typically presenting its atrocities in an implicit yet still impactful way. In some regards, it seems a little watered down but that's actually because the boy we're following isn't exposed to the true horrors around him and doesn't really understand those he does actually see. We do, though, and the piece isn't afraid to pull its punches in that regard. The young boy soon makes friends with a Jewish boy inside the camp, visiting him for daily chats through the fence. This is one of the primary focuses of the flick, a friendship that crosses the arbitrary boundaries put in place by the Nazi regime and flies in the face of the hate that Hitler tried to force onto every German citizen, regardless of their true feelings. The film is a little bit problematic because it focuses on a German family, with its Jewish characters - even the eponymous boy in the striped pajamas - being largely relegated to the background. It's also dodgy that the movie's great tragedy (spoilers, by the way) is that one German boy dies in a camp that he shouldn't be in. The reality is, of course, that nobody should be in there, and the tragedy of the millions of deaths of the people deemed 'subhuman' by the Nazis should really be the tragedy - as it was in real life. However, the film is trying to convey the fact that war affects everyone; the children being brainwashed into hating others are victims, too. The affair isn't trying to be desensitise or take focus away from the real atrocities it's based around. Even though it isn't always successful and may be a little misjudged, I don't think it has ill intentions. In fact, it's trying to do an admirable thing. I can see where its criticisms come from, but I don't believe it to be a harmful piece of media. It's a generally effective anti-war story. 7/10.",

            "review_title": "A devastating moral lesson",
            "content": "Reaching carefully through the barbed wire fence that separates them, two eight-year-old boys shake hands. It is a sign of forgiveness and reassurance that they are still friends, but there are no smiles here, for more than just a fence separates Bruno and Shmuel. Bruno is the son of a Nazi commandant, while Shmuel is a Jewish prisoner in a concentration camp close to Bruno's new home. It is the ultimate forbidden friendship and one of the many clich\u00e9s that riddle The Boy in the Striped Pajamas and make it less of a historical film than a parable about the dangers and devastating consequences of inhumanity and immorality.As the film opens, Bruno (Asa Butterfield) and his affluent family prepare to move from their old estate in Berlin to their new home in the countryside, which they have acquired because of Bruno's father's promotion. Bruno's father, Ralf (David Thewlis), is the conventional Nazi soldier: harsh, brutal, and uncompromising. His wife, Elsa (Vera Farmiga), is his antithesis and a stereotypical, meek, emotional, and ignorant woman. Tension develops in their marriage when they move to their new home, nearby a concentration camp, because Elsa is concerned about their proximity to the death camp and objects to Ralf's \"evil\" work.Bruno eventually finds his way to this concentration camp, which he believes is a farm, one day when he is exploring, his favorite hobby. There, he meets a boy his own age, Shmuel (Jack Scanlon). Though Bruno thinks Shmuel is a strange farmer who wears striped pajamas, they quickly befriend each other, for both of them are lonely. When Shmuel tells Bruno that he is a Jew, Bruno decides to keep their friendship a secret because of his anti-Semitic education and upbringing, yet at the same time he finds it hard to believe that all Jews are evil. On the other hand, his older sister Gretel (Amber Beattie) succumbs to the brainwashing and proceeds to hang Nazi posters on her bedroom walls. She abandons her dolls, for she believes she is not a child anymore, and stacks their naked plastic bodies in a pile eerily resembling the heaps of corpses so commonly found in concentration camps.Heavy with symbolism and filmed with a whimsical, fairytale feel, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas follows Bruno as he is placed in adult situations, forced to confront the emotional disintegration of his entire family and to reconsider his own beliefs after his life-changing experiences with Shmuel. The characters, like the dialogue, are simple, predictable, and placed in unrealistic situations, yet they are also well-developed and compelling. This is because the film is not so much an attempt at historical fiction as it is a tale with an important message. Thus, one must not expect this movie to be heavy on historical detail; instead, it uses the Holocaust mainly as a convenient backdrop to convey the moral of the story, that we are all human and deserve to be treated as such.The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is different from most other Holocaust films because it is viewed through the eyes of a child and effectively utilizes this perspective to demonstrate its purpose. Bruno's innocence and na\u00efvet\u00e9 parallel the ignorance of the general population during that time period as well as the modern-day incomprehensibility of how such a terrible thing could have been allowed to happen. The film also stands out in its focus on the impact of the Holocaust on not only its victims, the Jews, but also its perpetrators, the Nazis. Despite the minimal shock footage of the Jews in the concentration camps, the film, with a twist ending, powerfully conveys its warning message with a sense of utter destruction and sheer hopelessness.",

Excellent acting all the way around, including Vera Farmiga, one of the most beautiful women on screen. It's not a Holocaust movie as much as movie about family and friendships. The German boy does not yet understand that this Jewish boy should not be his friend. His innocence keeps him from learning the true meaning of his father's work. While the sister learns and converts, the mother realizes the wrong in what the father is doing. There is a scene where one of the Jews tends to a cut on the boy's knee; when she is informed that the Jew carried her boy inside and dressed the wound, the mother's compassion emerges as she thanks him.

            "content": "Mark Herman's \"Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\" doesn't quite prepare you to how great it is, simply because everything happens in the end, and gives its full meaning to the poignant but rather predictable material featured in the first two acts.And watching this movie, I knew I would find comments on IMDb echoing my sentiment. After that extraordinary climax, I just told my wife: \"this is the best ending the film could ever have\", and by that, I meant the most logical and satisfying. She thought the film would show something more after that painful shot on the outside of the gas chamber and the remaining clothes, but I knew the film would immediately close, as it had made its point, and quite a powerful one. It's really one of these instances when the last ten minutes of a movie elevate it to a haunting level of greatness.Yes, the film is about a German boy, Bruno (played by Asa Butterfield) who doesn't know the extents of the atrocities committed by the very men he worships (or used to), including his father, which all naturally leads him to befriend a Jewish kid in a death camp, named Schmuel. Yes, childhood innocence at wartime and unlikely friendships are very common themes, and even the encounters between the two boys, at each side of barbed wire fences, doesn't really strike for its originality, but it's all in the last ten minutes, when Bruno dies in the gas chamber, with his friend and other men.And it's not about being happy for Bruno's death but since it was the worst punishment his father (David Thewlis) could ever have, yes it was a worthy sacrifice from a pure 'Karma' standpoint, in order to inflict the heartless officer what he's been routinely conducting toward innocent people. Even worse for him, is that the death of his son could have been easily avoided, if he had simply told him what the camp was about, and what they were doing there. Sure, that would have tarnished Bruno's admiration but he would have thought twice before playing games near the camp. And this is where the characterization of Bruno works and his fate, although tragic, is a great pay-off.Bruno is shown as a rather detached and solitary kid, less passionate and fanatic than his sister Gretel, but he's not all brave and courageous for all that, just curious and sweet. The title with the 'pyjama' description is a hint that the story is seen from an innocent child's perspective. And when Bruno is confronted to that young officer's anger, he denies being Schmuel's friend, which is a rather cowardly move. And even when he enters the camp, he seems very reluctant, so it must have taken one hell of a blind courage to ignore the risks of setting a foot in a camp. And this is the point: Bruno couldn't realize it, not because he was blind, but because he was blinded.The Germans supposedly ignored what happened in the Camp, so that when the Allies and Russians liberated them, they were shocked to discover the truth. Even the news report of a camp was pure propaganda, showing healthy prisoners eating and playing football. The German people believed it, because they wanted to believe it, they didn't want to think their leaders were Barbarians. And Bruno illustrates that mindset, when he sees the newsreel, he goes hug his father, suddenly becoming a good man who takes care of war prisoners. He was blinded by the propaganda, by his father's lies and also by his love as a son, as the Germans loved (for most of them) Hitler. It takes a believer to lie.As for the liar, Bruno's father knew what he did and we can wonder, if he's so proud of his actions and so confident that they're meant to save the German motherland, so why doesn't he openly talk about it? is it guilt or shame? No, pure denial. Denying people their right to live and exist, and denying that these actions are innately evil. The father is so wrapped up in that evil madness that he hypocritically kills people believing it's good while hiding this reality to his son, as if it wasn't so good. And this is where you reach the genius of the film, almost imperceptible, because it doesn't feel like a Spielberg or Polanski's super-production.Indeed, the soul of this film is an evil one. Sure, the father could have come at the last minute, or the shower be a real shower, like in \"Schindler's List\", but the father's arc had to be closed that way. He was the antagonist of the film, and the two kids' sacrifices the tool Destiny or Karma or God used to punish him. In fact, the film works like a reverse \"Life is Beautiful\", while Benigni pretended it was a game to keep his son's innocence and save his life, in \"The Boy in Striped Pyjamas\", the reality of the death camp is ignored by Bruno, and his maintained innocence ironically seals his fate.It's a tragic film but the irony is delightful because the father is responsible for his kids' obliviousness to the danger of the camp. And there's more to that, it is often asked how come the prisoners never fought or how come the Jews let themselves being arrested. Apart from the fact that this question ignores some heroic resistances, it also shows the sad reality, many of the Jewish people who died in these camps didn't know they would die, or that it would go as far as being separated from their families and put in gas chambers. And when you think about it, Bruno and even Schmuel, had the same mindset.Anything could happen, but death... yet it did, it was the most tragically satisfying ending the film could get.",

The movie could have been one notch higher if we had been put in the mind of the child, because it took me some time to get how would a child think under these conditions. I felt there were many loopholes in the plot. but anyway we are not supposed to look over these because the main thing in the movie is the innocence of a child and how the realization of the loss of child for a German soldier and devastating experience that the jews felt in those camps. The screenplay was very good in some parts and mediocre in the rest. It felt a little odd that the child does not ask his mother all this questions, I felt the tutor part a tad bit of a drag, I understood this was a crucial point of the film but was it that powerful so as to change the behavior of her sister ? The movie did not felt smooth if I had to clear. Well except all this facts the conversation between the two boys is really nice. This was the best part of the movie especially the Jew boy did an awesome job. That could emote his tension in the camp with the innocence of a child. Even his expressions were so subtle. This Jew boy was damn perfect throughout the movie. Well i may have rated it somewhat low, but believe me go watch this movie to experience the Nazi camps and its effect in poor souls.",

I saw this film in my school classroom and when the ending came everyone went silent. The ending was definitely great, but to me the rest of the film, while never really dull, is never that interesting to begin with. It does have some great scenes, however. The performances are also rich, especially Vera Farmiga, who is proving that she is an actress to watch out for! I just wish the film was overall more engaging, but I still do recommend it.",

            "content": "In my opinion this is a good movie/book because it has basic moral appeal and an enduring message, and because this movie (and probably the book to an even greater degree) can have symbolic or abstract meaning in regard to the characters and what they represent in terms of history, national identity, and humanity.I think this quote accurately describes the moral message of the movie: A timeless story of innocence lost and humanity found. The message of the movie is that human beings are born innocent. We are born to love and we become friends with anyone regardless of race / religion / orientation, etc. However, as we grow old, we grow corrupted, and then we lose our innocence and become more prejudiced and filled with hate (well a lot of people, but not all). So in the end, the movie is saying that we are all the same, we are all human beings, and it is the silly, narrow, immoral things that divide and ruin us. None of us are immune to this behavior, so we must always remember that if we don't watch ourselves it can happen again.I would like to see other reviewer's interpretation and analysis of, the message of the movie and who or what the characters symbolically represent... There is no right or wrong answer, only your personal opinion(s).So, what is the author's message and who, or what, do the movie's characters represent to you?",

Its dark, disturbing and one of the best weepers of this fine year. Anybody above the ages of fifteen, you must see this movie. It might not beat 'The Dark Knight' with style or substance but this is without a doubt the most important film of the year. The imagery is so disturbing, you have to remind yourself, it's just a movie. But here's where there no escape, this isn't Last House on the Left. This is real, this is a film based on a novel of the same named based on historical events of a German family moving to a country house near a concentration camp and their son befriending one of the boys inside the camps. And if your hearts not in your heart during that unbearably tense final act then something is painfully wrong with you. These final minutes are so disturbing i broke out inot a cold sweat, Even stranger is how I allowed this to slip under my radar for weeks. I remember reading the book that this is based on when I was young. I remember loving it. And now I find it just wonderful how much the makers of this film have done it justice. During World War II, 8-year-old Bruno (Asa Butterfield) and his family leave Berlin to take up residence near the concentration camp where his father (David Thewlis) has just been made commandant. Bruno is unhappy and lonely, until one day, when he wanders out behind his house and finds Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), a Jewish boy his own age. Though the barbed-wire fence of the camp separates the boys, they enter into a forbidden friendship, oblivious to the true nature of their surroundings.If i were to complain about this film, plausibility is where I would start. Its exaggerated for sure. The lack of authentic German accents, the seemingly absent guards and an overall sense that this wouldn't have gone in that direction. All however is quite easily redeemed with its tear jerker, heart stopping ending.As difficult as it may be to watch, it should certainly be a film that everybody sees if only for the realisation that this horrific event occurred. If you're willing to forgive some implacability faults and a couple of odd accents then you'll walk out of this film feeling stunned with just how horrific the truth is.Verdict: a painful yet fully accomplished journey, that will appeal solely to those who can withstand the disturbing imagery, erry settings and that holy mary mother of god ending that will have you clenching your jaw in hope they make a copout ending. To our dissatisfaction, they don't. And while it might have been more releasing it would have spoilt the realisation. For what its worth this is film of the year material.",

            "content": "This is a very moving film that features an 8 year old child's perspective to illuminate the horror of the Holocaust, both in terms of the obvious effect on its persecuted victims as well as the insidious damage inflicted on the family structure of the perpetrators. From the outset we are given an insight into Bruno, the young son of a Nazi commandant father that foretells in some measure what will transpire. The boy is seen careening through the streets of Berlin with two friends, his love of play and companionship quite evident. When his father's duties require the family to move to a remote, isolated residence nearby a concentration camp (Auschwitz?), the viewer immediately senses that this boy who views himself as an explorer will undergo an experience that will challenge his limited capacity to comprehend at this stage of his life. This aspect takes up much of the film, and is highlighted by the burgeoning friendship of the German boy with a Jew (Shmuel) of his own age who resides in the camp. The total innocence of the dialog between the two boys is especially poignant in view of the horrific context in which these two unlikely friends find themselves.The acting by all the characters throughout is marvelous, the boys as well as the mother (Vera Farmiga) who becomes increasingly horrified by what is occurring not only around her but also within her marriage. Her rejection is conveyed not only in terms of dialog but also by the clothing and makeup of this beautiful young mother as she chooses to become increasingly drab, befitting her recognition that dress and makeup cannot and should not gloss over the horror of her surroundings and of her marriage to someone she has come to view as a monster. The damage done to the German family as mentioned earlier is not only shown by the deterioration of the marriage of Bruno's parents, but is also alluded to at the funeral of the paternal grandmother. Similarly, a young lieutenant who has a significant role in the film is viewed critically by the Nazi regime for not reporting the \"treasonous\" behavior of his professor father's emigration to Switzerland.An interesting subtext of the film is how differently people, young and old in Nazi German society behaved during this terrible time. On the one hand are the sensitive and humanity-inspired figures of the mother, grandmother, Bruno, Shmuel, the elderly physician/kitchen helper victim, and the lieutenant's father (unseen) who fled Germany. More than balancing those figures are the negative characterizations of the father, grandfather, Bruno's gullible elder sister, the children's tutor and the young, cruel lieutenant.This is a very thoughtful film for both adults and older children/teenagers, its ironic title belying the seriousness of this film. Highly recommended.",

And typically to all totalitarian regimes, one must always take sides, choose and prove his/her loyalty, hesitating or opposing in any way is not tolerated. This is all especially confusing and tragic for children, as they have misshapen and vague picture due to two main reasons: their limited comprehension as well the fact that adults try to gloss them over nasty things.The storyline of the film advances smoothly and is rather credible, the only thing that seemed strange to me was how those boys could meet so openly for so long time? What about guards and/or electrical fences? Using this corner, many could have escaped... The ending is unanticipated and forms a sharp contrast with the pace before.The cast is great, especially Vera Farmiga as Elsa, Asa Butterfield as Bruno (far better performance than in blockbuster Hugo) and David Thewlis as Ralf.

I've read books, watched movies, and written research papers on the near annihilation of the Jews. I thought \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" would advocate what I had long known and become passionate about. Boy was I wrong.\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" begins with little Bruno moving from his nice home in Berlin to a walled-in home in the country. It is only a few miles from a supposed 'farm' and Bruno hopes to make friends there. It would turn out that the 'farm' is actually a concentration camp full of Jews eventually condemned to the gas chambers. Bruno's dad is the commandant of this camp. Bruno (illegally) befriends a little Jewish boy in the camp. That's only the beginning of this woeful tale\u0085 This movie is for those that are already WWII fans. There is no 'set-up' or introduction of why the Jews were persecuted and there is no violence or gore. For me, there was none needed. I know what atrocities the Nazis were guilty of. The idea that this is all portrayed through the eyes of a child was very strange. I'm accustomed to more mature movies on this subject such as Uprising, so it was hard to get use to.I will admit that some of the movie was very touching. When Lieutenant Kotler dug himself into a hole that there was no getting out of, I felt downright sorry for him. And the Jewish boy's face when he is beaten looked sooo terrible....Though the movie had its touching moments, the reality was that what happened in the movie would not have ever happened in real life. A boy could not have dug himself into Auschwitz. He would not have talked to someone through the electric gates. It just would not have happened.Two things bugged me the most. The first was the assumption that Bruno was so dumb as to not know what was going on. It is possible that he would have been sheltered from the idea of the gas chambers, (much like his Mother was) but coming from a military family and how his sister turned into a Hitler youth wannabe, he would of known that the Jews were to be stayed away from. Kids aren't that dumb. He would of figured it out that it was some sort of communal camp. A farm??? Seriously? The second was merely how over-dramatized the ending was. The music was so loud in the theater; I thought my eardrum was going to pop. How did the mother know her son was dead? Was she psychic? The father was a bit more realistic. What really got me was how after blaring all that music, the movie ended quietly with the camera focused on the gas chamber door and the lights gradually dimming. I feel like a lot of Holocaust movies end like that...\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" might have ended with a moment of reverence to those who lost their lives in the Holocaust, but the rest of the film was almost a spoof. For the dedicated at heart, skip this one and go re-watch \"Uprising\" or \"Schindler's List.\" Something worth your time and money.",

All the characters speak with middle-class English accents, including Vera Farmiga who is American, which hardly aids authenticity. Then the central proposition - that the eight year old son (Asa Butterfield) of a German commandant of a concentration camp (David Thewlis) could befriend an inmate of the same age (Jack Scanlon) and not understand anything of what was going on - seems preposterous.Of course, fiction is allowed to depart from reality to examine a central truth and therefore the conclusion of this tale is critical and it is the moving finale that ultimately makes this an acceptable and instructive piece of filmmaking.",

            "content": "...then you don't have a heart. I'm not going to spoil this one, but the ending WILL make your heart race, and you WILL be glued to the screen until the credits roll. This is a great film, but it's the end that you will really remember. As I was watching, I conceived the ending before it happened, yet I never truly believed it would play out just like I thought.This film is the story of an innocent 8 year old German boy, Bruno, who moves to the countryside with his family. His father is a high-ranking SS officer, and his sister is a devout Nazi youth. He finds himself wondering why the people working on the farm behind the new house all are wearing pyjamas. He fancies himself an adventurer, so he decides to journey to the \"farm\" without the knowledge of his parents. It is there he meets \"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas.\" You will notice throughout the movie, that instead of taking on a perfect angel role like many children in movies, Bruno is the average eight-year-old with the average eight-year-old flaws. In the same way, the movie never quite draws the line between good or evil for most of the characters. In short, this movie deals with humanity and the loss of innocence in a realistic sense.The acting could have been a little bit better from the matured cast members, so this falls short of a perfect 10. However, the ending more than makes this a worthwhile watch. Don't miss it.",

They both had such expressive faces, as they each struggled with the reality that each found himself in. This film was told from a different point of view than any other Holocaust film I've seen: a child's. Bruno's everyday life was both an ordinary existence (on the surface), and a shocking one as well. As a child who could imagine living in close proximity to such horror, or, as in Shmuel's case, spending one's life behind that fence? Vera Farmiga's performance was wonderful, and heart-wrenching as well.Reminiscent of 'Schindler's List,' the cinematography was beautiful in this film. The beautiful shots of nature around Bruno's home belied the evil that was so very close.It's ironic that Bruno's father only becomes horrified about what happens in the concentration camp when it effects his son. I cried when I realized what Bruno's fate would be, but more because in showing it to us, we saw a glimpse of what millions of innocent people experienced.",

            "content": "This is one of the most moving stories I've seen in quite some time. This film demonstrates the innocence of people at a time when monstrosities were being committed against other human beings. Beginning with the Commandant's wife and children.Elsa (Vera Farmiga) doesn't fully understand her husband's position in the Nazi party. It isn't until they move to their new home at the Auschwitz Concentration Camp. It is at their new home when she realizes what is going on; the stench of the burning bodies and when Lt. Kotler, confirms her suspicions by saying \"They smell worse when they burn, don't they?\". She becomes very upset. As time goes on she wants to take the children and leave.Meanwhile, Bruno, their only son meets Shmuel, a Jewish child prisoner. Bruno cannot understand the position Schmuel is in, he only knows he made a new friend with a funny name and wearing pajamas unaware his own father is in charge of Schmuel's fate.Bruno: \"Why do you wear pajamas all day?\" Shmuel: \"The soldiers. They took all our clothes away.\" Bruno: \"My dads a soldier, but not the sort that takes peoples clothes away.\"Little by little Bruno begins to wonder what his father's intentions as a soldier really are. His sister encourages him to be more anti-Semitic with her propaganda as does their tutor who tries to convince the confused and questioning Bruno Jews are not good.Bruno: \"There is such thing as a nice Jew, though, isn't there?\" Herr Liszt: \"I think, Bruno, if you ever found a nice Jew, you would be the best explorer in the world.\"He witnesses the attack of Pavel who is the Butler of the house that had been placed there because he is Jewish. He helped Bruno patch up his knee once he fell from the swing and was kind to Bruno. Pavel died from the beating even though his mother begged his father to stop it; he did not. He finds his basement is full of dolls (taken from Jewish girls) and is prohibited from going outside the house gates (restricted perimeter). These things make him wonder about his father's work.I don't want to go through every detail of the movie, so I'll just say the ending was heartbreaking to watch. Two innocent children who'd made friends and yet lived completely different lives die together. Schmeul's death was inevitable and Bruno's was sort of Karma for his father's bad behavior. Very sad story, but I highly recommend it.",

            "review_title": "\"Heil, Bruno!\"",
            "content": "Mom liked her daughter better when she played with dolls. After a few history lessons with the tutor, Gretel(Amber Beattie) banishes the dolls into a transmogrifying darkness, where her brother Bruno(Asa Butterfield) discovers the plastic bodies arranged like the recently dead in an open grave. Mom liked the dolls better than their replacement, an Adolph Hitler poster. The Nazis killed Gretel's childhood, then she vanquished her dolls and treated them like a rumor, hiding the evidence in the family basement. \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" is a reconstructed fable for holocaust deniers. With Bruno, the filmmaker supplies his protagonist with rhetorical dialogue, disguised as child-like innocence. When Bruno asks his sister, \"What are your dolls doing in the basement?\", on an extra-diegetic level, this question exists outside of the official text; the question posed by Bruno is how the filmmaker demonstrates that the boy is being employed as a repository for the unofficial narrative being read by an auxiliary audience. The dolls in the basement look unmistakably dead, like Jews; these dolls, these paralleling Jews, were once kept alive by Gretel, alive in the sense that their existence is a contingency based on a dictator's imagination. Greta has the power of \"life\" and \"death\" over the dolls. Her room is like a concentration camp: the basement, conversely, can be construed as a crematorium. When Bruno stumbles upon the \"bodies\", the double-edged side of his question stealthily acts as a chastisement towards his sister's carelessness, because this metaphorical signifier causes his naivety to look more like a disingenuous act. On a metafictional level, the jig is up, but Bruno sojourns on, this denial about the \"farm\", with disastrous results.About her character Cindy Brady, \"Brady Bunch\" fans would sometimes approach the actress and ask, \"Is Cindy retarded?\" She played \"the youngest one in curls\" with a guilelessness that made her powers of cognition seem feeble. It's not hard to imagine Cindy asking the stepfather, \"Why does the farmer wear pajamas?\" if the Bradys were transplanted to Nazi Germany. Children want to believe their parents are good people; in Bruno's case, his mother(Vera Farmiga) is married to a commander for the Nazi army. The old man who lives in their villa, used to be a doctor; he fixes Bruno's leg after the boy falls off his tree swing. The disbelief Bruno projects upon learning about the Jew's past sounds unmistakably like harassment masquerading as naivety. It's practically a catch-22 when Bruno asks the servant about why he's peeling potatoes instead of practicing medicine.Any holocaust denier comes to the table with facts of his own ideological think-tank's making. Their reconstructed reality is like an inside joke they enjoy replaying to the world at-large with a straight face. In Bruno's convoluted world, an electrified barbed wire fence helps keep the farm safe from animals, and is not the last defense against escape in a concentration camp. He meets a boy there. In the grand tradition of Nazi films, there is always one good German who befriends the Jews. Schmuel(Jack Scanlon) has a benefactor who will sit with him under the hot Bavarian sun. More than anything, the Jew expects food from his unexpectant benefactor. Schmuel is no exception; the boy in the striped pajamas is hungry, but Bruno doesn't fill the Oskar Schindler roll because he believes the boy is on holiday. \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" surreptitiously allows the film's subtext rear its knowing head by making the transfer of food problematic. In short order: Bruno eats the boy's chocolate, feigns having anything to do with Schmue's half-eaten pastry when they're found out, and drops the boy's sandwich somewhere in the woods. \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" is at its most self-reflexive when Bruno churlishly giggles at the manner his \"houseguest\" attacks the pastry. He thinks Schmuel's hunger is a laughing matter. During Bruno's letting down of his guard, the film goes beyond fable, and reveals itself as farce of the pitchest black.Hard-wired for pretending, Bruno races through the woods, late in the film, with a shovel raised up high; an echo of the war games he played with his Berlin friends when they were doing the blitzkreig. A person who lies compulsively, over a long period of time, may start to believe his own bull****, which the film shrewdly demonstrates, as Bruno inexplicably digs a trench under the fence to let himself in. His seeing is an act of unseeing- the malnourished people clad in pajamas, the horrid living conditions, the stench- his blind spot is either a sign of mental retardation, or a deep-rooted conviction that the Jews are non-people. \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\", to its credit, supplies a climax with cross-purposes: it punishes the holocaust denier, in private, while a majority of the audience sees Bruno's gassing as punishment for the father. Bruno is punished for being in a propaganda film; not the propaganda film-within-the-film, but the film itself. In the opening minutes, the music that plays over the soundtrack compliments the crane shots of Nazi-era Berlin to give the impression of a benevolent Germany. And there is Bruno and his Anglo-Saxon cronies, playing their part in the war effort, running down the streets of a liquidated neighborhood with their arms extended in willful oblivion.",

Whilst it's been stated pretty much everywhere, the film strongly connects you with the whole story but leaves you attached with unsettlement to the tragic ending.The performances and plot of the film will immediately grab you and drag you further into the story. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is then a pretty fast-moving and entertaining tale, as it keeps the audience's interest with well-portrayed emotions, conversations and friendship, too. But the film all of a sudden ends in a tragedy, leaving each and every person emotionally terrorised. It seriously takes a high-class masterpiece to do that to you.Basically it's effortless to say that the film is a stunning idea. Based on the 2006 novel, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a historical drama worth watching for teens and up. It's a wholly realistic tale and due to the finishing, you probably won't want to watch it again for a while.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

The kid was completely naive of the current situation while people around him reacted differently. What he said might make audience annoyed at how oblivious he was, but that's the point because he was such a pure soul. Then towards the end, every sentence he said felt like piercing arrows because of the situation he was in.Another theme was the power of propaganda. For innocent kids, they were easily influenced and followed them eagerly. It's an effective way to corrupt the innocence from children.Overall, an horrible tragedy. So sad so sad. 9.5/10.",

            "content": "...and very, very O. Henry-esquire tale of innocence paying a blood debt for incalculable evil, \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" is nonetheless a minor Holocaust film worth at least a viewing. Adapted for film and helmed by British director, Mark \"Brassed Off\" Herman, from an Irish novel for young adults, \"The Boy...\" tells the story of a stunningly naive German boy, Bruno, who befriends a Jewish peer, an inmate of the concentration camp run by Bruno's father, an SS officer. Themes of trust, friendship, and willing complicity in evil doings are explored as things move toward a somewhat telegraphed and highly unlikely conclusion.Beyond nicely realized performances by the \"name\" actors headlining the cast--Vera \"The Orphan\" Farmiga, David \"Harry Potter and...\" Thewlis, and Rupert \"The Young Victoria\" Friend--the real leads, children both, are quite effective, which is good, because the success of the film truly rests on their chemistry. Asa \"Son of Rambow\" Butterfield and newcomer Jack Scanlon draw the viewer into their unusual relationship and tragic adventure with effortless grace; they could both well be young actors worth keeping tabs on. No, there's no complaint in the acting, nor in most of the relatively low-budget production values. Shot in Hungary, \"The Boy...\" manages a nice period veneer on an otherwise most improbable dramatic hook, line, and sinker. The film suffers from plotting anomalies and some far-fetched dramatic assumptions.I'll be blunt: the young son of an SS officer in WWII Germany simply could not have been as sheltered and ingenuous as the film's protagonist; it beggars willing suspension of disbelief, or at least it does mine. And the scenario of two little boys on opposite sides of a barbed wire fence surrounding a concentration camp, though emotionally and visually arresting, borders on the definition of preposterous. Perhaps this is all explained away in the source novel; perhaps not. The film makes no attempt, and perhaps purposefully so. For me, it didn't work.As I said, though, still worth a watch if you're in the mood for that sort of overt manipulation. The ending is almost \"Twilight Zone\"-ish in its melodramatic tragedy, and left this viewer feeling that he'd been cheated of a resolution more in keeping with the prior tone and perspective of the story.",

In an attempt to search for the missing father of Shmuel - Bruno secretly digs under the fence to enter the concentration camp - but both kids meet a fatal end - as that day they are taken to the gas chamber. The movie follows a fictional story form like a fable. Though criticized for the novel and movie's improbability - the movie holds good to send the message of how wrong the whole holocaust was.The movie looks at the events unfolding through the eyes of an eight year old child with a sub-plot of an anguish wife who is not party to her husband's nationalistic work. It is well directed by Mark, and all the actors especially both boys Asa as Bruno and Jack as Shmuel have acted beautifully. The movie is haunting to say the least and its impact as well remains in one's mind even after the movie is over. It is brutal and disturbing to see one human treating other human in this way. The musical score by James Horner was so effective that until you do not pay attention to it - it remains subtle to your sense. I will go with 7 out of 10 for this movie.",

Now, I don't mean to demean anyone who had a powerful experience in viewing this film- it's good for people to have their minds stirred to the tragedies of the past who may or may not otherwise, and the movie has proved effective in bringing its viewers to tears, no doubt, but only through juvenile methods of storytelling. The issue lies in its framework. It attempts to confront a delicately heavy subject, the Holocaust (which is automatically something that should tug at one's heartstrings for obvious reasons). But it doesn't do it in an authentic manner: it stretches the historical events around its plot, instead of the other way around as it should. I needn't go into the details as one can find them with a quick internet search, but the historical inaccuracies are downright blatant- yet integral to the plot. I understand the concept of \"the suspension of disbelief\" when approaching fiction (and even historical fiction), but the story has to work by the rules that it sets forth. A comparison I will give is Life is Beautiful, another Holocaust film that stretched the truth: however, the world that movie had established was one of hi-jinks and coincidence, and therefore the minor historical liberties it takes are forgivable because the viewer ought not take it at face value. In The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, though, the story is presented as true-to-life, and therefore has a responsibility to neither mislead its viewership nor insult their intelligence, which is exactly what it does. Because of this, it doesn't come across as authentic- not only by its historical falsities, but also in its far-fetched unfoldings of its plot, and in the flat traits and utter obliviousness of main characters. Many an audience can look past these shortcomings, it seems, but I found it to be insufferably jarring to the viewer experience, and the ending felt contrived and shallow as a result.",

He was too young to know.The story would've been much more interesting and compelling if he was older, knew what was happening, had some understanding and genuine feelings and choices about it. If it was loyalty, friendship or even love. That would've given it some depth and meaning and greater sadness. This way it's just oopsie, he died by mistake.While Bruno himself didn't deserve his fate, his father certainly did, though I doubt this would have changed or reedemed him. It'd be nice to see whether he learned anything from it.

He is an amazingly diverse actor. I felt this movie really showed that diversity.

            "content": "An 8 year-old son of a high Nazi commander befriends a Jewish death camp prisoner, also an 8 year-old boy. So far so good.This movie is plain bad on a number of different levels. However, the most fundamental flaw is that the creators must have thought of a seemingly ironic and tragic ending, and then tried to fit the movie to that ending. Everything in that movie is just a vacuous filler to get to the last 5 minutes.Nothing in this film justifies its overwrought, melodramatic ending. The story is flat and shallow and pretty dull. The acting is mediocre. The cinematography is repetitive and doesn't fit the subject matter. Perhaps, it intended to give this movie a meditative, surreal, fairy tale feel, in which case it came nowhere near its goal. It is possible to forgive some departures from the strict historical narrative provided that there's a solid, logical framework. In other words, we can suspend our disbelief at some of the events, provided that the core of the story is consistent and logical. This movie lacks such a framework. The relationship between the two boys never rings true. It can't. An obvious question arises: how do the two boys communicate, since in all likelihood the Jewish boy is from Eastern Europe; the movie seems to imply that the two boys come from different countries. It would have been very hard to build a relationship absent the ability to communicate. Or it would take a much better film. But even if you gloss over the language barrier, their relationship is still very superficial and lacks tension. Oh, true, there's betrayal by the German boy. Quickly forgiven though. Life is crappy anyway, so why fret about a little betrayal.Ironically enough, there are a couple of sub-plots -- the boys's brief relationship with a prisoner who works in the house; as well as his mother's horror when she finds out what her husband participates in -- that could have made for a decent movie. Nay! The \"horrible\" ending had to be attained, so full steam ahead. I will not give away the ending. However, after seeing this movie, ask yourself this: would it have been less sad had the ending been different? It would have been...and that's just plain wrong.",

If there's a bit of sameness to some of the descriptions? Perhaps this reflects a kind of universality: of the film, its effect on audiences, and how certain scenes are excruciating for anyone (with a heart) who chooses to watch.Some felt the ending was predictable. Although I regarded other outcomes as possible, I hoped they would not occur. The ones I could envision: all would have been unspeakable in their cowardice: a turning away, an unwillingness to grapple with the immensity of the Final Solution to the \"Jewish problem\" and how despicable it was.To those who complain of not feeling surprised: really, this is hardly the only film to depict one of the most significant and brutal episodes in 20th-century history. Nor the only one to convey its horrors through a child's eyes: although with far more (appropriate) seriousness than its predecessor Life is Beautiful. Also more directly than Fugitive Pieces: a film which holds certain advantages over this one, in complexity and depth. But the latter takes a different approach to the subject; direct comparison may not be appropriate.Nearly all are aware: among those sent to Nazi concentration camps, few survived. The historical truth places enormous limitations on possible (and sensible) outcomes.In thinking about what choices the filmmakers might have made: I am glad they chose not to refrain entirely from \"zooming out\" during the final scenes. We might have been excluded from sympathizing with anyone but the two boys whose unlikely friendship drives the story. No, we are also invited to experience the fear, hope and confusion of all the human beings who have been locked inside, feeling almost certain that an enforced \"shower\" is not what awaits them.Another wise decision: to end the film at this point, rather than attempting some sort of epilogue. Among other faults, it would (we imagine) have been inelegant. Nothing else remained to be said.",

It also left me pondering how much originality should be accounted for. Is a good film or is a good film whether its been done before or not? Arguably, the amount of similar films shouldn't really reflect on the film itself. but in that case clich\u00e9s wouldn't even be possible, you should apply some kinda quotient and WW2 and the Holocoust is some of the most mined subjects, hence its decidedly harder to make a good film about it. Maybe i would have liked this more if it were done twenty years ago?? Uh, yeah, maybe a little bit. And really maybe that little bit would have had an deciding factor. Problem is, its far to easy to tell the intentions of this film. If you're reading the premise, you can probably figure it out, and its message, is so easy to spot through the script its sometimes a little embarrassing. There are some nice parts with the family dynamic, in fact, this parts are far more interesting then main one with the little boy. Maybe if they had concentrated on that one. Shame they Didn't.

            "content": "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is about a German boy (Bruno) who moves to the country side with his family, not knowing that his father, who is an officer, is the commandant of the concentration camp nearby. Being only eight years old, he does of course not want to stay inside the concrete walls of the new house (a building looking more like a prison than a home) but he wants to explore. One day, he goes all the way to the fence of the camp where he starts talking to an eight year old Jewish boy (Shmuel) who stays hidden to avoid work. They become friends and Bruno brings food and games to Shmuel.As the movie progresses, we see the family deteriorates and the members of the family take different paths. The sister, who is twelve, shows an interest in Nazism and the teachings of the private tutor visiting the new home every week. The mother shortly realizes what is going on behind the fences and has a very hard coping with it.It was a rather interesting story but the problem is, the team making this movie was probably trying to make something very large and important (and I mean, the message in the movie is very important) but somehow the movie does not reach all the way. On the plus side we have the music score, the scenery, and especially the ending which in my book, was worth a couple of points alone. The acting was decent from the adults and very good from the children. One person in my family said the daughter was so annoying, which I think the director somehow wanted the audience to think. But some of the other acting was not what it should have been and the prisoners just did not seem to be prisoners. Also on the negative side was the fact that the movie was kind of slow. It is not the kind of movie you would see over again, but I would definitely recommend it. I would like to finish by saying that it is sad that adults cannot take the same approach as normal kids do when they meet strangers, but I guess that is not the way of the world.",

            "content": "Recently flicking through the TV channels... Oh \"The boy in the striped Pyjamas\" I remembered this was a movie I did like! So I watched almost from the beginning as it had already started. This is a very sad film, and the saddest thing about it...NO spoiler here, is that I have seen it before and could not remember much about its details, only that it made me remember that it was a very good movie to my liking. And this is sad indeed, I have some difficulty to accept that it was almost new to me again, and how could that be, when some of the scenes are so powerful and well acted. Today I read a few comments here on IMDb and it's quite interesting how they express almost extremes opinions. One that seems to pop up a lot is the choice of language. Some feels that it should have been expressed in German or with some sort of Germanic accent or words perhaps. I disagree with this. Recently I saw the \"Book Thieve\" and I found so inappropriate the use of a few German words here and there even if I wasn't too bother by the \"would be\" German accent at the hand of English speaking actors. I personally feel that the transfer to a fully educated English dialog reflected better than otherwise the depth of the situation. After all if it had been a book wouldn't it be in pure English? Reason for this choice are said to be because it is a British film, this alone is a good reason as the Irish writing is the original therefore its thoughts are expressed correctly and not translated to its nearest meaning. Then if it is presented to an English speaking audience it's definitely a good choice. I do understand though that each country has its personal characters, and language with its own peculiarities of which cultural influence is one of them, thus may have a different flavour written in another language, but this is only of value when one is familiar with these differences, I don't believe the majority of the viewers would. Other comments do speak of improbability of certain situations in the plot... I don't believe this work claims to be a factual account of what went on during these terrible times. But it certainly is inspired by the horror of it. And it brings it through the eyes of the age of innocence in a very touching way. Innocence from those who could not know better because of their young age, but also innocence from those who were conned in believing they were doing a humanitarian salvage. In France I have been raised with negative feeling towards the Jewish presence and I did not need this film to tell me what Jews were, I believe most of Europe was also holding the same perception. Of course, to hold such thoughts is still a long way from acting on it as the SS did, but it certainly part of it. But let's not forget that human behaviour has not changed all that much. We're still not very comfortable with anything not familiar or posing a challenge. Race is still a problem, Sport, nationality, status etc. So anything that may be identified as a threat, a disadvantage or a suspicion may give rise to undesirable thoughts or actions. Some suggest we should read other work about the Holocaust instead of \"melting\" over this story... I would say, some don't even believe or want to believe that such event happened. And here the brutality of these days I believe is factual, the unbelievable outcome of these event is also well documented and most reasonable people would accept it happened. The discordance between the German is also to be believed. I think each of them dealt with what happened then in their own way, mostly faced with a very difficult and dangerous \"hot potato\" But some were brave enough and some lost their life to keep to their belief. I saw all this in this film...Will I remember it next time?",

            "content": "War is said to either bring people together or tear them apart. The movie The Boy in the Striped Pajamas demonstrates both outcomes in a heart wrenching tale about a Nazi soldier's son and his unlikely new companion. The heartbreaking story begins in Berlin, where the son Bruno's life is that of an ordinary eight years old boys. All this will change once his Father asks the family to go with him on his assignment as a soldier during World War II, where the progression of tragedy begins. This tragic story is brought to life through many aspects such as acting, costume, and plot, all of which give the movie great emotional appeal. This movie would not have this great emotional appeal if it were not for the actors. Asa Butterfield brilliantly portraits the son, Bruno. For such a young actor Butterfield shocks his audience with such great expression of emotion. Asa makes his act believable through his facial expressions and delivery of lines. Often when he speaks his voice echoes innocence and when appropriate, confusion. The main physical feature he uses to portray his innocence are his eyes. He often widens them in awe and uses them to connect with the audience by looking either directly in the camera or intently at the other characters. One of those other characters is his father, who is also a Nazi soldier, played by David Thewlis. As the story progresses David smiles less and less showing how the war is beginning to impact his character. He shows little reaction to the cruelty played out in the movie, hardly flinching. This stillness that David brings further portraits his character as a harsh, unforgiving Nazi soldier and starkly contrasts Bruno. There is an even greater contrast seen between the Jewish and German characters in the film. This contrast is emphasized through the characters of Bruno and Schmuel with the use of costume and set. Bruno is a well dressed little boy, surrounded by a well dressed family, in a big beautiful house. While Schmuel, who lives but a mile away, wears rags in a fenced in suffering \"community\". While what they wear sets them apart, what really shows the social divide between the Germans and Jews is the wall around Bruno's home. When first driving up to the house it is evident that what is inside the boundaries of their home is vastly different from what is on the outside of it. This movie does a wonderful job in costume and set, setting up the movie for success in showing the social divide between the Jews and Germans during World War II. Mark Herman, the director has a lot to do with the success of the movie as well. Thanks to him the plot progresses in a way that flows and wastes no scenes. The movie lets you see glimpses into how the war impacted each person's life differently. From the grandparents to Bruno's sister we get a taste of the many different perspectives on the war. While the movie could have expanded on the other character's experiences a bit more, having only a brief look allows for each scene to serve a purpose and avoids filler. Due to that success in plot the movies emotional appeal continues to be its best quality throughout the film. This original idea to show a Nazi soldier's son and an eight years old Jewish prisoner leads the audience to feel great sadness. This sadness is not only drawn from the film but from a real history of hatred towards a people who were not understood. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is not a movie to be watched purely for entertainment, but also to reflect on the past and on the actions of the Nazi's towards the Jews. That is what brings true greatness to the film not just the acting, progression of plot, and costume, but the historical accurateness.",

If you care what's true, then how about researching this question at Amazon, wikipedia, google, ask.com etc?",

I went to see this movie on my own, and I know for a fact that I was not the only one who sat there in silence minutes after the credits had finished rolling. This film is incredibly moving and will touch the hearts of even the coldest. The mother's emotions throughout the film grasp what many people felt throughout the times of the Holocaust, and made the most heart-racing moments even more intense. I will never forget her screaming in anguish for the loss of her son through the most touching consequences, and it will be an image that will remain with me for a long long time. There are no words to describe how how felt after watching this film. I did not cry, but I remember that night I continued to think and reflect upon this film for hours.

A very realistic and very hard movie on the concentration camps, and the story is really poignant, and the characters are well written and superbly interpreted by very convincing actors. Asa Butterfield in the role: Bruno and Jack Scanlon in the role of Shmuel (the Jewish boy) and Vera Farmiga in the role of Asa's mother and David Thewlis in the role of Asa's father. A movie that fills the spectator with emotion, a great film of its kind, because all these wars are also all the misfortunes of the world that fall on the heads of the innocent, a movie to be discovered absolutely for its sensitivity to the skin",

But I wouldn't call this a negative aspect.I watched this movie in Pathe cinema and like more people wrote, nobody stood op when the credits started to roll, everybody was like 'oh no, this is so sad, it can't be true'.I only found it a pity that we did not see more of Shmuel's relationship to his father.I ordered the DVD, which is due to arrive the 29th of April, I wonder(hope) if there are any deleted scenes or directors comment on it.Ps: congratulations Asa on your birthday",

            "content": "The film starts out small, but slowly grows larger. As it goes on the film gets more powerful. It has a strong cast, great direction, and a constant strength. It not only covers the Holocaust, but it also covers many other things also. There is the friendship that the two boys have. Despite the Zazi system telling them they are supposed to be enemies they form a strong bond. The German boy Bruno sees kindness in the Jewish boy's heart despite him being in a family that is in the Nazi party. The Jewish boy Shmuel sees that Bruno is not like the Nazis who put himself in the camp. He sees kindness in him just like Bruno did with Shmuel. Also it talks about what family means. Bruno's family as I said is Nazi. His father is part of Hitler's army, and his sister has posters all over her walls showing support for the Nazis. Despite this we see that he still loves his family. We see that he doesn't know what side to be on. Should he follow his heart, or should he follow his people. On one side he has this friend he met that he believes is not evil like what his people tell him he is. On the other he has the family he loves that he couldn't imagine would be part of a cruel treatment of an innocent people. We feel his emotions, and we are there with him all the way through his hard decisions on what is right. Then we have how the film shows humanity even in someone as cruel as a Nazi officer. I would explain this, but that would spoil the ending. As for the ending you don't see endings this powerful often. There is also terrific acting. Nobody in the cast doesn't deliver a well put together performance. Overall this is in my opinion a fantastic film.4 stars out of 4",

The child son of a Nazi war criminal (Bruno) befriends a child camp victim (Schmuel). The climax, Bruno (though uncorrupted by the teachings, and obviously a good soul) enters the camp to help Schmuel find his lost father, dressed as an incarcerated Jew. Wrong place and the wrong time, (not that it ever could be the right place), but Bruno and Schmuel enter a barrack of prisoners and are shuffled to the gas chamber and Bruno, Schmuel. In the meantime, the Nazi general father of Bruno realizes where his son is, and desperately but futilely enters the camp yelling for Bruno, in an attempt to save him.I ask, of you, who are so filled with emotion...What if Bruno didn't die? Only Schmuel....would the movie been any less tragic? I found this movie unstirring, as if I should be more emotional that the child of a Nazi war criminal died an unlucky death in a matter of minutes, while Schmuel lived and suffered the horrors of the camp for years. If the message was a wakeup call to the Nazi father, i.e. how's it feel? Does aryan blood burn differently from Jew blood, a quote from the movie in fact....That might be an acceptable message. A taste of the Nazi's own medicine. But I don't think that was the message at all. It's a sad message if we are somehow meant to sympathize more for the child of a nazi war criminal than the millions of Jewish children who were incinerated, gassed and tortured.

But now my mood was quite good (I've noticed that if I plan things and complete them then my mood is much better on overall, and I was successfully studying for a few days and my relationship with everyone is good, so my mood is really good), so I decided to watch this movie.\nWell, my mood is still good and I'm happy, but I have to say the ending absolutely shocked me.\nFirst of all, regarding the story I have to say that everything is quite realistic, the dialogues, actions of the kid, events. So I didn't feel stupid moments or cliches when watching this.\nI love how they showed Germans - not necessarily in bad way. You can understand their motives and that they were normal humans.\nI liked the actress Vera Farmiga, she's quite nice looking in this movie, reminded me of beautiful and feminine Julie Benz, but just in this movie, as they are not really that similar otherwise.\nThe ending. First of all, the movie was shorter than I expected, which was a surprise. Secondly, the last 10-15 minutes of your movie make your heartbeat faster, you get anxiety and you start questioning yourself \"Wait, is this really possible, could they do something like that? Is this even allowed? Are you freaking kidding me??? No, no, no!\"\nA great movie.",

I have made it a point to own all of her work. Her performance was riveting, her British accent flawless (quite a gig for her--An American using a British accent to play a German character).I just watched it. I had no idea from the title the content of the movie. I avoided Schindler's List because I did not want to be reminded of the atrocities of the animals known as Nazis. Early into the movie I realized the subject matter, paused it, and researched it on IMDb. Reluctantly, I continued to watch the movie, again because it starred Vera Farmiga. The content was more horrifying than any \"horror flick\" I've ever seen because the horror portrayed in this movie was real. I sat with my mouth gaping through several of the scenes, but in retrospect I'm glad I decided to finish the movie. Indeed, I discovered that the memory of the horrific acts perpetrated by those Nazi monsters (redundant, I know) had settled into the recesses of my mind, and this movie brought them back to light. I needed that reminder. I highly recommend this movie because I think everyone needs this reminder. Asa Butterfield gave an astounding performance as Bruno, a boy who, unlike his monstrous father, had such a big heart. His companion Shmuel, played by Jack Scanlon, was also excellent. I am always amazed that children can act. As kids we all pretend to be various characters...cops and robbers, superheroes, etc. But this is different. They're not out in the yard playing. They're on sets or on location in front of cameras, directors, crew, other actors, and all those lights! But they do it, and usually extremely well.I won't give away the ending; I'll just say that I will never forget it...nor should I.",

It would seem movies of this nature are the perfect movie to open concurrent with military operations happening today somewhere in the eastern Mediterranean as horrifying as those that took place almost 70 years ago.

            "content": "So \"I watched the boy in the striped pajamas\" from 2008. So was it good, yeah it was good. Now was it great, I say no. So Vera Farminga won the BIFA for best actress, for portraying a German chick with an English accent, portrayed by a U.S born chick who only spoke Ukrainian until she was six. So I guess that's what got her the award, because that is kind of challenging. Other than that I didn't find her performance all that note worthy. As far as Nazi flicks I have seen better, namely in the form of \"Schindler's list\". \"Schindler's list\" didn't pull any punches, making it one of the most powerful films of all time. But this movie is good. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it. One of the problems I had was all of the German's spoke with British accents, which threw me off a little at first, until I realized they were Nazi's. The story itself is good and centers around a small boy who befriends the boy in the striped pajamas. I will admit the ending is very powerful, and in a tamer movie would probably have ended differently. The end in this movie is more than just the final act, it is what this film builds too, and I guess that is why I just liked it and did not love it. I guess what I am saying is if the rest of the film had been as unflinching as the end it could have been great. However, this is one of those movies I think everyone should watch, not just to form there own opinion of this film, but to serve as a reminder that humans in reality can be monsters far worse than anything with fangs or sharp claws. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",

I would say to all of you who are thinking \"Is it worth going to see?\" definitely go and see it. It will leave you thinking long after you leave the theatre.

I'll never make that mistake again.The actorsI've liked Vera Farmiga since i saw her in Orphan, apart from that i knew no one from the cast. She gave a wonderful performance, as a matter of fact EVERYONE gave a wonderful performance but the real winner here was Asa. He was the reason i watched this, i'd never seen any of his work before, heard good things about him so gave the film a try. His performance was amazing, he was so cute and expressive through those dazzling blue eyes.The storyAbsolutely heartbreaking, from the way that poor doctor was treated to the dad's treatment of his loving wife. Its even worse to know that all this stuff actually happened. I was trying my hardest to work out which way it would go when i was watching, i was hoping praying that nothing happens to Shmuel, i knew nothing could happen to Bruno i was thinking at the end they'd run off together and live happily ever after, but i should have known bearing in mind the subject of this film. I was taken by surprise. I was trembling whilst watching the ending, the brilliant score along with the faultless acting. All I gotta say is Bruno back paid his debt to Shmuel for getting him in trouble.The message I found myself thinking whilst watching this, 'Have i ever behaved like the Nazis in this film? Even if it was unintentional?' And i'm happy to say i haven't. It sickens me to think that people actually treated other innocent human beings in such horrible ways. I knew about the Holocaust don't get me wrong, but to see it from a child's point of view was just heartbreaking. For the excellent acting throughout, brilliant casting, amazing musical score and faultless performance from Asa, i give this...masterpiece a 10 out of 10.",

            "content": "The boy in striped pyjamas explores the holocaust through the eyes of an 8 year old boy called Bruno. He lives with his Mother Elsa, his SS commandant Father and Sister Gretal in a wealthy estate, but when his Father is assigned to a prison camp they must reallocate from their luxurious lifestyle to a grim looking residence only a couple of miles from the concentration camp itself. As soon as this post is confirmed a leaving party is held for the Father, and we see that not everyone is a Nazi supporter as the Grandmother of Bruno openly criticises the Father.As the film progresses Brunos naivety towards the Jewish people and what is happening to them lead him to discover the prison and meet a young Jew called Schmuel. Although they are separated by an electric fence and lifestyles which couldn't be further apart a friendship blossoms. Bruno is envious of Schmuel, separated from his friends back home he sees the prison camp as some sort of playground and longs to join him inside.Back in the new residence divides start to form in the household. The homeschooling bores Bruno, he does not understand the Nazi propaganda and instead prefers to read fictional books, his sister however, buys into it and is soon redecorating her room with Swastikas and other Nazi paraphernalia. When an off the cuff comment from one of the Fathers soldiers reveals to Elsa that the Jewish people are being burned in the concentration camp she is dismayed at what her husband is doing which leads to an angry and tearful confrontation.It's strange to think that in Nazi Germany some people could be ignorant as to what is going on, coupled with the chastising remarks from the Grandmother the film loosely explores the divide that existed at the time. The choice to have British accents as opposed to German is an interesting one, German accents can be sharp and harsh, but the British voices hit home that the people involved in Nazi Germany were just as human as anyone else, which makes the atrocities committed all the more horrifying. The burning of Jews is reduced to performances charts, efficiency diagrams and promotions, whilst others cannot comprehend that their families could do such things. The performances from the two children stand out from the rest. Asa Butterfield as Bruno remains convincingly wide eyed and curious throughout the film, Jack Scanlon as Schmuel presents a depressed figure, a child who does and doesn't understand what is happening to him, and a friendship realistically develops through the kind of connection that is born from the innocence of youth. The end scene of the film is predictable but it doesn't detract from the horror of it. However I did feel slightly perturbed, although to have such a dark ending is commendable I did get the feeling that the concentration camp wasn't sad enough so it needed a German child to die in it to just to hit home how terrible it was. The slightly contrived nature of it did ruin the emotional effect it should have had on me.Despite my grievances with the ending, it's a solid film that does the subject matter justice. The lingering afterthought of what the Jewish people went through whilst people in Nazi Germany either treated it as work or resented the ones that were doing it is food for thought. 7/10",

Based on the novel by John Boyle and set during WWII, the film revolves around and is in the perspective of an 8 year old boy, Bruno, the son of a commandant at a concentration camp. Bruno befriends a Jewish boy named Schmuel but the forbidden friendship with the boy on the other side of the camp fence has startling and unexpected consequences.This is by far one of the most amazing and most stunning films I have ever seen. The emotion that this film brings to the audience is like nothing I have ever seen before. The character development is so precise that you are so engaged in the film from the very first scene. The director, Mark Herman, has really brought something special to the screen here. He has been given a vision of an amazing story and he has stunningly and so effectively brought it to life. The scenes that Bruno and Schmuel share are so beautiful and you can really feel the friendship building throughout the film.As the audience we know exactly what is going on outside of Bruno's own mind and world, and what exactly is happening to the Jewish people in the camps but Bruno's innocence and naivety to the world around him is masterfully shown by Herman.The acting in the film is at its best. Verma Farminga is absolutely beautiful as Mother and her dramatic scenes with David Thewlis (Father) are so convincing and so emotional. She brought a lot of emotion and feeling to the character of Mother and she really has shown her true talent in this role.The child actors were just as good. Asa Butterfield was brilliant as Bruno and was perfectly casted for this role. I really couldn't imagine Bruno as anyone else. This is Asa's first major feature film and he really has proved that he has some real talent. Jack Scanlon as Schmuel is also fantastic.Overall there is really not much you can fault in this film (if anything) and this is a fantastic achievement in cinema. I truly believe that no matter whom you are, this film will affect you in some kind of manner",

She and Bruno and Shmuel, are the heart but Pavel, is the soul. He is wonderfully portrayed by David Hayman. When he bandages Bruno's knee and the doctor conversation begins, it is pure gold.

            "content": "When the ending credits rolled, the entire audience sat frozen in shock, completely speechless...This movie, based on the novel by John Boyne, is about a young boy, Bruno, whose family are sent to live in the country for his father's work.Bruno is initially reluctant to move, not wanting to be separated from his friends. He spies a farm, full of people in \"pyjamas\", out his bedroom window. When he asks about it, he is frequently dismissed. He is eager to visit the farm as he can see children there, but is strictly forbidden from going any further than his front garden.We soon learn that the camp is not a farm, but in fact a concentration camp. Bruno sneaks out to get a closer look, where he befriends a young boy called Shmuel. Bruno is initially jealous of Shmuel, thinking he lives on a fun farm with lots of friends. Shmuel explains that he cannot leave, and he is there because he is a Jew, which confuses Bruno.Bruno is conflicted by the teachings of his tutor, who tells him that the Jews are evil. Bruno can't understand how his friend Shmuel, and the family's kindly servant Pavel, can be so evil. His sister becomes a militant Hitler supporter complete with posters on the wall, which only adds to young Bruno's confusion.Bruno gradually begins to piece together what is really going on at the camp, and what his father really is - as does his mother, who is horrified when she learns the true nature of the smoking chimneys.My only criticism is that the film is spoken with English accents, which makes things confusing in the beginning (wondering if they are English people living in Germany) and takes away from the authenticity. Obviously the film would have to be in German to be truly authentic, however it is generally accepted that an accent implies that the characters would have been speaking the language.A beautiful and poignant film about innocence, loyalty and friendship, set within the sheer horror of the Holocaust.",

            "content": "I didn't know all that much about this film going in, so it was a nice surprise to see actors I recognized such as Vera Farmiga who played Lorraine Warren in The Conjuring, and Madolyn in The Departed, and also David Thewlis who played Professor Lupin in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. The film didn't give any specific date or year that the story took place in, which was interesting because I would have liked to place the exact year and what events were going on in Germany at that point in time. Initially I expected a formulaic Holocaust movie that was significantly watered down to make it more watchable for audiences and teenagers considering this was given a PG-13 rating, but that was definitely not the case, especially with ending.The opening shot was great and really caught my eye. It gave the film a very innocent full of life feel. The colors and cinematography as a whole was another thing I loved. Beno\u00eet Delhomme (the director of photography) did a great job of using such vivid colors which made this seem like the audience was watching a story through the eyes of a child, and also reminded the audience that the story is being told from a Nazi perspective. As Bruno starts to realize what is happening, his clothes become darker and more faded. Additionally, when Bruno gets into the camp, the colors become washed-out which gives the film a depressing tone. Another thing I noticed is that both Bruno and his father had blue eyes, but only Bruno's were light and full of life, while his fathers were darkened. This could be a contrast of a child's innocence and an adult corrupted by power.I additionally had a few problems with the film. If this is about Nazi Germany and set in the countryside of Berlin, why do all the characters speak English with British accents? It would have been much more realistic and effective if the entire movie was in German. There were also many references to airplanes when the kids were playing throughout the film, but this was never explained. Why did this happen in the first place? Another problem I had was how large the holes in the fence were in the camp. Couldn't Shmuel have easily crawled through one of them? Weren't there any guards watching the fence? It didn't look like it. The characters additionally kept referring to Germany as the 'Fatherland', whereas Hitler always referred to it as the 'Motherland'. Shouldn't the characters mimic this to be more historically accurate? The biggest issue I had with the plot line was that the entire story was implausible. There were no 9-year-olds in the camps. If someone was not old enough to worked, they were immediately put to death.As a whole, apart from these criticisms, I really enjoyed this film. The soundtrack was absolutely lovely and joyous, which was also a great contrast to the dark setting of the Holocaust. The entire cast did amazingly, but the most notable performances were from Farmiga and Butterfield. Also a nice touch that was added was the vans in the background every so often when Bruno was playing on the swing, so that the audience wouldn't get lost in the story of a kid, and are reminded of what this movie was really about. I also appreciated the themes of adults and their relationships with children. Not only does the teacher in the film completely brainwash the two kids, but any time they have a chance, the parents shelter and lie to the kids about what is really going on in the country. The ending had such a great climax and an upsetting, yet effective, conclusion. I knew there wouldn't be a happy ending, considering the subject matter, but the way this ended was extremely unexpected.",

Br\u00fcno wields his role as he really doesn't know what's going on. I appreciate that. Elsa, Br\u00fcno's mom, wields also her role very nice. In the story she's very observant. In real life I don't believe she's really so observant.I'll recommend this movie to everyone! It's a very thrilling, exciting film. You don't get distracted, because the most of the moments are really full of suspense! Rating? I'll give it 4/5 stars! So watch the film, and review it!",

His father is in the army and has a high SS rank. At a certain moment they move to a another place. The boy doesn't like it, but he has to. Then he discovers a camp what is according to him a farm. If he goes there, he meets a Jewish boy, Shmuel. Later Shmuel persuades him to come to the park to find his dad. Bruno does still not know what kind of that cruel place the park is. With all consequences.This film is a beautiful drama about a story that every one will regret. All the actors play fantastic roles, and live themselves entirely into the movie. The film was nominated for a ' ' Goya' ' for best European movie and actress Fera Farmiga won a British Independent film Award for her astounding performance as mother Elsa.Because of its sad story this film will seize many people. You get such a compassion with that boy, because he doesn't know anything all about the true story of the camp and thinks that it's all a game. Bruno was there at the wrong moment, at the wrong place.That was his fate, his destination.Copyright\u00a9 Blom Arts",

His father is a Nazi-officer who has just been promoted. That was the reason they moved to a place named: Out-With. Bruno went to take a look round the house. Through one of the windows he saw a \"farm\". He tells his mom about the farm, because he wants to know if there live children. So he can play with them. His mother prohibited him to go there, but Bruno became curious. On one day he follows the worker of the house. He was a Jewish man, and he lived in the camp. Bruno climbs through a window of the barn when nobody looks. He ran through the woods and came by the \"farm\". There he saw a boy named Shmuel. The two boys started a friendship. Bruno returned each day and sometimes he brought some food. When his mother wanted to go back to Berlin, Bruno didn't want to go. He wished to stay with Shmuel. So Bruno crawls under the fence of the camp. He was just at the wrong time there; he went straight into the gas chambers. His parents can't find Bruno till they came to the barn. Bruno's father goes to the camp, but is he on time?I like the actor Jack Scanlon (Shmuel) because he's quite young and he plays his role very well. He could empathize well and brings his emotions very clear. I recommend this movie to other people, because it is an impressive movie. I think people should stay aware of what happened in the war and what it was like. And I think this movie helps with that.",

My heart broke when Bruno lied about knowing Shmuel.... and it kept breaking - the ending - I saw this on cable and just sat there at the end - the only thing moving were the tears streaming down my face. I highly recommend this film - it's on an hour and a half - we should all revisit this horror - no one should ever forget. I am having my 13 year old watch this, we've discussed the holocaust events on several occasions; I think this film provides an excellent perspective from an innocent soul of some of the history behind these horrific events. If you have children between the ages of 10 (?) depending on child's maturity, and up - I would watch it with them; be ready to discuss it and possibly have other resources to share.

            "content": "Touching upon a well-worn and sensitive subject, this still manages to be one of the most notable and moving films I've ever seen. The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is an overwhelming story of the power friendship can truly hold. Mark Herman has created a masterpiece. Set in Nazis Germany, the story is seen through the eyes of Bruno, (Asa Butterfield) an eight year old destined to be an explorer. Living comfortably with his wealthy family in Berlin, he is blissfully unaware of the horrors that are unfolding in the real world. However his parents' protective grasp to keep Bruno ignorant is tainted. Bruno's father is promoted from his desk job to commanding a work camp in the middle of nowhere. Bruno cannot understand why he's forbidden to visit the 'farm' nor the sudden icy tension between his parents. Bruno's curious nature takes over as he makes friends with Shmuel, (Jack Scanlon) a genial Jewish boy being held in the camp. The unlikely friendship between the two boys was performed to perfection, very honest and believable. Their innocence in the face of evil is gradually spiked towards revelation as they discover horrific truths, yet without real understanding of it.My only criticism is that all the characters speak in a straightforward English accent, despite them portraying Germans. This is a little surprising nevertheless I got used to it. The cast was faultless. The characters were portrayed very well, particularly Vera Farmiga who played the part of Brunos mother wonderfully, dynamic as a distressed woman. Both Butterfield and Scanlon delivered strong, poignant performances. Bruno's father (David Thewlis) performs in such a harsh and cold manner, even towards his wife and children. A difficult role to produce, but he manages it superbly. Without patronizing, this film connected with both children and adults alike. It was perfectly weighted in every way. Just prepare to feel emotion at the harrowing, killer blow of a finale.",

Herman directed both Little Voice and Brassed Off - the man KNOWS how to use music effectively (Danny Boy in the latter film still makes be cry like a baby). The climax to this film however felt ham-fisted. The orchestration completely drowned the moment where I feel a much more restrained hand would have had greater emotional impact. Much of the rest of the score was fabulous.In the acting stakes, I think the ladies won the day, with both Amber Beattie and Vera Farmiga giving performances that were a joy to watch.A great film, but it could have been better.",

            "content": "I ask this question to myself, \"What's the point of a war?\" I got the answer from Professor Moriarty in the Game of Shadows that he wants to own the bullets & bandages. Perhaps it's always the business interest of individuals (& now nations) that orchestrate a war. Now who's got the most to lose in a war? It seems like it's always the Women and Children. So when we view that war from their eyes, we can feel the blunt of the problems the war has led to. Childish this statement be, If only the world leaders had seen issues through the eyes of kids, plenty of bloodshed in the twentieth century could have been avoided.What's the relevance of the above paragraph with the movie, \"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\"?We get to see the Holocaust in the eyes of a kid! Actually a German Kid, who happens to be the son of the Commander of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp. Does it matter to the German kid, whether the kid he befriends is a Jew? Does it matter if that Jewish kid is on the other side of the fence? Is it a big deal if he wants to cross the fence that separates them? As grown-ups we know the seriousness of the last question. But obviously the kid doesn't know that!The movie is made up of moments that shows us how the world around the Kid is trying to create a perception of the Jews. The tutor, the Nazi guard, kid's father & Grandfather represent the Nazi propaganda. The Kid's Grandmother (although she appears once) represents the anti- Nazi view. I couldn't understand the stand of the Kid's mother. Probably someone who's not anti-Nazi but at the same time wants to be away from the mess. The Kid's sister is the perfect teenager who has fallen for the Nazi propaganda.In such scenarios, I wonder is it wrong to steal food so that you can help a hungry kid? No. Our established morals have to go for a toss but does it matter? No. The biggest success of this movie is that any viewer who has seen quite a few Holocaust movies, would understand what's happening on screen. They need not show anything explicitly. That adds to the poignancy although not to a level of Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful.Keeping aside all that I've said above, the movie is a must watch for the heart wrenching final few minutes. It can move even the iron hearted to tears.Do watch it when you get time! I've tried my level best to avoid any spoilers.Additional titbits about the movie1.

            "content": "When a calamity as unconscionable and hideous as the Holocaust is scrutinized through the artless and unworldly eyes of a kid who has yet to celebrate the first decade of his life, it feels all the more harrowing and traumatic than ever since it is filtered and refined through a net of puerile innocence and unsophistication. Concepts like war and its immediate aftermath are just too much for the child's ignorantly blissful heart to deal with. So the question is: Is the holocaust a kid's stuff? The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a shot at it.The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a movie looking at the Holocaust through the eyes of an eight year old boy (Asa Butterfield) who, after his high-ranking Nazi officer father's promotion, has to bid farewell to his friends in Berlin just to find himself desolate in the countryside with his family consisting of his father (David Thewlis), mother (Vera Farmiga) and twelve year old sister (Amber Beattie). In his sheer desperation, Bruno sets off exploring his whereabouts through a window to spot a concentration camp which, in his naivet\u00e9, he takes for a farm chock-a-block with farmers in striped pajamas. With his insatiable curiosity getting the better of him, he skulks there to encounter a hollow-eyed Jewish boy of his age called Schmuel (Jack Scanlon) whom he befriends. This friendship goes on and on, with Bruno sneaking some food to the starvation-stricken and aggrieved Schmel, leading up to the movie's inevitable ending which I do not wish to disclose.In the mean time, the quotidian life has an uncanny course of its own. The father, overly committed to his career as the commander of the camp, hires a tutor (Jim Norton) so that his children do not lag behind in schooling. Despite the tutor's success in brainwashing the girl into a racist monster, his attempts in stuffing the boy's Laodicean worldview with tidbits of chauvinistic mumbo jumbo bites the dust. The loving and seemingly submissive and clueless mother hits the roof over her serendipitous revelation that she has been frozen out of her husband's vile transgressions in incinerating Jews in crematoria. Also, the commander's assistant's getting dressed down (Rupert Friend) for his dereliction in reporting on his father's relocation to Switzerland at the time of war and venting his anger on the doctor-turned-potato peeler inmate, Pavol convincingly played by David Hayman, are of noteworthy scenes.The director Mark Herman does not helm his movie on a taut and rock-sold premise. The script, based on a novel with the same name by John Boyle, is sprayed with some authorial contrivances just to push the plot a head and getting to the desired preordained ending at the expense of plausibility. That security is not high enough in the camp so Bruno visits it at his convenience and that Germans speak posh British accent raise some serious questions. All those shortcomings aside, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is rewarding in its emotional payoff and in the tiptoe performances of its cast, especially that of Vera Farmiga. The ending is so devastating that I had to comfort my wife. All in all, the Holocaust is not a kid's stuff but kids like Bruno and Schmuel makes it deserving of reconsidering our attitudes.",

It's not a perfect film, and I agree with others that the concentration camp doesn't look quite real. But I was completely hooked. The acting is really very good, particularly David Thewlis as father/camp commandant. Amon Goth in Schindler's List was a monster out and out. The really chilling thing about Thewlis is his portrayal of a man who loves his wife and children, loves his father and mother, has good friends, enjoys a good party, loves being a soldier, loves his country, is hugely proud of being promoted at work. But, oh dear, the work ... The most frightening thing about the Nazis is that they were ordinary people who did monstrous things while still retaining a humanity towards the people they cared about and absolutely none to those \"on the outside\". The film portrays this very well - is it just me who wonders \"what if it had been us?\". Asa Butterfield as Bruno conveys perfectly an 8 year old's innocent belief in his ideal father, a belief which merges into doubt, then to distrust, then touching but misconceived renewal of belief. We only have to hope that he doesn't have time to finally realise the truth before the end. It didn't make me cry (and seriously, I even get teary through some adverts), but I can't help thinking about it today so it obviously made an impression. It may not be as gritty as it could (should?) have been, but if the image of the gas-masked soldier through the skylight doesn't make you shiver, I don't know what will. Absolutely recommended.",

I expected that all along I guess as that is historyI did not shed any tears but my response was that of puzzlement.Perhaps I read too much (or too little( into this movie but I thought it well crafted. For example, the 'American' entertainer at the party. America's response at that time to to what was going on? Of course the theme of the uniforms The theme of awareness of what is going on as Bruno plays and the Jews in the neighbourhood are being 'rounded up'.. There we see the innocence of the child which will eventually be dramatically stripped away. The mother's awareness also figures in here Even the father will be impacted although he 'steels' himselfChildren affected by the parents is most striking with the young soldier who assists the commandant (father slipped away to Switzerland). Sometimes by actions and sometimes by birth (Jewish boy) My hearing I guess but it sounded like they were saying Schmoe.One last thought, the language may very well have been intentional to make it more closely tied to our day, circumstances and surroundings.

This is all in all an adult movie, and adult criteria apply. I will not reveal the plot but it is simply too much to believe in. I think the director should have taken out a lot of sidelines, because they are eating away valuable time. Now it seems the story is just tautened between the start and the end. For instance, the details about the sister could go, the teacher is not necessary, the time spent on the grandparents is a waste, the mini plot around lieutenant Kotler is rather superfluous. Instead this time could have been used to make the main plot meander more naturally to its unraveling. Without all these sidelines the solitude of the boy would increase, and the director could have thought about a more acceptable way the boy enters the no-go area.

The acting from the adult actors was wooden and void of emotional content for most of the film (the last fifteen minutes was rather overdone, screaming is not acting...its screaming!). The child actors were a lot better than their adult counterparts, and for most of the film brought an amount of credibility to their roles that i must credit them with. That is the only praise i can give to this frankly awful, insensitive and crass film. So the film is not about good acting.The historical value the film brings to the table is non-existent, it takes what we are all taught in school and exploits it to make a film about this black hole in human history. So its not a film about the history of the holocaust.The film makes no sense. How does Bruno stay at the edge of a concentration camp, playing games (at one point he even throws a ball over the barbed wire fence) for at least 2 hours a day, without any single guard spotting him (there is a guard tower overlooking the spot). Shmuel has to take a long walk to the fence from where he is supposed to be, why hasn't anyone ever followed him or stopped him? At the end Bruno is treated like an ordinary prisoner whilst being herded into the \"shower\". Why hasn't anyone noticed his long hair, or his clean skin, or his full belly, or his healthy looking body? OK, so its not a film about truth or common sense.The film is structured well, until the ending. I can just imagine the scene at the writer's house now. The writer sitting at his desk, about to write the ending to the most emotional and well written holocaust film since Schindlers list...and then his partner walks up to him, kisses him on the cheek and says \"come to bed darling\". The writer then proceeds to make the biggest mistake of his life, he writes the crass, insensitive and unfulfilling ending that eventually makes it into the film. There is no justice, no justification for the two hours of watching. There is no sadness in the ending, just anger. So its not a film about justice or sadnessThis film is blunt and stunted. If La Vita E Bella is like a delicate instrument designed to invoke a powerful and provocative insight into the holocaust, The boy in the striped Pyjamas is like a fork. Used to stuff ones face with over-emotional dribble, it turns into a very insensitive and crass production, which leaves a very bad taste in the mouth.",

A fairytale concentration camp with children, where everyone was just sitting around. For not to mention a camp without security and almost without guards. And the commanders son (main character) came to play with a boy for hours each day! Some writers recommend this movie for educating at schools. How could they? If you are going to portrait something very far from what really happened, you either add humor, or make everyone sure this is just a fairytale. This movie did neither..",

His growing friendship with a boy (in striped pyjamas) is a lens through which we see the horrible stereotypes and attitudes held at the time. This perspective gives us a fresh look at a subject covered many times before.I have read the book and the friendship felt a little more natural in print, but nevertheless the film sucks you in mainly because of the great work of Asa Butterfield as Bruno and a strong supporting cast. The period is captured beautifully* and the disparity between the lives the the commandant's family and that of the camp inmates is stark and something that resonates (I have visited a concentration camp and this was the case there as well...). * My main gripe are that I would have preferred the film to be played by German actors in German. It doesn't matter how much effort you put into period details and uniforms and re-creating Berlin with all the posters and Nazi insignia - if everyone is speaking like they just dropped out of a Downton Abbey set then it kind of destroys the illusion. Yes they acted well, but it felt so awkward to me that I really felt the film suffered as a result. I don't imagine this would have been released as a AAA blockbuster so releasing it as a German language film seems sensible. Tarantino managed to make a film with German, French and English spoken - why couldn't this be the same? Frustrating.",

When the father yells, \"Bruno!\" the mother somehow hears him and instantly understands all that has happened. That's just the worst example of writing and directing that understands nothing about history, nothing about the culture, nothing about human motivation.One of the stupidest movies I've ever seen.

There is no question about that.I do believe that Bruno (the main character) looses a lot of his innocence (and naivet\u00e9) as the movie goes on. However, my personal opinion is (people may interpret this differently, by the end of the film): I think Bruno does not loose all innocence, and still does not fully understand what kind of life Shmuel lives or why Shmuel lives there (and, Shmuel can't really explain it either, also begin just a child himself). He doesn't seem to understand what he got himself into, at the end of the film.",

Violence is applied to the story very sparingly, and then only to illustrate its direction and purpose; there are no date-movie thrills herein. The characters are three-dimensional, though (sometimes bizarrely, given the chosen setting) voiced with the Estuary English of their portrayers, and sometimes less brutal than they might have actually been in 1940s Germany.The fact that this film was *mildly* toned down is hardly a complaint, as I even found it difficult to watch at moments. During one especially important scene I even shed a few tears, and I'm hardly one to cry over a movie.This is essentially a story of contrast between the purity of a child's heart and the grime introduced to it by the adult world. It is also a reminder that we who enjoy the freedom to live can never again allow this to happen. *Do not* bring young children to this one; it is more than intense.",

If this was an animated film with bunnies and less glamorous animals, I would think the first scenario was possible.

It's insulting that a beautiful little German boy had to be the star of this movie when there were 6 million other reasons that should have been every bit as convincing, or more so considering the facts of the matter.

Coming from a Jewish family myself, I am quite interested in the holocaust and know a lot about it. The movie was very emotional and sweet and somewhat accurate except for a few things. First of all, children in the concentration camps were taken somewhere different, often put with their mothers, so Shmuel would not have been with his father at this time. Also, the concentration camps were much, much more secure than in the movie. They often had multiple electric barbed fences surrounding them, not just one. So in real life, it most likely wouldn't be possible for Bruno and Shmuel to have met and talked every day, because Bruno would have gotten caught, and besides, he wouldn't be able to dig under the fence, due to how many fences were there.. Another thing, Shmuel would not be allowed to go over and sit by the fence while he was supposed to be working. Many of the events that take place in this movie would have been unrealistic because of how restricted the Jews actually were. This movie shows them to have quite a bit more freedom than they did in the actual camps. Besides those inaccuracies, the movie really did amaze me. I am impressed on how it showed the emotion of all those people being lost forever, but in a way, you see it through a child's eyes and how their innocence changes the whole picture. It was a beautiful movie and I would indeed watch it again for the amazing story, but I just wish that it was more accurate and portrayed more along the lines of what actually happened.",

They were moving because Bruno's father (David Thewlis), commandant of Adolf Hitler army, got a promotion and would need to work nearby a concentration camp. The story is shown from the perspective of looking Bruno, and early on the film, the boy is supposed to be different from his sister, Gretel (Amber Beattie), who apparently does not care about the moving house, but she cares in trying to face the facts like an older girl than she really was, in the view of Bruno. The boy shows to be upset about the moving, because like an eight years old boy, he does not want to go to a place far from his friends, and he thought his house the better in the world, but nonetheless, he has to go with his family, even without understanding what is happening and the political regime of the time, the reason for his father needs to move. When they arrive in the new house, all look like satisfied, except Bruno, who just goes to his room and looks out his bedroom window, where he sees the camp concentration, but he thinks that it was a farm. He observes the place and the people inside it, what look like strange, because the striped clothes that Jews were wearing, and in the innocent view of the boy, it were simply pajamas. After it, Bruno starts to question his parents and his sister about what he had seen, and the answers never were convincing. His distrust increases when a Jew man comes in the kitchen of his house, and his mother cannot explain who the man is and what he was doing there. So, Bruno, driven by curiosity, as a boy who wishes to be an explorer, goes to look for answers to his questions. Then, he discovers a fence in the back of his house, that is the same place that he had seen by his window, and there, he sees a Jew boy, in the other side of the fence, who called Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) and decides to talk to him, and he discovers that both were the same age, and the boys become friends. But, Bruno still does not understand why he and Shmuel were separate by that fence, and the contradiction between what his family, except his mother, that shows to oppose to regime, and the other people said about the Jew, that they were horrible people, and his friend Shmuel, that does not look like this. The end of this story is obviously bad. Bruno decides to go in the camp concentration, so he passes under the fence, in the purpose of helping Shmuel to find his father, and the result of this action is the death of the two boys. The actors acting, mainly the children, is as good as the story. Asa Butterfield and Jack Scanlon had a great challenge in this film and both of them have not left to be desired. So, for those who like films about dramas or the Nazism time, the film is highly indicated, or for those who simply like an exciting friendship story.",

Ralf is a Nazi sergeant who has been given in his possession one of the many Jewish concentration camps that were installed in the Second World War, a cold man who has no feelings (only when it suits him), his presence implies total respect (sometimes fear makes you feel obedience from another person), the first scene in which he appears (in the living room) is a clear example, is a wolf with sheepskin, does not feel empathy for anyone, but who in this film is not like him?, maybe Bruno... I would very easily describe Ralf as the villain of the film but I think that's not the real message that the book and/or film really wants to show after all but to show the double amorality that exists in the world and the actions that may or may not have repercussions, but perhaps, in the end, he paid dearly for his actions. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is surprisingly one of those films that become very faithful to the book and also the film is easy to watch without getting bored.Cons: You would ask for the impossible, but I would have liked to see scenes in which David and Vera Farmiga interact more although it would be difficult to happen because as I said earlier he is cold and the wife for his part is very conservative ....... And why not: To have seen him live happily with his two sons Bruno and Gretel.",

I found myself watching for the unspoken references found throughout the film, that offer foreshadowing and a sense of foreboding.

That's why the strong scenes have the perfect innocence and lightness they should have. Also, the true friendship between Bruno and Shmuel makes everyone, even those who don't appreciate history movies, interested until the end.I have already seen a lot of films whose theme is the Second World War, but this one is definitely my favorite because of the fact that the main characters are children. We cheer for Bruno and Shmuel and we start to hate Bruno's father even before we notice him. The film hooks people from all ages, from adults to children (although I wouldn't recommend it to kids under 10 years old) because, in some way, everyone finds it relatable to their own lives. I must also give credits to young Asa Butterfield's wonderful acting.It is so nice when a movie can actually make people think about what they have watched. This is what happened when I first watched it with my family. We took hours talking about what we had just watched. Even my twelve-year-old brother started to ask more about the Second World War. When he found out this war really happened, he got really upset.The scene of the boys' death is just horrific and very faithful to the book. Again, everything is seen by the eyes of young Bruno, who thinks he's going on a trip. The innocence of both German and Jewish boys made me tear up. For those who are looking for a film that is very faithful to the real details of the war, I have to say that this one is not a realistic representation of real events and it isn't meant to be. It is not based on a real story, so it doesn't have the responsibility of representing every single detail of the real world. Bruno and Shmuel didn't actually exist. However, their story can still make us think and force us to never forget about how humanity has nothing to be proud of about the Holocaust.I would recommend this film to every person who doesn't care about crying when watching a movie. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is touching at the same time that is heavy and powerful. Mark Herman, the director, as well as all the cast and production, succeed in their jobs.

Throughout the whole film there have been a few sentences, so true, yet so discrete, because they were addressed to an 8 year old boy, the sentences that he doesn't understand, yet you do, and you pause the film and just sit in your empty room and think in complete silence and just think. You think about life, about death, your life, somebody else's life, about people in general, about all the harm they do and about all the misfortune and misery a human race is capable of causing. The book's beautifully transferred to the movie screen, Herman did an amazing job interpreting Boyne's masterpiece, casting was right on spot, they couldn't have pick better-suiting actors for this.Vera Faminga was outstanding, with her scream only a mother can understand.

Soon after reading the book and seeing the movie I would say the movie is surprisingly similar to the book. The only difference that stood out to me was the difference in age in the boys. After watching the movie I was so touched. The actor, who plays Bruno, Asa Butterfield, gives an amazing performance for a boy of his age. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is about a young boy who befriends a young Jewish living in a concentration camp. The movies climax is definitely one to see. Thankfully, my first time watching the movie was not in the theaters. I don't suppose I would have liked people seeing my face with tears streaming down. It isn't so often that a movie makes me cry and I take that as a good thing. I did enjoy the idea of the movie having to do with the holocaust and wasn't a typical storyline. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas has actually become one of my favorite movies and I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone up for shedding a tear or few.",

This movie completely lacked the sort of impact one comes to expect from a production about a very dark and difficult subject. I found there to be a lack of emphasis on the relationship between the two boys. The plots moved around continuously and never developed in any particular area making it impossible to form any sort of emotional connection with the film. Having said that, go on and take your 12 year old son to see it. It might be a good introductory lesson into some (very little) of what happened during ww2.",

I really understand that people get bored from the holocaust movies and think some people are abusing this concept to get more easy views. But let's not forget that this movie is a book movie, so it's not on of the \"nazi bad\" movies that you may think.The plot is very brutal, as it is in any holocaust movies, but this time the children is more included, so your pityness is going to be maxed during this movie. I repeat I don't think the creators' purpose is this. Of course there are disconnections in the plot, but what I'm bothered about is the character of the kids. There is no spoiler in this review but I don't think that's how a child thinks, or talks. He may seem like a kid if you don't mind the details. Bu you can easily catch some weird things a kid says if you watch accurately. I didn't read the book but I think this is a mistake and lowers the reality level of a dramatic movie.The cinematography is not bad, but not great either. If you watch the scenes without getting emotional (which is very hard because of the plot) you will realize that the scenes aren't that perfectly designed. But I'm not saying they are bad though. I think it is pretty good. Specially the camp scenes were good even through they included a little of it. The music isn't the star of the movie, but i think it is greatly coordinated. The music is just here to make you feel whatever the movie wants, so that's great.People always gets hyped when some kids act good. But since they are actors, you don't need to dramatize it. I don't think their acting was good by any means. Maybe the big girl, but she was foreshadowed because of the bad character development. And the mom, Vera Farmiga, is the star of the movie for me. Facial expressions was god level. There is nothing more to say well done.You can watch this if you even bored from the holocaust movies. It is also not that long. Don't make you expectetions high as something like Schindler's List and I think you'll like the movie.",

One thing that I am relieved is that not everyone in Germany agrees with taking part in the WW\u2161, even the top military's relatives as well. Also, it proves that children don't care about their race and background. This needs to be taught to adult at once seriously. This film is one of the best and touching ones that I have ever seen before in regard to WW\u2161. You'll never expect the ending literally and the story goes on making us breathless all the time.

            "content": "I believe films about the Holocaust are very important to teach young children the true story about what happened despite the cruelty of it all and this film does so, to a point.It's quite slow but the very good acting holds it in place and keeps it interesting from start to finish. However, I do have to criticise the role of the Mother. I don't think it was the acting, I just don't think she was very well written. The ending is what this film will be remembered for mostly though. It has a monstrous, devastating power and it hits like a brick wall and is a stark contrast to the slow, calm, nearly gentle tone of the film as a whole. Of course, there is a constant underlying threat but Bruno's innocence is purely portrayed: Sweet, gentle, innocent and naive. Again, that's what gives the ending such power.What I didn't like was...The pace. It's slow for a reason but sometimes too slow and even though it isn't quite true of the film, seemed rather uneventful.Also, as I already said, the character of the mother. Lastly, and most importantly, the believability. English is spoken of course where it would otherwise have been German. Now, a grown man could quite possible speak two languages fluently - Pavel; German and his mother tongue - but an 8 year old boy, I don't buy. Shmuel isn't German and I find it unbelievable that he can speak it at that age, fluently. He isn't from Germany. Bruno: \"That's a strange name\" so the two shouldn't be able to converse. Could be accused of nitpicking but once this crept into my head, I couldn't quite believe the rest of the film. Also, in terms of believability, it's too soft. A 12A, yes, but for a Holocaust film... I know they can't be overtly brutal, and that wouldn't suit this film, but the Holocaust was and we don't see any of it really. It's mostly implied for obvious reasons but I think something that wasn't too explicit and had a bit of grit (excluding the ending of course) could have went a long way in showing the cruelty of it all. I think some of what is implied in the film might be missed by the younger members watching.A good film it is, with strong acting (particularly from Asa Butterfield) but lacks a factor of believability.",

The cashier said something along the lines of 'I hope you have a full box of tissues'. I decided to rent it out of curiosity. The movie opens with a stark freedom of children running through Hitler's Germany without a care in the world. It was quite obvious that it was this freedom of childhood that would drive the movie forward. The story is about a German officer and his family who are relocated beside a concentration camp. The movie starts of from the German perspective and how they view the Jewish population. I felt a little unnerved at this point and watched on with a slight trepidation encase there was an underlying attempt of justification of mass genocide. The young boy Bruno meets a boy Shmaul sitting behind an electrified fence of a concentration camp. Immediately a friendship begins. This movie does not just tell us a story, it teaches us a lesson. Through these children's unprejudiced naivety and innocence a possibility is provided. A possibility of hope! If we were to view the world through the eyes of a child then we would be able to saves ourselves from our own inevitable destruction. This movie moves at just the right pace keeping you wonderfully intrigued, then, at the end you witness the most bitter irony and the most devastating tragedy. Recommended!!!",

Some have criticized this movie as too intense for the younger viewers that they think this film was intended for but this criticism misses the mark. The character portraits in this film are too complex for younger viewers to understand in my opinion, anyway.Besides the incredible ending, the real point of the movie is the growing horror of the holocaust as seen in the eyes of the characters. We see this not only in Bruno's mother (an incredible performance by Vera Farmiga) as she is repelled by the realization of what her husband has become. But also by his sister Gretel who initially becomes taken with Lieutenant Kotler and the Nazi philosophy because of her attraction to him. Only to realize in her brother's fear induced by his parent's quarelling that all is not right.The movie also offer s a strong commentary on how the German people could have tolerated or accepted what occurred even as some may not have yet understood all of the reality. When Bruno denies that he knows Schmuel when he is confronted by Lieutenant Kotler, we are seeing a metaphor for the denial that I believe the German people as a whole must have had for what, at some level, they must have realized was going on. It also demonstrates what pressure from those around you does to people.The strength of friendship is also evidenced by the next encounter between Bruno and Schmuel when Bruno asks Schmuel if he is still his friend and he says yes and they hold hands through the fence. I thought this was most touching scene of the film to that point.Finally in the end there is our own horror at what happens to Bruno who we have come to like and come to ultimately respect his own humanity and the lesson that evil destroys a part of the evil doer as well as the victim.To say that I was moved by this film underestimates its impact. This film is second only to Schindler's List in my estimation in its ability to enlighten us all on the horror of the holocaust. If this film is not at least nominated for Best Picture, I will be very disappointed.",

The dad, personally, was quite pleasant, likable guy and appeared to have a very good relationship with his family. A supportive guy with a sucky job. As the movie progressed he lost some of his appeal and became not quite as likable but I feel it was believable that this was due to the stress of his job and escalating estrangement from his family.Watching how the sister had no problem being brainwashed to the cause gave me a bit of a better understanding of how so many could be swayed to support the Nazi cause believing they were really in the right.Now to my reaction of the ending ...... after sitting in stunned silence when it was all over, I proceeded to throw up! I can't even say whether with the ending as it was I can overall say I enjoyed the movie or not - I am still absolutely reeling! Is it the type of ending that provokes deep emotions - definitely.

            "content": "Let me start talking about how Holocaust movies can really make me feel uncomfortable. Even though I fully enjoy them, I do not agree with how the Jews were treated during that time. Although, this does not mean we should not learn about it.What I mostly found wrong about the movie was the actors. I may not be an expert on accents, I believe they sounded more British then German. Also the plot does not seem right, I do not think that they would allow families to move near the Concentration Camps. Also, there would have been guards around where they met. The guards would have told Bruno to leave the camp and not come back. Near the end of the film when Bruno got under the fence, it would have not been so easy. I believe that before he got there the solider would have stopped them from doing anything else. I'm pretty sure they worked really hard to make sure that only the Jews would get killed in the gas chambers. However, I can go easy on the movie because this is not based on a true story.What I liked about the movie was how it made you think about the treatment of the Jews during WWII. I also liked how Bruno was different from the rest of the Germans during that time. He was one of the very few back then to realize that not all the Jews were terrible people. After all, if they were bad people then Bruno and Schmuel wouldn't have been friends. I felt pretty sensitive at some scenes, like with the end and when Schmuel was caught eating a cake while he was a slave in the house. I was also uncomfortable when I saw the scene when he was in the camp. I guess it's because I was sensing that Bruno was uncomfortable.I'll recommend this film to anyone who just wants to know the basics about the Holocaust. I don't think his film is historically accurate enough for school.",

My first notion before I attended cinema was I expected it to be boring. However I quickly changed my mind. Even though the actors were unknown to me I thought they were great. Throughout the movie I was quite fixated and near the end it became very intense. It was a very emotional movie and very quiet with a few wet eyes at the end. It was kind of disbelieving. The movie was about the holocaust during World War 2. It gave viewers an insight to other side of the story by way of how it might have been for the German people who had been brain washed into a certain way of thinking about the concentration camps because of manipulation by SSO propaganda. It did this through the innocent eyes of a child and how confused he felt about his friend when his father and teacher, the people he trusted talked about the evils of Jews. It demonstrated the intolerance towards the Jewish community and anyone that showed empathy towards them. However my critique is in reality things would have been much harsher in the camp and I don't believe the little boy in the camp would have ever got that close to the perimeter fence as it would have been very much guarded. I highly recommend the film.",

An intriguing look at one of the darkest chapters of human history, and by telling the tale through the eyes of the innocent and charming eight year old Bruno, they have come up with a way to give a new voice to a genre that is known for its heart breaking brutality.There is violence here as well I suppose, but it is an implied violence \u2013 violence that occurs just around the corner and out of eyeshot for Bruno. You know that it is taking place on both a personal and systemic level, but you never really witness it directly. It shows the sort of understated subtlety we've come to expect from Director Mark Herman (Brassed Off, Little Voice) who has turned in another impressive film here.Asa Butterfield is cast perfectly as Bruno, showing the right sort of charm and wide eyed innocence that allows this movie to move along at a steady pace, without becoming mired in the details of the atrocities that are occurring around him. David Thewlis (The Harry Potter Series) also deserves a mention for his outstanding portrayal as Bruno's Dad. Some movies hurt like a kick to the groin but leave you all the better for it. This is one of those movies.Full review here for those with an interest.http://cinestuff.wordpress.com",

At least that's the message I took from the film, and it would be interesting if any other folk would agree, or not. The fact that no attempt to hide the attitude from the two children was a little disturbing. Also blocking the view out of one window as it overlooked the 'camp' was also a bit of a shock.

IF YOU DO THE OPPOSITE ORDER, AS ME, YOU WILL PROBABLY BE HUGELY DISAPPOINTED. READ MY BIBLE-LENGTH REVIEW TO FIND OUT WHY.From reading a splendid and great book where you see a war and cruelty from a not knowing 9 year old boy (Bruno) that loves exploration, one would have high expectation for the movie, which was my case. I really enjoyed reading the book from Bruno's view of point, which I think was the best. I was greatly disappointed seeing the movie from the viewers view of point and not his. I partly understand why they did that. It was to save screentime, but nevertheless, that was half of the point. In order to understand Bruno's strange behavior one had to see the world from his view of point. I felt the director and movie wasn't able to deliver that. That is my greatest disappointment with the movie.It didn't only stop there. Next, they rushed the movie. Jumped over many important great details. In the book Gretel was in love with Lieutenant Kotler. She only threw her dolls once he was moved to the Eastern front. Indirectly it shown that she had grown-up from being a kid with dolls to a teen that would use her whole day to track her beloved Kotler. Contrary with the book ,the movie wasn't able to show that. From being a doll lover she spontaneously threw them away to praise Nazism out of nowhere. How did she become a brainwashed Nazi. I felt the book was able to convey her personality much better.Next, I really didn't like how they exaggerated everything and made more drama than necessary. For instance, the book ended with Shumel and Bruno holding hands, giving the reader impression that their friendship and bond couldn't be broken by any cruelty thrown to them by the Nazi's. Thus, we end up with a good aftertaste, though it had a sad end. You were satisfied because you knew that their friendship was so strong and powerful that even in death it wouldn't weakened of be diminished. This feeling was totally ruined in the movie where they focused more the cruelty of the holocaust and the drama of their family finding Bruno. In my opinion, the scene with his mother was totally unnecessary.There were more scenes I don't remember right now, but they totally ruined a great chance to visualize a great book. Real sad and missed opportunity.",

This film will test you as the irresistible plot keeps you asking for more. I was impressed by how they were able to change a book into a huge journey. The story takes place back in the Holocaust. We see a boy called Bruno running with his friends as the title credits play. He then moves into a new town at Outwith where he struggles to cope with his new home. He journeys off into the wilderness and finds a boy called Shmuel on the other side of the fence. We then see their friendship evolve immensely as they continue to see each other every day. Later on, Bruno promises Shmuel to try and find his father after Bruno had betrayed Shmuel. The following event that occurs contains dark scenery, a breath taking climax. Unfortunately, the friends die together burning. The mood in these scenes will make the emotional weep for their loss. Overall, the story is brilliant and contains a lot of twists that will test the viewer. One thing I dislike about the film is how they cut out two interesting scenes from the book. Despite being an adaption and re-written, I think that those two scenes would create more tension and effect to the performance of the film. On top of that, the quality of the film balanced out the disadvantages. The lighting is absolutely perfect and it seems to contrast in some scenes. In the camp, the lighting is dark and gloomy, and at the beginning the lighting is gold and bright. Huge differences in effects like this give variety to the film. I could compare this film to War Horse because of the drama and variety of effects. Bruno is a typical nine year old who has a good manner and a love for adventure books. He is a great character to associate with Shmuel. Speaking of Shmuel, Shmuel is an original and kind character who easily forgives and has a heart of gold. The worst character for me is Maria. Because of her missing a scene from her book, her character seems two dimensional and doesn't get as much screen time as Bruno. Also Gretel isn't as full of character as in the book. Fortunately, those are the only issues I have with the characters. In conclusion, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is phenomenal. I think that they did a great job with this movie. The plot is brilliant. The twists are unexpected and this is a breath taking experience overall. I'll give this film an 8.5/10",

This is the story of a young boy and his family who move house due to his father's promotion. Everything is seen through the eyes of the eight-year-old and we quickly empathise with his distress at leaving his friends and his grandparents behind, his boredom in his new - very restricted - environment and his confused emotions regarding his father, who appears a loving, caring man, and his job as a leading Nazi soldier. The child is initially unaware that the new friend he makes is Jewish, but their friendship proves to have unforeseen consequences.

I enjoyed watching it. Bruno, the main character was not only cute, but was played very well. At moments it seemed Bruno wanted to say something, or think something, but instead, he was portrayed with the all familiar face of childhood misunderstanding, a cold bewildered silence, and it suites the situation very well.(SPOILERS) I'm not alone when I say this, but the ending could have been better. Yes, it has been mentioned by a few that the non-graphic nature of this movie enables it to be accessible to young ones, but I still think they should have shown his father walk into the chamber to see his son, gone. His mother breaking down and screaming in anguish and pain really hit home on me, but when it showed his father, stand there, stone cold, like he's waiting for something, it just ruined the moment and made me a bit mad. Seeing him realize what his \"cause\" has done would have created such a better ending, and I would have easily cried.I love these kinds of movies, even though they make me so sad.

The story takes its time to unwind and then the ending is very intense but is suddenly very dense after all the first part of the story.

Cast choice is definitely perfect and indeed reflects the national appearance of the people. The only part I didn't enjoy was that how people didn't speak German in the movie. It's really OK for a quality audience to watch a subtitled movie, I guess and thus national differences and the realistic atmosphere is conserved. Especially German people shouldn't have a British accent, NO. It really spoils the realistic atmosphere. Other than that the tragedy of the movie, the annihilation of childhoods and a dictator's pressure on people was shown very adequately.",

It makes it all look rather false and hard to take as real people going about their business.I know the story is a fable and we have to suspend our imagination to accept the tale and it's final outcome but I would prefer as much detail and accuracy as possible where by it is part of the era and Third Reich of the time.I would guess that the story is set during the 1941 or 1942 period when gassing of Jewish people was taking place.During that period Jewish people would have already been deported or had emigrated to other neighbouring countries, that then became swallowed up by the Nazis and so they fell under the control of the murderous regime - The Third Reich. Jews in the German cities would have been non people and would have been few and far between.Deportation of Jews would have been done under cover of night or very, early in the morning so that ordinary German citizens would not have to see what was done by their government and in their name.The music played at the party in Bruno's parents home would not have been swing or jazz music. This was much frowned upon and outlawed by good Nazis.Just a couple of easy things to remedy and should have been executed a little better.",

The writer, John Boyne, was born in 1971 in Dublin. This is a confection, not just in the sense of being a wonderful piece of craft, but being sweet, or more correctly bitter sweet. But is it also a contrived confection? Much of the work on the holocaust has been important because it opens us up to new perspectives and teaches us key moral lessons.

Firstly I would have preferred that the Germans spoke German, however I can, to some extent accept this as there has been good WW2 movies where the Germans spoke English. What really breaks it for me in this film, and what keeps me from being engaged in the story is the lack of character development, the lacking sense of fear in the concentration camps and the overall indifference to what happens to the characters. The only thing that makes this film watchable is the good performances of David Thewlis and Vera Farmiga. In the end I was left with a bitter taste in the mouth of how a great plot was so purely executed and I can't help but wonder of what could have been.",

We all can read, right? This movie is even rated for older children, who can read. What's so wrong about reading?? And in the mean time you pick up a little bit of German.I truly believe that a movie with characters who portray Germans should be true to that language. Also the Jewish boy should speak his native language and not English. It even says in the book that they, at first, don't really understand each other.I have yet to see the movie, and if I still think its good regardless of the spoken language I will post this too.-----I have seen the movie yesterday and I can only add to my comment above that aside from the spoken language issue the movie still doesn't work in my opinion. Even though the story in essence could work, the many unbelievable things you see distract you too much to really get into the characters. I'm talking about (off course) fences with massive holes, a well fed-looking Jewish boy in a concentration camp and off course the 'sitting by the fence for hours unnoticed'part. In the book this works because your own imagination takes care of the pictures you see. In the movie it just totally falls apart.Good things (they also need to be mentioned): Asa Butterfield. He is absolutely brilliant! We can see what he feels, thinks and wants to do next by just looking in his eyes. Super!James Horner. The music is quite subtle for a emotional movie like this one. And that is exactly what works. I personally loved the music that played under the (SPOILER) gas chamber scene. I felt the air getting less and less and the fear getting bigger and bigger through the high sounds of the violins. Very, very well done! (SPOILER) The End. I was very happy that they didn't let the father (or anyone) find the body. That would've been horrible. I still prefer the ending of the book but I was happy about this little thing.

The movie starts in Berlin where Bruno has the essence of a child's life. He gets torn away from that by his father's job as an SS soldier. For a while he lives in solitude with his family. Bruno, the curious and adventuresome 8-year-old, would become friends with Shmuel who would change his life forever (Trying not to give the plot away).I said that this movie didn't live up to the 7.9 rating because of all the ridiculous nonsense that took place. Everyone that was in the movie had a British accent; they were supposed to be German. Many of the scenes were really stretched in order to make the movie 90 minutes (including credits). It seemed like there were minuets of people sitting at a kitchen table with awkward silence. Also, it seemed like there was no background on any character other than Bruno; both the father and mother didn't have names and there was no last name for the family. Next, everyone in the family is oblivious to Bruno's friendship. The mother doesn't question why he walks backwards with hands behind his back, the guards don't question why Shmuel consistently doesn't work, and the father doesn't question why Bruno wants to stay in an environment of solitude. It just doesn't make sense.Now, the movie wasn't all bad, just too much nonsense for me personally. -Dan (6.0 Stars)",

Her two reasons: 1.) it would have been even more terrifying in German, e.g., hearing Deutschland Uber Alles in German would have been gut wrenching and 2.) it would have for sure won an Oscar as best foreign language film!On the other hand, as several other comments have pointed out, there is so much that is conveyed in this film with hardly any words, that one can overlook the use of English. My own reaction was that I was confused at first; I thought maybe this was a British family in Germany before the war.

            "content": "I'm amazed that I can find nothing but praise for this film on this board! It was incredibly well made, yes, and up until the end I thought it was one I would really like. It was touching, effective, and seemed sweet and (as much as possible with Holocaust themes) family-themed and appropriate. But the ending was one of the most horrible I have ever seen and made it so I would never, ever recommend this film to anyone! Without giving any distinct spoilers, let me just say that we all watched in horror as the worst imaginable thing happened. And then there was nothing to justify it. If we had seen remorse on the part of the father, and been given the impression that maybe this horror touching him personally would be a life-changer and lead him to rethink what he was doing at the camp, the ending might have been somewhat justified. If we had seen a similar revelation in the sister, who was starting to associate with the Nazi ideology, that, too, would have helped.Instead, we see the mother sobbing wretchedly, completely broken -- but then, she was already horrified at what was going on and didn't need to be taught a lesson. And we see the father frantically searching for Bruno, but we have no idea of his emotions when he realizes what happened. Will he rethink his life? Or will he fit this into his existing mindset, blaming the Jews for what happened, and using it as a reason to kill more and more of them? There was no conclusion; nothing was wrapped up at the end. Viewers are left with a sense of horror, nausea and depression. There was little warning of this, as the rest of the movie was really good and the previews didn't warn of the atrocity in store. The DVD cover touts the fact that this was by the same studio as \"La Vita e Bella\" (Life is Beautiful), which is misleading to a fault, as the two cannot be compared--La Vita e Bella was tragic, too, but it ended on a hopeful note instead of total depression.So what was the point of this movie? What was the message? That the Holocaust was horrible? Yeah, I'm pretty sure we all knew that already.There's enough to be depressed about in this world right now; I don't think we need our souls completely driven into the ground. Unless you enjoy horrors or being completely depressed, I wouldn't recommend \"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\" to anyone!",

I found it shocking when Bruno lies about giving shmuel the food. Then I thought about it,and I'm reasonably sure I would do the same. I also found the propaganda about what the labour camps were interesting. Lastly I thought that this movie was very suspenseful but definitely not a pleasure film.

Not in the way of killing people by stuffing em in a gas-chamber, but the way most chickens find their way to our plate isn't much different. And the way Nazis thought of creating a better world isn't so much different than we do when spreading democracy and Christianity around the globe.Of course this is a terrible comparison, but just think about it for a minute or two. Freedom lies in the ability to choose, not within the power of a majority over a minority, which in principle is the same thing as what they did with the Jews. Thats also why i think it was a good idea to have all English speaking actors. It could have been us, it could have been you and me, instead of the Germans. We're no better when push comes to shove. Most of us would have probably done the same thing, for our nation, for our believes, or whatever bullshit reason we can conjure up.Lets hope that one day we'll understand the true nature of unconditional love.Namaste.",

It is a film, just, but the story is spread very thinly to make it go the distance, which in my opinion it doesn't, quite, even though it's listed as 94 minutes. The acting and photography are excellent of course, as one would expect of a BBC collaboration, and the settings, limited though they are, appear accurate, but the prison camp and numbers of extras, both soldiers and prisoners, are way too small in size and few in number for such a project. In many ways this film reminds me of a stage play adapted for the screen; it's just so 'pocket sized'? I suppose worst of all is that I can say it wasn't entertaining, or that I'm unlikely to want to watch it again, but that has more to do with what it says rather than anything qualitative. And in truth I believe we have been bombarded with this same moralistic tale since the 1950's. And really I am wondering why, given the all too common occurrence with which this subject, in one guise or another, pock marks human history. And especially given that extermination, by one method or another, is still happening all around us today?",

As we grow old, all is forgotten as we make perceptions and stop asking questions. There is no point in arguing the historical accuracy of the film because that is not the point. As a film, it is brilliantly directed and acted. It touches an extremely sensitive issue and by the end of it something in you will implode. A real life changing film.

            "content": "Director Mark Herman was clearly off his game with the release of \"The Boy In The Striped Pajamas\". After falling in love with the amazing novel by John Bayne, we were awaiting the chance to see this masterpiece come to life on the big screen, but to our surprise the brutality, emotion and realism of the novel and the Holocaust were forgotten in the making of this production.Starting out on to the poorly re-created concentration camp, Bruno(Asa Butterfield) played an ignorant 8 year old looking for a new friend. He stumbled upon Shmuel(Jack Scanlon) a young Jewish boy separated by the Nazi soldiers. Throughout the film, their \"friendship\" seems to grow, while Bruno remains completely oblivious to the tragic events taking place around him. As the story deepens, the action was minimal, and the whole story seemed built up around Bruno's boredom, and his mother's(Vera Famiga) fight to go back home with Bruno and his sister Gretel(Amber Beathe).Only to add to the disappointment of this movie, certain characters were poorly cast (Germans with English accent). Bruno's supposed terrifying father/commandant(David Thewlis) was nothing more than your average caring father. one would presume, and the novel certainly portrays that a Nazi commandant would be far more intimidating and aggressive. On the other hand, the cast was well chosen when they decided to portray Bruno's mother. Ther emotion and despair during this movie, especially when she learns of the purpose of the camp, was a breath of fresh air compared to others. Lieutement Kotler(Rupert Friend) and the poor Jewish cook Pavel(David Hayman) definitely brought a new feeling to the movie especially in the dinner scene.For such an intriguing storyline, the movie could have been made into a much more interesting experience for the general movie viewer. For a PG-13 movie, it was locking the details behind the Holocaust and the pain and suffering that the Jewish prisoners went through. All the elements from the novel that created such an amazing story were left in the pages of the book and not portrayed on screen. The setting, which was supposed to resemble a gruesome concentration camp similar to Aushwitz, was nothing more than your typical farm, which leaves the viewer emotionless to the realities of the Holocaust. Apart from the setting being poorly constructed, the bond between Bruno and Shmuel was looking almost entirely as the two boys were rarely seen together, which again disappoints the audience and disconnects them from the impact the film intended to create.Over all, 3 stars is the most we could give this film. The lack of emotions, gruesome details, the terrible setting, and rather disappointing acting, combine to make this film quite dull and unappealing. Potentially, audience members who have not had the privilege of reading John Bayne's novel, may enjoy the film. However, the farm like setting and unmoving character development is enough to even detract these viewers. The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas was better left on pages.",

This is like a historical film that takes you back to the time when the holocaust took place the whole plot is set around that time but it's not any typically historical film that's going to bore you.Bruno is the main character in this movie he's 9 yrs. old growing up during world war 2 in Berlin, his family then gets relocated to a place where he thinks its named \"out-with\" but it's truly Auschwitz were his father is in charge of that prison camp. You're going to fall in love with Bruno he's such an innocent little boy he doesn't know of any harm in the world he thinks everyone has the great life he does. As time goes by Bruno gets bored of being in his house because he is not permitted to leave under any circumstances but he gets curious of why he can't play with the children he sees outside his window in \"out-with\" all wearing the same striped pajamas he then realizes that there's men of all ages wearing the same pajamas. One day Bruno sneaks out to \"out-with\" were he finds a little boy his age named Shmuel they become friends but he wonders why the little boy with the pajamas can't go out of the fence. A year passes by and Bruno ends up getting lice that was the end for his mother she can't take being in that place anymore and so decides to leave. Before leaving Bruno and his friend decide to have a last exploration day.The last exploration day for Bruno and his friend Shmuel is the best part of the movie I would say it's the most shocking part so that's why I'm not going to say what happens in this part because I really recommend for you to watch this movie, you should go rent it it's going to be worth it.",

            "content": "\"Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights, before the dark hour of reason grows.\" -John Betjeman.Based off the bestselling novel by John Boyne, \"The Boy in The Striped Pajamas\" takes place in Germany during the horrifying times of World War II. We're introduced to the film with a clever quote (seen above) from the English poet John Betjeman; one that roots itself well with the perspective of the movie's lead character, Bruno. The story centers around Bruno (Asa Butterfield), his mother Elsa (Vera Farmiga) and eldest sister Gretel (Amber Beattie) who have recently relocated to the countryside of Berlin due to his father, who stays nameless (David Thewlis), gaining a hefty promotion within the ranks of the SS. Almost from the get-go we learn that Father's promotion is that of leading officer to a nearby, small scale, concentration camp. Bruno manages to sneak off periodically to visit a young boy named Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), eventually befriending him.Let's get some of the really negative points out of the way first. Something that bothered me from the very beginning is that the film's entirely based in Germany but all the actors are British and do nothing to hide their accents. To some it may be a minute detail but if you're trying to become emotionally involved with the story and characters it's very difficult when you keep hearing English accents, yet your brain is consistently reminded \"This is based in Germany. This is based in Germany.\" Another film that became heavily burdened with this break in consistency is \"Valkyrie\". Time and time again it's shown that if you're going to have your movie based in a country where there are distinct accents or languages, you need to have your actors imitate those traits.Alongside the lack of consistency with the character's accents there's also a lack of consistency with the character development. The writing isn't terrible by a long shot but it doesn't get you as involved emotionally as you should, considering the topic of the movie. I understood what the director was going for; trying to get the audience to see the film in the way that Bruno saw every day life, through the eyes of a child and without reason being a form of bias. The issue here is the movie almost seems to take this a step too far and decides to completely tear away any sort of in-depth character development. It's like they want you to view it in the way that Bruno would but at the same time there's all these other adult themed, unfinished side stories that start popping up and things just get a bit bouncy.It's quite obvious throughout the film that the creators wanted you to care heavily for these characters and what happened to them but the flow of attention between each character became so wishy-washy that you didn't really feel connected to anyone. I have to say that while watching the entire film I really did feel like they were banking on the audience taking their already instilled emotions of the Holocaust and connecting them with the film as to avoid any emotional development. It's a tactic that doesn't sit right with me. You cannot take a well known, tragic event and simply use past knowledge of the tragedy to bubble up emotions. The story needs to be told as though nobody knew such a tragedy was a part of history.Overall I struggled a lot with this movie because one of the aspects that I really enjoyed also heavily weighed down the storytelling. I'm referring to the unique way of the movie trying to emotionally capture a film through the eyes of a child. The film itself can also be beautiful to watch at times. It's well scored and there's some really attractive cinematography that highlights the beauty of Berlin, regardless of the sad note the movie plays on. At the same time nothing really jumps out and grabs a hold of you at any point. The acting isn't anything to get ecstatic over, though I did really enjoy the performance from Vera Farmiga's character. Something just felt like it was missing from beginning to finish. Even the extremely devastating ending didn't warrant a single tear from me because the ride up until this point was emotionally bland. It's one of those films that I watch and become convinced that the only reason there's any serious hype over it is due to fans of the book or because it's a Holocaust movie and that gains a lot of sympathy points. I don't hate it but I don't love it either. It's worth a Netflix rental but nothing more.",

It should be removed from Netflix so that young kids(like I was when I saw this the first time) don't watch it with out their parents permission. Parents should definitely watch this movie before showing it to children under the age of 12 or 13. It is extremely scarring, depressing, and disturbing. Although it does give us a good idea of what the world was like during the time of the Holocaust. If you don't know very much about the Holocaust, then this movie will make no sense as it does not give or explain fine details. Overall, I would recommend this movie to people studying the Holocaust, but otherwise keep younger children away.",

I've seen reviews saying sympathy towards the Germans, but if you watch it from the 8 year olds view point, you see his actions are that of an 8 year old boy- by his actions and/or words, speak volumes even if his words don't. Very well done movie and a different angle than most of this tragic time in history.",

            "content": "Don't waste your time with this movie. If you want to see a good movie about the Holocaust, watch Schindler's List. If you want to watch something for any other reason, pick just about anything else.The DVD box cover blurb speaks of an inspiring movie about hope. Whoever came up with that never watched the movie. So to spare readers from a wasted hour and a half, here is the plot, if you simply must know.Boy #1's SS Nazi father is assigned to run a death camp in Germany during WWII. We know his father is evil because he smokes and never hugs anyone. Boy #1 is bored with his new house and his new tutor (whose curriculum consists entirely of 'Thou shalt hate Jews') and wanders off until he finds Boy #2 sitting inside the 'farm' fence. They manage to strike up a friendship without detection despite the Nazi guards that are omnipresent in the rest of the camp and around the commandant's house. Likewise, Boy #1's mother can't keep tabs on her son despite having zero social life or responsibilities. (Just why she doesn't run screaming off into the blue from boredom by the end of the movie is beyond me).Boy #1 generally eats or loses the food that Boy #2 keeps asking him to bring, but Boy #2 is pretty hard up for friends so they hang out together anyway (as well as they can with an electric barbed wire fence between them). Pathetically naive dialogue is supposed to endear viewers. It doesn't.Boy #2 is brought to the commandants' house to help prepare for a party, whereupon Boy #1 urges him to stuff his face with the goodies set out. When the Handsome Young Nazi officer catches them, Boy #2 bravely wimps out and says he doesn't know Boy #1 and had just walked in on the scene himself. (Handsome Young Nazi is soon shipped off to the Russian front for not telling anyone his father left for Switzerland four years ago. This, along with Boy #1's mother crying and carrying on when she discovers why those chimneys on the horizon stink so bad, helps show how _stressful_ it is being a Nazi flunkie.) Boy #2 survives his beating and nods when Boy #1 mumbles an empty 'sorry' afterwards. If you're looking for the hope and inspiration at this point, well, so am I. Boy #2 subsequently reports his father is missing (RIP, clueless kiddies), but Boy #1 has bigger news: his mother is taking him away to live elsewhere. He doesn't want to go (playing checkers with Boy #2 being such a thrill and all), so he grabs a shovel and digs his way under the death camp fence to help Boy #1 find his dad. In broad daylight.Boy #1 and Boy #2 wander the death camp until they enter Boy #2's lodging just in time to be rounded up for the gas chambers. Meanwhile Boy #1's family is turning the house inside out looking for him, eventually following his trail to the fence. Too late. Nazi father screams, mother hears and cries. The end.Did you miss the hope and inspiration? I did too. This was an atheistic movie without a point. About the closest thing to a spiritual angle is when Boy #1's sister says a prayer on the train ride from Berlin and mother smiles. But that empty expression of Christian faith is painlessly and easily replaced by her energetic embrace of Nazi propaganda from the new tutor (complete with bedroom walls adorned with SS posters). The Bible says \"faith without works\" is dead, and that is accurately reflected in this movie. No one (including the collaborating Jewish inmates) lifts a finger to oppose the Nazi agenda, unless you count Mom's wailing \"I don't wanna live here anymore\" when she learns why the 'farm' smoke smells funny.The Bible warns us to be grounded in our faith and not be blown about by every wind of doctrine. Confidence in his salvation and the rewards of Heaven gave Romanian pastor Richard Wurmbrand the courage and motivation to share the Gospel and demonstrate love to Nazi and Communist persecutors through years of hellish imprisonment and torture. The example of Wurmbrand and others like him stands in marked contrast to the futile gestures of movies like this one, which offer no reason why a person ought to be good or courageous or hopeful. Let's hope and pray the producers of this movie find real hope and inspiration in Jesus Christ.",

I understand the point that they were trying to make about how immune the Nazi's became to killing the Jews and how when the commander's son escaped and was gassed, no one noticed. In a Holocaust movie, it is important to touch on a few things: the point of view from the Jews, why Nazi's hated them, and times when Jews received outside help from others. I mostly just got a gist of Nazi's and the life of high ranking Nazi commandant.The two best movies about the Holocaust that I have seen are \"Schindler's List\" and \"Defiance\".",

However, the acting by all is excellent and the ending is as you would expect awfully awfully sad.On reflection though I can understand why this film has upset a few people here. I think we the audience are so devastated by the ending because of the death of Bruno as we see him as an innocent, which of course he is but the way the story is edited it forgets to portray and mention that everybody in the whole camp is innocent. So you're feeling sorrow for the German boy but not really any emotion for all the other Jews getting killed along with him, if that makes any sense.

I won't go into too much detail about the plot because the its a pretty decent plot. My main gripe with this film is the weakness of the main character, Bruno.He starts of like an young, privileged boy would in a movie; annoying, prissy, and completely oblivious to what's going on around him. He reminded me of Jamie from Empire of the sun, another young boy whose life is being affected by WWII. Only with Jamie, you learn to like and respect him as he changes throughout film. He's a very dynamic character. Bruno, on the other hand is a very static character. His personality and attitude remain the same throughout the film, even when he sees what is happening to the Jews. Every scene that Bruno is in you are just waiting for him to stop talking because where he very boring, the rest of the family is pretty interesting. In fact, I felt the relationship between the mother and father was the most captivating, even if it is only a sub plot. And the sister is cool too in the limited screen time she gets.And finally the actual boy in the striped pajamas. His name is Shmaul and he develops a relationship with Bruno and is the only friend Bruno has. Bruno brings brings him food and the play chess together. I only wish that the story had been about Shmaul. He has real problems and understands the gravity of his situation. Shmaul and Bruno's mother are the characters you feel you grow with. They are characters you care about but Bruno is the one on screen the whole time. If you're looking for a WWII story told through a child's eyes, watch Empire of the Sun. Christian Bale and John Malkovich are great in it. Anyway, if you don't want the movie to be spoiled then stop reading now. Spoiler Alert. First, how is he able to tunnel under fence; if an eight year old boy can do it with a shovel than I than a few grown men can do it with their hands. And that must be the least secure camp the Germans had if people are able to sneak IN to it. Lastly, and this may sound mean but I didn't really feel bad for Bruno in the end, I felt bad for all the Jews, I felt bad for Bruno's family, but not for Bruno. I only hope that at some point before he died that Bruno understood the true nature of the camps and what his father had been doing.",

They are either good, or they're bad. They are either capable of cognitive thought, or they're not.The truth is, what happened during and before the 2nd World War, were due to the actions of ordinary people against other ordinary people. That is perhaps the most frightening aspect of it all, and this movie completely fails in communicating just that. Which of course is all fine and dandy in your average action movie, but in a drama movie one would expect a bit more substance.",

It is a product of fiction and not historically accurate, it is totally unrealistic considering actual facts. This is what bothers me, I don't think that the holocaust is a topic to make fiction about. It is dangerous to change the actual history to a more entertaining one, it can be easily misunderstood. For people that don't have the historical correct knowledge, the movie will create a wrong perspective. I know that the movie doesn't claim to be factual but it still wants to show a typical family of nazi society and takes the holocaust as topic. In my opinion it is morally negligent to use this part of history and create another fictional version of it for entertainment reasons.",

What the father does not know; his son, Bruno, can see the concentration camp Auschwitz. Bruno doesn't know what it is, so he just thinks that it must be a farm, and the people working there are farmers. Because Bruno had to leave behind his friends in Berlin, he was sad and started looking around for other kids to play with. His mother knows that somewhere around the house, there is a pathway leading to the camp, but she think it must be further away. \nEven though his mother does not allow him to \"explore\", what he loves to do, of course he sooner or later finds the pathway that starts in the backyard of the house. He starts to get curious as he sees one of the inmates working in his house as kitchen staff while peeling potatoes. He does not understand why he is wearing pyjamas, and thats where he starts asking questions. His parents don't really know how to explain to him what is happening. \nOverall, good movie, okay-ish represetation, and the seriousness of the movie is pretty average for a WW2 movie.",

Another aspect of the movie that was pretty good is that you see the moral conflict with this topic, for example the mother realizes what is going on in the concentration camp and says she doesn't want to be part of this.\nAlso the end is a great scene because the dad and the whole family realize on their own son what is happening in the concentration camps.\nI would totally recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 12!",

His dad is a German soldier that leads a concentration camp, Bruno meets a boy named Schmuel that is a prisoner in the concentration camp and the same age as Bruno, 8. Bruno visits Schmuel as often as he can until one day he snuck under the gate and he was mistaken for a jew and that was the day all the jews were put in the gas chamber.\n\nI recommend the book over the movie because the book has a lot more detail and events than the movie. I usually like the movie better but in this case i actually like the book better. It has a lot more meaning to me than the movie did. The movie did not include some detail that I thought was important, like how Bruno got his head shaved in the book but not in the movie.\n\nBruno looked a lot like what he was described in the book that he had short brown slicked back hair and he did in the movie. He was described as brave, curious. Bruno kept those traits in the movie. When he climbed under the fence to see Schmuel that was a brave act. \n\nA part of the movie that wasn't in the book was the ending. The ending in the book is where Bruno is lost and cannot be found and that's the day he went to go see Schmuel and climbed under the fence and it doesn't play out further than that. In the movie Schmuel brings Bruno clothes and Bruno brings Schmuel a sandwich but loses it on the way over to the camp. Bruno crawls under the fence and puts on the camp clothes, and after all the jews, including bruno died in the gas chamber his dad proceeds to look for him and demands all the guards to search for bruno, eventually Bruno's mom found his clothes that he swapped for the camp clothes next to the fence. Bruno's dad got the word that all the jews were put in the gas chamber and Bruno was one of them\n\nOne of the parts that were not in the book was when his dad shaved Bruno's head the day before he went to go see Schmuel and climb under the fence. In the movie Schmuel gave Bruno a hat to wear so the guards cannot tell that Bruno didn't have a shaved head.\n\nWith that detail missing from the movie it spiked my interest in the book because I think that was a good detail that they didn't add to the movie.\nI think that that detail didn't really affect the story line, it just made one of the lines more disappointing than I thought.\n\nFor this reason I recommend the book, only because I think the book had greater detail than the movie because the movie did not substantially change or substitute any scenes they took out of the movie. So because of that I recommend the book.\n\nIn conclusion I recommend you should read the book before the movie but still watch the movie.",

The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is about a boy named Bruno growing up in World War 2. Bruno's family must move considering his dad got a new job. His family left Berlin and moved to the \"Out-With,\" what the Nazi's called Auschwitz, for his father's new job. I recommend the book over the movie. The book has a lot of detail, and it helps give you an understanding of what happened In Auschwitz.  \n\nWhen reading the book, I imagined the main character (Bruno) looking like a small white kid, with black hair and my imagination was remarkably like how Bruno was cast in the movie. In the book, Bruno follows the rules because he knows his dad would be mad if he does not, but he has a friendly, compassionate side to him that can sometimes lead him to trouble. \"Well, you're probably not allowed to come here and talk to me every day either,\" said Shmuel. \"But you still do it, don't you?\" \"But if I was caught, I'd be in trouble,\" said Bruno, who was sure if Mother and Father would not approve. The book is better than the movie.  \n\nIn the book, Bruno will not leave his mother alone when Bruno finds out they must move to the \"Out-With.\" In the book, Bruno is constantly asking his mother questions about the move. Bruno's mother is getting upset at him. The movie, the night before the family moved, Bruno's father threw a party for his new promotion, in the book, it does not say that. It did not increase my understanding, but more enjoyment of the movie. It affected the story line by adding a whole different part in the movie than the book. For this reason, I recommend the book.  \n\nThe part that was left out in the book that was in the movie was when Bruno scraped his knee, Pavel, and Bruno had an extended conversation until his mother arrived and he was peeling carrots after helping Bruno with his injury. The movie did not show any of that. This did not give me a better understanding at all. It affected the story lines by showing something else that did not happen. For this reason, I prefer the book considering the book has a lot of descriptions in it, rather than a movie. As you read this book, you can imagine it in your head. \n\nTo end off my writing about The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, the book has more to it than the movie, and it helps you think about what had happened in the past. The book makes you feel different emotions. I recommend the book than the movie.",

The story starts off with a boy named Bruno that must move with his family close to a concentration camp, but he doesn't quite understand what's going on with the people in striped pajamas. I recommend the book over the movie. \n\nBruno is portrayed as small for his age and doesn't like when people belittle him but overall, he is innocent and kind of ignorant because he didn't want to stop hanging out with Shmuel which ultimately gets him killed. Bruno kind of looks how I thought he would with his brown hair n everything, but I would have thought he would be a little smaller. In the book, the parents never really find out where Bruno went except by him walking around the fence one day and finding a spot in the fence where the wire could be lifted but, in the movie, the dad finds out where Bruno went rather quickly and realizes it's too late. This explains why I like the book better because it kind of leaves you rather abrupt and a kind of mystery to the parents rather than them knowing what happened to him at the end of the movie. \n\nA part of the movie that was not in the book was at the beginning of the movie when Bruno's parents throw an exciting party at their home in Berlin to celebrate Bruno's father's promotion. Which in the book Bruno comes home to see that his maid is packing his things and he kind of gets mad and his mom tells him that they must pack and move immediately, and he wonders if he has done something bad. When they changed it to the party it's kind of didn't give me that much understanding of what was going on. This change didn't really affect the storyline but did affect it when the family met the fury and had dinner with him. For this reason, I would recommend the book over the movie. \n\nA part of the book that wasn't in the movie was when Bruno could lift the wire from the ground because it was not secured properly in that part of the fence. In the movie, Bruno couldn't touch the fence because it was electrified, and he had to dig a hole under it to get out. It made me understand it more because it made more sense to have an electric fence because if it wasn't it probably would have been easier to get in and out. I feel like it affected the storyline because it made Bruno leave a trail of how he got in because of the shower he brought. I would still recommend the book because it leaves kind of a mystery for the family to find out what happened to him. \n\nOverall, I believe that the reader should read the book first and then watch the movie because the book is more explanatory about Bruno's thoughts than it is in the movie.",

Therefore, I recommend the book over the movie as it has more development toward the storyline and the history of World War II. \n\nAs I read the book, I thought Bruno would look shaggy with shorter hair and greenish eyes. In the movie, Bruno's is sophisticated with hair that is flicked to the side, but in the book, he has a shaved head as he has head lice. This proves that the book pays more attention to detail and characteristics.   \n\nBoth the movie and the book have differences. In the film, Bruno takes a shovel and digs a hole to get under the fence, but in the book, he takes a ladder and climbs over the wall. It never changed my perspective of the story; I still enjoyed it. For this reason, I recommend the book over the movie as it gives more storyline, unlike the film, which leaves many things out.   \n\nAs in the book, Bruno's father shaves his head as he gets lice, but in the movie, they never add that dialog or the change in design. It affected the storyline in how when he got his head shaved, he just got the pajamas from Shmuel, but in the movie, he had to put on a hat to cover his hair; then, the director made the movie longer.

They say that Bruno is unrealistic because every German child would have had hatred for Jews taught to them. Sure, many German children were indoctrinated with hatred for Jews - this movie *shows* that. The whole point is that Bruno is *skeptical* of that (while his sister, by contrast, swallows the indoctrination, at least initially). The whole point of the movie is that our common humanity transcends nonsensical sectarian hatred, and this is often recognized best by children who have not accepted the status quo of their surroundings. The point of the ending is ironic justice - Bruno's father, in a sense, kills his own son through his willing participation in the holocaust. If you think the message of this movie is \"Oh no we need to have pity for the poor innocent Germans during the holocaust\", you're an idiot with zero sense of irony and this movie is over your head. Also, people complain that Shmuel is unrealistic because the Nazis killed most children and there was no guard by the fence where the boys talked. Well, it's a fictional story, it's not a documentary that tells you how things normally occurred. Like a lot of movies, it's interesting precisely because it tells the story (real or fictional) of an *exceptional* or unique case which, by its unique nature, can teach us something. This is elementary stuff for how storytelling works. This is a very well done movie which shows the complexities of human interactions, and it communicates some very important lessons assuming you have an IQ above room temperature.",

Herman has made a simple Holocaust film, one that doesn't restate the obvious details about the horrors in those camps we know so well. Herman doesn't bother with German accents for his actors, or even the real thing. The Nazi family speaks with posh British accents, highlighting their class and how it affects their role in Nazi Germany. As the young boy Bruno, Asa Butterfield has the right blend of wonder, cleverness, and innocence. Vera Farmiga is stunning as the mother, letting us see the gears turn in her eyes. It's not a true story, but this emotional drama will take you on a wrenching journey into history's worst genocide from a new angle. Terrific",

The strongest aspect was the dialogue between Bruno and Schmuel, but other than that every other character is annoying, horrific and underdeveloped.

            "content": "*SPOILER ALERT* WOW! Let me start by saying that this is one of those films where you only watch once. If you're looking for a film that'll leave you siding with the enemy yet disagreeing with them at the same time then watch this! Now I say siding yet disagreeing by hating the German family for what they allowed but siding with innocent Bruno, the son of the family who sees equality in all Jewish citizens. The film narrates the life of a German family that which the father, is a Nazi. The entire family seems a bit detached. The bonds between this family seems to lack love. Every character seems to be help captive of something; The mother is a housewife, the children are caged in, and the father is restricted since he's a Nazi. Clothing wise, every character is seen to wear specific outfits that match their personality. Since Bruno is a child he's always seen with suspenders and shorts, the mother and daughter in dresses and the father in his normal Nazi uniform. Sound played a huge par in this film as well. Throughout the film, lively music is played to express Bruno's innocence. Fast forward to the ending, the sound of the thunder and the dark clouds emphasizes reality in Germany. During the last scene, Bruno's eager personality puts him in danger. He wants nothing but to help his Jewish friend Shmuel not knowing that they are about to die. Them not knowing that they'll die shows their innocence. As kids, you don't think of the worst. Bruno was only trying to help his friend but was killed by his father and the rest of the Nazis. The last scene leaves you not only heartbroken but angry. The father put his family at risk for an awful racist group. Personally, I hated the last scene. With the dark clouds, loud fearful Jews, and innocent children, it was unfair to watch. The ending was no better. It left me wondering why they couldn't show the father mourning for his own actions. The film cut of immediately after Bruno died, which gives the audience suspense. All together, this was an amazing yet traumatic film to watch, hence why I said you only watch it once.",

In this way it is evident that premise that says that every war is absurd where victims fall from all sides.",

Asa Butterfield  as the main character is likeable and does a very good job of showing us the world from the eyes of a child.

Jack Scanlon was so amazing in playing the role of Shmuel, you can feel the chemistry between the two young actors which I think what made the movie so great, David Thewlis as Commander Ralf and Rupert Friend as Lieutenant Kotler were so amazing they both gave us these dirty and evil characters that you will hate after watching the movie, and Finally, Vera Farmiga as Elsa who I felt like in some scenes she was trying so hard to just fit into that character but could not, the only scene I liked was when she was fighting with her husband Commander Ralf, but other than that her facial expressions and acting were not that great.\n\nThe music score was not a problem at all, it added a great touch to a few scenes and it even made some scenes more emotional.\n\nThe movie showed us what life was during \"The Holocaust\" in such a genuine, dramatic, and emotional way because \"The Holocaust\" is a difficult subject for sure that many people suffered during it.\nHighly recommend this emotional / sad movie that will touch your heart and will leave you in tears after watching it.\n\nMy rating is 7/10\n\n(*For more movie / tv show reviews check out my Instagram page @Serious.Cinema)",

And its structure of having the climax as its ending leaves everyone a bitter taste until they sleep. Most find it as punch that makes it remarkable,  however for me, it's quite pleasant for a short story but not good enough for a film. Perhaps the book might have been better,  giving more context in the aftermath. I'll know once I read the book.

            "content": "\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" is a heavy film to take in but one that I definitely recommend experiencing. Like other movies about the Holocaust, this movie is very heartbreaking at times but the approach it takes is unique. This horrific time in history is shown from the viewpoint of an innocent child and that makes it even harder to watch at times. The movie can feel a bit slow paced at times but the story kept my interest throughout. The final moments of the movie were very emotional and I think the statement the movie tries to make is heard loud and clear. Overall, this is a very powerful movie about compassion and friendship that is tough to watch, but tougher to forget.",

            "content": "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is the best of a few films that describe events of the Second World War telling us a little, but beautiful story based on the book called with the same name. Released in 2007, it stars Asa Butterfield as a young german boy and the english Jack Scanlon as a Jew child trapped in concentration camps. This drama/fiction movie filmed on the lovely landscapes of Budapest will surprise you apart from showing you the hard reality of the Jews at that time and will fill you with joy and passion for the feelings of friendship of children.\n\nAbout the actors and actresses, that play a fundamental role in this drama, are: Asa Butterfield as Bruno, he started his career at the young age of seven years, he participated also in interesting series like \"Merlin\" and memorables movies like \"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\" and \"The Ender Game\"; we can't forgot the incredible and satisfied paper of David Thewlis as Ralph, who act many times in the amazing Harry Potter's movies; in the other hand is Jack Scanlon as Shmuel, who start in action at the age of 9 in his first movie Peter Serafinowicz and finally is Vera Farmiga as Elsa, who played very important roles in movies like Dust and Down to the Bone that allow her to get the prize for best actress in 2007 on the Sundance Film Festival, also she participated in horror films like The Conjuring and its sequel. All of them, give a good performance, but the one that did his best was David Thewlis, he play correctly his paper, using the specific and the same characteristics of a commander in this time, serious, reserved, concentrated and responsible man.\n\nThis film was about Bruno, a young german guy; and his family that have to move to another house outside Berlin because Bruno's father job, so they have to say goodbye to all the things they started on this city. When, they arrived to their new house, Bruno didn't have anything to do, so he decides to explore a concentration camp in which all the jews are locked. There he made a friend called Shmuel and he plays with him any time he can. After some days Shmuel tell him that he doesn't find his father, so Bruno decides to help Shmuel and he enters to the concentration camp. This story ends with a very unexpected final, in which you will appreciate the true value of a good friendship. In my opinion it is a very interesting film, with a memorable story that invite you to reflect about how bad the Germans did at that time. Also it's represented very similar to the time in which it is set, so you feel that you are in this part of the world's history.\n\nSome aspects of the movie that are important to mention are the following ones: the scenography, in which I could see many beautiful landscapes and many things of the time like cars, telephones, clothes, houses and posters that make me feel inside the drama of this film; other good point was the soundtrack that perfectly accompanies each scene of this great movie and finally the special effects that were good for the time when the movie premiered, but they could improve. The best scenes of this film for me were two, in the first one Bruno was putting some food in his bag, when suddenly his mom appeared and asked what he's doing, at this moment it seems that she had already discovered, but Bruno, very clever, manages to save himself using a good excuse. And in the second one Bruno and Shmuel were playing with the ball, passing it from one side of the wall to the other, show us the friendly relationship that they have no matter which are their religions. The solidarity, brotherhood, empathy and being fair (human rights belong to everyone) are some of the emotional effects that produce this film on you because it shows how jews were treated at that time, all the things they mention about them, until the point of not considering them people, they followed the wrong way and this movie reminds it to us, to not make the same mistakes. \n\nI think many people will see this film because of its huge emotional value and its interesting history. About the fans of this film they feel very satisfied, even nowadays is not one of the best films, it makes you reflect and watch how were many things in that time. This I give this film a 4 out of 5 stars. \nBy: Jose Karlo A.",

            "content": "The Boy In the Striped Pajamas Movie Review\n\nThe Boy In the Striped Pajamas is a movie about a young boy who is oblivious to the horrible things that are going on right outside his home. The young boy makes friends with another boy that is inside of a concentration camp. The boy doesn't know that this boy is a Jew and he doesn't know what was happening to the Jewish people right outside his house. Some may think that The Boy In the Striped Pajamas does not accurately represent the Holocaust; however, this paper will assert that the movie is an accurate representation of the events and emotions that occured in the Holocaust. The movie shows how we are not born with hate in our heart. Through an analysis of concentration camps, the Germans, and the Jewish people, this paper will show how although the events in this movie are fictional, they show the true emotions and represent the actions of the Holocaust.\nIn the movie the concentration camps are portrayed using pathos. All the same emotions that were in the movie were the truest emotions of those that were in the concentration camps. In the movie it says,\"Sitting around miserable all day won't make you any happier.\" This quote shows that although they were in a horrible situation, they made the most of what they had. The people in the camps did nothing to deserve the treatment they got. A little boy in the camp becomes friends with the son of one of the men doing this to the Nazis. They young boys feel love towards each other because to them they were the same. This supports the pathos because the emotion they feel of love towards each other shows that they were not born with hate. This connects to the thesis statement because the young people in the holocaust did not understand because they weren't able to comprehend that someone could hate them so much to do this to them. \nThe movie portrays the negative and hateful emotions that the Nazi Germans showed to the Jews. The Nazi Germans were taught to absolutely hate the Jews and they were taught that they were not human and therefore didn't deserve to live. In the movie, Shmuel says, \" The soldiers. They took all our clothes away.\" Shmuel is the little boy who is in the concentration camp because he is Jewish and in this quote he is talking to his friend that lives near the camp, his name is Bruno and they talk through the fence. This quote shows that the Nazis took everything from the Jews and this is what happened in real life. It supports the thesis because this is an accurate event that happened. The Nazis didn't care about the Jews so they took everything from them, including their clothes.\nAnother thing that is accurately represented in the movie is the things that the Jewish people had to go through and their feeling. In the movie Bruno is the son of a man that runs the camps. Bruno is questioning who the people in the camps are and his father said, \"Those people... well, they're not people at all, Bruno.\" This is exactly how the Jews were treated, like they were not human at all. The Jews in the movie are portrayed exactly how it was in real events. The movie is so sad and uses patos because the emotion and sadness that you feel helps you gain sympathy for those who had to experience this. The Jewish people did nothing to deserve this and yet they had to go through it. This supports the thesis because the events are portrayed with the same emotions as the real life events.\nAlthough many argue that you have to be in the moment to understand the feelings that are felt, the movie uses the perspective of the people that were that and use their feelings. In the movie it says,\"Don't make it worse by thinking it's more painful than it actually is.\" The jews in the concentration camps were in a lot of pain and the movie shows that. Although it is a fictional movie, The Boy In The Striped Pajamas helps you understand the emotions of those that had to go through the Holocaust. You can understand partially understand the emotions by watching the movie.\nThe movie The Boy In the Striped Pajamas portrays accurate emotions and events of the Holocaust by correctly portraying the concentration camps, the Germans, and the Jewish people. The analysis of these topics support the thesis because in the movie they are the true emotional and eventful representation of the Holocaust. The movie teaches us that we are born to love but throughout growing up we are taught hate. Some think that that emotions can be understood unless you are truly at the event, but the emotions in this movie are those of the ones who were there. The Boy In The Striped Pajamas fulfills its purpose of informing us of the horrible and tender moments of the holocaust through pathos. \n\f\nAnnotated Bibliography: The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\nBrooks, Xan. \"Film review: The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas.\" The Guardian, Guardian News        \nand Media, 12 Sept. 2008, www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/12/drama.family.\nThe authors general stance towards the movie is positive because he talks about how it treads a fine line that the fate hangs in the balance until the end. His opinion is that it shows accurately how the events of the holocaust took place. He likes how it keeps you guessing until the end and goes the least expected way. The new insight to the movie is that it is a kind if dark reimagining of the secret garden, and the events of the holocaust. And what was truly happening in Germany during World War II. His review is using ethos to portray the movie, he talks about the ethics. It is a secondary source because it is a review from someone that saw the movie. The strengths of the source are in his opinion of how it treads the fine line of fate. The weakness of his review is the length of it, because it is a short review.\nEbert, Roger. \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas Movie Review (2008) | Roger Ebert.\" \nRogerEbert.com, 5 Nov. 2008, \nwww.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-boy-in-the-striped-pajamas-2008.\nThe authors general stance towards the movie is positive, because they talk about the powerful impact that the movie has because of the story being told through an eight year old's eyes and not an adult. This gives a new light to the events of the Holocaust because its not through the perspective of an adult, but a child. This review uses logos because it gives a lot of logical reasons why telling through a child's eyes can change what people think about certain events. The strength of this review is the powerful word choice and impact that it has. The weakness is that the article doesn't give much detail into other parts of the movie.\nHerman, Mark. \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas (The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas).\" The Boy in \nthe Striped Pajamas (The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas) (2008) - Rotten Tomatoes, 8 Jan. \n2018, www.rottentomatoes.com/m/boy_in_the_striped_pajamas.\nThe authors general stance towards the movie is neutral, because they believe that it takes a unusual stance on the holocaust, and is very dark. They like the way it ends with a brutal final punch of a twist. The new insight is about the dark and unusual stance towards the holocaust, and the brutal punch of a twist at the end. His review uses pathos because he shows emotion in his word choice. This makes the reader interested by the way he explains the sad ending. The strengths of the review are the numbers it shows and the reasons that the movie was the percent it was. The weaknesses of the review are that it is very short and lacks a lot of detailed information. This is a secondary source because it is from someone who reviewed the movie and not the actual movie itself. \nO, Review A. \"Something Is Happening.\" The New York Times, The New York Times, 11 Nov. \n2006, www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/books/Scott.t.html.\nThe authors general stance towards the movie is positive, because they talk about the exciting release of the book and movie. And give insight into the making of the movie and the story behind it. It goes into detail on the story of it and not so much the actual movie, but the backstory on it. The strength is the detail and length of the review. This review uses ethos because a credible source that is well known and liked is the author of this review. The weaknesses of the review are that it doesn't depict the events in the movie but the backstory. This review is a secondary source because it is someone who read the book and then wrote their own paper about what they thought about it, rather then being the actual book which is a primary source.\n\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas.\" Metacritic, Miramax Films, 7 Nov. 2008, \nwww.metacritic.com/movie/the-boy-in-the-striped-pajamas.\nThe authors general stance towards the movie is positive, because they talk about how powerful the movie is at providing a look in the prejudice, hatred and violence affect innocent people. They like how the story is told through an 8 year old, and not an adult. The new insight into the movie is about how bruno and shmuel can have a great friendship even though bruno's dad is the leader of the concentration camp and shmuel is in the concentration camp. This is a secondary source because it is a review of the movie or book which are the primary source. The strength of this review is the powerful word choice in it. The weakness is that the review does not explain very well what it is talking about.",

            "content": "The Strength of Innocence Reigns Over All\n\n\tThe Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a film depicting the story of the Holocaust through the perspective of an eight-year-old boy, Bruno (Asa Butterfield). It was produced for the soul purpose of opening your eyes to the reality of not only the devastating times but also the reality through the perspective of an innocent child.\nThis mind-boggling film starts out with Bruno playing with his friends in Berlin, then coming to the realization that his family is moving to the countryside due to his fathers' (David Thewlis) promotion in the military. As his family arrives to the new house, Bruno discovers what he comprehends to be a farm. One with knowledge about the Holocaust will come to the realization that this \"farm\" is a concentration camp that Ralf, Bruno's father, is in command over. As they get settled into their new surroundings, Bruno begins to ponder about the \"farm\" in the distance. \nHe just moved away from his beloved friends, friends he grew up with. Now he is surrounded strictly by family and the people that work for them. All of these people seem to have their plates full, and never have time to spare a moment to play with Bruno. This leaves him to fend for himself when it comes to entertainment. Bruno loves adventure; he is always seeking new things to explore, which leads him to the concentration camp seen from his new house. \nWhen Bruno comes across this camp, there is a boy in \"pajamas\", Shmuel, (Jack Scanlon) sitting alone beside a pile of concrete blocks. Over the next several weeks, Bruno builds a friendship with \"the boy in the striped pajamas\" despite the enormous barbed-wire fence standing between them. During this time, there is an incident with Shmuel and a soldier at Bruno's home. Shmuel is not seen for several days after this. As an innocent boy, Bruno does not understand why his friend is no longer coming to the intimidating fence at the camp. One day he reappears and is more mournful than usual. Bruno learns of the cause for his newly made friends' emotions and decides he is going to help.\nDuring this time, Bruno's mother, Elsa (Vera Farmiga) comes to find out that the camp is killing Jews due to the lack of respect from a soldier when he proclaims, \"they smell even worse when they burn.\" Because of this gruesome statement, Elsa decides it is in the family's best interest to move away from the camp in order to raise Bruno and his sister, Gretel, (Amber Beattie) appropriately. The day that the three of them are scheduled to leave, Bruno escapes to the camp in attempt to help Shmuel. It is in this moment of the film that you really understand how devastating the Holocaust was. The next few scenes leading up to the end of the film unfold the reality of two innocent children trying to make sense of the evil in this world.\nAs I watched this film I continuosly compared it to The Book Thief, in which the young girl moves to Germany due to the loss of her mother and must find a way to survive. The girl in that film does not understand that the Holocaust is taking place; she is just trying to survive and does so because of her innocence.\nThis film not only expresses the heart-wrenching pain caused by the Holocaust, but also the innocence that the children had during this time. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas was not created in a way that tells the story of the Holocaust like the typical straight forward film does, instead it provides you with a new perspective, that of an innocent eight-year-old boy. A boy with the only intentions of exploring new places and creating new friends.\nIt takes a certain dedication to portray a story in a way that not only tells the history of the Nazis and Jews but also provides a perspective that the majority of people seem to forget exists. This film shows the strength innocence has in times of desperation, which is exactly why you should spare 94 minutes of your life to embrace the heart-wrenching reality of one of those innocent children during a life-changing moment in history.",

A very realistic and very hard movie on the concentration camps, and the story is really poignant, and the characters are well written and superbly interpreted by very convincing actors. Asa Butterfield in the role: Bruno and Jack Scanlon in the role of Shmuel (the Jewish boy) and Vera Farmiga in the role of Asa's mother and David Thewlis in the role of Asa's father. A movie that fills the spectator with emotion, a great film of its kind, because all these wars are also all the misfortunes of the world that fall on the heads of the innocent, a movie to be discovered absolutely for its sensitivity to the skin",

I wail at the drop of a hat - I'm talking Muppet movies and Campbell's soup commercials - but I was too busy rolling my eyes and feeling a bit pandered to to feel any raw emotion from what was happening in the story. It was a ludicrous plot point with an excruciatingly predictable outcome rubbed out by a director who thinks he's suddenly started shooting the next Schindler's List. I can't blame the actors, as they were all masterful, especially Vera Farmiga, and the young actors portraying Bruno and Shmuel. If the novel, which I have not read, has the same climax/resolution as this film, then I absolutely blame the author for this mess, and would have thrown the book in the fireplace after reading it. Perhaps it went into greater detail in why the \"decision\" (without spoiling anything) was even made in the first place, other than to give the characters a reason to reach the story's conclusion, and to make people reach for their Kleenex. If that's the case, then it's a shame, because thanks to this movie, I have virtually no desire to ever read it to find out for myself.",

            "content": "War is said to either bring people together or tear them apart. The movie The Boy in the Striped Pajamas demonstrates both outcomes in a heart wrenching tale about a Nazi soldier's son and his unlikely new companion. The heartbreaking story begins in Berlin, where the son Bruno's life is that of an ordinary eight years old boys. All this will change once his Father asks the family to go with him on his assignment as a soldier during World War II, where the progression of tragedy begins. This tragic story is brought to life through many aspects such as acting, costume, and plot, all of which give the movie great emotional appeal.\nThis movie would not have this great emotional appeal if it were not for the actors. Asa Butterfield brilliantly portraits the son, Bruno. For such a young actor Butterfield shocks his audience with such great expression of emotion. Asa makes his act believable through his facial expressions and delivery of lines. Often when he speaks his voice echoes innocence and when appropriate, confusion. The main physical feature he uses to portray his innocence are his eyes. He often widens them in awe and uses them to connect with the audience by looking either directly in the camera or intently at the other characters. One of those other characters is his father, who is also a Nazi soldier, played by David Thewlis. As the story progresses David smiles less and less showing how the war is beginning to impact his character. He shows little reaction to the cruelty played out in the movie, hardly flinching. This stillness that David brings further portraits his character as a harsh, unforgiving Nazi soldier and starkly contrasts Bruno.\nThere is an even greater contrast seen between the Jewish and German characters in the film. This contrast is emphasized through the characters of Bruno and Schmuel with the use of costume and set. Bruno is a well dressed little boy, surrounded by a well dressed family, in a big beautiful house. While Schmuel, who lives but a mile away, wears rags in a fenced in suffering \"community\". While what they wear sets them apart, what really shows the social divide between the Germans and Jews is the wall around Bruno's home. When first driving up to the house it is evident that what is inside the boundaries of their home is vastly different from what is on the outside of it. This movie does a wonderful job in costume and set, setting up the movie for success in showing the social divide between the Jews and Germans during World War II.\nMark Herman, the director has a lot to do with the success of the movie as well. Thanks to him the plot progresses in a way that flows and wastes no scenes. The movie lets you see glimpses into how the war impacted each person's life differently. From the grandparents to Bruno's sister we get a taste of the many different perspectives on the war. While the movie could have expanded on the other character's experiences a bit more, having only a brief look allows for each scene to serve a purpose and avoids filler. Due to that success in plot the movies emotional appeal continues to be its best quality throughout the film.\nThis original idea to show a Nazi soldier's son and an eight years old Jewish prisoner leads the audience to feel great sadness. This sadness is not only drawn from the film but from a real history of hatred towards a people who were not understood. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is not a movie to be watched purely for entertainment, but also to reflect on the past and on the actions of the Nazi's towards the Jews. That is what brings true greatness to the film not just the acting, progression of plot, and costume, but the historical accurateness.",

It brings a novel perspective to the Holocaust from the point of view of a German child, Bruno, while also showing us more typical perspectives, such as the perspective of a Jewish child in a concentration camp, the transformation of Bruno's sister due to brainwashing and propaganda, and the separation of Bruno's parents as duty to their country conflicts with morality.  This film's other assets are the wonderful performances of young leads Asa Butterfield and Jack Scanlon, and Vera Farmiga's incredible performance as Bruno's mother, which brings a lot of emotional depth to the film.\n\nIn short, \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" is a touching, albeit predictable film with the beautiful message that if we could all be like children and look past cultural differences and see different people as human beings, the world would be a better place.",

Based on the well known history of the Nazis treatment of Jews within concentration camps, this sees the story of two eight year old boys that begin to build a friendship from opposite sides of the electric fence. Little do they know what the future holds for both of them, nor how their respective families are sworn enemies, and with the audience fearing the worst all the way through the movie, the inevitable is soon sprung upon us (with a little added twist for good measure). As racist as this may make me look, I didn't feel as affected as one should, but I believe that to be because it felt somewhat of a rushed conclusion. Don't get me wrong, the whole idea of this part of history is one of the most tragic known to man, but it didn't make the most of what should have been a long drawn out and emotional moment. You couldn't have asked anything more from two young actors, who played their part to the max, but the speed at which the events unfolded, with little time to reflect on what happened, really didn't do the rest of the build up justice. I truly thought this was a very captivating watch, which for an avid hater of history, is really saying something. The whole plot around the German boys family was well delivered, giving an engrossing sub story to what was really the main focus between the two kids. I didn't take my eyes off this for a second, and although you could argue that my opinion was possibly influenced by spoilers given prior to viewing this, I really couldn't help but feel it was lacking that little something to truly pull on the heart strings. Not really one to watch over again, as unfortunately the ending will never change, but definitely an educational spectacle, and a worthwhile recommendation.",

Such is the case with The Boy In The Striped Pajamas, a movie concerning that darkest of modern events, the Holocaust. My 2 biggest issues with the movie was the pacing and performances of the child actors, particularly the lead. He had a number of genuine moments, and by the end I felt quite strongly for him, but much of his delivery is too wooden to be believable, and it often looks as though he's reading his lines off screen. But the parents, especially the mother, played wonderfully by Vera Farmiga, who very often steals the show completely, are both excellent. The pacing is very leisurely, and it often feels like the film has no idea where it wants to go, simply bobbing along for most of its run time. But as I got to the end, I realised that might have been the intention all along. The movie would be worth watching for the conclusion alone, which ends the events on an incredibly bleak, heart-breaking note through the use of camerawork, music and acting. By the time the credits rolled I was still and silent, utterly unable to comment on what I'd just witnessed. It might be a one-time-only film, but it's one you won't be forgetting in a hurry.",

But what disturbed me are just how much the detractors missed some of the key points and devices that to me were clearly on the minds of the movie's makers.  Even worse, some of these critics wandered into the very soulless lack of human empathy that allowed the Holocaust to take place.   You can go elsewhere to read the basic plot, which would be a good idea if you haven't seen the movie yet, as otherwise you will likely not be able to grasp the points I want to make in this review.  So let me take on some of the major objections in order to rebut them in earnest:  The Germans speak in perfect British accents. But how can the critics miss the obviousness of this device? It's not mainly to make the film palatable to audiences.  We've been conditioned to automatically associate heavy German accents with WWII evil. What good would it serve us to 'know' from the start, and even through the eyes of an innocent, trusting 8 year old son of a high ranking soldier, that his father and all he stands for is evil?  No!  We NEED to be massaged by the comforting regalness of that British accent into seeing everything and everyone around us as being good and noble.  The device works splendidly.  Another major criticism is that the story lacks credulity.  Oh, please! Have these dolts never heard of a morality tale that takes enough elements of reality to create a story that is compelling enough to make that reality MORE than documentary? That's the whole point of this film!!!  The Holocaust as seen through the eyes of two children here is miles beyond that horrid travesty \"Life is Beautiful\", the worst film about this historical event to have ever been made. And lest anyone think that we get coloring book people that are all good or all bad, every single character explored in depth here has both sides of their human nature seen. The death camp commandant is a loving father, tender in his interactions with his children.  His mother hates what he has become but blames herself for dressing him up in uniforms as a child. Before his wife becomes the 'good German' conscience, she relishes in the power and privilege that her husband's career brings. And most important, his young son betrays his Jewish secret friend at the very point that telling the truth would have protected the unfortunate boy.  Finally, the ending.  For that, you must see the film.  But to call it contrived, forced, unconvincing are all nothing but the conceits of a smug kind of critic who is lurking in the shadows looking for something to pounce on. Do we attack fables for not imitating historical life? That would be absurd!  So, ignore the critics who did precisely that here, and see this film.  The book may have been intended for older children and young teens, but the movie is every bit as much fitting fare for adults.  Life isn't always beautiful.",

The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a great film that gives an idea about how German's lives were at during the war. Asa Butterfield and Jack Scanlon are terrific and they have great chemistry together. Vera Farmiga and David Thewlis are great also. The plot is not that special, but it's the kid leads that matter. It has a shocking end that probably would end up as a tearful moment. The characters are decent, and the writing is really good and Mark Harmon knows how to write children characters.

Their friendship is never really fully developed as there are not that many scenes with them together, which was a shame as it would've made the final scene a lot more emotional. As with the atrocities that went on behind those fences all are kept off screen, it would of been a lot beneficial to see more of what they had to go through then be kept in the dark for most of it. I did like that not every person in the film agreed with what was happening, we know the Nazi's were an evil race but not everyone shared their views.

Let's start with the story: the story behind this film is clearly that of irony because (spoiler alert?) the boy is not a fallen hero who redeems the world with his sacrifice.  It's rare that we get to witness a screenplay based on a story of irony, and so I really appreciate this.  Next up is the ending.  My wife and probably many other movie goers would like closure on the story.  Perhaps a memo pre-closing-credits that would explain what was done about the situation.  Little do they realize, such a clumsy summation would destroy the powerful emotion attached to this ending.  I prefer to keep my mind blown for a minute thanks.  Last, the acting in this film is the only area I can say would need improvement because I found at some parts I was unconvinced by the acting and it gave rise to a deep inner conflict.  On the other hand, with the written material the actors were working with, I find it hard to believe that the cast could have sold the story better.  It really is a difficult sale.  Costumes, props, set, lighting and directing were all excellent and while I don't recommend this film for everyone, the people I wouldn't recommend it to I don't consider worth very much of my time.  Thank you Mark Herman.  This was a good film.",

            "content": "\"Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights, before the dark hour of reason grows.\" That's the first line in this movie. And think if you were a boy, and grew up in the holocaust. When I was in sixth grade, my teacher had us read the boy in the striped pajamas. Yes, while the other kids read the Lightning Thief (a book I'd later read, and helped me becoming a writer) my class read the book about the kid in the holocaust. Then we all watched the movie, and it's pretty damn good. And as far as movie adaptations go, this is one of the best goes. It's not the novel, but it's the film version of the novel. Everything good about the book was used, and parts not as good were replaced, and it covered everything. That's how film adaptations should be. And from what I heard this movie is pretty well received, but I find that surprising since I expected most wouldn't like it because I kind of feel you'd have to read the book to really appreciate it. Anyway the movie is about a boy named Bruno, and his dad is a high class Nazi in a big situation where he must move his family over to a house next to nearby concentration camp to basically be the overseer. I'm pretty sure that's what he does anyway. But that's the thing, like the book, you almost see the movie through Bruno's perspective. You feel the pressure as people tell Bruno this backwards way of life, where Jews are evil, and not people at all. But before that happens, Bruno meets his friend Shmuel, a Jew in the concentration camp. Yes, Bruno nonchalantly walks up to the fence up a concentration camp, and he now has a friend. And that is the real picture painted. Two friends, on two different sides of a fence. That fence means everything, and nothing at the same time. Through the movie there is a lot of little arcs, and little information. And in movie form I'm surprised it works. And seeing Bruno in these situations where he doesn't really think much of something, when something really big actually happened, it really gets to you. I'll give an example. At one part Bruno falls off of this swing. The only other person around is one of the Jew house workers. Now, if he touches Bruno, he's fucked. But if he just let's Bruno sit there, he's fucked. But the guy's a former doctor, and he helps Bruno up, and heals his wound, and has a really good conversation with him. And little Bruno had no wonder at what he just started. But luckily the guy got off  free... for now. Carrying on! Also I'd like to talk about the acting. The kid who plays Bruno, he did fantastic. I think this was his first movie, and he didn't look at all like he was. I was so invested into his character he wasn't even a child actor in my brain anymore, he was way gone and he was just Bruno, the kid who played him didn't exist when he walked off set. Most child actors you hate, and also Shmuel does a pretty good job as well. In fact, everyone does good, and nobody really messes up. And this is one of those movies that are getting points just for making you think, and plucking at those emotional scenes. It's dramatic tragedy, and is frankly one of the most grabbing endings that stick with you. I do believe the book did grab that ending a little tiny bit better, but considering it's in firs-person, and the movie isn't so much about Bruno, the newer ending with additional footage that was kind of grabbing extra stuff is still very welcome as it is sad. So ladies and guys who are nicknaming them \"man tears,\" get ready to get some tissues. But another thing the movie captures is a lot similar to the quote in the beginning of this review. A childhood is based off of sounds and noises and pictures. Things we can't really understand. And this whole movie almost feels like one big memory that old Bruno is remembering, and is now making sense of. There are so many references to dark things, things he just doesn't get. But rarely does it get super dark and Nazi evil, for the most part it feels what I consider realistic. We remember the holocaust as this dark evil place, but in reality lots of normal things happened, there was just a big evil thing going on in the back of their brains, or under their nose. But occasionally there will be that guy, that one really racist dick or another (the teacher and others) who just say something that's really offensive. So it is emotional, and it is a good movie. And this movie I will remember as the movie I watched in my childhood that had linked with the book. I can't not remember it without thinking of the book and my old class, it's impossible. But movies are suppose to do that, they bring parts of our lives into them. And the boy in the striped pajamas is one of those movies that have a special place fore me.",

The relationship between the two boys lies at the heart of the movie, yet they seemed unusually distant.  After all, the movie seeks to examine the extermination of Jews through the eyes of children.  Vera Farmiga played her role well, as Bruno's mother, but I found the brilliant David Thewlis to be somewhat constrained by the role of Bruno's father.  An enjoyable film, though we must now be coming to the end of innovative ways of dealing with the holocaust on film.",

It's been 70 odd years since World War 2 and we still discriminate, label, stereotype? what wasdone to the Jews, unforgiveable, the war is far from over.

It DOES deal with the Holocaust, after all. I really should read the book someday. Mhmmmm\n\nThe acting and script writing was wonderful. They picked a great cast. They picked a really good family...they look like a real family. Bruno looks like a spitting image of the \"mom\", while Gretel looks a lot like the \"father\". Which I think they did on purpose. \"Father\" is a Nazi and believes in the cause and the daughter takes after those thoughts and beliefs for a time. \"Mom\" at first is rather naive and innocent about what her husband does (meaning he runs the concentration camp a few blocks away), but then finds out and despises it and him, and then Bruno is similar. Granted he doesn't ever really understand what his father is doing. I loved Shmuel. Probably the cutest kid. Great kid to play the role, he did a wonderful job. I really wonder why none of the actors won an Oscar. Oh well.\n\nI have nothing to complain about. I just wish they would have played around more with Gretel's development as well. Oh well...also I hated the ending. Mind you, it was a FANTASTIC ending. However, I cry EVERY TIME! I've watched this well over five times now and I still cry like a child. I did watch this with Boyfriend on our second movie date a while back, so I had to restrain myself immensely. I also watched it in my Humanities class and the buff, football playing tough guy next to me even teared up a wee bit.\n\nOverall, this is one of my favorite movies. Top Twenty (I should make a list of my top twenty movies, so far).  It does have a rather sad ending, but it's just a great, great movie. If you like Drama or have any interest in History or just movie watching, you need to watch this. You will love it too. Out of five stars I grant this one 5 stars.\n\nFavorite Character(s): Bruno's Mom, Bruno's Dad (just because I adore the actor) Bruno, Shmeul (cute kid), and Grandma\nNot-so Favorite Character(s): Gretel. >.>",

This movie is scary, fantastic, depressing, and yet has this child like nature that pays off well throughout the film. The movie stars Asa Butterfield who really shines in this movie and also stars in another great film (Hugo, 2011). The movie is all on his shoulders and if not done right, the film would fall apart. But Asa Butterfield proves his acting chops (at a very surprisingly young age), and leads the film very well. The score by James Horner fits the movie perfectly setting the stage for the director and cinematographer to do a very good job.The supporting cast is also at first okay. Then out of nowhere, (right at the halfway point) the supporting actors and actresses bring on their A game which really pays off in the end. An ending that is terrifying, unexpected, and chillingly real of events that did in fact happen during WWII that still haunts victims to this day.",

            "content": "If you want the definition of ironic, it would be the plot to The Boy In the Striped Pajamas. Everybody knows the story of Hitler and 1940's Germany. A military man moves his family out into the country so he can work at a concentration camp. His eight year old boy wanders off and finds the camp and befriends a Jewish kid from the other side of the fence. A combination of the child's naivety, strong story, and somber music makes this movie very powerful and brings a new insight to WW2.\nThe main force behind this movie and what really keeps it going is Bruno. He is the eight year old boy and the main character. He is forced to move away from his friends in Berlin and is looking for a new friend. He meets a Jewish boy in the concentration camp and he has no idea what is going on. He is young and knows little of the war and the terrible things his father and countryman are doing. There are moments in the movie where he asks stupid questions and it makes the audience just go, \"oh, no. I know the answer, how can you be so blind?\" Then I remembered he was eight years old and has no business knowing what is going on. His older sister is twelve and she gets it. She talks about joining the Hitler youth and she becomes war driven. She is being brainwashed and corrupted by the adults around her. Her whole existence is the show the vile works of the Germans in that time. It's odd how each character in the family is completely different, obviously it is on purpose.\nWe have Bruno, the main character who is completely blind and innocent. It is his blindness and innocents which makes the movie. Then we have the father, Ralph, who is also Professor Lupin in Harry Potter, just a side note. He is the definition of evil. He works at the camps. My favorite scene is when they are all at dinner and he basically interrogates one of his officers and finds out his father was Jewish. On the spot he has the man taken into the other room, beaten, and killed. It is a powerful scene and shows the reality of the situation. One could argue that it's not his fault because he is just following orders and Germany was corrupt by one insane tyrant, but that's not the point. This movie isn't about the war or Hitler or even the Jews. It is about the relationship between the two young children battling the odds Then there is my favorite character in the entire movie, and that is the mother. She is special so she gets her own paragraph.\nElsa is the mother of this family and she is protective of her children. She knows the danger bit is also blinded by her surroundings. She knows what her country is doing with the Jewish people but she has no idea that they are dying. She finds out that they are being gassed and burned and she flips out. This says a lot about her character and how she did not approve of her countries actions. This is a bold move by the director because he disproves the stereotype that everybody in Germany hated the Jews and approved of Hitler. She is a strong character an gives the movie a different edge.\nThe movie is a little slow at first and it takes a while for the backbone of the plot to kick in. This movie is 94 minutes and it takes a while before the two boys even meet and build their friendship. Another problem is the little screen time the little Jewish boy is in the movie. The title of the movie is about him and he isn't really seen as much. When he is on screen he tries to tell the truth to young Bruno. He is eight years old and he knows and understands everything that has happened to him. There is one point in the movie where Bruno messes up and it almost costs him his life. I like Bruno as a character but he was a coward and he made foolish mistakes. As the movie progressed I began to realize there were only two outcomes to this story and both are very sad.\nPacing problems, limited time with a main character and my major problem is the lack of character development. Every character with the exception of the mother is the exact same from the opening credits to the end credits. The father is a jerk. The boy is foolish and his sister is corrupted. This made the movie a little boring and even though it was a short film it felt really long. I wanted to see more but I can't think what else could have been seen. The strengths definitely outweigh the weaknesses but the weaknesses are still substantial.\nOverall, I did enjoy The Boy In the Striped Pajamas. The music added an emotional touch throughout and one thing you need to understand is that the main character is a kid and you need to think like a kid to understand what he does. By no means is this a happy movie, but more tragic with a few glimpses that would make any parent proud. Watch this movie but be warned, it is not for the faint of heart. The acting isn't anything remarkable, the characters are strong but have little development, but overall enjoyable. This movie gets the WillyT Honorable Mention.",

            "content": "Popularity of a Labrador, bravado of a Bulldog, confused as a Cockerpoo and Totally Shih-Tzu.  \n\nThis WWII drama follows Bruno and his German family from their family home in Berlin to their new house following his Father's promotion.  His Father is presumably an SS Officer and he is to become the new Governor of a concentration camp (loosely based on Auschwitz).  The new home is next to the camp and the audience watch as Bruno slowly finds out more and more about the situation as the wool can no longer be pulled over his eyes.  It is very much a movie about viewing the holocaust through the eyes of a child.  When he views the camp for the first time through his bedroom window (having been shielded from the truth by his parents) he thinks he can see farmers tendering the land in their nightwear. \n\nI am very interested in anything related to the Second World War.  I really wanted to like this film, but I can't; 'cos it's crap. \n\nMany people who have seen the film find it shocking.  I must admit that I did too.  We see the Swastika's flying on the red Nazi flags, the German troops and are aware we are in the German capital in the 1940's.  The first man opens his mouth to speak and out flows the English language.  I found this shocking, but was intrigued to see how this would work.  \n\nAs the film continued my irritation was building to a crescendo.  It's not like Schindler's List where, everyone speaks with various accents, but speak English as it's an American Movie.  The Nazis  speak with the thickest of English accents, as do the Jews, the children and the rest of the world presumably.  It really is the clearest \"Queens English\", I can just image one of the SS officers turning to the other and saying;  \"Pardon me old boy, would you mind awfully if we stopped for a spot of afternoon tea before we stroll over the road and bump 'orf a couple of dozen gentlemen of the Jewish persuasion?\"\n\nImage a new movie is coming out called \"Churchill\", which is made by Germans but set in England.  Imagine that we're in the height of WW2 and the family gather around the wireless to hear our Prime Minister speak.  We hear him deliver his most famous of speeches - \"We shall go on to the end.  We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills;  we shall never surrender\". Now image that its delivered in the thickest German you've ever heard!  \n\nPersonally I find this aspect of the film insulting.  As a Brit and for the Germans.  It's not a subtle thing, its very \"in your face\" and clearly done on purpose.  It doesn't stop at the language either.  Everything about this movie wreaks of English culture. I did consider whether it was portrayed like this so the audience would relate more or perhaps to bridge a cultural separation.  But for whatever reason, it doesn't work and was a poor choice.  Especially in the scene where they view the film that has been made to eradicate peoples doubts in the camp - that its more of a holiday camp than a death camp. \n\nMoving on; everything from the acting, to the music, to the wardrobe is inaccurate, weak and feels like a cheap amateur production.  The story is supposed to be a tragedy, but I couldn't get into the film enough to feel anything.  It's just too unbelievable.  I can't believe that some of the actors were selected for their roles.  I just can't understand why.  Maybe they were the only ones to turn up on the day?  Jack Scanlon (Shmuel) is particularly bad.  As far as acting goes, I feel Henry Kingsmill (who played Karl) was the best by a long way.  More convincing than anyone else on screen throughout. \n\nFor me, the movie is all mixed up, back to front and round the wrong way.  Jewish characters played by clearly non-Jewish actors, the movie is all in English but the literature is in German, the German child is brunette and the Jewish child is blonde and most notably 6,000,000 Jews were murdered in the holocaust yet this is a tragic story of 1 Nazi child who was killed alongside.  \nIf you swap the Nazi's, the Jew's and the concentration camp for Al Qaeda, American citizens and the Twin Towers America would boycott the movie and label it as seriously poor taste.\n\nOn a positive note, I felt that certain scenes seemed metaphorical.  Which I found quite insightful.  Such as when Bruno (Asa Butterfield - one of the better actors in the movie) lies about being friends with Shmuel out of fear.  As maybe many Germans did at the time. \nI found the scene where his Father is deciding to \"come clean\" and tells his son; \"Those people ... are not really people at all\" quite a good reflection on how Germany saw Jews, as parasites.  I would have liked to see that scene go on a little longer.  Perhaps to answer some of the questions Bruno may have asked.\n\nI found it a clever idea that Bruno asked questions and in the lack of response the viewer seems to answer them in their own mind.  This way it becomes very personal.  It would have been very powerful, if it wasn't so transparent. \n\nIn short The Boy in Striped Pajamas strives to be a sentimental, heartfelt, shocking tale of discovery.  But is ultimately an unbelievable, naive, clearly fictional story that is only shocking to those previously unaware of the situation.  It loses marks for being unconvincing, making poor choices in direction, being weak throughout and personally found it insulting to me and the darkest hour of World War II.",

Actually, only for the fact of making films about fictional events in 2nd War became something cult. Even up to quite tiring. But what to say about this production in particular, among many others of the genre? First, it's curious that a film based on a book has only 90 minutes long. But this is not something that points the lack of content or material. On the contrary. There are movies that can perfectly flush this out and just The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas achieves that success. The film primarily deals with the innocence of a child, and this can be modeled as negatively in the wrong hands. And the narrative axis has support precisely in fraternal relationship between the boys, both in extremely opposite but at the same time demonstrating profound ignorance of everything that is happening. And of course, not unworthy of the supporting cast, which is a rather considerable, as can be seen with the judel Pavel, showing fear and constant insecurity. We have one final daring by today's standards, but that is precisely what generates all the impact on the viewer (yes, all), so that a passing sensation of pain, both physical and mental. Even though it is fictional, it does point out all the humiliation and brutality that millions of Jews suffered.",

This movie makes the atrocities very gritty as we see the son of an SS Commandant (David Thewlis) in charge of one of these camps befriend a young boy within the confinements, dressed in what the soldiers son Bruno (Asa Butterfield) believes to be striped pyjamas, completely oblivious as to what is really going on.\rThe more humanly and realistic tone comes from this soldier and his family, a very comfortable family with a wife and two children, a girl aged 12 who is simply doing what she is told and who falls even more deeply for the Third Reich as each day passes. There is also the Commandant's wife, who is unaware exactly what her husband's work consists of. She tries unsuccessfully for Bruno to enjoy their new home, but of course unbeknownst to her he is spending his time quite recklessly at the barbed wire fence of the camp and bringing food to this boy the same age as him, similar in curiosity, but these two have led very different lives, a pecking order if you will.\rDavid Thewlis playing the SS Commandant is quite the predicament indeed in terms of explaining what he is like in the role. When we become aware of his job and what his intentions are, there is shock to be had because of his humanity, which is either shedding light on these soldiers simply following orders or a poorly placed character, because at the end of the day, these people are murderers.\rThis is exactly where the film is at its best, it never necessarily cares about the political motivation of any of the characters, but showing the point of view of these two innocent and caught in the middle children, they don't quite know why they are where they are, but they soon add up that not everything is right.\rAn historically questionable but ultimately powerful film of friendship and humanity, that never fails to break the heart.",

It is such a pretty uniform and it's such a nice house and everyone is so nice, so typical Arian nice(pigtails).\rWell outwardly because underneath it all the perfect Nazi family has troubles(they have to). Nevertheless son Bruno happily goes out exploring and meets this other boy near a barb wired fence. Bruno at one side, in his typical little boys outfit, and Shmuel at the other side, in his striped pyjamas. Lucky for the story there is just one fence, and not three as at Auschwitz and, as the script will have it, there are no guards intervening in the broad daylight meetings. A relation develops. One eight year old boy belonging to the master race, and the other eight year old boy from the subhuman race, bonding, just like normal boys do everywhere..\rOf course it had to end bad. Bruno digs a hole under the fence and joins Shmuel at the other side(why not the other way around?), and then together they are marched of to the showers. Father is too late to intervene. A stack of clothes is all that is left of little Bruno.\rI wonder what would have happened if Father had made it in time? Get Bruno out, spank him for being disobedient and then send him to bed without dinner? Would he have ordered Shmuel released or have him beaten to death for luring his Arian son into a lethal situation?\rAnd then what happens?\rDoes father quit his job now he realizes what horrible things he does? Does mamma divorce him or curse him for the rest of his life?\rHas he all the Jews released?\rDoes he kill himself?\rDoes he kill Himmler?\rWhat impact has this?\r It is hard to judge a movie that means well, but is it really necessary to make up an unlikely story because you want to get the point across that killing people in extermination camps is bad? What is exactly the point of this particular story? Why does it exist? Is it made because it is more horrid that eight year old boys get gassed? Is it made because sweet little Arian Bruno get's gassed by accident?\rAnd why have the boys killed at all?\rCause that is better?\rPerhaps it would have been better if father had intervened in time or a guard:. \"Hey, aren't you the camp commandant's son?\" And Bruno gets pulled away from Shmuel, survives and now knows what a horrible man his father is and what is even more: his father knows he knows. Each look into Bruno's eyes will be a mirror to his own abject debasement. Too late Hoess(Auschwitz commander) to confess at your trial that what you did is bad after you killed a million people or so people. Far too late: they shouldn't have allowed you to confess at all.\rBut perhaps even more eyeopening would have been: Bruno totally indoctrinated by the Nazi lifestyle does not realize at all what is going on. Why should he? He is eight, he has been part of the Nazi culture all his life: he knows no other world: \"Just spare Shmuel, dad. He is my friend, not like the rest of them.\"  or \"Son, it has to be done.. it is better for the world. Sometimes we have to do things we don't like for the good of the whole..\"\rAnd then the cute Jewish boy gets gassed anyway.\rAnd it makes Bruno an emotional timebomb. Everyday his father looks at his son and wonders..at what age will he realize that what I did is horrible?\rAnd if you were making fantasy stories anyway.. why not make a perfect Arian family? Just like their propaganda wanted you to belief? The contrast between this perfect well functioning beautiful totally Nazi family and the situation in the death camps would have been bigger. And once Bruno knows.. then have the troubles start.\rOr not.\rWhy not have Bruno forget about Shmuel and have the happy Nazi family go on with their perfect life deliberately oblivious to what is happening some hundred meters away from them, because they do not want to know. Like was typical in Germany?\rAnd perhaps they have Shmuel for their pet Jewish houseboy? The only Jew to survive because he is the friend of Bruno and once Bruno has enough of him...\rNow that would have been a chilling movie.",

I like that you see the perspective of the Nazi's and that they were ordinary families (even though they had English accents). The problem with this movie is that Bruno, the main character, is so naive and never has any idea what the camps are despite living next to one for months. It's very unrealistic as he sneaks away from his home every day to visit another 8-year-old boy inside the concentration camp, who would never be able to sit next to the fence all day. The over-protective mother would have realized at least once her child was not in the backyard. The two boys sitting on either side of the fence stick their hands through several times and even dig underneath at one point. They certainly would have been shocked to death. The fact that neither one understands that people are killed, though when we enter it's plainly obvious, is hard to believe. It's so unrealistic neither children have any clue what's going on.

The film was directed by Mark Herman. It stars Asa Butterfield as a young German boy Bruno, David Thewlis as Bruno's father, a high-ranking Nazi officer, Ralf and Jack Scanlon as Jewish boy.   The film is set in Budapest during the Second World War.   It is essentially about the Holocoust through the eyes of a 9-year-old boy. At first a young boy Bruno lives with his family in Berlin in Nazi Germany but then they have to relocate to the countryside home that is walled off from a \"farm\" in the far distance. In fact, this farm is a concentration camp and the Bruno's father is a commmandant of the camp. Bruno's mother is kept in the dark for a long time about her husband's murderous duties. One day, Bruno goes beyond the wall, eventually arriving at an electric barbed wire surrounding the camp. There he befriends a Jewish boy, Shmuel. But their friendship is fatal...   I strongly recommend this unforgettable and poignant film, not only for pleasure but also for educational purposes.

The particularity that makes this film remarkable is that it takes us to see everything through the innocent eyes of a child, who cannot understand what is really happening, and to what extent his own family is involved in the atrocities that we know happened.Bruno is a child who lives a sheltered and carefree childhood. He is the son of a German army officer, and the family is wealthy. He knows that his country is at war and that his father is important, and he is helping his country to win the war. But this is basically all he knows or understands about what goes on in the Germany of his time. When his father is ordered to go to the countryside, Bruno is very sad to leave his house and his friends, but he meets a strange child, who wears striped pajamas and lives inside a fenced enclosure, which his mother does not wanted him to see. She's the only one in the family who really understands what her husband is there to do, and the only one to protest it all.The film is based on a novel written by John Boyne, but despite the source material and the film's fidelity to it, I wonder how immune a ten-year-old could really be to the avalanches of Nazi propaganda, considering that his father was a high-ranking official and the family had natural political connections to the Hitler regime. I don't mean to say that I disagree with Bruno's innocence and the way he doesn't know what's really going on, but it just seems hard to believe, since the Nazis used all means, including youth organizations and public education, to convey their ideology to younger people.The cast does a truly remarkable job. The spotlight naturally goes to Asa Butterfield and Jack Scanlon. The two young actors knew how to work perfectly and created a very good working relationship, which gives credibility to the friendship of their characters. It's their effort that makes the film particularly touching and human. David Thewlis also did an extraordinary job, incarnating in his character the contradiction of a loving and caring family man who is responsible for the planned and meticulous slaughter of a huge number of people. Is he a monster? Was he turned into a monster? In clear contrast, Vera Farmiga gives life to a courageous mother and wife, who finds herself in the need to protect her children from a reality she cannot agree with, and in which her husband is totally immersed. She is, like Bruno, able to see the human and innocent side of the people her husband says aren't \"really people\", even though she eventually has to silence what she really thinks about German politics in order not to suffer. Its consequences. Amber Beattie, on the other hand, shows us what happened to many German children and young people, victims of massive Nazi propaganda from an early age. Nevertheless, she is human, and her love interest in a young SS man reveals it, though it sends her further into the Nazi frenzy. The film also has the very relevant participation of Rupert Friend and David Hayman.Shot mostly in locations around Budapest, the film has a very beautiful, vivid, colorful and luminous cinematography, which fades and shadows as the film moves towards the end. There is a remarkable contrast between Bruno's house in the city (warmer colors, more light) and the gloomy house he goes to later (washed out colors, shadows, less light and a much heavier and more tense environment). The sets, costumes and props are good and in keeping with the time and context. I didn't see any anachronism errors. The soundtrack, signed by James Horner, is memorable and stays in the ear.",

It is based on the idea that the son of a SS Commandant would be completely oblivious to Nazi racial politics, and that a young Jewish boy would be left alive at Auschwitz or allowed to go anywhere near the fence. Both of these ideas are complete falsehoods and utterly impossible. During the period Auschwitz was killing Jews and other people deemed undesirable, enrollment in the Hitler youth would have been mandatory. It is impossible for the main character, Bruno, to escape indoctrination in that circumstance. He would have hated the Jews and never would have considered fraternizing with one of them. The Jewish child would have been immediately gassed as he is too young to work at the camp. If not that, he would have been shot or electrocuted for going anywhere near the fence. When the German child is killed in the end of the film, many reviews claim having felt sympathy and sorrow for his Nazi family. Need I remind anyone that these people are responsible for this genocide and are, at the very least, complicit!?

I remember being quite frustrated with how much we were taught about the camps, the holocaust and the tragedy that was World War II in general, while in secondary school. In it being shown from a German childs point of view, it certainly tackles a very disturbing time, in a slightly different way to which im used to watching, which is why it interested me, also (admittedly) knowing its a 12 rate I presumed it wouldn't be too graphic, as ive seen enough graphic footage from that time, or depictions of such, for my liking. I liked seeing the boys inquisitiveness and the awkward reactions from relatives when quizzed about what went on in 'the farm'. The plot moves pretty slowly I suppose but I liked how it unfolded, with him slowly realising that things aren't what they first appear, becoming more unsettled and curious, even openly challenging the biased nationalistic teachings he's given from a presumed private tutor.On a basic level, I liked the innocence of the boy and the way he quickly and easily bonded with the Jewish boy, Schmuel - there's obviously a great sense of innocence and humanity conveyed. Of course this could come across as very sugary sweet and even over bearingly melodramatic but I felt it was handled well, with some hard hitting dialogue, Bruno being told the usual anti-Jewish propaganda, that 'the Jew' aka the entire race(!) are 'evil vermin', which he clearly knows is nonsense from his short but poignant conversations from the other side of the electrified camp fence - he even challenges this by asking/saying basically but there are nice Jews too, aren't there?. There is music used at key points but its quite subtle and not as over the top as it certainly could have been overall. It is, however, still very much an emotional movie, as you can probably imagine. At one point Bruno feels intimidated when confronted by a solider in his own home - one of his own people, who seems so authoritarian and cold to him, that he doesn't want to anger and so says what he believes is expected of him at that time, to 'toe the line' - I didn't feel such scenes were ruined by a ridiculous over use of musical score, although it does feature at times but as I say its quite subtle for the most part. The movie runs for approximately an hour and a half long, so its certainly pretty short, especially for a war based movie.  There are some scenes that may make you flinch but there isn't the graphic violence that there could be, or that features in other war movies of course - thankfully so, as far as I'm concerned. I found it interesting the way the plot developed, there are some interesting twists, which would potentially spoil the movie to go into detail about but ill put it this way, some adults are more aware of the full truth than others. I found it interesting the difference between Bruno and his sister, she being more aware and accepting, or embracing, of the then political standpoint. Overall, I'd say the men came off worse than the women though, with Bruno being the exception.I thought this was a very watchable movie, of course elements of it are grim but I found myself curious to see how events played out, to see Bruno's take on it and how others treated him and handled the situation. I liked that there did seem to be a sense of hope present, from the way that Bruno so basically and without qualms became friends with the prisoner and his drive to help him as the film continued, which I felt really gave a good sense of empathy, the fact that kids look at things and basically see people on such a basic, human level, if that makes sense?.",

Through the eyes of an eight-year-old boy largely shielded from the reality of World War II, we witness a forbidden friendship that forms between Bruno, the son of Nazi commandant, and Shmuel, a Jewish boy held captive in a concentration camp. Though the two are separated physically by a barbed wire fence, their lives become inescapably intertwined. The imagined story of Bruno and Shmuel sheds light on the brutality, senselessness and devastating consequences of war from an unusual point of view. Together, their tragic journey helps recall the millions of innocent victims of the Holocaust. (Miramax Films)\u2026 Expand"
