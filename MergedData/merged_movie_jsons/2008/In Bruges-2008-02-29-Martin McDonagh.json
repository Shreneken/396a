            "content": "For those who might not know the name, director Martin McDonagh is an Irish playwright who won the Oscar last year for his short film \"Six Shooter\" about a chance encounter on a train, and that film's star Brendan Gleeson has returned as Ken, one of two hit men sent to the medieval city of Bruges in Belgium along with his partner Ray (Colin Farrell) to rest and lay low after a hit gone horribly wrong. Ray is a miserable bastard who makes it clear he's not happy about being in Bruges, but Ken convinces him that their boss Harry has a job for them there, as well as allowing them a chance for some sightseeing, none of which improves Ray's mood. Things look up when he meets the beautiful local woman Chloe, played by French actress Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy--you may remember her as Fleur Delacore in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire--and scores himself a date, which also goes horribly wrong due to Ray shooting off his big mouth. From there things continue to go south as Ray and Ken get into all sorts of messes and meet strange characters, all of whom will play a part in the larger picture.There aren't too many non-Belgian films set in Belgium, and Bruges is a beautiful but odd place to set an entire movie. You'll probably learn more about the place than you ever need to know as Ken narrates their sightseeing excursions with a few factoids about the place. The entire first act is driven by the chemistry between Farrell and Gleason as they deliver rapid-fire patter that reminds one of McDonagh's background as a playwright, but it makes them as immediately endearing as Vincent and Jules in \"Pulp Fiction,\" allowing for an even bigger impact as things happen to them. Our first encounter with the boys' boss Harry is an expletive filled telegraph and an equally amusing phone conversation with Ken, making it obvious that this is a mobster cut from the same cloth as Ben Kingsley's Don Logan. Those who don't recognize the voice will be thrilled when they learn who plays Harry, because it's a pleasant surprise.This is easily Colin Farrell's best role and performance in a long time, one that allows him to show a lot of range, not just as the big-mouthed prat we assume Ray to be, but also as a thoughtful man distraught about what happened in London. Having seen the error of his ways, he feels the need to make right, even if he hides it with a lot of complaining and arguments, and that carries over to Gleason's Ken, continuing his great run with McDonagh.McDonagh has created a clever script that interweaves its small cast of characters into an intricate crime caper that mixes humor, violence and true heartfelt human emotions into a brilliant debut feature. Just when you think you know where things are going, McDonagh throws a sharp curve ball at you and then another, and another, and pretty soon, what started as a two-handed talkie has turned into a hold-your-breath action flick, when Harry turns up in Bruges to rectify some business that Ken has botched. Even so, it never loses what made the first half so charming and entertaining, because McDonagh's impressive dialogue remains at the forefront for the extended confrontation between Ken and Harry. The ending might be somewhat grim for some tastes going by the lightness of what's gone before, but the way everything is tied together makes it all worth it.Anyone worried that Tarantino and Ritchie's best work might be behind them, can revel in the promise of McDonagh's take on the crime-comedy genre, as this talented filmmaker shows that \"Six Shooter\" was no fluke and this movie begins what's likely to be a long and promising film career. On top of that, if \"In Bruges\" doesn't end up being the funniest and most quotable movies of the year, then it should be very close",

            "content": "...in Bruges. Two Irish hit men (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell) are sent into hiding by their British boss (Ralph Fiennes) in Bruges, Belgium after a botched job only to learn that the most damning job awaits one of them just around the corner. Bruges is a picturesque tourist trap built around the oldest and best maintained medieval city in Belgium. Director and screenwriter Martin McDonagh bleeds the setting and the material for all its worth and makes his feature film debut in superb style.The dark comedy built around the existential quandaries of hit men has been done to death over the years. If last summer's \"You Kill Me\" was the relentlessly dark and relentlessly sitcom-y take on the genre, then \"In Bruges\" is the hipster art film take on the theme. McDonagh deserves all the credit in the world for breathing life into the stale story by texturing the tonal shifts with crisp digital camera-work (that is surprisingly haunting), deep character development, and by creating a wonderful sense of place. Imagine a Graham Greene novel (\"Brighton Rock\" specifically comes to mind) modernized by David Mamet. The dialog is super smart and wickedly un-PC while the comedy parts are as gut-busting as the crime thriller parts are suspenseful.McDonagh has also brought together an outstanding cast who thrive in the material. Farrell defies all odds and manages to be as sympathetic in the dramatic parts as he is charmingly sarcastic in the comedic parts. Brendan Gleeson gives a fantastically nuanced portrayal as Farrell's mentor and friend. Meanwhile, Ralph Fiennes channels the scary-as-hell energy he's used previously in \"Schindler's List\" and the recent \"Harry Potter\" films in a limber subversion that is a frighteningly fun to watch. The supporting cast is to die for, with Jordan Prentice spot-on as a coked-up dwarf actor shooting an abhorrent art film on the streets of Bruges, and Clemence Poesy coyly seductive and unforgettable as Farrell's unlikely local love interest.Ultimately \"In Bruges\" meanders down too many cobblestone paths, and one scene near the end involving a bell tower stretches credibility but adds necessary dramatic effect. Certain plot elements will turn off a large segment of the viewing audience. However, those with the right mindset will be greatly rewarded. \"In Bruges\" is hilarious, contemplative, sometimes scathing, often nihilistic, but marked by a shockingly hopeful undercurrent while tones shift and the colors of the human condition undulate in McDonagh's insightful light. The arrival of a commanding talent has been heralded...in Bruges.",

            "content": "What drove me to seeing 'In Bruges' in the first place was primarily great actors like Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes, and also for the concept and Bruges itself. 'In Bruges' is definitely not for all tastes, one can say that for a lot of films but 'In Bruges' is one of the more extreme examples. It is very foul mouthed with an extreme profanity laden script, is very uncompromisingly violent and its political incorrectness will put the easily offended and the faint hearted off. Three reasons not to see it if all this bothers you. It didn't bother me much though (having seen plenty of films with those approaches that still manage to be great). Neither did on the most part the ridiculousness that 'In Bruges' has been criticised for.What is meant by \"on the most part\"? 'In Bruges' weakest element, from a storytelling standpoint and for the film in general, is the ending. This to me was the only part of the film that went over the top on the ridiculousness to overblown proportions, and it just felt contrived and running out of ideas in feel. Carter Burwell's music score is a well written and quite lovely one on its own. Within the film and its mood though, it didn't fit however and juxtaposes too much in terms of tone.However, the performances are very good, excellent in the case of Gleeson (as always) and Fiennes having tons of fun as his sinister character. Wasn't expecting acting this good from Farrell, this is the best he's ever been and he is successful in providing an interesting character that was intended to be morally complex and not likeable. It's the relationship between Farrell and Gleeson that drives the story and drama, it was essential to the film's success and manages to be entertaining, affecting and thought-provoking,Photography is both gritty and beautiful, with a clear sense of style and atmosphere. Bruges not just looks wonderful, it also is treated like a character of its own quite rightly.Similarly successful is the script, which is surprisingly intelligent with a strong balance with thought-provoking philosophical musings, very funny black comedy and character moral complexity (not making the characters likeable but it was clear early on that the intent was for them never to be so) . The story absorbs and entertains, with the brutal holds no prisoners violence not feeling gratuitous, the central relationship being beautifully written and the despair and redemptions themes being surprisingly poignant.Overall, very good if understandably polarising. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Award winning playwright Martin McDonagh brings his amazing writing talents to the big screen and scores with his first turn as a feature film director. The city of Bruges (yes, in Belgium) is the perfect setting for the multi-layered story. Its well preserved medieval architecture is like an character unto itself.Colin Farrell delivers by far his best performance to date. He is funny, dangerous, sexy and emotional throughout. This is exceptional acting from a guy who tends to disappoint. Of course, it helps to have magnificent writing and this one most certainly delivers on that front. The dialogue is quirky and quick ... so tune in early.Strong work also from Brendon Gleeson, who all will recognize from \"Gangs of New York\" and the Harry Potter series. He is a tough guy with a streak of humanity. The third piece of the puzzle is Ralph Fiennes as the mastermind bad guy. The supporting work is fine from Jordan Prentice as the dwarf actor (sadly Mr. Prentice is most famous for playing Howard the Duck) and a very cute Clemence Poesy as Farrell's odd love interest.Very few writers can write dialogue like this and even fewer can juggle as many layers without making a film seem busy, crowded or forced. Hopefully Mr. McDonagh will bring more of his work to the big screen ... he certainly adds a touch of class!",

            "content": "I think that I will shortly be purchasing the Oscar winning short film Six Shooter from 2004. I've got an iTunes gift card for just the job. The thought occurred to me after seeing the wonderful debut from director Martin McDonagh, In Bruges. After seeing the trailer, which really worked for me, many times and wondering at how it is from an Oscar winning director yet never hearing of the name, I did some research. While he already has more little gold men than Alfred Hitchcock, his actual feature premiere is what has opened this weekend. It is Irish, most definitely, and if you have trouble with the accent, maybe you should steer clear until in comes out on DVD, however, if you can cope, this is a smart pitch black comedy. When I say pitch black, I mean black hole expanse of darkness. The trailer leads you to believe it will be an uproarious time, and while it is very funny and very smart, there is a tragic event that is held over the proceedings, lending a somber shadow over all that occurs. In the end though, it is consistent with its wit and drama, telling an intriguing story and never relying on the laughs to hide any plot point that the creators may not have wanted to work out to completion.If I am to gripe about anything, it will be the ending. Not the very end, however, as that is absolutely perfect. The camera-work, voice-over, and final shot cannot be argued, it is the climax that happens just before that rings false. It is the only moment like that, though, so I don't hold it against the film. McDonagh needed a way to get his characters to their arc's conclusions and if that means turning one of the roles, at first seeming to be there for jokes, into a pawn for a symmetrical kind of convenience, I'll give him that reprieve. As far as fitting with the story, yeah it works; it has to because the incident is alluded to unknowingly at many times during the course of the sightseeing romp. I guess I think it fits too well and wish McDonagh could have come up with another way to do it.Besides that, though, In Bruges is a great time at the theatre. Colin Farrell is steadily becoming a favorite of mine with his precise comic timing and broad facial expressions. I may be one of the few people on earth that loved his comedic turn in Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream, (yes I truly believe the comedy was intentional), and here he shows it was not a fluke. Kind of similar to his scene-stealing role in Intermission, he is a punk with a lousy disposition and disregard for tact. Here, however, he also has a conscience. This tug-of-war is ripe for laughs as he is a sweet guy, he just doesn't know how to keep his mouth shut. One-liners are in abundance and you will be laughing continuously. Brendan Gleeson helps this fact by being an effective straightman to play off of. He knows the score and tries to enjoy the \"fairytale\" city while his cohort sulks and puts on \"moods like a five year old\" because, honestly, unless you grew up on a farm and were slightly retarded, Bruges is really just hell on earth. (Actually, the city looks pretty great and I wouldn't mind checking it out once in my lifetime.) The periphery roles, and there are many, also add depth and interest to the film. Small characters like Eric Godon's alcove loving gun dealer, Jordan Prentice as a horse-tranquilizer taking midget actor (he played Howard the Duck, that is awesome), and Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy as the love interest and enigma Chol\u00eb all are fun and never quite feel just thrown in as jokes, but instead integral parts to the story. Of course, the great Ralph Fiennes is involved too. His accent and vocabulary rivals Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast and unfortunately is a much smaller part than anticipated from the trailer. Well maybe not unfortunately, because if he was in more it might have become a gimmick. I also couldn't help stop thinking of Harry Potter with Mad-Eye Moody, Lord Voldemort, and Fleur Delacour all involved.I highly recommend this film for anyone looking to see a good drama with comic overtones. Don't go in thinking this is to be a total good time, with laughs a minute, there is so much more to the tale that you may not expect or necessarily be hoping for. At times it is very dark and drains every molecule of happiness out of your heads, but thankfully a good joke or line will be coming shortly to alleviate the depression.",

            "review_title": "Atonement and Existentialism In Bruges",
            "content": "A European film through and through, showing its deep theatrical roots, \"In Bruges\" works on may levels, and is a fine night at the cinema.The film follows the denouement of a \"job\" gone bad for two Irish hit men, who are forced to hole up in Bruges, Belgium, and really can't stand the inactivity. The forced waiting, a symbolic purgatory in both assassins' struggle for absolution, gives Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell a chance to act through some marvelous comic dialogue.The film itself looks like it was filmed in an area of the old city of Bruges that is no more than a 500 square metre radius. It doesn't matter, because the film is a character study more than anything, and like all good theatre, the character interplay allows the audience to forget the confined spaces.Ralph Fiennes comes into the film late basically stealing Ben Kingsley's character from \"Sexy Beast\". This has to be an absolutely deliberate choice, so can't really be criticized. The writing is so good that Fiennes can have real fun with it. All the actors do, as a matter of fact.I have been deeply suspicious of Colin Farrell's ability to read a script in the past. His choices of projects in the past has been spotty. Not this time: his acting ability is brought to the fore by director and screenwriter Martin McDonagh. Farrell gives a very strong performance as a morally challenged hit-man.Brendan Gleeson has been around forever, and is a renowned character actor. You may remember him from \"Braveheart\" as Hamish Campbell, Mel Gibson's loyal adjutant. He is able to completely bury himself in this part. Colin Farrell has the capacity to reach these heights as well, and in fact, in this film, shows many of the mannerisms and intensity of Russell Crowe (whom I consider to be the best actor on the planet).I appreciated the comedy and satire working hand in hand with the moral complexity of the characters' inner struggles. It makes for a very satisfying film, one that is much more than entertainment. When you consider what the budget was in comparison to many Hollywood films, \"In Bruges\" serves as a reminder that it is the script and the quality of the direction that makes a film. Why Hollywood thinks they can just throw money into a project and expect people to come to the cinema is beyond me.",

            "content": "This movie is everything I love about movies. It's got great acting, great characters, great story, great dialogue. It's nothing short of amazing. I haven't seen Farrell in a roll like this before, but he certainly shines. Going from being a brat, to coked up as all hell, to depressed in a matter of minutes and it's hilarious as well as heart breaking.Gleeson is fantastic in his role too! He plays a perfect mix of cold and calculating, still being sophisticated and also has a conscience of sorts.Every scene in this movie develops either character or story, and the story unfolds so flawlessly with every passing scene. Going from thinking Ray is just being an arrogant brat to realizing what he has done and why he's acting like he is is a truly fascinating journey, and you can't quite tell whether to laugh or be upset by it, sometimes doing a bit of both at once.The dialogues and delivery are truly perfect, and it leaves us with so many quotable lines about topics from saving someone you were going to kill from suicide and having a discussion with him about it afterwards to race wars with midgets. Sorry, \"Dwarves\". The wife telling Harry to bring \"the fellas\" as he leaves and him apologizing for calling her an inanimate object because he was upset brings so much depth to characters and their relationship only from a minute-long scene. True magic with regards to acting and dialogue. This is why dialogue and acting is so important. It brings us closer to the person behind the character and gives the story immensely more depth and excitement.A cinematic masterpiece!",

            "review_title": "Nice Blend Of Drama And Comedy",
            "content": "One of the problems with seeing a trailer for a film is it creates an expectation. If it raises expectations, and the film delivers, great. However, if the film is less then expected, then the viewer feels cheated. The best case scenario is the one I found myself in before I saw In Bruges. Low expectations.After seeing the trailer, In Bruges looked like a plodding British comedy with little originality and repetitious humor, hence the low expectations. Yet, In Bruges exceeded my minimal expectations, and, unlike my impression from the trailer, was an original drama with good acting and a nice blend of comedy mixed in. It was funny in the right places and appropriately dramatic when the story shifted into high gear towards the end.Set in, no surprise here, Bruges, Belgium, the plot focuses on two London hit men, Ray played by Colin Farrell, and Ken, played by Brendan Gleeson. The pair is sent to Belgium after Ray botches his first hi. And therein lies the humor, Ray has no interest in being in the medieval city, and Ken wants to sight see.I've never really liked Colin Farrell but who knew he had such a good sense of comedic timing? There is a running gag involving fighting with a bottle, and karate, that he manages to keep fresh as it pops up throughout the film. Brendan Gleeson's character provides the moral center and plays the straight man to Farrell's Ray. This works well as the movie turns more serious towards the end. However, for my money, the best performance is delivered by Ralph Fiennes who plays Harry the pair's criminal overlord back in London. Whereas Gleeson character embodies the moral center, Fiennes's Harry fills the role of principled immorality, if there is such a thing. Fiennes creates a character with a dubious moral center and is a quite believable figure of menace when he travels to Bruges to square off with Ken. Also, of note, is Jordan Prentice, an irritable dwarf who's in town to act in a movie filming there. His ramblings in one scene, about a coming race war, is worth the price of admission right there.The only aspect of the film that didn't work for me was Ray's love interest. Early in the film he manages to woo Chloe, a drug dealer with, drum roll please, a heart of gold. For my tastes, the budding romance seems a little forced and comes across more as a vehicle for jokes and drama. But it's a small thing and I doubt anyone but me would notice.I intentionally left a lot of plot points out, because, as I've mentioned, this film surprised me in a good way and I don't won't to ruin it for anyone else.In Bruges is a good film. Go see it.At the very least, it'll make you want to visit Bruges.",

            "content": "The idea of a film about a couple of foul-mouthed Irish hit men laying low in Bruges after one of them has accidentally killed a child in a church doesn't sound like a barrel of laughs but there are plenty of laugh out loud moments in this black comedy.The two men are Ken, the older of the two who loves the culture and history in the ancient town and Ray who thinks two weeks stuck in Bruges is like purgatory. Ray is having difficulty coming to terms with the fact that he killed a child to such an extent that he is contemplating suicide... he might not have to do it however as Ken gets a call from Harry, their employer, telling him he is to kill Ray. Of course nothing goes quite as expected, Ray falls in love with a local con-woman and ends up dealing with her less than competent ex-boyfriend who threatens him with a revolver, a dwarf who has some strange views about race when on drugs and some large American tourists who don't like being told they are too big to go up a church tower.The Martin McDonagh wrote a great script the brilliantly directed a cast of talented actors; Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell were great as Ken and Ray, they are able supported by Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy as Ray's new girlfriend Chloe, Thekla Reuten as pregnant hotel owner Marie and Ralph Fiennes as the two killers' employer who had a strict rule about never hurting a child.If you are offended by swearing give this film a wide birth as it contains almost non-stop bad language, it also contains some bloody violence that might bother some viewers, however if these things don't bother you then I'd strongly recommend this, a laughed out loud many times and won't deny that I also shed a few tears.",

Ray is a lovable young man and Ken is his paternal superior. The duo have just completed a job in London, but things didn't go well; Ray accidentally shot a child.Guilt-ridden, Ray spends the rest of the film in a suicidal daze. Ken sympathises with the guy, and the duo have a number of touching conversations. These are the two most touchy-feely assassins since John Cusack in \"Grosse Point Blank\".McDonagh's plot later takes focus when the duo's crime boss arranges for Ken and Ray to travel to Bruges, a small town in Northern Belgium. Ken views this as a vacation, an opportunity to explore the historical city, but Ray hates the place, he wants to die or perhaps hook up with pretty local girls.McDonagh lays the symbolism on thick during the film's first 40 minutes. Bruges is portrayed as Purgatory, a transition point between Earth and judgement, with Hieronymus Bosch paintings, ominous dialogue and much talk of sins needing be repaid. Several noir elements are also set up (bottles, midgets, stairs, prostitutes, weight, fat people, lists, rivers, guns), all of which come into play during McDonagh's final act. Here his characters increasingly find themselves buffeted by, not only their warrior code, but noir fate.Midway into the film, Ken receives a message from his boss: his new mission is to kill his partner Ray, a long-standing clich\u00e9 in assassin movies (see even the recent \"The American\"). Ken refuses and his boss grows furious. The film then ends with your typical final act shootout, though the script is smart enough to subvert expectations at times. McDonaghand has enough wit to mock genre conventions, but isn't strong enough to create his own rules.7.9/10 - Can't compete with John Cusack's \"Grosse Point Blank\". Both films feature neurotic assassins and attempt to mix action with humour, but \"Grosse Point\" trumps \"In Bruges\" in virtually every category. It's funnier, wittier, has more action, and it's character's are ultimately more touching. \"In Bruges\" is neither serious enough to be a major dramatic work, nor funny enough to be a memorable comedy.Worth one viewing.",

As they wait for instruction from Harry the pair start to address many things that are troubling them, with one pressing matter particularly relevant to their lives post the Bruges visit.Written and directed by Martin McDonagh, a man more known for his play writing abilities, In Bruges is a rare old animal indeed. Not only is it a winner in the very wobbly sub-genre that encompasses the British gangster movie, it's also a hugely funny and tasteless button pusher to boot. From the outset the film sets itself up to not be to everybody's cup of tea. As Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson exchange expletive after expletive whilst surrounded by the considerable beauty of Bruges, it's obvious this is not going to be a \"normal\" movie. Throw in drug abuse, prostitution and a racist dwarf, well you can understand why the film is seen as unpalatable to some - yet still be digestible brilliance to others. What is for sure is that those who haven't seen it really should do so for it may just become one of your favourite movies, yes, it really does deserve the chance to pull you on board.By definition, it's an ultimate black comedy, But in amongst the laughs, and there are many, lies a potent and affecting human drama involving love, guilt, morals and redemption. With the trick pulled by McDonagh being that of having every character in the piece dislikable, and yet easy to be on side with. Don't be surprised if you find yourself welling up with emotion during some of the more critical scenes. For the screenplay (BAFTA Award Winning) and the performances of Farrell (Golden Globe Award Best Actor) & Gleeson are razor sharp and very involving. Even Fiennes' spiv gangster boss is shown to be a ruthless sweary anger merchant, yet still capable of apology and genuinely respective of good principals. If that sounds odd? Then good, because it's an odd and strange little movie. I mean the love interest comes in the form of pretty Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy, a criminal femme fatale type here, but once \"Fleur Delacour\" in \"Harry Potter\" & \"The Goblet Of Fire\". While Canadian dwarf actor Jordan Prentice is more well known for playing \"Howard The Duck\". Each of them serving genuine purpose, both for the funny side of the story, and for the more humanistic elements that unravel as we hurtle towards to the coup de gr\u00e2ce a like finale.A barbed wire black comedy led by a towering performance from Farrell - where just like him you should laugh, cry and swear to your hearts content. 9/10",

However, I went to see it anyways, and let me just say that by the end credits I was completely shocked out how much I actually liked this movie. It was not only very funny but you were able to connect with the characters in a way you didn't think you would. The plot was def. very interesting and kept my attention the whole way through. Only real problem I had with the movie was that it was a little bit too long, but it didn't take away from anything. I should also say that I'm not a huge Colin Farrell fan, but after this movie I believe that he has proved that he can hold his own with the other leading men out there. I thought there were some beautiful moments that they captured on film where you see him dealing with his characters inner demons. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for something \"different\", if you're sick of seeing the same \"hollywood-esque\" movies, then please give this movie a shot. If anything, enjoy it for the witty dialogue.",

            "content": "I first saw the dark comedy-thriller IN BRUGES (IB) in our local multiplex back in April 2008, and I loved it immediately. No wonder writer/director Martin McDonagh's screenplay went on to be nominated for an Oscar, and co-star Colin Farrell won a Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Comedy/Musical! When McDonagh's short film SIX SHOOTER, starring Brendan Gleeson, won the 2005 Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film, I was already familiar with his plays (including the 2005 Broadway hit THE PILLOWMAN with our family's household fave Jeff Goldblum), so I looked forward to seeing Gleeson work with McDonagh again in IB. I wasn't disappointed. McDonagh's quirky, funny, soul-searching dialogue is a joy to hear. It's chock full of profanity, but the delivery renders it more comical than offensive. The filmmakers even spoof the \"adult language\" in one of the DVD's bonus features, a montage of every time the word \"F***\" is used in IB.Gleeson and Farrell make a great seriocomic team as Ken and Ray, two Irish hit men who have suspenseful and surreal adventures hiding out in Belgium in the magnificent city of Bruges after their latest job goes horribly, heartbreakingly wrong. They're the ultimate odd-couple tourists as they await further instructions from their boss, with Ken enjoying the sightseeing and the swans as Ray spews forth befuddled, unfavorable, hilariously un-PC opinions of just about everything and everyone he encounters, except a pretty Flemish production assistant (Clemence Poesy of 127 HOURS), who's as full of surprises as our undercover assassins. Farrell gives one of his very best performances, blending laugh-out-loud comedy and guilt-ridden heartache beautifully. My favorite running gag was Ray's childlike fascination with dwarfs, and his oafish but well-meant concern for cokehead dwarf actor Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), who's in the fairytale-like city to appear in a dream sequence in a local indie art-house flick. As Harry, the boys' crime boss, Ralph Fiennes does a terrific job channeling Sir Ben Kingsley as the terrifying Don in SEXY BEAST (I assure you, that's a compliment!). IB mixes suspense, melancholia, and hilarity very well indeed. Along with THE BANK JOB, IB was my favorite crime film of 2008. The DVD's featurettes and deleted scenes are fun, too, including interviews, a captioned boat tour of Bruges, and a deleted scene involving Matt Smith in his pre-DOCTOR WHO days -- and a machete! The many deleted scenes are all quite entertaining; I'm sure they were only cut so IB wouldn't be a 3-hour epic! :-)",

There's comedy, beautiful cinematography, and awesome action scenes, albeit scattered throughout and absent at times when the viewer may be growing weary. I'd highly recommend seeing this movie.

Though it does.In Bruges is a black comedy for grown ups not because it consciously satisfies our skulking childishness, our 'incorrect' urge to lash out at convention , say f*ck the lot 'o ya's, fist someone in the mouth for good measure and then offer a fast talking and wickedly funny apology. And it does all that too.In Bruges is grown up cinema because despite being sexy, fun and stylish, it is emotionally literate. Is that allowed?The complexity of Martin McDonagh's screen play is manifold, developing and delineating character through dialogue as much as action. Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrel inhabit their characters with equal and at times forceful skill, displaying flawless comic timing and sensitivity. Together they breathe 'real life' into the hyperbolic corpse of a bloated genre that never quite realised it died some time ago. McDonagh's characters realise too late they've been c*nts, one way or another, and far too late, begin to grow. Characters with history, in emotional distress, barely conscious or all too aware. They do what we might in their shoes. And as they trace the outline of their own destruction in lines of cocaine or spilled beer, their conceit, self loathing, compassion or stubbornness lays them all bare. There is a cost for all of them, characters on a human scale, acting out their tragedy in recognisable terms. In Bruges is as morally instructive as it is dramatically satisfying, almost becoming a medieval mystery play in the setting of the title.Finally In Bruges is a dangerously perfect fusion of plot, meaning and story. Ripples of understanding run back and forth across the surface of the experience, hinting at the themes which swim powerfully beneath. A film this genuinely startling doesn't happen very often.",

If you liked \"The Limey\" and/or \"The Matador\", I think you'll like this one. Really I thought I'd like this one, but didn't expect it to be as satisfying as it was.Colin Farrell really should be considered for an Oscar for this performance. He plays Ray, a troubled hit-man who is struggling to come to terms with the aftermath of a hit gone wrong. While some commenters have noted Ray's erratic behavior, few have mentioned his quite profound crisis of conscience. Some might say he has no conscience but that is undercut by the moral code to which the hit men in this film adhere. This one act has thrown him completely off-course and he acts out in anti-social (and very funny) ways. He insults other tourists; he is excessively irritated by minor things. He is completely disinterested in sightseeing in the beautiful medieval city (it's in Belgium) where he and and his laid-back accomplice, Ken (the ever professional Brendan Gleeson) have been sent with instructions to lay low until they get their next word from their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes playing a character whose job and demeanor seem very similar to those of Ben Kingsley in \"Sexy Beast.\" That said, Fiennes, makes this role his own with his passion and intelligence).Director Martin McDonagh, as mentioned, has a flare for capturing the ultimately sad human essence of hit men. He does not glamorize them but captures them at their most mundane. The laughs seem all the funnier for their very universality. That said, he never loses sight of the fact that this story is really about hit men attempting to come to terms with what they have done. It lends the story a sobering undertone which ensures the movie will stay with you for a long time. Farrell is absolutely at the top of his game. Fiennes is (like Ben Kingsley in \"Sexy Beast\") scarily psychotic, and Brendan Gleeson is, like others have said in comments, the moral center of the film. The conclusion is satisfying and appropriate and I cannot wait to see what McDonagh does next.",

            "content": "Went to see it for the setting. Loved it for the dialogue. Wished it had just gone a bit further.In Bruges is a dark comedy set in the beautiful medieval town of Bruges, Belgium, featuring an Irish duo of hit men who have been ordered by their boss to hide out there after a high-profile job in London went sour. Their instructions are to keep a low profile, sightsee, and generally avoid trouble until further notice.But all is not as it seems.The dialogue between Gleeson and Farrell is witty, delivered with perfect comic timing, zany, and a joy to watch. Farrell and the charming Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy also have great chemistry and are fun to watch on screen. The humour is designed to make viewers uncomfortable, and succeeds remarkably on this count. If you're looking for political correctness, you won't find it here. What you will find are jabs at Americans, tourists, gays, blacks, whites, fat people, and oh yeah, midgets. As this odd assortment of characters mixes and mingles in the streets of Bruges, the tension builds.And there's just enough of a psychological dark edge to keep things interesting. This is a comedy, yes, but it's by no means light and fluffy. This movie has been compared to The Big Hit or The Whole Nine Yards, but in fact, it's much, much darker. And in my opinion, that makes it better.Shot entirely on location in Bruges, the backdrop is of course stunning. I originally went to see this knowing absolutely nothing about it other than the title, simply because, having visited Bruges, I couldn't resist an opportunity to see it on the big screen. Filmed in the wintertime and largely at night, Bruges itself is one of the stars of the movie. Like the other characters, it is not portrayed as light, airy, innocent or picturesque, the way it is in real life. Instead, its more haunting quality is captured elegantly on film, with a heavy mist giving the town a sort of eerie, dream-like quality.So much of this movie was just right, and I highly recommend it to people who like twisted humour and aren't easily offended.I have two issues with this film, however. The first is the score. The music is completely wrong for this movie, giving it a feel that doesn't work at all with the dark comedy tone. The melancholy, slow, stirring music would've worked nicely with a drama or a psychological period piece, but just seems out of place here.The second issue is with the ending. Nope, I won't give it away. Suffice to say, I thought it was wrong, wrong, wrong. All wrong. Almost as though the author couldn't figure out what to do next or how to end this thing.But overall, I really enjoyed In Bruges. It was wickedly funny, daringly different, and fantastically non-PC. And the shots of Bruges are wonderful. Despite what the main characters say about the place, Bruges is really quite wonderful. I suggest seeing both the movie and the city.",

In the case of the worst I am trying to work out just why they are so bad, in the case of the best, like In Bruges, the rare 10s, they make such an impact that I cannot get them out of my head. It was only later that I realised that Martin McDonagh has, apparently, lifted his basic situation - two hit men whiling away the time waiting for instructions as to their next victim - from Harold Pinter's early one-act stage play The Dumb Waiter. However The Dumb Waiter ends when the message (the same one as in In Bruges) arrives. McDonagh then extends the scenario in quite unexpected directions, the foundations of which have been meticulously laid, sometimes by a mere throwaway line or gesture, earlier in the film. The film is full of memorable moments - dialogue, incident or characterisation - that interweave to form an indelible impression.Some of the comments posted seem to take exception to the fact that In Bruges is difficult to categorise - that terrible compulsion of the film industry to fit every film into a \"genre\". This is a film that is genuinely uncategorisable. It is often very funny, sometimes poignant and touching, sometimes darkly frightening, always thought-provoking. To categorise it as, say, a \"comedy-thriller\" would be to seriously sell its qualities short.There is one very good reason for the film's special elusive quality - it is very Irish. Although strictly speaking it would not count as an Irish production and Martin McDonagh was born in London, all his stage writing stems from a strong Irish sensibility and it is no accident that the two leading characters are played by Irish actors (albeit actors familiar to an American audience playing Americans!). The ability to see pathos behind humour, as well as the funny side of tragedy, is a peculiarly Irish trait.The brilliance of the script is matched by superb performances from the two leads as well as all the supporting cast, however small the part. The only weak link (and it is a very minor criticism) is Ralph Fiennes as the boss figure who, as one other posting commented, was more convincing on the phone than in person, perhaps, as many have pointed out, because of unfavourable comparison with Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast. Brendan Gleeson is, as always, impeccable, Colin Farrell gives his best performance since Intermission, both are subtle and totally believable. The supporting characters are so effective partly because they are very well cast, partly because they have been written with such attention to detail. Almost my favourite moment is when the hotel owner hands over a phone message from the boss, carefully typed out including all the obscenities, with a personal hand-written correction at the bottom - \"I am not the receptionist...\".I am hoping that by writing the above I will be able to stop myself thinking about In Bruges, but somehow I doubt it!",

The spoiler here is that the story takes over by the very end and the structure of the story forces the characters to knowingly act as they know they must. Even at great sacrifice. This works by two means. One is conventional: the code of the assassins is underscored as it is in hundreds of movies. This is supplemented by the nature of the place as a sort of purgatory which has its own rules leading toward passage.But there's a second writerly trick at work here. Its the use of story fragments being introduced at one point in the story in such a way that they are tagged with significance. Then those story dynamics take on a life of their own and retouch the narrative later on. An example is that the threat of a bottle is introduced. Later, that threat appears. Its only done there and a few other times so we can subconsciously read the sense of the story. Midgets dying. Guns in rivers. Written instruction. Weight and climbing stairs. Prostitutes.Of course the all-important film within the film makes an appearance. So this sets us up for the noir-driven ending where an earlier story element inserts itself taking control.Ferrell always understood this method, even as Bullseye. He's good, that one.

His performance, at times he is funny, at times, his performance centralizes over all the drama, all the twists. His accent, his expressions, a perfect performance, and he certainly deserves an Oscar nomination, I happen to think it is one of the best male performances of the decade. The film plays out soft and quiet, it certainly is a life-learning experience in a way. The film takes us on this man's journey, his journey with his partner, and his journey into the world of hit men, and the film makes something new. It makes this world a sort of livelier place to be, a sort of warm place, but only at the right times. The film is beautifully shot, and it makes it's points about the city Bruges. The cinematography is just gorgeous, as well as the haunting music score, that is manages to make every scene filled with more passion and emotion.In Bruges is very memorable, because it does things differently, it is not just a crime film, it is not just a comedy, it stands in the middle.

They must have taken their cue from boss man Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes), who honorably killed himself at the end of the picture when he wound up shooting Jimmy by accident. I would have expected nothing less, although to be accurate, Jimmy wasn't a kid, so Harry would have had some leeway there. I'd have to assume Ray made it back to London at some point, seeing as how his narration closed out the picture, but the ending could just as easily be left up to the imagination of the viewer.

Normally I despise the excessive use of the 'F' word. In the script & the way these fine actors use them it seems natural & normal.Colin Farrell & Brendan Gleeson are 2 hit men hiding out (in plain sight) in the Medieval city BRUGES BELGIUM, they are waiting to hear from there boss superbly enacted by Ralph Fiennes. In fact all 3 actors could be nominated for acting honours at this years end.I must also mention the following players for there outstanding work,Clemencie Posey as a native lass of the city,She is new & a breath of fresh air, hopefully she will be in many more films.Also Jordan Prentice just about steals the few scenes he is in, He happens to be Dwarf & has great talent & promise as an actor.The entire production is first rate.NOTE,, Bruges dates back to the 12 th century & most buildings are many hundreds of years old. They seem very well preserved. (Gee Whiz, here in the good 'ole' USA,If a building is 50 years old its torn down & we do nothing about it.)Due to the language & subject matter as well as some violence at the conclusion I do not recommend this for children, ALSO there are NO CGI action scenes, It is a film with great dialogue between the actors, mainly between Farrell & Gleeson.DO NOT MISS THIS FILM . It will be high on most best lists.Ratings ****(out of 4) 98 points (out of 100) IMDb 10 (out of 10)_",

Farrell shows excellent comic timing and gets most of the best lines. The supporting cast are all good, everyone is believable.The humour is often very politically incorrect but never in a nasty way, the dialogue is superb and there are some great set pieces and unexpected comic twists to catch you by surprise and make you laugh out loud.The dramatic side handles a very dark and emotional subject very deftly with believable switches from humour to sadness and the leads really earn there money by pulling those switches off seamlessly.There is a lot of action and violence especially towards the end and this throws in ideas that I had never seen used before.If you liked the film \"Intermission\" you'll definitely like this, but this has more and better jokes and the plot is far more interesting.I've rarely left a cinema feeling I got as much value for my money as I did with this film.",

            "content": "If The Dark Knight is the film with the biggest most grandiose hype surrounding it this year, then In Bruges would be the biggest sneaky surprise. Not only is the writing as snappy and perfectly honed as any other film, big or small, this year but boasts career high performances from the entirety of its cast. Dark comedies are hard to master, and this is certainly the most worthwhile I have seen since Lethal Weapon creator Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang; especially with far lesser attempts such as War Inc. fouling up the pond.Bruges, the capital of West Flanders in Belgium (pronounced 'Broo-jiz') serves as the quirky setting for second time director Martin McDonagh, and the cinematography and art direction immerses the viewer into this abstract setting. In Bruges evokes a somewhat dreamlike carriage which is efficiently echoed by journey of the characters. This beguiling fable follows two hit men, the distraught and emotionally fragile Ray (Colin Farrell) and the gentle fatherly Ken (Brendan Gleeson) sent by their irritable and emotionally erratic employer Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to Bruges to fulfill a hit. Complicating the situation is Ray's unstable mental state, which was shaken on an earlier job when a young boy was caught in the crossfire, and which has left quite suicidal. The surreal surroundings of Bruges leave Ray wanting, but thrills Ken with its Gothic storybook refinement. Things become even more phantasmal during the meeting of a movie star dwarf, played by Jordan Prentice and with the development of an unlikely relationship between Ray and a local girl, Chloe (Cl\u00e9mence Pos\u00e9y). These circumstances sway the line between a dreamworld and the bleak reality of the duos proffesions, but never to the extent where the film could be considered a physiological bind-bender by any means.Colin Farrell has always been a solid actor, but needs to rethink his agent, as his roles carry from routine action flicks which leave him emotionally grounded, to art house flops that become far to precious and quirky for their own good. Farrell gives the performance of his career, flawlessly blurring the line between a coy smart-aleck and tragic silhouette. Gleeson is equally sensational, again showing, like never before, his acting chops. I cannot say that Ralph Fiennes gives his best here, as that distinction belongs with his astounding portrayal of Amon Goeth in Schindler's List but it is certainly his most accomplished since then. Pos\u00e9y is delightful and complex for her small role, and Prentice proves that an actor of his stature does not have to be typecast in meaningless roles.As amazing as the ensemble cast is, kudos are justly due to McDonough, whose writing chops provide the drole and solid foundation for the performances. This effort is simultaneously hilarious, tragic and mystical; and the three blend seamlessly. Unlike other films cut from the same cloth, In Bruges never lets its quirkiness take the story, setting and characters hostage. It is involving and endearing, with countless meaningful undercurrents, and as a whole this film demands repeat viewings; an order I am highly pleased to fill. There is also some gunplay and bloodshed for those who find themselves hard-pressed to sit through a film completely devoid of a scuffle or two. Really, In Bruges takes a bit of everything, and perhaps that is best suited to the continually surreal surroundings that we find the two immersed in, and although risking a lot with such a direction, it never seems scattershot or incoherent. And after this infinitely satisfying adventure, in Bruges was the only place I wanted to be.View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",

To be receptive to it, you must be ready for graphic violence, constant extreme bad language, drug abuse, moral ambiguity, and massive political incorrectness.If you can accept that, you are in for a treat. You get an unusual story with threads which tie together unexpectedly, strong characterisation, much splendid black and tasteless humour, sharp dialogue, brilliant acting and, despite the fact that the main characters are unsavoury in many respects, a fundamental underlying sense of humanity.This film is shocking, gripping, touching, uncomfortable, and eye-wateringly funny.I was very, very impressed.",

            "content": "What a splendidly executed dramatic comedy about two Irish hit men wandering around the ancient city of Bruges, Belgium. Everything seems to come together, everything synchronized, and the chief credit must go to the writer and director, Martin McDonagh, with myriad plaudits left over for the actors, the photographer, the typically insinuating score by Carter Burwell, and all the other elements of the film.Colin Farrell is a hit man in London. On his first assignment from boss Ralph Fiennes, he shoots a priest and, accidentally, a little boy waiting to make his confession. The guilt haunts him although, aside from the occasional act of putting a pistol to his head and cocking it, it doesn't otherwise seem to interfere with his enjoyment of life.Farrell and another murderer, the plump but perceptive Brendan Gleeson, are sent to Bruges to await a phone call from Fiennes identifying their next target. While sitting around, instead of twiddling their thumbs, they visit the medieval Old City at Gleeson's insistence. Farrell is nervous and impatient, while Gleeson is enthralled by the cathedrals, the canal, and \"The Last Judgment,\" a triptych by Heironymous Bosch. It prompts Farrell to observe that Bruges itself might serve as a proper Hell.In fact, it just about does. Gleeson finally receives the long-awaited call from Fiennes, who inquires about Farrell's appreciation of Bruges. Did he visit the cathedral? Yes. Did he see all the paintings? Yes. The canal? Yes, but Gleeson doesn't think that's Farrell's \"thing.\" Did he see the swans? Are the swans still there? Yes. (Long pause on the phone.) \"Well then what does he ****ing mean, it's not his ****ing thing?\" Fiennes has sent the two of them there intending this trip to be a last present to Farrell, whom Gleeson must now kill for having murdered that young boy, a violation of principle which must be atoned for. In the end, Gleeson refuses. Fiennes himself comes to Bruges to straighten things out and there is a violent climax.The brutality is as gory and realistic as the comedy is funny. The dialog sparkles, and there were some lines and some conversational exchanges that made me laugh out loud. The characters are quirky and interesting in themselves. Farrell gets wildly excited when he sees a movie crew filming a scene with a dwarf. \"There filming MIDGETS!\" he exclaims, running to the shoot.This is pretty dangerous territory for a movie, when you get right down to it. You know -- whimsy involving idiosyncratic hit men, a pregnant concierge, a dwarf who complains about how much **** he's had to take from black midgets, cocaine, a Russian arms dealer who wonders if he's using the right word when he talks about \"alcoves\", a beautiful young woman who supplies film crews with dope. It's the kind of story that could easily try to coast along on its phantasmic charm. But the plot is strong enough to hold in one channel the divagations into saintly relics and restaurant fist fights with Americans who complain about Europeans blowing cigarette smoke in their direction. That last incident, the one about smoking in a restaurant, is emblematic of the entire film. It's a misunderstanding, and a bloody one. The impulsive Farrell decks the American, Zeljko Ivanek, saying, \"That's for John Lennon, you ****,\" only to discover later that the American was a Canadian and that he, Farrell, had made another violent error.Well, I guess I won't go on about it although, to be sure, we're talking about more than just two murderers taking a vacation in Belgium. There are religious undertones -- or, more generally, moral ones -- galore. The logic doesn't always maintain its integrity. (Eg., Farrell is supposed to be eliminated because he accidentally killed a little boy -- but whacking the priest during confession was okay?)I'm not so sure that kids would either understand it or enjoy it but see it when you get a chance.",

            "content": "Hit men Ray and Ken have been sent to Bruges to lay low for a while and await a call from their criminal boss Harry. They are meant to stay near the phone in the evening and are free to sightsee during the day but Ray is less than impressed with his surroundings even in Ken is soaking it all in. While they await further instructions, the two talk over things, travel round the city, get involved with some of the cast and crew making a film and generally fail to stay out of trouble or maintain a low profile.In Bruges was sold as a hilarious comedy and this in combination with the names involved made me want to check it out. It was mis-sold but this is not to say that the film still wasn't pretty good. It is occasionally laugh-out-loud funny but it is only occasionally and mostly the tone is very black, with humour coming laced with violence. On the flip of this approach though the film does still have a plot where the characters are in danger and it does still expect to pack a narrative and emotional punch. Both sides are OK but they do not work as well together as I would have liked. When it is funny the film is brilliant, with great lines juxtapositioning with the often violent situations they are in and this darkly comic stuff really appealed to me but the downside is that it does make it harder to suddenly launch into a more dramatic film where we really need to feel the danger. This is difficult given we have just watched danger being dealt with in a comic and offhand way, so my heart was not really in it in the later stages of the film.When the violence is handled with humour, it doesn't bother me much but the gore and the impact of the violence is pretty harshly depicted, which again makes the film a little hard to \"enjoy\" in the way I was in the first half of the movie. Really it needed to go one way or the other for definite so that there was an overall direction for the film because, as it is, it does feel like two different approaches with a reasonable blend in the middle. The cast make it work though and you can see from their performances that they know they are the whole show here. Farrell impressed me with his comedy abilities and although he did remind me of Father Dougal at times, he is really good here, getting laughs and being able to deliver sudden brutality. Gleeson is equally good and the film is great when the two of them are allowed to play off one another. Fiennes helps the latter stages of the film work because his performance is strong \u0096 injecting dark energy into the film just when it needed something to carry it across the end. Reuten and Prentice are OK but are very much secondary to the main three.Overall In Bruges is not a brilliant or hilarious film but it does more or less work and entertain throughout. The darker it gets the less it works and the ending is not as strong as the first half of the film but mostly the darkly comic and brutal material does work thanks to the really good playing from the three main actors, while Bruges itself provides a picturesque background. Come to it with low expectations and it will probably charm and engage you but it is not quite as good as some would have you believe.",

            "content": "There is something to admire about In Bruges. It's a black comedy, which is the hardest genre to make, as it comes with all possible pitfalls of both humor and drama. It's ambitious in themes and symbolism. The script makes an ingenious use of set-ups and pay-offs: every element or character introduced in the first half has a relevant consequence in the second - a sort of Chekhov's armory.And its premise is intriguing: killers Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Gleeson) hide in Bruges after a botched assassination, waiting for further instructions by their boss Harry (Fiennes). Ray is fuming with boredom and irritation; older, pensive Ken enjoys the atmosphere of the enchanting medieval town - until Harry orders him to kill Ray.Writing in this movie has something of a cult following. Humor is subjective, but I found it hit-and-miss. See, the problem isn't the amount of jokes about gays, blacks, yankees and dwarfs (the latter turned into a painful running gag); Tarantino, for one, thrives on this politically incorrect stuff - except he is actually funny, has a point to make and a gift with words this script doesn't display. Smug cynicism is mistaken for humor; we are supposed to laugh because a man child is obsessed with \"midgets\". You can wax philosophical, portray Bruges as a sort of purgatory, fill the movie with imagery straight from Bosch... but, after the fourth dwarf joke, your lofty ambitions scrape against your facile humor - it wasn't that funny even the first time, McDonagh. See a confrontation between Ray and Harry when a pregnant woman angrily stops the armed men waving guns in her hotel and, when they agree to go kill each other outside, quips \"You people are crazy!\". This isn't \"deep\", it's a sketch. Confront it with another aborted Mexican standoff - the one at the end of Pulp Fiction, which had humor, tension and the affecting musings of a man rethinking his life.Ray, who has the central arc, is unbelievable: a killer who acts like a goofy 10-years-old and switches between moping for his hatred of Bruges, pursuing a local girl (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy) and feeling devastated for accidentally shooting a kid. That's not a character, it's a coat rack for a writer's unused ideas. More coherent and interesting is Gleeson's melancholic Ken. For the definitive black comedy about anti-heroes dealing with honor, karma and atonement, watch Pulp Fiction. For more light-hearted crime comedies, good picks are Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang - and, for a straight-up comedy about neurotic killers, Richard Armitage's Grosse Pointe Blank.What's odd is, McDonagh's following (and better) movie Seven Psychopaths is the opposite of this - a paper-thin premise, but a script which is actually amusing.5,5/10",

Their boss, Harry, figures the medieval city will be perfect to get this duo away from all the commotion the crime has caused back home. Ray, doing his first job has to get rid of a priest. In doing so, he also kills an innocent child on his way to confession. The mere idea in killing a minor is something so repugnant, that even the criminal boss is horrified.Harry remembering fondly the time he visited that lovely old city, decides to send the two men there. Ken, who is older, and wiser, decides to take it easy and tries to discover the hidden treasures of Bruges, while Ray, a much younger and inexperienced man thinks the city stinks, literally. Having them share a room is too much for Ray. Ken, on the other hand, doesn't appreciate his babysitting job, knowing his younger partner is a loose cannon.Ray discovers the gorgeous Chloe that appears to be working in a movie being shot in the city. Ray wants to have fun, finding that Chloe is game for whatever. As they are getting comfortable at her place, her boyfriend Eirik, arrives wielding a gun and pointing it to Ray, who is able to get it from him. Little did he know it had blank bullets. In the struggle Ray fires a shot wounding Eirik in one eye.Ken receives an urgent message from Harry, he must eliminate Ray. Ken is not mentally prepared to execute what Harry wants from him. In fact, when he finds the proper time to do it, he changes his mind ans asks Ray to go away and try to stay away from Ireland and England, but as fate has it, Ray is found out by the police because of a violent encounter with a Canadian tourist at a restaurant.Harry decides he cannot trust Ken. He shows up in Bruges to take care of business. The confrontation has Harry and Ken going to a tower that faces the main square. What happens next will surprise us because of the way things develop. The ending parallels what happened to Ray when he killed the boy by accident. In this instance Harry proves he might be a criminal also, but one with scruples.\"In Bruges\" is a fine film by playwright turned director Martin McDonagh, whose \"Leenanne Trilogy\", \"The Liutenant of Inishmore\" and other plays have delighted theater goers in the last decade, decided to work on an original story that he magnificently sets in the gorgeous, and touristy city of Bruges, Belgium. Mr. McDonagh shows why he is one of the best writers working these days. With this debut he makes probably the impossible task of making a film that everybody will use as a base of comparison against his future films.The cast is first rate. Brendan Gleeson, the star of his short film, \"Six Shooter\" was born to play Ken, the older criminal that has seen a lot during his hard life in that world. This actor clearly shows why he is one of the best character actors around. Equally surprising is Colin Farrell. This actor brings an intensity to his Ray, the ambitious young man who made a mistake in misjudging the way he was to eliminate an enemy and has to pay dearly for it. Ralph Fiennes gives one of the best performances of his career as the crime boss with a conscience. His presence in the film is based on a raw energy we just didn't expect.The supporting cast is excellent. Clemence Poesy is the beautiful Chloe, the woman that catches Ray's eye. Jeremie Renier, the wonderful Belgian actor has a small part as the skinhead Eirik. Thekla Reuten appears as the pregnant hotel owner. Zeljko Ivanek has a small, but important part as the offended tourist that protest about smoking in a restaurant. Jordan Prentice is Jimmy, the dwarf actor working in the film that is being shot and becomes friendly with Ray.The film is photographed lovingly by Eigil Bryld. He takes us through the magical city of Bruges to witness the action, never making the mistake of making it a travelogue. Carter Burwell's fine musical score contributes to our enjoyment of the film.

Worst of all - it was uninteresting and not amusing. I am even more horrified to learn that this was written by a playwright not some 15 year old watching too many Tarantino films & thinking he's being hip/ironic by making fun of midgets, swearing every 3 seconds & having his characters be amoral and unsympathetic.-The characters were not only all uninteresting and unsympathetic they were all boring. Yes, we get it, they're pathetic, Ray's not very bright, they have no other future, they're amoral, most of the people are violent, homophobic, and racist... but they feel a little bad when kids die. There was NO personal growth on any of their parts - a tiny bit of remorse maybe, no sense of an attempt at redemption (Ray is literally CONFUSED about the concept when Ken tries to spell it out for him). -Ken's sacrifice for Ray came out of nowhere and made no sense (he claims Ray has a chance to change-- there is NO indication from Ray that he will redeem himself or change *in the slightest*!). -There were no interesting/novel action bits or shooting. -Nearly every \"twist\" was obvious and foreseeable (what the \"instructions\" would be, what Ken was doing in the park, most of the ending). -I enjoy most of Ralplh Fiennes movies (other than Maid in Manhattan) but his role here was a waste of time. Unstable evil guy. Absolutely nothing new or even really fleshed out.It was painful and an utter waste of my time! It was derivative and pointless. It didn't entertain me, it didn't make me think, it didn't challenge me, it didn't show me anything new (other than scenery of Bruges), it didn't amuse me (I chuckled maybe twice).If you want a good European locale + action film with character development and clever dialogue watch Hot Fuzz instead.

The scenery and music are really amazing, especially as a balance to the extremely foul and crude language that are rampant. Though that might put some people off it adds to the hilarity of the situation, the contrast between this beautiful and melancholic music and scenery and the dialog that goes on between the two main characters.There is, of course, a great deal of violence, but that is to be expected of a movie about hit men. THe fact that everything took place in Bruges makes it all the more funny, especially with all the jokes that are made about both the town and Belgium in general.There is much more that I can say but I think that the film should speak for itself, go watch it.

            "content": "\"In Bruges\" has two things going for it: a tender, poignant performance by Colin Farrell, and Bruges itself, a city most of us don't pay much attention to. Other than that, the film is derivative and almost empty \u0096 I say \"almost\" because it does have some content, and that content is vile.Colin Farrell used to be the next big thing, but that hasn't panned out, and he's made a lot of small, independent films like this one. I hope his next movie offers him a script worthy of the acting talent he reveals here.Bruges is a city in Belgium with lots of extant medieval structures and museums dedicated to medieval masters like Jan van Eyck and Hieronymus Bosch. \"In Bruges\" just shovels Bruges on the screen; no art is exercised. There's no special lighting or setting or marrying of the film's themes or dialogue to unforgettable images of Bruges, its structures, paintings, or swans. \"In Bruges\" doesn't do for Bruges what a Woody Allen film does for Manhattan or any number of movies do for Paris.Outside of Farrell's performance and the city itself, \"In Bruges\" is a rip-off of \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Sexy Beast.\" Rather than John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson as talkative hit men, you get Farrell and Gleeson. Rather than Ben Kingsley in a contrary-to-type role as a vicious crime lord, you get Ralph Fiennes in a contrary-to-type role as a vicious crime lord. Fiennes is surprisingly uninteresting and not at all scary here.For the most part, you get Gleeson and Farrell strolling around Bruges, trading low key, banal observations: Americans are fat, racist, and kill John Lennon and Vietnamese, beer is good, medieval art is deep. These observations are larded with the F word. So effing beer is effing good and effing medieval art effing is effing deep and effing Americans effing are effing fat effing. Oh, and since Gleeson and Farrell are Irish, and Irish people are inherently cuter and more interesting than anyone else on the planet (this movie thinks) their banal, F-work larded comments are all the more valuable.And, of course, every twenty minutes or so the screen is spattered with blood as another character dies.You get the idea.Here's the thing \u0096 the director and script writer, the inherently cute and smart (because Irish) Martin McDonagh, doesn't know anything at all about crime or hit men or how bodies react to bullets. McDonagh doesn't even know the make of the guns he shows on screen.But McDonagh knows that he'd never be able to sell a movie about two Irish accountants, say, or two Irish sanitation workers, or two Irish school teachers, strolling around a poorly lit (because this is a low budget movie) Bruges trading banal observations about how effing wonderful effing beer effing is, so he makes his characters hit men, and, voila, suddenly everything they say is ultra fascinating, or funny, or profound, in a way that it would not be had they been common working slobs.This could be called the Big-Mac-in-France trick. In \"Pulp Fiction,\" two hit men discuss the naming of fast food hamburgers. It's an incredibly banal conversation. The only reason the movie's largely teen male fans love the scene is because they believe the men having the conversation not to be John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, but two hit men, and hit men, teen boys think, are glamorous and inherently interesting, and so their comments about Big Macs warrant careful attention.Putting banal, shallow dialogue into the mouth of an imaginary hit man who bares no relation to real life hit men in an effort to make his dialogue sound profound has got to be the cheapest trick in the book. Arthur Miller managed to make Willy Loman, a traveling salesman, the most fascinating character in the world \u0096 through Miller's brilliant writing. A great, or even competent writer, doesn't have to make his character a hit-man to make his words matter.",

            "content": "After a contract killing goes disastrously wrong, two hit men are told by their boss, the foul-mouthed Harry, to hide out in Bruges. So they head for Bruges, even though they have no idea why they have been sent there, or even where Bruges is. It's in Belgium. In Bruges, the two hit men are forced to come to terms with their own inner demons, and they are doomed to face the consequences of their actions.It is easy to spot that Martin McDonagh, the writer and director of In Bruges, is heavily influenced by Quentin Tarantino. In fact, I would go so far as to say that this is the type of movie Tarantino would have made, had he been born in Dublin and not Knoxville, Tennessee. Every Tarantino trademark, from the Mexican standoff to the retrospective storytelling, is brilliantly executed in this film. In addition, the use of piquant and pervading dialogue to build McDonagh's characters and drive the narrative is also superbly executed. Tarantino would be proud. However, this film is not just another Quentin Tarantino knockoff by a British director. Apart from the obvious nods to Tarantino, there are other elements that make this an interesting and distinctly entertaining film. The film is shot on location in Bruges, a small, picturesque town in Belgium, of which most people probably have never heard. Bruges is portrayed as a town steeped in history and religious lore. And, despite Farrell's character, Ray, saying it is a \"s******e\" at every possible opportunity, Bruges looks quite exquisite on the big screen. If it is to be the last place you see before you die, it is definitely a beautiful place to go.Another key ingredient of this exemplary film is the tour de force performances by the three leads and supporting cast. Colin Farrell, in my opinion, has never really lived up to his early promise. Farrell has had more misses than hits, but his performance in In Bruges shows that he has impeccable comic timing and can also deliver a performance that is, at the same time, both subtle and poignant. Gleason is superb, as usual, as the older and wiser hit-man, who cannot bring himself to punish Farrell's character for his gruesome mistake. And, finally, Ralph Fiennes drops the repressed upper-class-Englishman guise that he usually adopts and plays the frenetic, foul-mouthed gangster with gusto.In Bruges does get very dark at times, for a film that is billed as a comedy; thus, some viewers will be put off. But, I believe its propensity to shock you one minute and make you laugh the next is one of the film's strongest qualities. Although the writer-director was born in London, it is obvious that there are many strong Irish influences in his life. And, these Irish influences are very evident in his writing.In Bruges, is a darkly comic film, with lashings of Catholic guilt throughout. Its strength lies in its outstanding characterisations and its ultra-sharp dialogue. In Bruges is an example of screen writing at its finest and the film is destined to become a classic. Even better still, it is a first-rate advertisement for the city of Bruges. And, after watching the film, I know I want to go there!",

            "content": "Director/writer Martin McDonagh's stunningly incredulous piece of sentimental claptrap involving touchy feely hit men and highly principled mob kingpins is all location, location. I've never visited a lovelier large town and this tale about a lethal Laurel and Hardy team is an insult to it's name.Ken and Ray have just performed a sloppy hit in which a priest and a young child are the victims. They're ordered to hideout in Bruges until they get further word from their boss Harry Waters. When orders do arrive they are for Ken to kill Ray. Veteran hit man Ken however goes soft for cuddly developmentally delayed Ray and can't go through with it. This is where things become absurdly unrealistic.McDonagh is well schooled in Coen and Tarantino but there are only hints of the former and an excess of the latter. There's some nice comic dialogue in the early going that balances well with the violent moments but after forty-five minutes things become convoluted and insipid as kingpin Waters takes it upon himself to go to Bruges alone assaulting citizens and running through town shooting away at Ray since from the looks of things the entire Bruges police force is on Christmas Holidays and it's left up to a pregnant hotel keeper to stand between gun toting thugs. Even though Ray and Ken go soft they are physically resilient to the point of super hero status. Ken already shot and bleeding profusely falls from a roughly three hundred foot church tower splatters on the cobblestones but still manages to warn Ray whose tough hide takes four shots to the trunk of his body but is gamely hanging on at the end. A supporting cast of ugly North Americans, a dwarf, a wimpy skin head, and a misunderstood drug dealing hooker, thief whose a sweet girl at heart are erratically developed and manage only to contribute to the films torpid pace.McDonagh spills blood liberally mixing it with heavy handed symbolism but it's pure comic book by the last half so it's hard to take the plot or the characters seriously. Colin Farrell's Ray has the makings of a fascinating and absorbing character in the films early moments but soon dilutes the suspense with a more impish than tortured approach that just repeats itself. As Ken, Brendan Gleeson displays a world weary fatigue with a convincing glum resignation that makes him the film's most interesting character before going soft and doing the inane swan dive from the church. Ralph Fiennes is completely over the top as the illogical mob boss.McDonagh does a fine job of filming Bruges, particularly at night but this is supposed to be more than a travelogue and his imagery and editing is unimaginative. In Bruges is one botched collage of poorly woven ideas, incoherently realized by a juvenile imagination. They should not have let McDonagh and company across the town line.",

            "content": "Apparently I grew up on a farm, because In Bruges impresses me very much. Directed by Martin McDonagh, the film, In Bruges is an interesting character driven movie. The characters in this movie are as human and fully fleshed out as it gets. A really dark comedy, the film is about two Irish hit men, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) going into hiding in the Belgian city of Bruges after a hit went horrible wrong. They are waiting for a phone call from their violent crime boss with unbending principles, Harry (Ralph Fiennes) for further actions. The city of Bruges become a center point of the plot, as both see it in different ways. Ray sees the oldest well preserved medieval city, as boring and a personal hell nightmare for him wanting to get out of it. While, immature and his youth showing, Ray throughout the film is plunges into a state of depression and a torturous emotional experience, guilt for the hit going bad. Without spoiling it, he understand he violated moral standards of his crime, and looks for a way out by extreme pleasure, only to find himself paralyzed more to the guilt. Ken, the wiser of the two, sees the city as a dream due to its old buildings architecture and the rich history of its streets. Like Samuel Beckett's 'Waiting for Godot' novel, the two characters play off each other on everything from living life to how to die in what to do, while waiting for Harry. Ray wants to party it up with a drug-dealer love interest Chloe (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy) and dwarf actor Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), while Ken wants to go site-seeing. The film is rich with symbolism and ideas. I love the film within a film notice such in the way, Ray met Chloe and Jimmy. A dream sequence kinda out of pastiche or homage of Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now. A 'nod of the head'. The whole scene would foreshadow a lot of the end. The arrival of the phone call is the film's climatic moment as it put the film into motion. A nice reference by showing the opening shots of Touch of Evil, is clue that's things will not end well, for the two. The movie is about the conflict of principles. Harry is play out as the grim reaper of the film, as he thinks that anybody who did the same crime that Ray does, deserves to die. Ken acting as the guardian angel believes people has the capacity to change and deserves a second chance. It's a human struggle of how to seek justice. By having the medieval city as a background, all three of men represent the both extreme of religionist viewpoints on how justice is served. When Ray and Ken visit the art museum and look upon \"The Last Judgment\" painting by Hieronymous Bosch. They walk into a surreal dream. Somehow, how purgatory might be looked at, based on Irish mythology. The idea of waiting for their inevitable fate in an unknown land is a common theme in philosophical Irish literature. When, Ray look upon the painting, The Flaying of Sisamnes by Gerard David, we knew that the guilt was eaten himself him, ripping him apart. All the actors did pretty well in this film. Colin Farrell's character is somewhat likable, but I found myself, not caring much about his fate due to some really annoying prickly jerk moments. It kindly turn me off the film. I found myself, relating more to the Ken character because he had more a moral code. Then again, the movie didn't had any heroes much to root for. It's perfectly alright to kill people, but don't you dare accidentally shot a kid. What type of moral code is this film presenting? I found myself, choosing the less of two evils. The hope of redemption and forgiveness is held out by Ken to Ray, doesn't resolve as this film gives blood-splattering conclusion where nobody wins. I don't think, Ray learn anything, besides wanting to live. He's doesn't seem like he wants to live to do better. It's seem he want to live for lust or fear of dying reasons. Hints why, I found Chloe to be a really horrible character. Brendan Gleeson display one of the best performance, I ever saw of him. Ralph Fiennes is just brilliant. The twisted humor is a hit and miss. I found myself, laughing in a few mean-spirited jokes, and at others, not at all. I did like the comedy of errors. The pacing is good, each scene didn't seem like a filler, as it serve its purpose, and move on quickly. I did find it, dragging in the pointless dwarf hooker party scene. I did love the perfect irony ending. The film was nominated for Best Original Screenplay award at the 81st Academy Awards in 2009, and I can see why. It was well-written, maybe a bit too nihilism for my taste. The violent and gore was alright. Not to cheesy, nor unrealistic. The jump from Belfry tower of Bruges was a bit out there, gross. The language was alright for a gangster flick, but I did find Harry 'f-bomb' letter, just too cartoony. The music score by Carter Burwell is forgettable, and disappointed. I can't remember a damn thing about it. As a travelogue, I think the film is most impression as I didn't know much about Bruges before this film. The camera shots are great. High angle shots are used on church item, creating the impression that religion will be theme throughout the duration of the film, looking down on the characters. Close ups are great to show the coping of the aftermath of mistakes. Mise en Scene for the dreaming scenes. Overall: worth seeing, no matter if you're in Bruges or not.",

I spent two years there and visited all the Minoan sites. Of course, all the tourists go to Knossos, and my wife didn't mind that as it is partially reconstructed, but the other four were a real pain to her. One is way on top of a mountain that is accessible only by a one lane dirt road. All the time you are going up, you hope a bus isn't coming down. You finally get there and you see the site as it is - a 5000-year-old, unreconstructed site. In my wife's description, \"We climbed up here to see a pile of rocks!\" It is exactly how Ray (Colin Farrell) felt when sent to Bruges with his partner, Ken (Brendan Gleeson). Ken, like me, of course liked the sites. The banter between the two is priceless. Martin McDonagh not only directed a winner, he wrote some of the best dialog that I have heard in a long time. Imagine a Hugh Grant film with hit men. Well, he did one of those, didn't her, but this was far superior.And, it has Fleur Delacour (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy) in a very un-Harry Potter-like role.

            "content": "Martin McDonagh makes an impressive writing and directing debut with the very fresh and entertaining and surprisingly well rounded film IN BRUGES. Though the basic storyline is rather simple, McDonagh knows how to keep it turning and twisting with generous amounts of humor as well as probing character development. He has assembled a cast of very fine actors, turned the cinematography of the gorgeous Belgian city of Bruges over to the capable creative hands of Eigil Bryld, and finished his project off with a fine musical score by the gifted Carter Burwell (with a nod to Schubert and others): the result is a beautiful little film with messages galore and always a visual treat to see repeatedly. Two hit men - Ken (Brendan Gleeson), a chubby, optimistic bloke who loves spending time with the sights of Bruges, and Ray (Colin Farrell), an emotionally distraught young man in the throes of guilt from a botched 'hit' that accidentally killed a young boy - have been sent by their 'boss' Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to 'lay low' after the botched murder of a priest (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds). It is Christmas season and there are too few rooms available so Ken and Ray reluctantly share a tiny hotel room to await further orders from Harry. Ken falls in love with the beauty of the city of Bruges while Ray, ever anxious and distrustful, finds some solace in a film being shot about 'midgets' (J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renie) with behind the scenes girl Chlo\u00eb (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy). How these two Irish guys make the most of their enforced isolation ultimately leads to the real reason for their assignment, a reason that includes a last 'hit' that sweeps the audience to a surprising ending. McDonagh writes very well, giving some of the best comedic lines to Farrell who proves himself a fine fit for this difficult role. Yes, it is another 'hit man film', but this one has the good fortune to deal with very real people, conflicted with their choice of 'occupation' and who are hungry to share their tenuous lives with good friends. Though there is considerable bloody derring-do, the film uses the chase and kill scenes to good advantage, allowing the audience to feel the human side of those whose job it is to 'off' others. Both Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are superb and their roles are enhanced by a choice selection of character actors who speed the plot along nicely. This is a very entertaining movie, one that can be appreciated on many levels, and one that suggests that Martin McDonagh has a solid future in cinema. Grady Harp",

'In Bruges' fails utterly to align its two conflicting urges; to be maudlin, and to be shocking. It's very amateurish. As an alternate take on the hit-man movie, it goes places the others don't, but it's not terribly interesting. It feels like a gay hit-man soap opera paid for by the Belgium tourism council (The voice-over intro which dispenses with the reason they're in Bruges in one line - before the movie even starts - is just pitiful). The two hit-men hug, they cry, they mope. I'm gay and this movie makes me squirm. It's about as much fun as watching two sulking gay guys pass the time while they iron out their relationship over a vacation. It's too elegiac and subdued to be much fun ...and too puerile to be much of a guilty pleasure.Author McDonagh revels in foul language but doesn't find much glee in it. And the movie becomes a clunky, ever more meaningless action-movie-clich\u00e9-machine for the last half hour. Post-'Sexy Beast' villains are all the same (Here it's Raelph Fiennes). The angry midget gag is stolen from 'Lost in Oblivion.'",

            "content": "\"In Bruges\" has a plot line that comfortably accommodates a number of seemingly incongruous elements as well as producing some neat twists. Its mixture of crime, comedy and action is immediately appealing but as it develops, it's also enriched by the eccentricities of its characters and the sharp dialogue that brings them to life so effectively. As an added bonus, the action is set in the beautiful Belgian city that provides the movie with its stunning backdrop as well as its title and the action is cleverly paced to accommodate both character development and the delivery of some entertaining action sequences.Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are a couple of Irish hit men who are sent to Bruges to escape the fallout from their last job which went very wrong when Ray unintentionally killed a child. All they know is that their stay could last up to two weeks and that they need to remain on standby to receive some further instructions from their crime boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes). The two men are very different as Ray is young, excitable and a complete novice at his job whereas Ken is older, more experienced and has a much calmer disposition. Ken adjusts immediately to their predicament and takes the opportunity to enjoy some sightseeing but Ray is completely unimpressed by his new surroundings and is impatient to leave again as soon as possible. Ray's also consumed with guilt about what he's done.Ray's attitude starts to soften, however, after he sees a film crew at work one night, and becomes fascinated by a dwarf who's one of the main actors in a dream sequence that they're filming. To add further enjoyment, he also meets Chloe (Clemence Poesy), an attractive production assistant and makes a date with her. Their friendship soon becomes very eventful as their date ends with Ray beating up an unpleasant couple who were sitting near them in a restaurant and discovering that Chloe is actually a drug dealer whose sideline in the past has been to seduce tourists so that her ex-boyfriend Eirik (Jeremie Renier) could rob them.When Ken eventually receives Harry's telephone call, he's surprised by the assignment that he's given and prepares to go ahead as instructed. Things don't go according to plan though and so Harry feels compelled to travel to Bruges himself and this leads to the story's surprising climax which proves to be deeply ironic, wonderfully absurd and perfectly fitting for this very black comedy.For his directorial debut, well-respected playwright Martin McDonagh has come up with an exceptional story that's totally unpredictable and juxtaposes tragedy, comedy, remorse, violence and pathos in ways that are quite original and unexpected. His characters are extremely well-drawn and there's an innate quirkiness about the whole undertaking which makes the movie continuously stimulating and funny to watch.Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are marvellous as the two hit men as they bring out their individual characteristics so vividly whilst also displaying, through their banter, how well they work together and function as friends. Ralph Fiennes also makes a huge impact with his nicely over-the-top portrayal of the scary sociopath, Harry.",

Not only does it take forever to get going, is it full of people doing completely unbelievable things, does it completely fail to capture the spirit of Bruges and its inhabitants (and believe me, there's plenty material there which can be parodied mercilessly if one is so inclined), but worst of all it doesn't even know what it wants to say. And it's pretentious, to boot. The romance is ridiculous, the midget/dwarf character is only there to function as the punchline of a sick joke-oid (which really isn't funny or profound or thought-provoking). None of the secondary characters are believable (a pregnant woman ordering an armed gangster out of her hotel - without showing the slightest worry or fear, for instance, or someone piloting a boat down the canals of Bruges who doesn't react when someone leaps onto his boat from a hotel window and bullets start flying), they're badly written and acted, and except for the ticket seller none of them are Flemish (let alone from Bruges). They're mainly French speakers - why, for Christ's sake? There are hundreds of Flemish actors and a few dozen of them are actually quite good. Script-wise, the problem is that the jokey tone of many of the scenes completely clashes with the extreme tragedy of what Colin Farrell's character has done. And once this horror is revealed (which makes it very hard to empathize with him at first), absurd crime situations and 'cool' bits of ultra-violence just don't fit with the overall tone. This should be a story of either reprisal or redemption, but it ends up being neither and both. As the film progresses, it becomes more and more ludicrous, with the scene in the hotel between Farrell, Fiennes and the landlady as the absolute nadir. There's also some quite shocking gore (a boy with his brains blown out, a character with half his face blown off)On the plus side, Farrell (whom I really, really hate, normally) is extremely good, Brendan Gleeson also does a good job, and Ralph Fiennes does his best with a very ill-conceived role. And some of Farrell's rants and jokes are amusing. But the weaknesses of the script and the weak acting of the rest of the cast make this an unalloyed disaster. Too bad McDonagh didn't jump off the Belfort instead of Gleeson's character. Then the world would have been spared this travesty of a film.",

So far so good, apart form the fact that I was not specially in need of yet another Brit-underworld movie. However, the main problem with this one is that it tries too hard. It tries hard to be - at least - like two very good movies, such as \"The third man\" and \"Sexy beast\". It tries hard to be funny, cool and smart, failing miserably along the lines. It tries hard to make Bruges look like a place you want to visit (I have been there and I agree with the Colin Farrel's character - it is not, to put it mildly)The part where it tries to be \"The third man (in Bruges)\" is obviously the location and night scenes, but also the fact that the main villain is named Harry. Said villain is played along the lines of the great Ben Kingsley - the psycho you'll love to hate, which made \"Sexy beast\" such a good movie -.Ralph Fiennes tries too hard to upstage Kingsley, but he is never believable as the gang leader with a personality split between the psycho and the loving father. Kingsley is just unbeatable exactly because he was constantly over the top, with none of the mushy sentimentality of a good father. But the huge, black hole of the whole story is the attempt of making us believe that these criminals actually \"care\" about strangers. Unfortunately, there is no honor among thieves. If they are criminals it is exactly because they do not care about collateral damage, being it a pregnant woman, a harmless child or an elderly guy.Finally, it is extremely difficult to root for any of the characters. They are incredibly verbose, just go on and on with lines of absurd dialog; act in ways that are not consistent with criminal backgrounds and are simply very unlovable. Colin Farrell is supposed to be the nice \"bad\" guy but he is quite nasty, with serious anger-management issues which would suggest he is way beyond redemption. In a restaurant scene he hits a man AND his girlfriend, just because they complained about cigarette smoke. If that is acceptable behavior in somebody's book, is not in mine. I would object having my face smashed even by a good-looking thug like Colin.I am surprised by the good reviews, but maybe it is because I have been in Bruges and totally do not care to go back.",

It has the English mafia mentality of Guy Ritchie's work, with a fair amount of action and violence, but it also has a sentimental side that Ritchie doesn't really touch upon in his tales. These are men who not only kill, but can love... and have their own moral code of right and wrong.Colin Farrell shines here. If he never did anything else, he could still be remembered for this film (he's also decent in \"Dr. Parnassus\"). And then you have Ralph Fiennes, who pretty much never makes a bad film, even when it's a sappy romantic comedy. More than any other role, Harry (Fiennes) brings out the anger and the control.This film is \"Snatch\" brought to the next level with some of \"The Third Man\" thrown in. A few unpredictable twists and turns, and some lively characters that are unique in more ways than one. I highly recommend this film for anyone.",

Brendan Gleason provides a sturdy framework for the plot and the revelation of character. Clearly, it is one of his best performances - a hit-man with the face and fidelity of an old knight errant. Ralph Fiennes also sets the perfect tone as the criminal nobleman to whom Farrell and Gleason both owe allegiance and must confront with reluctant defiance. The erstwhile Fleur Delacour of \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,\" Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy, plays the drug dealer/mugger assistant with a (sort of) heart of gold (And, no, for once, that's not Peter Dinklage, the hardest working little person in movies, it's Jordan Prentice.)

            "content": "Take an inauthentic theme (British \"hit-men\") and a ludicrously inapposite location (Bruges, Belgium), add an unconvincing love interest, and cook with a preposterous villain, and you get In Bruges. This film does not know whether it's a comedy or a tragedy, and works as neither. It breaks the solemn movie law by having no hero, and all its characters are thoroughly unlikeable. It is the quintessential entertainment made \"by those who can do nothing, for those with nothing to do\".You can see how the basic idea could have tweaked the money-men's interest: three British psychopaths cause mayhem in quiet, picturesque Euro-town. Sadly, it reinforces all the ugly stereotypes of UK soccer thugs, refusing to speak the language and trampling over the locals. There's even a rude joke-situation about Canadians, just for good measure. So that's the basic package: buy it if you like it.There's no point in going into the script: it's meaningless. The love interest is a lobotomised and marginalised figure, so women forget it too.The main character (no way he's a hero), played by Colin Farrell, is supposed to have shot a child accidentally, and his partner is to execute him for it, something he never dreamt of. As in the rest of the film, there is no police presence around the killing, a thoroughly childish aspect of this boyish venture. Bruges has been chosen by their boss (Ralph Fiennes, who should have known better) because it will give the victim a little view of fairyland before he dies. The mawkish sentimentality is not just the Fiennes' character's, it is also that of the director, Michael McDonagh.If it is not enough to have polluted the world to a wasteland, we have men dishing up this kind of mindless rubbish in the cinemas and on television.

            "content": "\"Three Billboards\", I thought it might be a good idea to look at the rest of Martin McDonagh's relatively short filmography and give that my appraisal. First up was a revisit to his debut feature \"In Bruges\" which I'd seen before and thought fondly about.Two assassins, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) head to Bruges to lie low after one of Ray's jobs goes catastrophically wrong. Though the cities medieval charm appeals to the older Ken, Ray is desperately bored, and the place is not the required distraction from the failure that he desperately needs. The pair await instructions from their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes) about what to do next, but when the orders come, Ken is unsure how to proceed.Despite being quite prodigiously and hilariously offensive, I still enjoyed \"In Bruges\". I wasn't immediate convinced by Farrell but, when he settled into the heart and the pain of his character, he's doing some of his best work ever. In fact, all the performances are really good, Gleeson and Fiennes are pretty much incapable of being bad and, despite smaller roles, Jordan Prentice and Clemence Poesey are memorable too.Though I found \"The Banshees\" funny also, I do think that \"In Bruges\" was a funnier effort, probably more conventionally amusing too. Despite its darker moments. \"In Bruges\" has a more complete story that \"Banshees\" does too and, though I liked the interpretive work in that film, the story is what draws me most to any film.I don't think I'll need to see it again for at least another ten years, but of the three McDonagh films I've seen so far, \"In Bruges\" is the most accomplished.",

Both the leads and Ralph Fiennes, who plays their profane, volatile boss Harry, are excellent in a clever, sharply scripted story of a short but bloody path to redemption. Religious symbolism is deftly woven in throughout the movie, in which Bruges serves as heaven, purgatory, or hell depending on the character, including imagery from Hieronymus Bosch's famous painting Last Judgment (itself sort of a 'black comedy').

            "content": "It has been my lot in life to know -- at least to the extent of taking part in conversations with -- three and a half hit men: two definitely and three who might have been killers for hire. None of them were possessed, so far as I could judge, of any great sense of moral angst, existential anguish or philosophic underpinnings to their professions, even to the extent of the 'Get 'er Done' attitude of Larry the Cable Guy. Instead they struck me as thugs who were at times gigglingly happy that people would pay them money for something they gladly did for any or no reason whatsoever.One of them was reputed to have killed his own mother by bashing her head repeatedly against a radiator -- perhaps she was not the most lovable of women. The others struck me as not much more entertaining, despite the fascinating lines of white powder they put on the table for the use of the ladies. None were possessed of the ability to quote Apocrypha at length, discourse on the shmoo or hew to moral precepts at appropriate moments. Indeed, the most accurate depiction of the type may have been Alan Ladd's turn in THIS GUN FOR HIRE: asked how he felt when he kills someone, he replies fiercely and blankly \"I feel fine.\"I mention this at the start because IN BRUGES accepts at face value certain assumptions that have become rampant since Quentin Tarrantino got PULP FICTION released. In this movie we have what could have been a black comedy, except that only Ralph Fiennes and Peter Dinklage seem to think it is one. Colin Farrell plays a character similar to his recent turn in CASSANDRA'S DREAM, except that he shows his range by assuming an Irish accent, and Brendan Gleeson adds some weight -- no pun intended -- and kills any comedy by his serious and excellent acting. Bruges is very photogenic in obvious ways -- the only other time I have seen this city in a movie was one of Leonce Perret's endless tableaux epics about lace makers filmed about 95 years ago.The net result is a movie that you enjoy when you are watching it, until you go outside and think about it. All of them wind up dead? Good to hear. Except that in the real world, they don't.It would be all too easy to accept this as a great picture based on its track record: a fine cast, a writer-director who just won an Oscar for best short subject, excellent cinematography and so on. But looking at the heart of it, you should see its intellectual and artistic laziness, its acceptance of false assumptions because they enable the creator to gloss over its vacuity with fine words. But it does not use its assumptions to challenge us in any way, except to try to convince us that vicious, uncaring murderers are people just like you and me. Well, they aren't like me, and I know the difference. I hope that you do too.",

            "content": "What a fantastic 'little' movie and I mean no disrespect by using the epithetic 'little'. In fact, it's a word that conveys extremely well the charm of this film, set in a small town in Belgium, Bruges, one of the unlikeliest but cleverest settings of a crime film. Even the title couldn't have been more eloquent, since the whole point of the film is that two Irish hit men are basically spending time \"In Bruges\", waiting for their boss' instructions after a botched job. While one of the two protagonists, Brendan Gleeson as the calm and moderate Ken, takes the opportunity to do the most normal thing we would do in a touristic place, his younger partner and friend, Ray, Colin Farrell, more free-spirited and tormented, impatiently thinks of leaving the town.There's a melancholic feeling inhabiting the first part of the film, as if we're waiting for something to happen \"In Bruges\", the action takes its time ... but that didn't bother me at all. The pacing's slowness gives us enough time to follow the characters and understand their personalities, and in the specific case of Ray: the big trauma that tortures his mind, and might have something to do with their 'waiting' in Bruges. And as the film progresses, you realize that Ray's pain reveals another one, even subtler, hidden in Ken's heart. It's a film with an unexpected depth that doesn't distract from the whole comedic atmosphere and reveals what is for me, one of the best written scripts of the last decade. Actually, I still wonder if I saw a black humor comedy or a light-hearted drama, but in both cases, I know I've seen one of the most unconventionally original films which is hard not to review without sounding like a pompous critic.So ... what I loved the most about \"In Bruges\" is this little universe it created, something very distinctive that I can't compare with any other film. A unique atmosphere where tourists, actors, thieves, prostitutes meet together and discuss everyday or futile matters like we do in real-life, when we go visit a foreign place. It's a cinematic melting-pot made of curiosity, discovery and knowledge, creating a supplementary delight while watching the film, as if the town was a character we learn about it, too. And that's how the movie works first, as a comedic medley of all the intriguing and entertaining situations we face while visiting a foreign country, something that gives the impression of an episodic and non-linear story, but the power of the script is that all these situations evolve crescendo and then finally combine for a totally satisfying and gripping climax, even more gripping because it took time to come to this situation. Where the official antagonist appears, Ralph Fiennes as Harry, the boss with some serious anger management's problem, we know we are getting closer to a memorable shootout, and a movie as original as \"In Bruges\" couldn't have disappointed.But I don't want to spoil anything from that movie, just to say that the performances from Gleeson, Farrell and Fiennes, are absolutely amazing, and convincing in their mix of goofy seriousness and melancholic depth. In many moments all through the film, especially in the scenes featuring Ken and Ray, you never cease to feel extreme empathy for these people whose presence in Bruges seems to serve a purpose that goes beyond the mission, as if it meant something even deeper, strangely deeper, they can't even figure what \u0085 as if Bruges was in the crossroads of these fates where something new was going to explode from these cocktails of feelings, of traumas and repressions, like those kind of holidays where we do change, from redemption or alienation, or both \u0085 but this is not a movie to over-analyze. The intellectual approach is smoothly invited near the ending when we collect the right pieces of the puzzle, and wait for us to find the last, the most precious piece, which still relies on the central character's soul, Ray.Ray is not necessarily deeper than Ken, and at many points, Ken is the most likely to get our sympathy, but what makes Ray more interesting is the way he's highlighted and foiled by the people he meets. Ray makes us encounter strange and unforgettable characters in a way that seems to go nowhere, like the very trip in a random place named Bruges, and the greatness of that film, is to make you wait until the end before you realize, they couldn't have chosen a better place to live this adventure. In Bruges, as the quintessential charm of the apparent insignificance which offers the best setting to explore our lives' own insignificance until the ultimate realization, that some things must change. Damn, whenever I try to praise the comedy, I end up talking about a drama.Indeed, \"In Bruges\" seems to be more a lighthearted drama that transcends the dramatic element and translate it into something so deeply funny, that you're never quite sure if you should laugh or cry, but why hesitating, the barrier between the two is so tight, you can go back and forth from one emotion to another without feeling any emotional jet-lag. And like the story, the emotions provided gets more and more intriguing and disturbing until they culminate in a tower where comedy thrones hand in hand with the psychological thriller in a bloody honeymoon, in a small town, named Bruges \u0085 Bruges finally put in the Belgian map, in Belgium, the country that \"Man Bites Dog\", another masterpiece of Black Comedy, put in the map too \u0085 Bruges as the crossroads of destinies, or dead-end, or both \u0085 Bruges as the town, we hate so much, we just can't live in, but can't leave it either",

            "content": "One of the outstanding movies of 2008, \"In Bruges\" is that rare cinematic high wire act that manages to juggle any number of seemingly contradictory moods and tones simultaneously without ever once dropping the ball. Alternating between the absurdly funny and the deadly serious, the movie, written and directed by Martin McDonagh, offers a wise, witty and surprisingly touching take on friendship, guilt, redemption and the strange code of ethics that guides the behavior of the professional killer (those who appear in the movies at least).Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleason are superb as Ray and Ken, two British hit men who are sent to Bruges, Belgium to hide out after Ray accidentally kills a young boy in an assassination gone wrong. Stuck in this strange Medieval city, the two men make the best of a bad situation, Ken by taking in the sights and immersing himself in the rich history and culture of the place, Ray by moaning about how bored and homesick he is, all the while trying to work through the guilt of having the blood of an innocent child on his hands.In a screenplay crackling with irony and wit, McDonagh paints the portrait of an unusual friendship between two men who seemingly have little in common beyond their chosen profession and a mutual respect for one another. Ken is mature, well educated, even-tempered and pragmatic, while Ray is unbright, hot-headed, and easily provoked by the words and actions of others. Yet, somewhere beneath his rough-and-tumble, sometimes rather befuddled exterior beats a giving heart and an appreciation for the good that can be found in certain people. Gleason and Farrell give performances of immense sophistication and depth, with Farrell, in particular, creating a fully rounded portrait of a \"loveable\" killer. His body compressed down into a perpetual slump while a host of conflicting emotions flutter across his expressive face, Farrell demonstrates that he has the physicality an actor needs to make a character come to life on screen. In a much smaller role, Ralph Fiennes also makes his mark as the mob boss who has some strange notions about what constitutes morality and honor when it comes to killing.Add to all these various virtues lyrical direction by McDonagh, beautiful cinematography by Eigil Bryld, some colorful minor characters, and architecture guaranteed to knock the viewer's eye out - and you have one of the true movie going pleasures of recent years.",

The trailer didn't make it seem as such, then again it is hard to express the kind of conundrum that the main characters get themselves into while also appealing to a base of fans that love quip-type one liners (i.e. \"You're a bunch of bleeping elephants!\" or \"If I was retarded, or grew up on a farm, Bruges would impress me, but I didn't, so I'm not impressed.\") When In Bruges is at its best- and until its self-consciously symbolic touches in the last five minutes it usually is at its \"Best\" whatever that means- it expresses what I love seeing in films about career criminals: the total inner turmoil of what was done coming back to haunt the person. If it's true that no good deed goes unpunished, the same would probably go for bad deeds in the world of In Bruges, where the atmosphere of the practically medieval city is, the character Ken observes, like \"a fairytale\", and a sharp contrast to the dark side pervading Ken, Ray, and Harry.The basic thrust of the plot is that Ray (half wise-ass womanizer and half half-suicidal played by Farrell) did a job back in London, a murder, which went horribly wrong in just one misstep (I won't reveal it here, though I should, except to say that it's one of those cardinal rules career criminals/hit men have to stick to), and so he and the older, less cynical Ken (Gleeson, who seems to be one of the most honest looking types in the character actor world, a spot-on casting choice), are sent to Bruges to receive more instructions. But those instructions, sent by the easily angered Harry (Ralph Fiennes, doing almost a hilarious imitation of Kingskey in Sexy Beast), aren't followed through, and then some manner of chaos ensues.Here and there McDonaugh takes what appears to be a lackadaisical attitude to the characters in this otherwise tense and uncertain fatalistic situation, as if an odd-matched comic duo are in a place one likes and one only can stand for mocking midgets (scuse me, dwarfs) in movie-making and hitting on the one hot girl in all of Bruges. But it's such a strange form that McDonaugh is working with here, with its mix of tones that it suddenly feels, in the context of the slightly bizarre and chilling circumstances, truthful. It goes without saying the cast helps give the material a boost, and that McDonaugh doesn't throw too many out-of-left-field curve balls with the plot. If he does, it's not of the sort we know we're usually hitting in this kind of crime story loaded with gallows humor and Catholic redemption mini-saga.In short, if I were a bloke in Britain or a fella in Dublin, or a dupe in Bruges, as a writer this is the kind of stuff I'd immediately try to go for. It's smart, serious, mature genre work that relies on just enough blood-shed and violence and trauma to haunt its audience proper, and do its duty to supply another batch of wonderfully off-kilter 'comedy' scenes for fans of British gangster flicks. That this is nowhere near as shallow as a Ritchie pic goes without saying.",

Colin Farrell plays a newbie hit man who messes up his first assignment, and Brendan Gleeson is his friend who brought him into the organization and is tasked with bringing him out of it by the brutal kingpin played by Ralph Fiennes.As I say some elements seem to remind me of other movies which is how I take this movie down perhaps a few points. The buddy movie hit-man thing was similar to \"Matador\", and Fiennes' whole character, role in the story, and even his performance was a bit too similar to Ben Kingsley in \"Sexy Beast\" (which is a much better movie). However this movie of course was different because it was.... in Bruges. The novelty of the setting wears a bit thin and at that point so does the movie, although not tediously so. I think that some of the characters were too arbitrary to really hold any weight, especially the drug-dealing girlfriend character. They're really just fantasy fodder for the teenage audience that wants to feel sophisticated watching a European movie.Ultimately it's a good movie because Gleeson and Farrell are so good together, that they create some moments that are different and interesting to watch. But it all degenerates into silliness by the end.",

Ken (Gleason) loves the fairytale prettiness and medieval sites of the town, but Farrell, a volatile and troubled young man, is bored out of his mind. He perks up a little when he meets a pretty drug dealer and makes a date with her. It gets to be kind of messy, though, when he takes offense at the restaurant and beats up a fellow patron, and then at her place, her boyfriend.Ken is at the hotel to receive the call on the next hit, and it's on Ray. The boss was trying to show him a nice time in a pretty place before he dies. The reason? On his first hit, which was in a church on a priest, one of Farrell's bullets hit a child. Not only can't Farrell recover from it, but Fiennes wants him gone.Though this is a dark film, it has a great deal of humor, mostly provided by Farrell's excellent performance as the reckless Ray. The director, McDonagh, has skillfully enmeshed both the comedy and the drama together and woven the idea of heaven, hell, and purgatory into the story. For Ken, Bruges is his idea of heaven, peaceful and beautiful. For Ray, since they're stuck there for two weeks, it's purgatory.\"In Bruges\" is a beautiful film about guilt, camaraderie, and the possibility of redemption. It's depressing but not completely. And the scenery, despite what Ray thinks, is beautiful.",

It was called 'Reservoir Dogs' and I am still watching rubbish homages cum lazy rip offs of that so-called ground-breaking movie - 'In Bruges' is the latest and it is pretty poor. Yes, the first fifty minutes are OK in a breezy comic sort of way as a couple of hit men try to come to terms with being exiled after a botched job in Bruges. Then it tries to mix serious with comic and completely collapses so that even an excellent Brendan Glesson cannot save. Once again a director who has had praise for his first film makes a turkey but the critics cannot go back on their first impressions - witness the absolute rubbish that Tarantino has been turning out since his debut!!!!!!!!! So Ralph Fiennes, sporting the worst cockney accent since Dick Van Dyke (it's too posh even for mockney), arrives to kill Colin Farrell, spending hours walking around with a gun firing indiscriminately at the tourists with not a policeman in sight!!!! I kid you not! Unbelievable, don't care about the characters, writing that should not grace a ten year old's Nativity Play, and swearing that merely becomes tiresome.

In Bruges was advertised as a straight comedy featuring gangsters who like to shoot at each other, so the three-dimensional characters and emotional depth come as a nice surprise. Colin Farrell, who, if he hadn't already convinced me he was a great actor, certainly wins that title now, stars as a green hit-man with a short attention span who messes up his first job by killing an innocent bystander. Things seem to be okay with the boss (Ralph Fiennes), who sends Farrell and his partner, Brendan Gleeson, to the beautiful Belgian town of Bruges to wait for their next instructions. The fact is, Fiennes plans for Gleeson to snuff out Farrell. That's the basic set-up, and it would be criminal to reveal too much more. McDonagh's script is a thing of beauty, quick-witted, smart and frequently touching. I did think that the final twists were a bit overly clever. Jordan Prentice, who plays the dwarf Jimmy in the film, began his career as one of several dwarfs inhabiting the Howard the Duck costume in the film of the same name.",

            "content": "A friend of mine saw this before I did and said it was a strange thing, but he found Colin Farrell's performance award-worthy.It is a strange thing.Has Martin McDonagh, of the brilliant plays, made the transition to film successfully--as both writer and director? Yes and no. In Bruges is a little gem--but with the emphasis on \"little.\" The squabbling gangster duo (and their boss), the violence, and the feisty dialogue recall Tarantino; so does the fun with political incorrectness. But McDonagh hasn't the flair or cinematic richness of Tarantino at his best. The film-making is adept, the direction is excellent, the images are surprisingly dark and handsome, but the mise-en-scene is tame. In fact very much is made of how boring (though beautiful, and perfectly preserved) the Belgian city of Bruges is. Though it is, in a sense, all about the diaogue, which sparkles, startles, and amuses, the material is simple. The dialogue doesn't open up mind-blowing and astonishing worlds as does that of Pillowman, the play that McDonagh himself thinks has set the highest standard, of his works.A novice hit-man working in London, Ray (Farrell) botches his first hit. He's sent to Bruges with his pal Ken (Brendan Gleeson). Later their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) enters the scene. Along the way there's a pretty girl, a film set, a dwarf Ken and Ray meet on the set, a hotel clerk, an antiquarian named Yuri (Eric Godon) who dispenses guns, a skinhead, and tourists, whom Ray insults, thinking they are American.McDonagh has fun with Bruges, \"the most perfectly preserved medieval city in all of Belgium.\" It does make a nice setting for a movie, if a largely static one, like a stage set but in 3-D. But Bruges is something you can do better in a movie; its beauties wouldn't translate to the stage; best to go there and film them. It's ironic that a couple of Irish hit men with an Englishh boss should be stuck there. And for a while McDonagh is content with riffing on that. You don't need much for his kind of verbal comedy. The Irish have such a way with words. Look at what Beckettt could do with two bums on a bare stage.McDonagh has said the source of this movie was a visit to Bruges he made himself. He enjoyed the tourist sites for a day or so, and then he was done with the \"culture\" and wanted some \"fun,\" \"to get drunk,\" as he's put it in interviews, \"and get laid.\" Ken and Ray embody the two sides of his experience: Ken is for the culture and Ray, who's not interested in history (\"It's just a lot of stuff that's already happened,\" he says), is for fun.This is good for laughs (I almost wrote \"laffs\") but underlying the story is a terrible scene we actually, vividly, witness, in which Ray kills an innocent bystander, for which he is tormented by guilt. It's this cock-up that leads to the duo's furlough in Balgium. Eventually after the boss comes in, there's a lot of blood: laughs and blood are two things Martin McDonagh knows how to deliver in a devastating one-two punch.There also has been by then a knockout and a blast in the face and a coke party in which the dwarf who's a movie actor from America predicts a coming war between blacks and whites in which you won't have to take sides: you'll have no choices.The success of all this in a film shows that Martin McDonagh is a slick operator. It doesn't show if--whether on the screen or on the stage--he is going to sustain the genius he showed when he wrote seven plays in a year or so nine years ago. Another thing it does show,is that Colin Farrell, who's turned away from his popularization by Hollywood, has perfect pitch for this kind of thing, and can go from scornful to desperate without losing his puppy-dog charm. Girls still go wild for his black moth eyebrows. The American critics don't seem to have been terribly impressed by In Bruges, however. It is a fine performance but a minor one, as a film.You will enjoy it more, I should think, if you have not seen the US trailer for it, which as so unfortunately and so often happens nowadays presents six or seven or eight of the key scenes of the movie with the best dialogue zingers culled out of them in a row, so that as you watch the movie, especially if you've been subjected to the same trailer five times as I was, you'll find yourself haplessly ticking the scenes off as they appear in context. And because the tone is so right in McDonagh's writing, and, especially when Farrell is talking (but Fiennes and Gleeson and the others are all extremely good), each of these zingers encapsulates a big chunk of the movie. And this kills all the freshness of it. I wish movie promoters would stop doing this. It's a virtual crime. They should be sent to Bruges and made to stay there forever.",

Without spoilers, this film had a surfeit of such clich\u00e9s. I groaned again and again. And again.Colin and Brendan, playing hit men Ken and Ray, shine in a slowly developing relationship that is foisted upon them by their boss. There are some funny bits. One gets invested in the characters. A few twists and turns to the plot follow. Not all successful.Ralph Fiennes, for once, is a little over the top as the head of the hit organization.

            "content": "It's interesting to see Martin McDonagh's first film with the hindsight of his two other movies. While I missed In Bruges (2008) back when it came out, I have recently enjoyed Seven Psychopaths (2012) and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017). Having now seen all three of McDonagh's films, I see the themes and motifs he uses throughout his directing. I already had hints of these common elements; it's just that seeing In Bruges for the first time has cemented them. From using short people to drug use to some uncomfortable violence, McDonagh has a style all his own, and it clearly shows in his breakout film.I think what draws me to McDonagh's films is his expert use of multiple \"Chekov's Guns\" as well as tying all these various foreshadowings together in a satisfying way. Whether it's a fat American, spare change, or the untimely death of a child, each part of In Bruges was included for a purpose that becomes evident in some truly genius twists along the way. Some may say that the ambiguity of the endings of his movies is frustrating, but I almost like the open-ended conclusions that seem to say \"and life goes on.\"While I did enjoy In Bruges, it still had some areas where McDonagh eventually improved through his continued filmmaking. Even though they spoke English, half the time, I couldn't understand what was being said by the actors. This almost caused me to turn on closed captions for some semblance of \"subtitles.\" Other than that, the dark comedy helped to balance the deeply dramatic plot as it centered around death in its many forms. I was already a fan of McDonagh's films, but In Bruges helps to confirm that the McDonagh trilogy is one of the best pieces of filmmaking to happen in the last decade.A fantastic first film in the \"McDonagh trilogy,\" I give In Bruges 4.5 stars out of 5.",

Jackson as the hit-men, we have Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson. In Pulp Fiction, John Travolta's character was just back from Amsterdam; here Farrell and Gleason are just over the Dutch border in Bruges, Belgium. Like Jackson and Travolta, Farrell and Gleason spend most of their time arguing about trivial things. There is also drug-taking as in Tarantino's movie, but this film is non-league compared to Pulp Fiction's Premiership status.As in Pulp Fiction, the hit-men work for a scary Mr. Big character, here played by Ralph Fiennes (in one of his worst performances) instead of Ving Rhames. Fiennes has clearly seen Ben Kingsley's performance in \"Sexy Beast\" and he's tried to pitch his performance at the same hysterical level. The difference is that Kingsley had some terrific dialogue to say in his film, where Fiennes just screams the F-word so often here that you just wish he'd shut up after a while. Fiennes also seems to be doing a Peter Cook impression, using the same nasal, whiny intonations of the late comic genius. He's terrible in it, but the script has to take some of the blame for that too.If you like making fun of midgets, as the writer of this film seems to, then this movie is for you. The so-called \"jokes\" about little people aren't funny and they become repetitive and offensive after a while. If midgets were the funniest subject in the world, then this movie would be the best comedy of all time, but they're not and it isn't. It's a failed stab at humour that's poorly executed.The script was written by a playwright and, like a play, it's all talk and no action. Every second word is the F-word in a desperate bid at humour; you become numb to it after a while. Ralph Fiennes shows up at the end to try and liven things up, but by then it's too late to care.

            "content": "Martin McDonagh, in his first feature film, has created one hell of an introduction. The movie is not complex, at first, as two hit men are sent to Bruges to wait for their orders after a hit goes terribly wrong. Bruges is in Belgium, by the way. It's a beautiful medieval city that lifts off the screen with gorgeous cinematography. It's hard to imagine a city so aesthetically pleasing with its towers, canals, and scenery that most would cherish. One of the hit men is Ray (Colin Farrell) and the other is Ken (Brenden Gleeson). Ray finds Bruges to be old and boring while Ken admires the architecture with wondrous eyes. As they wait for their orders we have a lot of comedic banter with a setting Quentin Tarantino could write dialogue for days with. It takes about twenty minutes into the film when the action and the plot start to pull all the strings together with a hit; in a church of all places. This is Ray's first hit. The scene starts, through a flashback, with Ray confessing to a murder that will take place in the not so distant feature. He tells the priest, \"I've murdered someone.\" The priest asks, \"Who did you murder?\" Ray responds with, \"You, Father.\" As the bullets start to fly a life is taken. More importantly an innocent life - a young boy's life. The boy is on his knees as he just finished writing his confession for all the bad things he did.This sets into place a string of events involving characters recognizing their own absurdity in certain situations (they call them principles). The humor is dark and extremely effective, mostly coming from Ray. At some point in the film, I was laughing so hard I missed the next lines. It truly is laugh-out-loud funny. Farrell is perfect with his childish delivery, batting eyebrows and high pitched squeaking sounds to emphasize certain words. Farrell does an excellent job as and makes you feel for his characters pain immensely as he agonizes over the little boy's death. Both of these actors work exceptionally well off one another and both give heart felt performances. Do hit men such as these have moral boundaries? Do they cross them? Do they stand by their word, and more importantly, do they do what they say they would do when the gun is put to their own head? Ethics would never come into play with hit men in most films, but these men have boundaries and their word means something to them. Henry (Ralph Fiennes) is the leader of these two hit men and he sent both to Bruges to wait for his orders after the tragic hit in the church. For the first 2/3 of the film we only hear him over the phone and he brings dark humor into the picture as well. The writing is fantastic as certain characters constantly repeat themselves and say the same thing multiple times. It sounds musical and so rhythmic with the delivery and the repetition. Fiennes is terrific. He and Ken have a couple of great scenes together in the final act. It's acting at its finest. The direction overall is extremely well done. After the film settles in it takes off and most of that is due in large part by the gorgeous cinematography and the great score lifting the film to the heights that it will stay at for the rest of the film. As the film progresses it gets better and better and better. You'll find yourself gradually becoming more and more involved with the outcome of the characters. \"In Bruges\" is a dark and funny film that's engaging till the end with an engrossing plot and characters. The best movie of 2008.",

And damn, this was a real good flick.Story focuses on two hit men who are sent to a beautiful and culture rich city in Belgium, known as Bruges. They're both to stay put in Bruges and keep a low profile until they hear word from their boss, Harry.Bruges is a gorgeous, quaint looking city with canals and cobblestone roads. One would think anyone would love to spend time here, but this isn't the case with this odd couple. The two men both share a profession, but not tastes. And this is where some really nice humor plays in. One appreciates life, the other not so much. The story focuses on why these two see life in different manners which really gives the film some great character development. And this is where the movie shines best. In it's two leading men and their banter with one another. From just talking about beer or how silly something is, to serious issues of death and the afterlife. It's all very entertaining which makes the movie move at a fast clip.Like any other flick with Irish actors, you've got the silly observational type humor, the thick as a brick accents and the motormouth way of speaking. It's all good, but I have a tough time hearing/understanding them quite a bit. If you're like me, this is just a warning to keep your ears open.In Bruges was a surprisingly good flick with great performances by the two leads and two supporting actors being the characters Harry and Jimmy. The others, like Ray's girly, were nothing special. She really just felt like a model thrown into the mix. Besides that, anyone who enjoys a well-written flick, a little blood and some taboo themes should definitely check it out.",

            "content": "2008 had two high-profile crime time comedies that blended action with suspense and a hintage of good ol' European humor. On one hand, we have the slick Rockn'Rolla that brought Guy Ritchie back into the spotlight, and now we have a new-school director delivering one of the most unique hit-man films in a very long time. In Bruges is one of those rare examples in which the comedy is so bleak, so dark, it can barely pass off as humor depending on the viewer. Marketed as a quirky action comedy; this film doesn't match the genre in the least bit. Instead we have a deep character study that focuses on the moral implications of the main characters, as they tour around a beautiful yet overlooked city. It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea. The film itself is interesting and fleshes out a clever story; but never quite gets off the ground, never quite propels itself to become a highly entertaining film. Then of course, we have the indie ending.In Bruges follows two hit men that must lay low after a mission went horrifically wrong. While Ray (Colin Ferell) soaks in the bitterness and guilt over his murder, Ray's partner Ken soaks in all the beautiful scenery and curiosity of the area. They both become well-acquainted with the place, meeting all sorts of characters. However, things become complicated when their boss (Ralph Fieness) has a new job for one of them. This is the debut feature-film script and directorial effort by Martin McDonagh as he crafts a good tale that has the same style of dark humor and tense action as his acclaimed short film from years ago. Originality is all over the place in this film, as dark humor is a tough genre to sell and deliver; it's rarely ever done successfully.The film is a delightful character study about people's actions, reactions, and the codes they must follow. Irony and subtle humor is also heavily present, as the mere premise of two murderous hit men touring around a secluded town like tourists is sure to tickle the funnybone. The script also calls for sympathy towards our anti-heroes, which is definitely a hard task that McDonagh tackled with ease. Helping the writing is superb acting by Ferell and Brendan Gleeson. If they don't interest you, Bruges certainly will. Bruges is basically a character in the film, as it adjusts and alters the mindsets and morality codes of our assassins. Beautiful scenery and nice cinematography makes In Bruges a travel documentary with a fictional story attached.However, the dark humor in the movie is a bit too dark. The movie can barely classify as a comedy because there's so much tension, so much violence, and so many heavy themes. A few chuckles will occur, but it's offset by the bitter humor that leaves you cringing at times. In Bruges in other reviews has been described as \"Irish humor.\" If that's the case, Irish humor is definitely not my cup of tea, as its comedy is disguised in heavy drama.Bottom Line: A nicely written and acted film, marred by so-called \"comedy.\" The humor comes off as bitterly dark and sometimes even dwells into the outright bizarre. If you can handle the dark chocolate-like taste (the 85% cacao bean kind), then you are in for a treat. The story is unique, so are the characters and situations they are involved in. This just might be American mainstream's first taste of Irish flavored film-making in years, and you can whether enjoy the flavor or move on. While the movie itself isn't amazing, this new-school director deserves a bit of attention for a strong first effort. In Bruges: a documentary with bullets and bodies.The food there looks good though.",

            "content": "I was looking forward to seeing this movie. The plot sounded really funny, and I'm happy to say that it didn't disappoint. In Bruges has an interesting plot. Two hit men are sent to await orders in the city of Bruge after killing their last target. The only thing is that Ray, the main character, hates Bruge. It goes deeper than that, but I don't want to spoil anything. The plot is good and thankfully Martin McDonagh knew what to do with it. The characters end up being one of the major driving forces of the movie. Ray himself goes a lot deeper than expected. Despite this, the movie never takes itself too seriously. Ray's always got something to whine about, and it's great fun to watch. The other characters are good too, but Ray especially. As mentioned above, the movie is very funny. It's a comedy though, so you'd hope so. But the jokes, while random and weird, still make sense in the context (for the most part). They aren't just random noises or phrases, they actually fit, which is nice. The movie is paced quite well too. Despite pulling off a 107 run time, not a whole lot happened thinking back on it. But it never felt rushed or too slow.Overall In Bruges is great fun, while still managing to stand as a great film. It's funny with great characters, a great plot, and great pacing. It's all around just a great movie. I'd recommend this movie to basically anyone, so long as you have a good (and a little dark) sense of humor.",

            "content": "I had the chance to see a few years ago one of Martin McDonagh's plays 'Pillowman' and came to know one of the more interesting theater authors today. 'In Bruges' is his first feature film, and while his path from a controversial and successful author of theater to director reminds David Mamet, the characters and mood of his film are more related to the world of Tarantino.Here is the story. Ken and Ray are two Irish mob killers who are sent into hiding after having murdered one more innocent victim than necessary. As our gangsters have a soul the younger of the two is full of remorse for the collateral victim who happened to be a kid, and as the gangsters world has a code of honor the elder of the two is charged with applying the capital punishment to the younger one. Here comes one of the best scenes I have seen recently on screen, with Ken with a gun at hand walking in a park towards Ray with the intention to kill him, and ending by saving his life by preempting his suicide. Genial - I believe that this scene may win an Oscar for original script to Martin McDonagh.The city of Bruges is playing more than a background role in the film. With its so European order, cultural atmosphere and quiet beauty it contrasts at first sight with the brutal characters sent into hiding under the disguise of the world worst tourists. And yet it is the simple humanity of the place and civility of its people that ends by engulfing the two heroes and making them find inside themselves the resources of questioning the sense of their own actions. The middle of the film takes almost a moralistic and religious tone when dealing with these issues. When the brutal world the two belong to surges back under the person of the mafia boss come to fulfill the rules of the crime world code of honor, even his actions end by submitting to the ritual of European politeness. As in his plays, you are never sure whether McDonagh is ironic or respectful towards the world he describes.Good acting helps a well told story, which develops in a natural manner despite the quite unusual premises. Colin Farrell, an actor that critics love to hate for roles like the ones in 'Alexander' or 'S.W.A.T.' is simply marvelous as Ray, the young gangster hitting hell at his first murder, trying to redeem himself and showing that he is so much better than his own actions. Brendan Gleeson as Ken, the elder, wiser and even more cultural-prone of the two adds his own human dimension, enhanced in a classical gangster movies ending which otherwise looks somehow not fit into the rest of the film. Ralph Fiennes is cast here completely against his type (another fine choice of the director) and does a wonderful job as the hysterical mafia boss enforcing the code of honor to its ultimate consequences. Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy provides the romantic trigger igniting the spark of humanity in Ray, while Jordan Prentice allows to the director the throwing of ironical arrows towards David Lynch and the dwarf-haunted surrealistic dreams in his movies.Hopefully McDonagh will continue this path of his career as film director after this remarkable start. His own play-writing with the cut-edge irony, black humor and the sharpness of drawing his characters is probably the best source of inspiration and the best chance for his voice to become fully original, away from the other film makers who influenced his beginning.",

            "content": "Contract killers Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, the former a clumsy hatchling with easily ruffled feathers, the latter a calm veteran whose patience only intensifies Farrell's aggravation, are sent to the picturesque old Belgian world of Bruges by their edgy, ferocious boss Ralph Fiennes and told to await further instructions. While Gleeson peacefully absorbs the sights and historic buildings, streets and quays, Farrell is pessimistic and finicky, irritated with the lack of local nightlife. From the wild playwright of the feral, hypersensitive Lieutenant of Inishmore, this is a wonderfully enjoyable set-up for an action/comedy buddy crime film. It prepares itself with comic dynamics and quaint atmosphere, just as it markets itself in trailers, but it lets us down with an erratic handling of its tone as a jarringly dark twist in backstory unravels itself. It could have balanced its mood swings if it did not so convincingly set itself up as the duo comedy as which it was marketed.The pace accompanies the tone in the dunce corner, the film's running time being nothing more than filled by the subplot of Farrell striking up a romance with a thieving drug dealer he meets while she is working as a PA on a movie set with a temperamental dwarf actor.There is nothing wrong with a film that gets darker and darker as it unfolds, but In Bruges's missteps lay in its disappointing effect as well as its odd feeling of severing us from it, as despite its beautifully antiquated medieval scenery and occasional moment of fulfilling humor among a promising cast of great contemporary English actors, its struggle with its own contrivance being transparent more than the story's capacity to absorb.By either following through with the spirit of its exposition or helming better control over its landslides into melodrama, it could have avoided being an incoherent disappointment which, if I came across it one day with a lack of better choices, I would still watch again. I sense it as a film that has the potential to grow on you despite its nearly crippling flaws.",

McDonagh does have a way with words, but it seems to have eluded him in this film, which works better as a concept. Maybe it would work better as a play, but as a film it feels half-baked. I see that he is referencing Waiting for Godot and he's playing with his usual mashup of violence and humor, and he is paying homage to old, masterful movies like Touch of Evil and Vertigo, but the whole thing feels really forced and rather soulless. I am willing to suspend my disbelief and swallow that the wonderful Brendan Gleeson and the incredibly uneven Colin Farrell are hit men on holiday, but why? They really seem to be the nicest chaps, with no edge of meanness. Lovable thugs who work for a fastidious thug, played rather maniacally, by Ralph Fiennes, whose performance over the phone is actually funnier than when he actually shows up. It is nice to see him in a comic role and sporting a perfect thuggish accent, but he is not believable either. And the actors are saddled with stupid lines, which is really surprising coming from Mr. McDonagh. Gleeson is divine as a hit-man perfectly content to spend some downtime sightseeing. He revels in the calm. I love Brendan Gleeson and if there is a reason to see this movie, he is it. Farrell is all over the place, and trying really hard to be funny, which may not be entirely his fault. He is best when he feels guilty and dissolves into tears, but otherwise he mugs for the camera like there is no tomorrow. Jeremie Renier, who has starred in the distinguished films of the Dardenne brothers, L'Infant and La Promesse, has a bit part here. This always bothers me, that when the big foreign production comes to town, the best actors in that country end up playing stupid bit parts. Such is the pecking order. There is a subplot involving a racist dwarf, and fat Americans, so you know the movie is aiming low. Some American critics have vociferously objected to the violence, which is really beyond me, considering Hollywood is still churning out violent porn like Rambo. The violence is over the top in concept, as Farrell kills human beings that are taboo to kill. And this may be the point of the movie, that the principles of criminals are bogus, and killing anybody is wrong, period. But it's a point we expected Martin McDonagh to make with his accustomed panache, not all dumbed down.",

            "content": "Two hit men hide out in an unassuming Belgian town in this thriller, which starts out as a quiet two-character study and then jukes and jives its way to a screamingly violent conclusion. In Bruges is a low-rent Pulp Fiction knockoff, but it's a knockoff that pays off in spades, with strong, believable acting, excellent cinematography, and a taut, amusing script.Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) have just completed a rather difficult job and have been ordered by their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to repair to the idyllic town of Bruges to lay low for up to two weeks. \"Two weeks with you?\" Ray exclaims to Ken. \"No way!\" Ray's a novice to the world of hit-manning, and being as young as he is he's not too keen to spend two weeks in any spot that's not teeming with hot women or other fun things to do. Bruges isn't exactly a Mecca of excitement, you see. On the other hand, the more seasoned Ken is pretty happy with staying in the placid little burg, because it'll give him time to sightsee and take it easy.Both men start to believe there's something else afoot. Why Bruges, after all? They're Londoners, so why not hide out in London, or even in the English countryside? No, they had to schlep over to Belgium. (There are plenty of Belgian jokes, and a smart dig at Americans that was both accurate and snicker-worthy.) But before Ray can get properly bored, he meets a sweet young lady named Chloe (Clemence Poesy, late of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) working on a movie that's being filmed right there in Bruges, and he sees a chance to redeem himself for past sins - but apparently Chloe has a few dark secrets of her own.Gleeson and Farrell are wonderful together, and the film avoids such clich\u00e9s as the young impetuous hothead and the veteran killer on one last job, and you never get the impression that they're just a couple of lunkheads who go around killing people randomly. (You know the type: Guy gets tired awaiting further instructions, so he shoots someone to keep in practice.) And of course, nothing goes as Ray and Ken expect it to go. There's no way, of course, that they're going to stay the entire two weeks in the podunk town with nothing happening, right? Yeah, probably not.So they wait around for Harry to call and give them further instructions, and when he does all hell really breaks loose. But setting that aside for the moment, here are some other entertaining aspects of the movie: drug use, gunplay, midgets, and blood. Yes, midgets! Okay, dwarfs. And although there's no dwarf tossing, there is a karate chop to a dwarf's neck, which is awesome in and of itself.Another plus is the film is remarkably well shot. Filming on location in the actual town of Brugge in Belgium, cinematographer Eigil Bryld brilliantly juxtaposes the angularity of the buildings and the beauty of the landscapes with the brutality of the men's violent behavior and coarse language. The pooling of blood on stark, gritty pavement, surrounded by gleaming snowdrifts and the pulchritude and quiet desperation of Bruges itself.Although not as wittily intelligent as Pulp Fiction, In Bruges is still quite clever - and not too clever for its own good, either. It's not one of those movies that tosses in funny dialog just to be funny or so-called twists just to keep the viewer guessing. Two charming, gutsy performances by Gleeson as the unorthodox older man and Farrell as the twitchy younger one boost this one up a notch about the typical caper thriller.",

Writer-Director Martin McDonagh's \"In Bruges\" creation was a juicy blood-broiled black comedic offering, with a few Irish fried hit men to go along with it. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson star as Ray and Ken, the aforementioned hit men protagonists who are ordered by their mob boss Harry to lay low in Bruges, Belgium due to the fact that Ray accidentally killed a young boy on a hit job. Ken takes a touristy liking to Bruges, while Ken thinks that Bruges is the boredom capital of the world. Their hit men chemistry was definitely on target, and in equilibrant comparison to Jules & Vincent in the classic \"Pulp Fiction\"; and this is a fact! Team Kenray do come across some eccentric characters while in Bruges including a: a foul-mouthed dwarf actor, a one-eyed robber, and a rude Canadian couple. A ray of sunshine appears in Ray's torturous Bruges experience when he meets the beautiful ecstasy drug dealer Chloe. Things get a bit hairy for Ray & Ken when Harry comes to Bruges to hunt them down for hit men insubordination; if such thing exists. Colin Farrell was phenomenal as Ray with his witty banter on his hatred for Bruges. Farrell also did the best heavy emotional work in his career portraying Ray as a guilt-ridden suicidal hit-man, while still maintaining his sarcastic comedic liveliness. Gleeson's subdued but resounding performance was also a sure shot winner. Ralph Fiennes continues to be one of the finest actors in the business with his hair-raising thespian fineness as the menacing Harry. I also gladly in took the \"In Bruges\" supporting acting experience with crafty performances by Jordan Prentice as the American dwarf actor Jimmy and Clemency Posey as the poised Chloe. Obviously, the city of Bruges does play an integral part of the film's symbolization. I dunno where McDonagh's imaginative genial inspiration came from for his \"In Bruges\" masterpiece direction & script; but I bet this is a McDonagh that has more tasty offerings for us to cinematically chew on for some time to come. Must also fare well to Carter Burwell's soothing \"In Bruges\" score; might just get the top score as the best movie score of the year in my book. So colonize yourself to Colin's colossal acting and the rest of the outstanding movie attractions that \"In Bruges\" has to offer. ***** Excellent",

His mate Ken, an excellent Brendan Gleeson,, is more stoic, dependable, and has seen it all.What lifts this is not only the script by playwright and first time director Martin McDonagh but the deadpan delivery and wonderful sense of comradeship.Without a doubt one of the better films about hit men of recent memory - better than Matador et al - due to a stonkingly good script and lots and lots of little touches and surprises. It has real depth and polish, but it is best when it just plain vitriolic.Top drawer comedy with some action thrown in, probably not granny's cup of tea, but definitely a good film if you're in the mood.",

            "content": "Writer/director Martin McDonagh has fashioned a little gem of a crime thriller/black comedy with his film, \"In Bruges.\" It's quirky and eccentric, but in a way that comes naturally and doesn't feel remotely forced. And despite the running joke about Bruges being such a boring and dull place to be, the movie makes the city itself look lovely.Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) play two hit men who hole up in the titular city awaiting orders from their boss, Harry, played by Ralph Fiennes. Both suffer a crisis of conscience -- Ray because his first hit resulted in his accidentally killing a little boy, Ken because his orders once they come are to bump off Ray, who annoys him but who he rather likes. When Ken tells Harry he refuses to kill Ray, Harry comes after the two men himself, resulting in a quite violent finale.McDonagh's background in theatre shows, especially in his writing. The screenplay to \"In Bruges\" is a marvel, tightly wound and compact. It's fresh and surprising, traits that don't frequently describe movie scripts nowadays. The movie is viciously funny, but the relationship between Ray and Ken is also rather moving, and the violence (and boy is it graphic at times) is very disturbing precisely because we come to care so much about the characters it's happening to.All of the performances, but especially those of Farrell, Gleeson and Fiennes, are superb. McDonagh proves himself to be a good director of actors, and he handles his own material masterfully. He even manages to make midget humor (the stuff of movie comedy clich\u00e9s) funny again.Grade: A",

            "content": "To put it succinctly, In Bruges was the best film that I saw in 2007. I loved every minute of it, from the expletives in the opening scene to the shockingly crazy ending. Colin Farrell plays a hit-man recruited by Brendan Gleeson to work for Ralph Fiennes. When Farrell botches his first job, Fiennes sends both him and Gleeson to Bruges, Belgium, to get them away from London.Colin Farrell was disastrous in Alexander, largely because the film was a catastrophe, so watching him in In Bruges was a real surprise, he is excellent. He fits the character so well, the mannerisms, emotions, everything. His interactions with Gleeson during their escapades throughout the medieval town of Bruges are examples of perfect cinematography, excellent scripts, and superb sounds. The score complements the film in every way, fitting both the scenery and the film.However, if you are easily offended or unable to deal with violent scenes you probably do not want to watch this film. Violence, coarse language, and other \"antisocial\" tendencies are pervasive throughout the film as they form the core of the movie. I know of only two people that would not like this film, in fact I plan to show this to my mum, and I'm sure she'll love it.",

At its core is the superb performance by Colin Farrell, proving yet again that he is one of the finest actors of his generation (check him out in Woody Allen's \"Cassandra's Dream\" as well and you'll see what I mean). A perfect blend of comic timing, rough charm and vulnerability - it's a knockout performance. And that's not to diminish the work of Brendan Gleeson, Ralph Fiennes or any of the other cast members - even the bit part players are terrific. Best not to say too much about the plot, as it's better to see it with fresh eyes - but Martin McDonagh deserves to be showered with awards for his work as both writer and director (and it's his first feature!). And it's not a bad tourist ad for Bruges either! I hope this film comes up at Oscar time - it truly deserves to.",

But I still occasionally try new ones out, usually to my disappointment or disgust but In Bruges is one of the great exceptions. I've now seen this a couple of times: how such seedy violent profanities can appeal to me still puzzles me, but there's no doubt to me that this is a brilliant film \u2013 with many faults, dazzling to watch. My daughter wasn't as impressed as me so maybe it helped not to be as used to modern movies or maybe it's just that you'll either love it or hate it.Two Irish hit men (Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson) hole up in Bruges - definitely not an excrement-hole \u2013 they don't know why except to await orders from their gangster boss Ralph Fiennes back in London. Farrell is mentally tortured by the recollection of accidentally shooting a young boy in the head. When the order finally comes to Gleeson it comes as a surprise to put it mildly. With everyone constantly swearing their heads off with some great lines, all bickering, taking the mickey, the story veering into very dodgy territory at times all depicted with a slapstick frankness, great photography/colour/sense of humour/style, editing and atmospheric music. So what if the denouement was a little contrived and telegraphed to the viewer well in advance, it all made perfect sense in a glorious black comedy. Favourite bits from so many: the opening sentences \"After I killed him \u0085\"; Farrell and the bunch of elephants interested in the church; the dismissive references to gay beers; the wingeing skinhead shot in the eye by a blank; Fiennes sorry for calling his wife an inanimate object; the wonderful meeting between Gleeson and Fiennes in the caf\u00e9, with so many side-splitting unrepeatable comments made or retracted; I really really hoped Farrell wouldn't die too. I never thought I could laugh so much at so much coarseness!It's fast and stylish, with beautiful Bruges at all times looking like it's from a effing fairy tale. Not recommended if offended by sex/violence/bad language/adult themes (as I very often am, but only in what it shows the film-makers think of their audiences) \u2013 however this is an eye popping work of Art, in my admittedly limited experience utterly unique and recommended.",

            "content": "How do you make the story of a hit-man who accidentally blew a hole through a child's head funny and light? It ain't easy, but IN BRUGE does it on several levels.You definitely have to have a main character who can pull off something both dramatic and comedic. And that someone is Colin Farrell (MIAMI VICE), a killer who finds he's having trouble living with the accidental death of child who got in the way of a bullet.Then you have to have a great co-star, and he turns out to be Brendan Gleeson (KINGDOM OF HEAVEN). Gleeson has been a favorite star of mine since his American portrayal of Sheriff Keough in LAKE PLACID. His combination of dramatic chops mixed with witty line delivery made him the perfect choice for this role.You've also gotta have some sort of tryst going on, and there's actually several of those. The primary is that of Ray (Collin Farrell) and Chlo\u00eb (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy). Their brutal honesty with each other makes for some interesting mental sparring between the two and has some of the lighter moments within this otherwise dark dramedy. The other is that between Ken (Gleeson) and pregnant Belgium hotel owner Marie (Thekla Reuten). Ken's distant manner opens up to Marie during certain film segments, and Marie's stunning good looks and prideful appearance make her a person to be reckoned with. Another mini-tryst comes thanks to a film being produced \"In Bruges\" where one of its stars named Jimmy (midget Jordan Prentice) is out to have a good time with whatever women he can find (or drugs).Normally location wouldn't necessarily play that important of a role in a movie like this that is truly a character study of dark people who are also genuinely decent in many ways. But Bruges, Belgium IS important. After Ray (Farrell) accidentally kills the small boy, he and Ken (Gleeson) are told to \"get out of town and head to Bruges.\" For Ken, it's like a vacation; the stunning buildings and peaceful waterways put Ken in laid-back mode. But Ray is tense, on edge, and sincerely depressed at his accidental shooting of the small boy. The two clash as soon as they reach Bruges, and their differences are mirrored in the landscape around them: swans, steeples, guns, and prostitutes.There's also a comparative study going on between a famous painting of Hell in Bruges, Belgium (that Ken and Ray check out), to that of the movie being filmed in town by Jimmy (Prentice) and that of the experience Ken and Ray find while visiting this quaint, Belgian community. I won't say more for fear of giving away too much.The final bonus for movie watchers is checking out Ralph Fiennes (THE CONSTANT GARDNER) as the overly-scrupulous death dealer Harry Waters. He's a family man with a mob-boss mentality who must head to Bruges himself in order to set things right. And once he's there things really heat up! Bullets fly. Bodies fall from tall buildings with resounding *splats!* And he finds himself the victim of his own moral code in the end. Nicely played.A warning should probably be given to those who are squeamish or don't care for the overuse of foul language. Both play out significantly in the film, but they are also integral to the characters and the life they've chosen. But you can't say I didn't warn you (the R rating is definitely deserved).What's more interesting to me now, though, is that I would LOVE to see Bruges in person. The extra features on the DVD include a boat trip through the canals of Bruges and point out incredible spots of interest. An added bonus, for sure. I just hope I don't see any cloaked midgets or men with silencers running around.",

She said, about some other movie, that, for reasons of clarity, it should be entitled \"Beware! Very, very boring!\" Very true, and very applicable to \"In Bruges\". I was at least as bored by the story as Colin Farrell's character is by medieval architecture. In fact, \"In Bruges\" is so boring that you wonder whether it was funded by the Flemish Board of Tourism. The movie only picks up some speed when Harry arrives on the scene. Cast against character, Ralph Fiennes plays a fast-talking mobster with a heart of gunpowder and a quirky code of honor. Minor perks include local lassies like Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy (in the part of Chlo\u00eb) and Thekla Reuten (as a hard-headed innkeeper). The one thing that makes the movie stand out despite its many flaws is Carter Burwell's music. But it feels strangely out of place in a movie so devoid of depth and drama. Guest appearance by Ciar\u00e1n Hinds as a moribund priest. Oh, and for those of you who need to know: Johanna Adorj\u00e1n was talking about \"Sex and the City\".

I like all the actors involved and I thought that this might be a good movie to watch, but I really had no big expectations. But I was surprised at the end. \"In Bruges\" is a really good movie, with great dialogs and great actors and what I cannot forget to mention: brilliant photography that presents us all Bruges. There is no panoramic scene same like others. Just great! Movie is in some things similar to \"The Matador\". There, we've got only Brosnan shining in not so good movie; but here we've got Farrell & co. shining in very good movie. I must admit that I didn't expect such a good performance from Farrell after disappointing \"Alexander\", \"Ask the Dust\" and \"Miami Vice\"; at least disappointing to me. So about the script.Movie is about two professional killers Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) who come in Bruges on some sort of vacation. There, they must keep low profile and wait for the further instructions of their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes). As the movie goes on we found out that Ray is troubled by his first job. He accidentally killed a young boy while he was trying to kill his target. Because of that he's got suicidal thoughts. And one more thing, Ray really dislikes Bruges. His older partner, Ken is enjoying in Bruges and its culture, with all that old houses, churches, towers and canals. Ray meets Chlo\u00eb on set of the movie that took place in central of Bruges. But soon Ken is given instructions to kill Ray, because of his incident with the little boy.\"In Bruges\" is first long movie of Martin McDonagh. McDonagh wrote a fine scenario, where he puts one younger and older killer in front and fills the movie with big doses of dark humor (mostly coming from Ray, who acts sarcastic about everything) and nice turn in a story. I must say that the ending is quite unexpected; it's not American happy ending where everybody lives happy after. That's why this movie is so good. With message that you must follow your principals and with lots of irony, humor and strange events (like dwarf war). Also McDonagh presents his characters like ordinary people, with all their problems. But what's most important is that he managed to combine humor and human tragedy (Ray falls in love but he must be punished because he killed a child) in a way that at the end you feel sorry for main characters even though there is no completely positive character (only that little boy). So, \"In Bruges\" is not a movie for everybody. If you expect action comedy, look somewhere else. Cause this movie has a big touch of drama and makes you think about it. Great debut for McDonagh, one of the best roles for Farrell and great movie for me (and I hope for all of you).",

            "content": "I headed into my screening of the new Colin Farrell/Brendan Gleeson film, In Bruges wanting to like the film as much as any film I have travelled a distance to experience this year.I am one of the few that think Farrell's interviews over the years have been far better than any of his performances, but Gleeson is someone that I have admired since he stole a few scenes from Gibson and the gang back in 1995's Braveheart.Putting the two Irishmen together in a film ripe with violence and humour was as welcomed into my day's itinerary as that favourite uncle that always came to the house bearing gifts.But when the full experience came to a close, I was left feeling like I opened up the gift only to find a rattle rapped inside a knitted sweater.In Bruges stars Farrell and Gleeson as Ray and Ken, two hit men hiding out in the Brussels town of Bruges after Ray's first assignment suffers some collateral damage. The two couldn't be more opposite. Ken is the elder, father-like figure that would spend his days traveling the city and taking in the historical sites and buildings. Ray, is the cynical partner (and comic relief) that prefers to chase skirts and head to the local pub for a pint or two of local lager. Together the two are Frick and Frack. Murtaugh and Riggs. Lee and Carter.With not much going on in the small town, the two seem to squeeze their entertainment value out of the locals thanks to large consumptions of beer, some cocaine and quirky acquaintances that provide leisurely distractions to both Ray and Ken as they await further instruction from crime boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes). Particularly small man Jordan Prentice as Jimmy. As a midget on location in Bruges shooting a dream sequence in a film, Jimmy provides all the laughs that don't come from Ray's adolescent behaviour.The fun and games take a turn for the serious when Harry orders Ken to off Ray as punishment for the hit that resulted in complications. Unfortunately, this is also where the film turns predictable. You know just know that Ken is not going to kill his apprentice Ray and that Harry would end up having to come to town himself to rid himself of now two problems.And this all takes us to a bloody finale that should have been more fun that its conclusion and more satisfying than its ending.I definitely cannot fault the writing via a screenplay from director Marin McDonagh who at one time had more Oscars (with one) than Martin Scorsese. When Ray utters such non-politically correct phrases as \"If I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I didn't, so it doesn't.\" I could imagine Farrell and Gleeson sitting around a script reading table laughing uncontrollably over the audacity of the lines that are played with quick witted precision in front of the camera.But the film from top to bottom confused me and left me bouncing off the walls trying to figure out what type of film it was trying to become. It started off with the black humour and utter ignorance of a Payback, then went into a Lethal Weapon buddy/buddy film only to change pace and go incredible serious leading up to the final chapters that were more bloody than most of the horrors I have seen in recent weeks.For all that, I cannot give In Bruges a recommendation. It is one of those few films that I do expect to watch again on DVD and I hope I can be swayed into seeing the film for the individual parts even if they don't flow together cohesively. But in the meantime, I recommend that you don't go to Bruges, but you stay at home and do a virtual tour on the internet instead.www.robertsreviews.com",

            "content": "After watching The Lady Killers and reading all the reviews here saying it was not funny, and then watching In Bruges and seeing all the reviews calling it funny, humorous, hilarious and entertaining, I have to wonder if the world has truly gone mad. I decided to finally give this movie a try after hearing an interview with Brendan Gleeson on Fresh Air with Terry Gross. I will say this for the film: It is powerful, has beautiful cinematography, all round fine acting and a good score. I can even see elements of black humor, like the encounter in the park -- I'm not obtuse. But unless you enjoy seeing graphic, senseless violence in myriad forms, and find it funny to see it repeated over and over and over, I don't think you can call it funny, humorous or even entertaining, and certainly not hilarious. I would also call it unforgettable, which, sadly, I prefer to do with such violent fare.I've lost count of all the violence, but I do know we get to witness in graphic detail two suicides, one by blowing his head off with a gun in his mouth, the other by jumping off a tower onto the pavement, two children lying in pools of blood from accidental shootings, a contract shooting or two, a blinding, a beating to death, a beating to near death, a shooting victim who inexplicably lives, and probably more that I don't remember. The endless gratuitous violence in In Bruges makes Fargo look like a Currier and Ives Christmas card.What's the point? Killing people is now a joke in the 21st century? Tell that to Norway. There seem to be some unexplained plot elements, like why Ray shot the priest in the confessional. I don't recall him receiving any instructions, or even getting a gun. I also don't see how the little boy got shot accidentally. Maybe I missed something, but I am not going to go back to figure it out. In the real world, the shooting of a priest and a small boy would be in the news. In Bruges, nothing. And Ray goes bragging about it to a woman he's just met. This is not realism, it is adolescent fantasy.There are people who enjoy watching graphic violence. There are American films that cater to those tastes, but I never watch them. Then you see foreigners who think these films are realistic depictions of America. I presume and sincerely hope this is not a realistic depiction of Brits or Europeans; I'm not quite as sure about Russians, from what I read in the news. More to the point, is this movie an indicator of European tastes?Stepping back for a moment, I think what this film indicates is that there are serious social and moral problems in most places: drugs, violence, prostitution, murder. There also seems to be a decline in aesthetics due to hyper-stimulation, demanding more and more intense experiences, so that some people have lost the ability to appreciate subtlety and delicacy of humor, such as in The Lady Killers. I suppose there is a place for films like In Bruges, which is a sort of 21st century take on Fellini surrealism. I would have found it more palatable without the graphic gore and violence. Even though it is fiction and make believe, I find it still tends to deaden the soul. Frankly, I found it a degrading experience to be dragged through this sewer.But not everyone agrees. Oddly enough, Bruges, the city, has worked In Bruges, the movie, into its tourism marketing. I hear tourism is up.So what's next for Martin McDonagh? How about a week in the life of two sadistic serial killers? Or a mass murderer who blows up buildings and shoots up a children's camp? Or a suicide bomber who hijacks a school bus? Those movies should be a barrel of laughs for this crowd.Spoiler alert:The ending is bogus. Harry shoots Ray with a large caliber \"dum-dum\" bullet clear through, and he not only lives, but Ray runs half way across town with Harry in chase. So Harry shoots him again and again and again, yet Ray is carried off on a stretcher, alive and conscious. You must be kidding. Is this one of the jokes others find so hilarious?The whole point of \"dum-dum\" bullets is that they mushroom on impact, shear open, shredding the innards of the victim beyond any hope of medical help and remain there in fragments, instead of passing through the body intact as shown in the film. Death is usually nearly instantaneous -- a \"dum-dum\" bullet is designed to stop a rampaging animal dead in its tracks -- or human -- with a single shot. You would not see a bloody exit wound in the back. Look it up.-- Note to IMDb on spell checker: It's \"d u m d u m\" not dumb dumb.",

Jim Sheridan, Danny Boyle, Terry Loane and Kenneth Branaugh do it exceedingly well. This offering by Martin McDonagh -- in only his first feature -- is no exception. He's aided, mind you, by exceptional performances (Brendan Gleeson, Colin Farrell and Ralph Fiennes doing terrific turns with some very offbeat, \"sideways\" characters) and his own competent script.The one shortcoming is the over-the-top scene where Ray, Ken and \"midget\" Jimmy indulge in cocaine, booze and off-the-wall banter about racial wars. The scene comes across as an intrusion, a dark throwaway, one that is out of place in an otherwise gripping story of characters who have chosen a questionable -- but intriguing -- profession.Not your typical Hollywood ending by a long shot -- but probably more satisfying especially because it's not.

It turned out that while the movie starts out comedic, it gets more serious as it progresses. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson play hit men Ray and Ken, respectively. After Ray accidentally kills a boy, head honcho Harry (Ralph Fiennes) sends Ray and Ken to Bruges, Belgium. This is the sort of city that by rights should attract just about every tourist; certainly Ken spends as much time as possible sightseeing. Ray, however, can't get over his previous actions, and his short temper gets him into trouble everywhere.Two wrenches get thrown into the works when Ray strikes up a relationship with local drug dealer Chloe (Clemence Poesy) and Harry orders Ken to kill Ray. The events resulting from the second part really set the movie on its more serious course.I guess that the movie disappointed me a little in that it turned out not to be the comedy that I expected. But for the most part I liked how it posed the question of what is right in such a convoluted situation and lets the audience decide for themselves (sort of like what \"No Country for Old Men\" does). Worth seeing, if not the best movie. And if I may say so, Jimmy's (Jordan Prentice) description of the race war sounded like what Charles Manson envisioned.Also starring Elizabeth Berrington, Anna Madeley, Thekla Reuten, Ciaran Hinds, Rudy Blomme, Mark Donovan, Ann Elsley and Jean-Marc Favorin.",

Martin McDonagh wrote and directed the film and brings out the best in the two Irish leads Colin Farrell as Ray and Brendan Gleeson as Ken. Ken and Ray are two hit men sent to Bruge by their boss play by Ralph Fiennes after a job goes wrong all of which are amusingly characterised and portrayed realistically.The film oozes atmosphere and I wouldn't want to spoil the story but it is both touching and funny. As with any kind of successful dark comedy there is an array of quirky characters including a dwarf, a one-eyed boyfriend, pregnant hotel lady, gun seller and a drug trafficker.

It is extremely endearing, gory, violent, funny, tender, but most of all it is a compellingly human film. It charts a handful of days in the lives of two hired killers, after a job in London goes wrong, and they are sent to \"cool off and lay low\" in a rather unexpected place: Brujes, Belgium.The reason they are sent there becomes apparent once we have already been drawn well into the plot, and have developed empathy for the main characters, which makes everything that happens to them in the final act all the more resonant.Without spoiling it, as I believe this film is one of the least predictable ones I have seen in years, the reason they are sent to this little-known place (in Cinema, at least) partly involves the fact that \"Brujes is like a fairy tale city\".Since I dearly treasure the feeling of going to the cinema and being pleasantly surprised throughout the length of a film, both by its quality acting and original plot, I shall simply tell you that I was amused and laughed throughout, I felt pity, I felt pain, I felt hope.

            "content": "In Bruges is a black comedy whose idea arose from a vacation writer/director Martin McDonagh took to the pristine town of Bruges, Belgium. McDonagh reflected in the DVD featurette that he was in awe of the town's medieval beauty but had the simultaneous feeling of being incredibly bored after two or three hours. He took these two disparate feelings and split them up over two characters. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleason are a pair of hit men who are paid by their boss to go to Bruges for an undisclosed assignment. They are supposed to pose as two tourists and maintain a low profile while waiting for a phone call. Ken (Gleason) takes an interest in the sights of the town and jollily obliges, while Ray (Farrell) is very bored. He is somewhat of a cultural boob with low intellectual curiosity but he gets more likable as the film progresses as we slowly see that he starts to develop a curiosity about living a better life. He is also bored because he has just accidentally shot a boy and is coping with guilt over that. Ralph Feinnes also enters in the story a little later as the enigmatic boss. The film is also populated by the kinds of characters that come with small-town comedies: An obnoxious Canadian tourist, a pregnant innkeeper, an alluring coke dealer (who Ray falls in love with) and her unfortunate boyfriend, and an opinionated midget.The film reminds me of Analyze This or Anger Mangement in that it features a star (Robert De Niro or Jack Nicholson in the above examples) making fun of their screen personas. Colin Farrell is playing to type in an extreme sense, reflecting his public image: Shallow and mostly interested in booze and women. (In real life, Colin Farrell is an avid reader and student of history who would be the kind of guy who's interested in a place like Bruges, but I digress). It's an interesting mix of genres but as is the staple of this genre, the black comedy, there are usually meaningless deaths. I won't spoil what happens but I grew close enough to these characters that I came to hope that we wouldn't be seeing anything bad happen to them.The film also has an interesting and curious romance between Ray and the coke dealer. She seems to give him a lot of chances but it turns out that she has a dark side to her as well.The dialogue was really good and it was clearly an engaging film but a pet peeve of mine in the dialogue is that everyone talks the same and uses the f-word in every sentence. The screenwriter did such a great job of giving everyone distinct personalities so I wish they would give them distinct styles of speech.",

Ultimately psychopathically vicious, treacherous, and murderous but....\"let's have big fun with it by making bloody murder and psychopathic hit men funny in the beginning before we get down to the real cruel blood and guts at the end\"...... more or less a tired copy of one of Tarantino's films like Pulp Fiction, and it was mostly a one trick pony commercially calculated to depict sick but marginally entertaining segments of contrived and cruel human behavior including all the violence, blood and suffering an audience could stand for 2 hours without turning theaters into vomiteriums. The worst aspect of this film was that it shamelessly copied others in this genre who have done a much better job of it, like Tarantino, Peckinpah, and Scorcese. In Bruges was two disparate films tacked together.....the first one was a goofy, near Monty Python sketch of a forced stay in Bruges, Belgium by two joking and wise-cracking hit men sent there by their head man to cool off after a botched assignment in the UK, and the second part was a cruelly vicious and bloody version of a typical Peckinpah/Scorcese/Tarantino film of terminal comeuppance and payback for treachery and nearly limitless earlier sins. The two film parts and the character's actions in each part did not match well and thus the result looked contrived and uneven overall and appeared to be done by one who has a lot to learn about what makes a film good, and that includes consistent characterization that he did not well control. And, it does not include shamelessly copying a story style done better many times in the past 40 years and essentially pretty worn down by now.So, to me there was little substance that was interestingly new or different here. Instead, go see No Country For Old Men for this story genre done as well as it can be done. But, Bruges did look like a nice place to visit.",

            "content": "For his first feature film, In Bruges (pronounced Broozh), Irish playwright Martin McDonagh (The Pillowman) has fashioned an absurdist black comedy about hit men hiding out in the medieval city of Bruges, Belgium, taking stock of their life while awaiting their next assignment. The film offers fabulous acting by a stellar cast, glorious scenery worthy of the best travelogue, and the characters' poignant metaphoric journey from cave to cathedral. Yet the story line about thoughtful hit men and the mobster's code of honor is artificial and self-conscious and contains some insensitive humor that comes off as more of an \"I'll show you if you think I am politically correct\" exercise than something intrinsic to the characters.Colin Farrell plays Ray, an English hit man who botched his first assignment and has been exiled to Bruges by his London handler, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), together with Ray's partner Ken (Brendan Gleeson). The absurdity of having two mobsters trying to come to terms with a city full of culture and history is quite funny and engenders some feeling about being a stranger in a strange land. The culture unfortunately is lost on Ray. He calls Bruges a *beep* hole and humors Ken who is interested in seeing the sights and attractions of the old city. In the process, McDonagh goes out of his way to be offensive to everyone including gays, dwarfs, blacks, and women, and also dumps on Americans (a safe target), showing an overweight couple taken aback when Ray suggests that they would have trouble maneuvering the winding stairs to the top of a monument.He paints Bruges as a city with Russian gunrunners and Chloe (Clemence Poesy), an attractive drug dealer selling drugs to a racist dwarf (Jordan Prentice) while an art movie is being filmed, but this has more to do with the demands of the script than the reality of Bruges. McDonagh's idea of humor seems to be his characters putting down the world around them. Ray calls the timeless art works \"rubbish by spastics\" and says he would be impressed with Bruges if he had grown up on a farm \"and was retarded\". \"Do you think this is good?\" he asks Ken \"going 'round in a boat looking at stuff?\" Neither have any idea why they are there. I guess if its Tuesday, this must be Belgium.We soon find out that Ray is racked with guilt because he accidentally killed a five-year old boy who was in the line of fire as he was murdering a priest. Naturally he has no remorse for killing the priest because that is his chosen profession and he was only doing his job. The hardball hit men turn softies right before our eyes as they ruminate about guilt, sin, and the hereafter and question what they have done and whether it means they are going to hell, Ray says, \"Aside from trying to live a good life, I have to reconcile myself to the fact that I have killed people.\" Fine time to think of that. While they do not exactly engage our sympathies, the relationship between the two men is touching and they deserve credit for being willing to reexamine the choices they made in their life.One is forced to wonder about these choices even more when Ken turns up as an advocate of Ghandian non-violence after Harry emerges from London to act out his sociopathic \"principles\". What remains after the soul searching is a bit of a romance, some cool Tarantino-like hip dialogue, some obligatory chase scenes, and a contrived plot sequence involving a murderous ex-boy friend of Chloe who is blinded in one eye when Ray shoots him with a blank in self-defense. At the bottom of this is the gangster's Code of Honor that we are supposed to admire but never seems to be a part of anything real. Yet in spite of its infuriating flaws, In Bruges is always entertaining, and at times moving and does make me want to visit this entrancing city now that the lowlifes have been dispersed in true Shakespearean style.",

            "content": "Ah, we finally reach Spy's favorite genre of film: the hit-man dramedy. One of my favorite films is The Matador, which is about a dysfunctional hit-man's friendship with a regular average joe. In Bruges, while sporting similar characters, is different in the plot and outcome, but is the same in that it is now one of my favorite films.It is a great character study. Martin McDonagh's existential hit-man piece has wonderful humor packed into a greater drama that serves as a big time eye opener for our characters. All three of our leads, Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Ralph Fiennes, will experience a change in their outlooks on life before the credits roll. For those that do not know this film, it follows the misadventures of two hit men (Farrell and Gleeson) in Bruges, Belgium as they await a call from their boss (Fiennes). It's a moving picture, despite the fact that it moves fast and has some of the best comedic dialog of the year. I found the movie utterly hilarious at some points, with most of the humor coming from Colin Farrell.I've always found that the existential/introspective type of dramedy has been my favorite type of film, and the fact that there's guns firing and laughs bursting at the same time only makes it better. There's humor injected into all the action sequences (though they are few and far between, they are well shot and edited). A good score also helps the film out a lot, but this film truly belongs to our actors.I never thought I'd say this, but DAMN! Colin Farrell is wonderful in the film, and in my opinion, his role was the hardest to pull off. I've noticed that Farrell's best performances come when he uses his natural Irish accent. The emotional intensity of Farrell's performance, combined with his uncanny comic timing, make for the best performance of his career, bar none. His character was my favorite in the story, and he really impressed me here. Brendan Gleeson...well, I've long felt that he's one of Europe's diamonds in the rough, and very underrated. Hopefully he gets the exposure he deserves from this film. Gleeson, giving us a wonderfully introspective show, helps provide the wisdom and balance to Farrell's fast talking youngster. The partners really compliment each other. Then there's Ralph Fiennes, who, despite being absent for a big portion of the movie, had me on the floor laughing when he finally enters (he is heard on the phone at some point but doesn't actually appear for a while longer). To continue the appearances of cast members from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Clemence Poesy is also impressive (and might I say, quite beautiful) and well casted in her role as Chloe.In Bruges is a true gem of an action/dramedy that shouldn't be missed. It has a wonderful script with the best dialog of the year, some of which will have you laughing through the next few lines after. It's a beautiful character study and a well shot piece that will make our director a hot commodity over the next few years. Farrell, Gleeson, and Fiennes should be proud to have this movie on their resumes. I know I would be.",

Ray was responsible for the hit going wrong, so it's his neck most likely on the line and it doesn't help that while Ken tries to take in the local culture and experience, he sees everything wrong with it. So as they await the call, they must also come to terms with a town where everything seems foreign and weird.Quentin Tarantino's style of crime thriller writing has inspired some notable imitations, one of which would appear to be this well received Europe set film from Martin McDonaugh. Your sense of political correctness can be left well at the door, as jabs at the Chinese, midgets and retards come thick and fast. Other problems though, include it being a rather slow and talky film at times, but it's an undeniably sharp and well written film, which makes it funny and thrilling as well. Performances wise, it's nice to see Farrell back (check out the scene where he talks to the midget and the prostitute, double chin or what???) and there's nice support from Gleeson and Fiennes, ditching his usual well spoken brit thing for a sharp cockney villain dialect. ****",

The city affects both of them as one is completely enamoured by its culture while the other absolutely detests it but things change when next instructions finally arrive.Written & directed by Martin McDonagh, In Bruges brims with a fresh, invigorating energy and is highly gripping from start to finish. McDonagh's work behind the camera is no doubt impressive but the screenplay he penned down is even better. Packed with sharp humour & memorable one- liners, the scripted tale retains its lighthearted tone even in serious moments and is just as funny as it is thrilling.Shot in exotic locations, the city of Bruges comes alive in vivid detail and while the film captures its old-fashioned vibe & way of living in an evocative manner, it also doesn't shy away from poking fun of the same from time to time. Cinematography infuses the tale with neo-noir elements, the pacing is smooth & steady, there isn't one dull scene in the final print, and Carter Burwell's score fits the premise beautifully.Coming to the performances, In Bruges features a talented cast in Collin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson & Ralph Fiennes, along with a couple more, and since their respective characters already exhibit an interesting arc, the actors are able to build their work on a solid platform. The chemistry between Farrell & Gleeson is delightful but Fiennes isn't far behind either & steals pretty much every scene in the supporting role of Harry, their employer.On an overall scale, In Bruges is a thoroughly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying crime-drama that scores high marks in all departments of filmmaking and is further boosted by its pitch black humour & committed performances. A surprisingly effective marriage of comedy, crime & drama that has the ability to evoke rib-tickling laughter from its audience in the most unexpected ways, In Bruges is an instant classic that's every bit worthy of its cult status. Highly recommended.",

Two mismatched friends who kill for money but really might die for each other, but themselves are both totally lacking in sophistication bring a little Archie Bunker to Euro Cinema. And if thats not enough, much to the delight of even Ray, there's even a midget!",

For me, the ending was a little too protracted and I would have avoided the false ending that was a bit too melodramatic. But otherwise a joy to watch and very different. Baddies competing in their badness but drawing their own lines they would not cross. I loved it that a guy could talk of all his kills then get soppy over some aspect of his life. But what I liked best was the full frontal script and gags that we thought could no longer be told, involving gays, Americans, dwarfs, fatties and much much more. Great stuff. I had not seen Colin Farrell before but was most impressed with his sense of timing and can well understand his popularity, not least one sign of which is that I see his has five films slated for release in 2009.",

I've never been there, but the name of the town will now forever evoke the collocation 'shithole' in my mind.Ray and Ken are two assassins sitting in out in Bruges after a botched job. \"Why Bruges?\" asks Ray. Why indeed, the answer becoming clearer as the opening banter gives way to a darker undercurrent.Colin Farrell has never been better, playing the dumb-but-deadly Ray. The humour, though not always successful, is daring at times. Delightfully, the film makes no attempt to pander to an American audience. Delicate souls from the The States might come out of this one chest-thumping. Farrell's courting of a local film PA sets up most of the comedic moments, along with his reluctant mentoring by Gleeson. When called upon to provide some deeper emotions, Farrell rises to the occasion with aplomb.Gleeson, who has quietly built an incredible CV that includes Braveheart and Gangs of New York, is as dependable as ever. When the boss charges him with a repugnant task, his inner turmoil is all-too-evident.Both men, so used to acting in foreign accents, clearly revel in the exchanges in unadulterated Irish English.The casting of Ralph Fiennes as London hood Harry Waters is less successful. Fiennes appears late in what appears to be almost a cameo, but the holding back of his presence is somewhat undercut by featuring his visage prominently on the poster. His performance is too derivative of Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast, and comes across as poor parody. He does share one of the films best moments with Gleeson in the pavement caf\u00e9, in a heated discussion revolving around an insult to his kids. But his character arc is forced, and his demise far too contrived, telegraphed as soon as the dwarf appears in school uniform.The running gags about dwarfs committing suicide, and the fighting prowess of the Vietnamese, are fresh and inventive. Gleeson and Farrell pitch their odd couple routine to a tee. In Bruges is both funny and moving and is not to be missed.",

            "content": "At first, I wasn't sure what to make of this small-scale crime thriller that follows the exploits of a couple of hit men hiding out in a European city after a job gone wrong. The profane script recalls Guy Ritchie, not in a particularly good way, and the characters are difficult to warm to. The tone is quite uneven, with black comedy being the order of the day as the script sees the characters ruminating on bizarre characters and occurrences, such as when they become involved with a dwarf actor currently staying in the city. I was tempted to switch off during the first half. Then the narrative becomes to be more focused and the second half becomes a lot more entertaining. I found myself warming to both of the leads (a given with the reliable Gleeson, but a surprise as Colin Farrell isn't a favourite of mine) as their humanity becomes evident, and things build up to a thrilling, eventful climax that never disappoints.The on-screen antics are small scale but the acting strong and the pacing spot on. Ralph Fiennes contributes an extended cameo as the duo's violent employee and uses it as a showcase for some over-the-top ranting and humorous scenes. I enjoyed the sense of darkness that pervaded the film, particularly as the ending grows near, and while it's not a favourite, I did find this a solidly enjoyable outing that's more original than most.",

Instead, the comedy comes naturally from the situations and the characters.I don't think I've ever seen Colin Farrell in a comedic role before, but he delivers a fantastic performance.

It was boring and amateurish, there was nothing to the characters, and if the dialogue was half as clever as it thought it was it would've been mildly amusing. Every single plot device may as well have come with sirens and flashing lights. And to tie it all together into one big mess, Ralph Fiennes is miscast, and for Colin Farrell, apparently, acting equals working every facial muscle he owns. This is no successor to Tarentino or Sexy Beast. Not at all.

            "content": "For viewers who don't mind pervasive use of the F-word and occasionally the C-word, and also don't mind gory violence here and there, this is a very well-crafted and entertaining dark comedy.As we learn in the extras on the DVD, Bruges, Belgium is an attractive medieval city that hasn't been featured in a movie, so this story was sort of \"let's figure out how to get Bruges in the story\" and it works.Colin Farrell is Ray and Brendan Gleeson is Ken, two professional hit men who are sent to Bruges for a while to see how things cool down in London after a hit. Ken is the veteran, Ray is the new guy. Things didn't exactly go right in his first hit.Ralph Fiennes is Harry Waters, their boss. He plays this role as a ruthless \"business man\" who has very strict rules about their profession.French actress Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy is Chlo\u00eb , a local Bruges actress that Ray meets while a movie shoot was going on at night. One of the actors is an American dwarf and while his appearance seems cosmetic at first, becomes a key element in the overall resolution of the story.SPOILERS: Ray messed up his first job, a hit on a priest, when he accidentally shot and killed an innocent young boy. Harry's motive for sending them to Bruges was to order Ken to execute Ray, because Harry, a family man with sons and daughters, has a strict rule against killing children. Meanwhile Ray is despondent over all this and is about to take his own life in a Bruges park when Ken comes upon him, ready to shoot him. Instead of simply observing, he stopped Ray from suicide then put him on a train out of the country. But Ray was brought back to Bruges to face assault charges from a few days earlier,while Harry is traveling to Bruges to deal with Ken for not snuffing Ray. The whole thing comes to a climax in a town square at night, when Harry chases down Ray and shoots him he also accidentally kills the dwarf and, thinking he killed a child, put his gun in his own mouth and killed himself. As the movie ends, Ray is being transported to a hospital with grave wounds and we hear his thoughts \"hoping that he survives\", but we don't find out if he does.",

This doesn't make it a bad film but it does make it unoriginal. I don't know what it is with Irish writers and rip-offs: It's not so long since one of them wrote something called Dancing At Lughnasa which featured a dysfunctional family living in the Depression with a son walking out of the action to spout linking narrative and then returning to the action. Nothing wrong with that IF Tennessee Williams hadn't done the same thing years earlier in The Glass Menagerie. Anyway back to Bruges where Colin Farrell is being as un PC as it's possible to be - and I have absolutely no problem with that. If nothing else we get some great scenery and that with the fairly decent acting makes it worth seeing even if McDonagh is only The Caretaker for Pinter.",

Things do not become crystal clear until about midway and then things take off crescendos to a slam-bang finish full of blood, but that is not what makes the film. What makes the film is its bitingly sharp sense of black humor where characters are mean to those around them trying to get away from their own problems.

In fact there aren't words in my language which can express how deeply in tune to it I feel every time I put the DVD in for a watch, which is at least every four months or so. The dual forces of comedy and tragedy have combined here using Martin McDonough's genius script writing as an avatar to create something raucously funny and profoundly moving. The comedy is of the spiciest and very darkest nature (my favourite), and the tragedy tugs at both the heart strings and the tear ducts, scarcely giving you time to wipe away the tears of laughter from the scene that came before. The best in UK crime fare, some of the most balanced, peculiar writing and fully rounded characters who are as flawed as human beings get. Colin Farrell delves deep and gives the performance of his career as Ray, a would be hit-man who has messed up bad, and now heads for Bruges (it's in Belgium) with his mentor Ken (Brendan Gleeson, pure brilliance and humble class). Ken loves eccentric little Bruges, with its historical architecture and quaint townsfolk. Ray is bored to tears and pouts like a toddler. They meander around the town getting into all sorts of mischief including a dwarf (who has fascinating ideas about the ultimate race war), museums, cocaine, the Belgium film industry and more. Ray sets his sights on the gorgeous Chloe (), and Ken does his paternal best to keep him out of trouble while wrestling with his own gnawing guilt. The film gets a shot of pissy adrenaline when their boss Harry comes looking for them, in the form of a knock it out of the park funny Ralph Fiennes. Fiennes rarely cuts loose and bounces off the walls like he does here, and his Harry is a delightful creature to watch in action. Angry, petty, volatile, clever and out for blood, just a joy to behold. As playful as the script is, there's a purgatorial sadness to Ray's situation, a fateful sense that he's been dumped in Bruges not just to fool around, get drunk and utter witty barbs in that brogue (which he does do a lot) but to deeply ruminate on his choices and ponder where his actions will lead him moving forward from his terrible deed. Maturity permeates each exchange between him and Ken, a fledgling and an old timer shooting the breeze about heavy topics which neither of them pretend to understand, but both are neck deep in. I always cry at certain scenes, always laugh my ass off at others, and never cease to be affected right to my emotional center and the marrow of my funny bone each time I watch this. Look for a brief cameo from Ciaran Hinds in the opening few minutes. Every second of this piece is filled with lush, thought provoking dialogue, awesomely un-politically correct dialogue that doesn't censor a single impulse from its characters, and a yearning to explore the decisions which cause people to be labeled 'good' or 'bad', something that's inherently complex yet feels lightly treaded on here.

The lines given by the actors are pure brilliancy and are intelligently spoken by the script (read duality and ambiguous for \"given\" and \"spoken\").I am desperately trying to remember a movie as good as In Bruges, but right now all I can think is Monsieur Hire by Patrice Leconte to compare with this one as far as its deepness and simplicity to story tell.I believe this film will get some serious attention this year for it has the right look of a winner, with the heart of a happy loser (read \"winner and loser\" as least competitive as you can).Enjoy this beauty!",

I never saw the latter, but I saw the former last night, and it is a very good, very entertaining movie. McDonagh still has something to learn about writing, but he's nearly there, and I think I should have to keep an eye on IMDb for further works by this guy.\"In Bruges\" is a great collection of well-crafted sequences. First is the opening exposition on Bruges itself, a doddering old medieval town which Irish felon Ray (well played by Colin Farrell) despises outright. His entire commentary on frumpy tourist towns early in the film is hysterical and quite accurate (I've been to a lot of frumpy tourist towns and thought most of what Ray says more than once).The film continues on with other hysterical scenes, like Ray's encounter with obese Americans (this film is quite hard on America, actually, but I didn't mind one bit). There's also a botched robbery, where typical tourist-town criminals try to roll Ray for cash, and get far more than they bargained for.The film then moves on to introspective moments. Here is where Farrell's co-star, Brendan Gleeson, comes to the fore. He plays a quiet career criminal with a conscience, concerned for the future of Ray's very soul. I can't go into detail without announcing spoilers, but these scenes are good, too.Then there's a great closing sequence where the astoundingly profane crime boss, fantastically played by Ralph Fiennes, catches up to the two hit men for a big showdown in the doddery village.There are so many great moments and characters in this film, I couldn't really type them all up. But here's a quick list: a one-eyed thief; a racist dwarf; a goofy European movie set; a tourist trap ticket-taker who takes his job waaay too seriously; a beautiful local drug dealer; horse tranquilizers; a vulgar phone message; and a pair of smoke-phobic Canadians.My one and only problem with this film is the overall writing. As I said, there are a lot of great sequences in this film, and a lot of great dialogue. However, there's something not quite right with the structure of the piece. It has been said that the two toughest parts about writing a story are the beginning and the end. McDonagh seems to have trouble with beginnings, this film is quite fragmented up front and takes a while to build up steam. I found this quite distracting. He also doesn't really segue well. Sometimes you're wondering \"why did we move to this scene?\", although once you do get there, you love what you're seeing.I think McDonagh is well on his way, though, for these flaws are something that can be overcome given adequate effort and experience. Overall, I liked \"In Bruges\", and recommend it for those who like goofy criminal capers with a heart.",

There haven't been this many black comedy one-liners in one film since \"Pulp Fiction.\" All three of the principal actors are superb, with each revealing new facets of their talents I had not suspected before, even though I know their work well. Most impressive in a way is Colin Farrell, finally rescued from the handsome male lead ghetto and given some lines to really chew on. And chew he does...his Ray makes up for with scathing wit what he lacks in subtlety. The subtlety belongs to Brendan Gleeson, who manages to transcend both his character Ken's profession (hit man) and his background to explore the art, culture, and philosophy that he finds in Bruges. Ray thinks Bruges is Hell; Ken finds it a kind of Heaven. And the third surprise in this film is Ralph Fiennes, a very, very different Ralph Fiennes than we see in *his* handsome male lead ghetto roles.Martin McDonagh has been called \"the most famous Oscar-winning director you've never heard of,\" based on his win for a short called \"Six Shooter.\" I've seen that film, and it's even darker in its way than \"In Bruges.\" But it's that Irish kind of dark that is full of humor. Black humor, admittedly, but humor nonetheless. And, like \"Pulp Fiction,\" if you can get beyond the surface characters and what they are and what they do for a living, and focus on what they're SAYING, the humor is side-splitting.

I can't say I'm a huge fan of Farrell but I couldn't think of anyone else I'd rather see play Ray in this movie.If you like dark humor than this movie is way up your ally. As you might of read in IMDb's trivia section, the word %$#@ is said 125 times in this movie and every time it makes me crack up. Interestingly, Ralph Feinnes doesn't make his mark until the last half hour of the movie. Every scene he is in made me laugh so hard. So many brilliantly played out awkward moments that always have a punch line even if it was meant to be serious. The script was brilliant and very original. The movie only made around 7,000,000 in The United States but then again, most of the little films these days seem to be the better movie.Ray and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are trying to settle down from there wild lives of being hit-man. But it isn't easy for hit-man to blend in as tourist. The big turn of the movie comes around forty minutes but it acts like a small twist so I won't say anything else.They're really isn't much out there on DVD right now so as long as violence, profanity, and drugs (and there are lots of all the above) don't offend you, give In Bruges a try. Could be the biggest surprise of the year.",

This movie accomplishes the difficult task of enabling the viewer to connect emotionally with murderers.

This does show that Colin Farrell can be a likable and effective Actor, in fact, the Performers here are all up for this ostentatious offering. It's a crude and funny attempt at something or another about despicable Characters with a \"tender\" side, and the Audience is suppose to believe that there is Beauty, if one looks, everywhere.

            "content": "'In Bruges' tells a darkly hilarious story of two hit men who visit Bruges to stay in hiding. 'In Bruges' deserves credit for the creativity behind it among other things. Being a huge fan of black comedy, I haven't seen anything like it. The screenplay is superb and unique. The story feels very Shakespearean and I wonder whether there is another movie where the dialogue is loaded with such dark humour through dialogue, situations and characterization. McDonagh does take the dialogue to quite an extreme side of darkness using themes like pedophilia, racism, homosexuality and xenophobia but the comic impact isn't lost.The setting is amazing. Bruges looks amazing. It's historical, quiet, seemingly peaceful and mysterious. Thanks to the remarkable cinematography which allows the town to play a character of its own. It definitely makes one want to visit the place.'In Bruges' is additionally loaded with colourful characters that include the aforementioned two hit men (the main characters), a gangster, a racist little person who prefers to be as a dwarf, a blind con-artist, a Russian arms dealer, a pregnant lodger, a sexy drug dealer, a Dutch prostitute and a Canadian couple who hate cigarette smoke. Many of their appearances may sound random but it all comes together beautifully in this film.All the actors do nothing short of a splendid job. Farrell and Gleeson both perform naturally as the killers with conscience. Their dialogue delivery and comic timing is fantastic. Colin Farrell is in form after a long time. Though the reason for Ray's arrival in Bruges was to escape the consequences of having killed a child, Ray is portrayed as a childlike character himself and Farrell makes him believable and human. Brendan Gleeson is excellent as a father/big brotherly figure to Ray. His reaction to his costars is particularly of note. Ralph Fiennes has played villainous parts before (like in 'Schindler's List' and that Harry Potter movie) and here he does it wonderfully displaying a flair for comedy. Thekla Reuten is a surprise treat as she is very likable as the hostess. Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy is charming.'In Bruges' is an exceptional witty black comedy that is both entertaining and fascinating. It's been a long while since I laughed out loud so many times during a movie.",

            "content": "I don't need to repeat anything about the plot line since you have already read it, or should have. In any event I found this film to be a wonderful diversion. What we soon learn is that the two hit men are completely unsuited to the job. They are complex, morally conflicted and emotional, while their employer is a cynical psychopath. Having some time off with these two in the Belgian city of Bruges during Christmas allows us to move about the old city on a sight seeing tour, punctuated with serendipitous or chaotic encounters with other people and interactions between the two leads. Along with the Christmas lights there is some violence, but it is integral to the black comedy aspect of the film. Some of the violence is quite comical.The addition of a film in production within this film adds another level. Two of the supporting characters come out of that inner film, in a certain way providing a connection between waking and dreaming. Bit parts played by people in fantastic costumes add to the magic of what might otherwise be a purely dark scene.All the characters are very carefully crafted. As another review stated this is (in part) a character study. It is also designed to be very entertaining, which it is. I enjoyed it immensely. A bit slow moving at times, but this is a European film which holds the value of the stage very high, yet it does not appear staged. It puts you right there. The direction, the camera work and the acting all work together to give a real experience.",

            "review_title": "Big disappointment",
            "content": "\"In Bruges\" was a huge disappointment, especially considering the unending praise this movie has been drawing from critics and viewers alike.I thought it was very false, and contrived.The movie centers on two professional hit men from Ireland, rationalising what they do for a living, i.e. killing people for money, by telling themselves that most of the people they've killed weren't very nice anyway, so kinda had it coming/only got their comeuppance. At the same time, they do of course have very appropriate pangs of conscience about the few people they killed who may not have deserved it. Generally speaking I don't care for movies about contract killers (\"Grosse Pointe Blank\" being another example) which depict their protagonists in a na\u00efve, romanticised way: Yeah, here are these two paid killers, but don't be put off by what they do for a living, they're really quite friendly people, so long as you don't end up on their hitlist! In fact, even if you do end up on their hitlist, they are still going to be friendly to you, although they are going to have to kill you, but that's strictly business, nothing personal! There is a scene where one of them relates how he had to kill a man he wasn't paid to kill \u0096 the man just stood in his way trying to protect a relative who was on the assassin's hitlist. The scene turns into a mock argument about whether or not he shot the man in self-defence, with the two talking at cross points, or rather Colin Farrell's character pretending to be too obtuse to see the other guy's point. The scene is clearly meant to be hilarious. I had no inclination to smile.One thing I am really sick of in English-language movies (not only this one) is all these Continental European supporting characters with absolutely flawless English, in this case Colin Farrell's enormously annoying Belgian love interest. Not only do they never make any mistakes, they speak the language so brilliantly that they can hold their own in witty conversations with native speakers, firing from a sparkling repartee that includes puns on English words that I assume wouldn't work in their own language. How about making a movie for a change in which Belgians, Germans, Italians, etc. speak English the way they really do, i.e. BADLY? Of course, no explanation is ever given why they speak English so well. Usually one of the native-speaker characters just makes a stupid surprised face and says something like \"Wow, your English is really good\", and that's that. On to the next pun.Another thing I am tired of is all these regular people with superhuman courage in the face of extreme danger, in this case an extremely pregnant(!) hotel owner who never wavers for a second as she stands in the way of an armed madman, in defiance of the danger to her own life and that of her unborn baby. Right. If there was anybody in the real world who would really act this way, it wouldn't be courageous, it would be plain stupid.There is one scene of such colossal absurdity, I can't help but relate it. A man is first shot in the leg, then he hobbles down the winding stairs of a bell tower (albeit propped up by another man, to be fair), then he gets shot into the throat or maybe shoulder, then he drags himself back up the same winding staircase (this time without the help of the other man), then \u0096 once at the top \u0096 he drags himself onto the parapet of said bell tower to stand erect(!) upon the parapet before hurling himself down. There is a massive cloud of blood as he hits the ground. I won't reveal what happens next, let's just say the guy is of an impressive resilience.Almost as absurd is the ending which has the five leads all in the same place at the same time, so the movie can conveniently deal with them one after the other until all emotional and outer conflicts are neatly resolved, in a way that could only have been contrived by a director who comes from theater.I am giving this movie a liberal 2 out of 10 stars, the lowest rating I have given any movie since Terry Gilliam's \"Brothers Grimm\". If you want to see an honest movie about a paid assassin, watch the original \"Day of the Jackal\". That movie too centered on a man who killed for a living, but unlike \"In Bruges\" it never tries to coax the viewer into sympathising with its protagonist. Instead, it deals with its subject matter-of-factly: he's a contract killer, ruthless and despicable.",

Basically Irish hit men Ray (Golden Globe winning Colin Farrell) and Ken (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Brendan Gleeson) are sent by Londoner and mobster Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes) to lie low after a job in a London church went wrong. Ray was supposed to kill the priest of the church for a hit, and he accidentally kills a child with the same bullet, and he has had nightmares about it since. They have been sent to lie low in Bruges, Belgium, during the Christmas holiday, and while Ray is bored and missing home, Ken is wanting to enjoy the things to do and see. Ray has his bored attitude changed when he meets drug dealing crook Chlo\u00eb Villette (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy) who is dealing during a movie being filmed, starring American dwarf actor Jimmy (American Pie Presents The Naked Mile's Jordan Prentice). Harry calls with instructions for their hit, but Ken refuses forcing the mobster to come to Bruges to settle the score and have a showdown in the Belgian square in the area. In the end, after seeing Ken fall to his death and speak his last words, and a gun to give him, Ray kills Harry, and once again unintentionally a small person, Jimmy. Also starring J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier as Eirik, Elizabeth Berrington as Natalie and Eric Godon as Yuri. Farrell, with his unusually large eye brows, and Gleeson with his Irish prowess, and the always reliable Fiennes putting on a lighter than usual voice make a good cast. It may be a little politically incorrect in parts, it even shocks you with the death of the child, but some humorous moments and a witty script, it does do well as a black comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Editing and Outstanding British Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical.

Wow - just like in real life.The scenes of Bruges are beautifully shot, the script is clever and funny and the acting first rate. The whole movie is a work of art. It became my favourite movie from the first viewing but I left it nearly a year before reviewing it as I thought my enthusiasm may subside. It has not: I have given this film 10/10. There is a wonderfully warm paternal relationship between Ken (Brendan Gleeson) & Ray (Colin Farrell) both characters are beautifully written with depth and wit. The background story unfolds gently without any fanfares that would insult the viewer. There are several very interesting characters floating around Bruges with Ray & Ken many of whom have good lines and memorable presence in the film: Tourists, drug dealers, a dwarf and a ticket seller, all with their part to play and who play it well. The movie changes tempo in the final half hour becoming more action orientated and for me this is the weakest part. But the ending itself is perfect for the film. It has ambiguity which is something I normally hate, but a happy ending would be out of the question in this story and who the hell wants to see a sad one?",

But for hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson), it could be their final destination; a difficult job has resulted in the pair being ordered right before Christmas by their London boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to go and cool their heels in the storybook Flemish city for a couple of weeks.Very much out of place amidst the Gothic architecture, canals, and cobbled streets, the two hit men fill their days living the lives of tourists. Ray, still haunted by the bloodshed in London, hates the place, while Ken, even as he keeps a fatherly eye on Ray's often profanely funny exploits, finds his mind and soul being expanded by the beauty and serenity of the city.But the longer they stay waiting for Harry's call, the more surreal their experience becomes, as they find themselves in weird encounters with locals, tourists, violent medieval art, a dwarf American actor (Jordan Prentice) shooting a European art film, Dutch prostitutes, and a potential romance for Ray in the form of Chloe (Clemence Poesy), who may have some dark secrets of her own. And when the call from Harry does finally come, Ken and Ray's vacation becomes a life-and-death struggle of darkly comic proportions and surprisingly emotional consequences. In Bruges 9/10",

            "content": "I wasn't going to review this, but a recent rash of award nominations together with encouragement from people like Barry Norman (the UK film critic) provokes it. A characteristically attractive central performance by Brendan Gleeson (too good for this material) and at least competent performances by Farrell and Fiennes conceal the profound moral emptiness and cynicism at the heart of this film, which blatantly attempts to assemble the components of a cult hit. Add a dash of Tarantino dialogue, the comic cinematic dwarf from \"Living in Oblivion\", the psychopathic geezer-gangster from Sexy Beast; even the title is probably a steal (though in different circumstances it could have been quite a funny one; American readers should know that there is a satirical magazine in the UK called Private Eye, a bit like your \"Onion\", and in Private Eye there is a running joke about an imaginary film called \"They flew to Bruges\", which successfully captures everything about the sort of worthy and desperately unglamorous black-and-white 1950s war film that you might doze off to on a Sunday afternoon's telly).But look: it takes more than adding a few effs and jeffs to the dialogue to make you Tarantino. You have to have an ear for real speech to make this work. All we get here is just pointless foul-mouthedness, but with not one memorable or quotable line in the whole thing. Compare this to, for example, Armando Ianucci's \"The thick of it\" (A TV political satire), where a character hovering in a doorway is told to \"Come the f*** in or f*** the f*** off\"; now that's funny, creative swearing. In \"In Bruges\" it's just depressing and relentless. Still, the director and producers are enormously proud of their potty-mouths, as they devote a whole DVD extra to counting the instances. \"Oh, grow up\", is the only response I can muster.These three central characters are two hit men and their psycho boss. Gleeson's character can remain appealing enough as we are told little enough about the hard realities of his background, but Farrell (the ostensible lead, with whom we are supposed to sympathise), is on the run in Bruges (this isn't a spoiler as it's clear early on) because of a \"hit\" that's gone wrong, resulting in the death of an innocent child (a choirboy, no less). Still, any moral qualms one might have about rooting for these dangerous sociopaths can be conveniently be put to one side because the \"hit\" that went wrong was on a priest who had been interfering with children. A paedo! So that's alright then; never mind that their more normal business is enforcing with violence the trades of prostitution and protection and drugs, not to mention narcissistic concepts of \"respect\"; he was attempting to shoot a paedo, so the collateral killing of a child is just another comic blunder.As for the denouement, which I don't need (and can't be bothered)to introduce spoiler warnings for: preposterous, just preposterous. If the contrived ending had introduced some moral shape (even if just a subversive or nihilistic one) to the proceedings, there might have been some redemptive power. Instead, all it does is just emphasise the cynical way in which the ingredients, including the calculated taunting of imagined \"political correctness\", have been mixed together. Not to mention their sheer implausibility.Not clever, not funny, not original, not satirical, not cutting-edge or black comedy, not even realistic; just a nasty taste in the mouth.",

When some playwrights bring their craft to the big screen they fail to grasp the possibilities that a space beyond a stage offers them. With McDonagh, he brings the best of the intensity of the stage to the screen.The storyline is simple, two hit men flee London after a job to Bruges, and await instructions.Played by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, the first hour is an absolute joy.They talk, they reflect they discuss in a manner very reminiscent of Travolta and Jackson in Pulp Fiction.Intermittently very violent the film oozes restraint making the bloody outbursts even more shocking.A perverse gunman's morality also underpins everything which passes.Ralph Fiennes has great fun as \"Godfather\", Harry in a role which acknowledges that played by Ben Kingsley in \"Sexy Beast\".As is the hallmark of most playwrights, the story has a \"proper\" end and is all the more satisfying for it.With Tarrantino and Ritchie seemingly spent forces at the moment the field is open for the likes of McDonagh and the Coen brothers to blaze a trail for 21st Century crime capers.At just over an hour and a half the film also displays a rare discipline as the viewer quickly learns to soak in each setting and each exchange of \"badinage\" , so little is wasted.As of early May, my favourite film of 2008.",

These two professional killers have been sent to Bruges to lie low after a killing-gone-wrong. Their boss is Harry, played by Ralph Fiennes, who follows their progress by phone from England.Ray is hyperactive, depressed, and hates Bruges. Ken can actually enjoy the wonders of Bruges, even though it's just a stop on the road to the next killing. Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy is Chlo\u00eb, a woman who hangs around movie sets to deal drugs and offer her body as enticement to the unwary. I've been to Bruges twice, and it's probably the most enchanting city I've ever seen. It's called the Sleeping Beauty city because progress passed it by, and there was no incentive to tear down the old and build the new. By the time people got around to modernizing Bruges, they understood the value of a city preserved as if in amber, and they left it the way it was. (You actually get a pretty good tour of Bruges in the movie, and it looks beautiful. That's the point--it's a beautiful city in which terrible things are happening.)The terrible things naturally involve Ray, Ken, Harry, Chlo\u00eb, and other lowlife types as well. What makes the story a fairy tale is that all kinds of mayhem take place on the streets and in the houses of Bruges, and no one except the main characters appears to notice. People shoot at each other, coins rain down from a tower, and a police officer never appears. Bruges has police, and they intervene there as they would intervene anywhere else. You have to suspend disbelief to accept their absence in the film.Despite this lack of realism, the movie is both a powerful psychological study and a real thriller. It's definitely worth seeking out in a theater, and will work fairly well on the small screen as well. See it!",

            "content": "What a neat, compact and thoroughly entertaining little package In Bruges actually is - a film that never takes itself too seriously, but will have you feeling some sort of slap of emotion if you've gone with it by the time the finale has arrived. The film is an extremely black comic piece, relying on jokes and humour that targets specific ethnicities and 'types' of people but at the same time includes the necessary substance through slyly introducing events and flashbacks, confirming why certain characters carry certain hate ridden and confused opinions on their surroundings. The film is encouraging in another sense; a British director running on British fuelled money directing a debut piece he also wrote and quite clearly using other British co-writers/directors from recent times as a source of inspiration.The sources for this inspiration range from Guy Ritichie to Simon Pegg with an essence of Jonathan Glazer's 2000 gangster outing Sexy Beast thrown in for good measure and it all pulls through rather nicely. Interestingly, fellow writer/director Martin McDonagh pays tribute, not necessarily directly to these people but certainly acknowledges he's updating and referencing, very early on when one of the lead characters stumbles across a film set. Here, he meets a young Belgian female production assistant and she exclaims that 'what we're doing here is an homage; a pastiche is too strong-a word for the project'. The lead's confused reaction might well be the same for some audience members but the girl has nailed it and McDonagh has nailed it in his own screenplay.It is a homage; maybe pastiche IS too strong-a word but it is poignant this exchange happens on a film set. McDonagh has cleverly brandished his two leads Irish, making it particularly difficult to label them British gangsters of sorts but you know exactly where he's coming from. In Bruges sees two Irish hit men hiding out in the Belgian city of Bruges following a botched job. Their orders are to wait for a phone call from English mafia boss Harry (Fiennes) as he assesses the situation but Harry has a dilemma and when he does call, his intentions are far more menacing. But that would be spoiling the fun. The two leads are Ken (Gleeson) and Ray (Farrell) and their initial time spent there has the film crack its best jokes that are particularly un-PC but also sees the script establish several complex emotional pieces of substance to back up the content. It appears Ray is having a bit of a break down and thus resorts to verbal insults and discrimination as well as adopting a relatively childlike persona, best highlighted at his glee at the sight of dwarfs, beer and his bemoaning at the sights of historical buildings.Since we do not get to know Ray prior to his 'tragedy', we cannot compare mentalities before/after. Ken seems to have known Ray for a certain amount of time and acts as a foil to Ray once all the bickering in Bruges begins. The important thing here is that Ken actually replies to Ray's bickering so all the complaining and un-PC comments Ray says in Belgium probably does not reflect the kind of person he really is. If he'd been like this even 'before' the event, perhaps Ken would've got sick of always snapping back and might've let Ray just get on with it. If Ray is an assassin, we expect a certain degree of professionalism from him but what we get is a spoilt child performance conflicting archetypes. He is, indeed, referred to as 'the boy' by characters later on.Ray's badgering sees him insult the Belgians, fat people, autistic people and dwarfs but this sort of neurotic behaviour is confirmed when it becomes apparent Ray's suffering an identity crisis and is branching off into a mindset of guilt and suicidal ideation, hence his too sharp-a tongue and insults. For a long time, we share Ken's viewpoint. We are disgusted at Ray's dialogue and we get to hear first hand of the revelation Harry calls up with. But the perspective begins to shift quite brilliantly when things become apparent and emotion comes to the forefront.Ralph Fiennes' Harry Waters is introduced brilliantly. He carries a Don Logan persona about him and the same air of menace with the constant badgering and talk of things seemingly innocent and random, only off screen down a telephone. Our first actual look at him in his England home whilst on the phone is a really tasty piece of editing. McDonagh's fast, wise talking gangsters are indebted to Guy Ritchie and his branching off into a fast paced action film that actually has its characters acknowledge the finale is nearing and that \"this is the shootout\" nearer the end is more a link to Hot Fuzz than anything else. Again, the film set location within the film pops up at the end and it's no coincidence this is where the fatal blows are played out.While nobody weeps for the priest Ray killed on the job in the flashback and the fact Harry has young kids of his own which is quite alarming, the film is brutally entertaining and shot in cold, bleak and distant colours commending the psychological feelings Ray goes through. The film begins in a jovial and juvenile manner but we're hit with a brick that knocks both us and the film into focus rather than off course, which is very refreshing for a change. Fast; witty and quite humbling at times, In Bruges is a winner.",

But the charms of Bruges are lost on the simpler Ray, who is already despondent over the innocent death, especially as it was his first job. Things change for Ray when he meets Chloe, part of a film crew shooting a movie starring an American dwarf named Jimmy. When Harry's instructions arrive, Ken, for whom the job is directed, isn't sure if he can carry out the new job, especially as he has gained a new appreciation of life from his stay in the fairy tale Bruges. While Ken waits for the inevitable arrival into Bruges of an angry Harry, who feels he must clean up matters on his own, Ray is dealing with his own issues I've really liked Colin Farrell but who knew he had such a good sense of comedic timing? There is a running gag involving fighting with a bottle, and karate, that he manages to keep fresh as it pops up throughout the film. Brendan Gleeson's character provides the moral center and plays the straight man to Farrell's Ray. This works well as the movie turns more serious towards the end. However, for my money, the best performance is delivered by Ralph Fiennes who plays Harry the pair's criminal overlord back in London. Whereas Gleeson character embodies the moral center, Fiennes's Harry fills the role of principled immorality, plays the straight man to Farrell's Ray. This works well as the movie turns more serious towards the end. However, for my money, the best performance is delivered by Ralph Fiennes who plays Harry the pair's criminal overlord back in London. Whereas Gleeson character embodies the moral center, Fiennes's Harry fills the role of principled immorality, if there is such a thing if there is such a thing. Fiennes creates a character with a dubious moral center and is a quite believable figure of Shoot first. Sightsee later. After seeing the trailer, In Bruges looked like a plodding British comedy with little originality and repetitious humor, hence the low expectations. Yet, In Bruges exceeded my minimal expectations, and, unlike my impression from the trailer, was an original drama with good acting and a nice blend of comedy mixed in. It was funny in the right places and appropriately dramatic when the story shifted into high gear towards the end. The another aspect of the film worked for me was Ray's love interest. Early in the film he manages to woo Chloe, a drug dealer with, drum roll please, a heart of gold. For my tastes, the budding romance comes across more as a vehicle for jokes and drama. But it's a small thing and I doubt anyone but me would notice. I intentionally left a lot of plot points out, because, as I've mentioned, this film surprised me in a good way and I don't won't to ruin it for anyone else.In Bruges is a good film. Go see it.",

Ken enjoys the sights, but Ray doesn't. Soon Ken gets orders to kill Ray for botching a job.This is a gem of a movie. Both hilarious and suspenseful, it has the comedy that can only come from European sensibilities (good writing and careful story arcing, that sort of thing). The directing and editing are also of notice. The film also has the good sense to keep things down to earth, which actually makes it all the funnier. Colin Ferrell is twitchy, irritable, and has no control over his tongue, while Brendan Gleeson's character is a sober, dignified calm soul. Ralph Fiennes plays a foul-mouthed, straight-forward assassin with a code of honor. He needs to do more films like this. He more or less steals every scene he's in without even trying.On a sidenote, I wonder how this will affect tourism in Bruges, despite Ray's constant put-downs of the city (and one horrid joke about Belgium, but never mind that). Probably in the positive, for all press is good press. The city, for it's medieval quaintness, practically is a character in the film. The movie will probably raise people's awareness of the city in any case. It's an impeccably plotted story-arc with dramatic moments almost as powerful as the laugh out loud moments (and Lord, were there many).Hilarious and overall enjoyable, In Bruges gets an A-",

Like a violent and very adult episode of 'Father Ted' the two main characters Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Gleeson) are hit men relocated to the sleepy Belgium town of Bruges after a job in England goes wrong. The pair are constantly at odds and like any great comedy duo play off each other amazingly well, the dialogue is fast and funny and the only let up is to make way for action or at times poignancy. The films charm lies in the fact that you can never quite tell what it wants to be, just when you think it's a sharp script based comedy like 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' it changes direction to become a tense thriller via moments that wouldn't seem out of place in a Farley brothers gross out movie. As well as an impressive use of swearing and some totally un-pc insults there are effects that would make even the strongest stomached patron wince a little, but as part of the whole package including a great little part from Fiennes as big boss Harry, this is one of the most enjoyable cinema going experiences I've had all year. A hidden gem with all the elements that other films lack, humour, excitement, a storyline, and characterisation. It is also blessed with an overwhelming sense of not being afraid to play out for an adult audience, brilliant.",

            "content": "\"In Bruges\" is a very interesting film, and as dull as that term is, it truly feels most appropriate. Writer/director Martin McDonagh's first feature length film is somewhere between a European crime comedy reminiscent of Guy Ritchie's work and an existential drama. Sometimes this works and sometimes it honestly becomes schizophrenic: a marketing nightmare. I'm not surprised it was released in the off-month of February as a result. The film is an experiment that pays dividends in ways, mostly in humor and characters, and feels curious and strange in others when it comes to the more dramatic moments. As with most experiments, it's the kind of film that some people won't be able to stand and some will flat out love.The film starts off as it was marketed, as the off-beat Euro crime comedy. The premise is simply that Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Gleeson) are hit men and their boss (Fiennes, who doesn't appear until an hour into the film) tells them to lay low in Bruges and await further instructions. The city thus plays a vital role in the plot and especially in the film's deeper meaning. The gentle balance between the humor and the themes of personal inner turmoil is where the film goes schizophrenic. The first hour is mostly all lighter and the second is substantially darker. The humor exists throughout though it grows darker as the plot does.I found the humor to be the greatest strength of the film. Each joke is sort of a swift punch in the gut: you laugh hard very quickly but it doesn't linger for long. The characters were obviously instrumental in this. Though I felt Farrell's characters was a bit too all over the place, he was really quite excellent at showing his inner monologue whenever McDonagh had a shot exclusively of him with no actual action or dialogue. Gleeson is also a terrific supporting actor and brings an interest to Ken though he's not the funnier of the two. Fiennes, though his time brief, does as he always does in sucking your attention toward him. When he plays an antagonist, he always steals moments in films and this really isn't an exception.The hidden gem of this movie is the notion of Bruges as purgatory or perhaps even hell and the way it psychologically affects the characters and their thoughts about life and death. How much you like \"In Bruges\" will pretty much depend on how well you make that connection and it resonates with you. It's easy to get caught up in only the humor of it the film and totally miss all that, or in some cases that thematic content simply is too subtle. In general, I felt that because it set the tone early on as an only minimally dark crime comedy, those themes fell short with me. So while I think \"In Bruges\" is one of the more interesting films I've seen lately, it didn't click with me all the way.",

They are meant to prose as tourists as their await for instructions from their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes). They do this despite Ray hating the city; but he finds someone for entertainment in the form of Chlo\u00eb (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy). Ray attempts to seduce the young woman and ends up going through a number of bouts of violence in the process. But in the midst of the fun and games Ken is given an impossible choice by Harry whilst in the city which if he doesn't do it his life is forfeit.In Bruges is the first film from Martin McDonagh who is best known as a playwright in Ireland: but well, he has a talent as a director and screenwriter. In Bruges is funny throughout and whilst it does edge towards being offensive at times, McDonagh uses this to his advantages. McDonagh writes an excellent script with great, witty dialogue, funny jokes, a bit of violence slapstick and a simple but effective and believable story. His talent as a director also is shown, allowing for comedy and violence but also there are moments of real drama, darkness and character development. There is an event that couldn't be done in a Hollywood and McDonagh does shock the audience with it. McDonagh's pacing is quick and for a first time director he has some excellent shots from funny fight scenes to a more touching small moment with Colin Farrell lying in bed and cries out a single tear.There is an excellent cast in the film. Colin Farrell before this film had a reputation as a bad boy and his acting career seemed to be on the slide to poor action and indie films. But with In Bruges he was able to bounce back and proved that he is a talented actor, having excellent comedic timing and able to show he can also be a serious actor with his role. This is the best film he has ever done. Ralph Fiennes was very funny and effective as the foul-mouth Cockney gangster with a short temper. This is a very different role for the man and excellent in the film. Brendan Gleeson too was very good in the film and with Colin Farrell a very funny double. Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy's role wasn't as developed as the other characters but she was decent. Jordan Prentice was very funny as a bigoted dwarf American actor making a film in the city.Basically an outrageously funny film throughout.",

Writer/Director Martin McDonagh does an admirable job of bringing this movie to the big screen with just enough humor, action, and some suspense thats makes In Bruges an enjoyable film. The rest of supporting cast are good in their roles but it's Farrell, Gleeson, and Fiennes who stand out amongst them. In Bruges impressed me it was funny at times and violent with dark humor. Most of the screen time is given to the two leads (Farrell and Gleeson) who definitely make the best of it their scenes together are worth watching the film alone. Ralph Fiennes does lack screen time because he doesn't show up until late into the movie but he does a decent enough job with his smart part. I recommend anyone looking for a movie to watch thats different and entertaining at the same time most of that because of the terrific performances by Farrell and Gleeson.

            "content": "'In Bruges (2008)' is director Martin McDonagh's feature debut, and it promises excellent things to come. His film shows the influence of Guy Ritchie's 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)' and 'Snatch (2000),' but is mostly without the excessive stylisation of Ritchie's films. For two hours, the film delicately blends black comedy and action, exploring difficult themes of life and death, but in a manner entirely without pretension. McDonagh's highly-quotable screenplay (\"they're filming midgets!\"), despite an over-reliance on obscenities, enjoyed an Oscar nomination, but otherwise the film escaped most official recognition.After an assassination attempt goes wrong, two London hit-men take shelter in the unfamiliar Belgian city of Bruges. While the philosophical Ken (Brendan Gleeson) takes an interest in the city's historical architecture, the impatient Ray (Colin Farrell) takes to complaining at every possible opportunity. Eventually, the unique history and people of Bruges \u2013 including stunning local girl Chloe (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy) and an American midget actor (Jordan Prentice) \u2013 leads both men to reevaluate their lives, for better or worse. When specific orders are ultimately disobeyed, their disgruntled boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) reluctantly flies to Bruges to settle matters himself. 'In Bruges' contains several scenes that don't quite work: the midget's narcotics-fuelled rant about interracial warfare feels like forced drug humour, and the climax seems to operate out of ironic obligation rather than an understanding of character. However, Gleeson and Farrell share a chemistry that is amusing and often quite moving. The city of Bruges, whatever Ray has to say about it, is photographed with fondness and affection, depicted as a sort of historical sanctuary where time stands still. Two friends of mine plan on touring Europe later next year. Their proposed itinerary includes the staple capital cities of Berlin, Amsterdam and Paris. 'In Bruges' may, indeed, have added an additional pit-stop to their journey.",

And, yes, thanks to the cinematography of Eigil Bryid, I am not only loving this European medieval city, with canals and glowing cathedrals, but I am also reminded of the dark shadows and intricate morality of the Third Man.Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are hit men waiting days, like players in Beckett or Pinter plays, for orders about their next hit. For Ken, it is a chance to tour a glorious ancient city; for Ray it's a chance not to do that but rather watch a Belgian movie about dwarfs and hook up with the lovely girl who supplies drugs to the cast. Like two buddies from Patrice Leconte's Man on the Train, the boys couldn't be more different except for the deep well of feelings to emerge from an absurd situation.Reluctant as I am to comment on acting, I must confess to being won over by Farrell's sympathetic portrayal of a man/boy haunted by his first hit. Nor does Gleeson's Ken suffer by comparison\u0097he's tough but caring, willing to take a life or spare one. These guys are also straight out of David Mamet (think of Heist, Spartan, and House of Games)\u0097amoral and thoughtful, rude and poetic: Ken urges Ray to climb a medieval tower to look at \"the view\"; Ray responds, \"Why do I have to climb up there to see down here? I'm already here.\" Or when Ray says, \"If I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I didn't, so it doesn't.\" Perhaps Ray Fiennes Harry, the uber assassin, is more in the Mamet tradition with his repertoire of f-word variations.I am as moved by the existential sub theme as I am by the gallows-humor of these lost souls. As in the Crying Game (in which there is also a skin head former boyfriend and arguable orientations in love and murder), being comfortable in the game of murder is not easy, especially for those who like people a bit too much to be in the business and are uncertain about their identities when it comes to life, love, and death.If for nothing else, In Bruges will send you to the internet for the best travel deal to Belgium. For those who demand meaning married to story, this is a satisfying character study in the best European tradition. At the graveyard time of year for movies, I'm in heaven and Bruges is its name.",

            "content": "British gangster film: a genre that, apart from Guy Ritchie's films and Sexy Beast, has gone pretty much unnoticed for quite some time. So what makes Martin McDonagh's feature debut any different from the rest? What justifies its status as a really good gangster movie? Well, for starters, there's a lot of religious symbolism, which fits in nicely with the incessant profanity and occasional bouts of outrageous violence. Second, and this is the real selling point: it takes place in Bruges.For anyone who's never been to the beautiful Belgian city (the official name is actually Brugge, since it's in the Dutch-speaking part of the country), McDonagh's film can serve as a satisfying tour guide, despite the consistent complaints from Ray (Colin Farrell), who calls the place \"a sh*thole\". Not that he is there willingly: he screwed up an assignment (he's a hit-man, you know), and so he and his mentor Ken are hiding abroad for a couple of weeks until their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) calls with new instructions. And while Ken laps up the gorgeous architecture, medieval streets and museums, Ray says that unless he was retarded and had grown up on a farm, there's no way Bruges could ever impress him.Then, all of a sudden, Ray has an epiphany: a film set where the main character is a rude midget (Jordan Prentice). He bonds with the little fella, falls in love with a woman named Chloe (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy, aka Fleur Delacour from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), and starts appreciating the town a bit more (plus, a little cocaine never detracts from the pleasure). And just as things are beginning to shape up, Harry and his instructions show up for a \"social call\".The stark contrast between beauty (the landscape) and ugliness (the language and eventual bloodshed) is the key ingredient of In Bruges' weird appeal. In fact, the two aspects come together when Ken and Ray are admiring a series of paintings by famous artist Hyeronimus Bosch and Ray just can't take his eyes off \"The Last Judgement\", a splendid yet shocking depiction of the afterlife. This is also where the film's underlying spiritual theme is unveiled: the two protagonists are seeking redemption, and Bruges is their Purgatory (although Ray has another opinion on the matter: \"This is what Hell must be like: spending the rest of eternity in f*cking Bruges!\"). It may seem a bit far-fetched, but then again the characters themselves describe Bruges as something out of a fairy tale, thus justifying the movie's surreal turns (not least the fact, and it's no coincidence, that the movie-within-the-movie is inspired by Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now).But the real beauty of In Bruges doesn't lie in the setting alone: who's there is also a crucial element. Gleeson is, as expected, a tough but ultimately loving presence, and Fiennes, though ostensibly ripping off Ben Kingsley's work in Sexy Beast (but hey, so did Alec Baldwin in The Cooler), especially the language (\"He swears a lot, doesn't he?\" says Ray), adds an extra notch of creepiness to what is fundamentally the villain of the piece (of course, the main characters are all gangsters, so it's a pretty strange distinction). And then there's Colin Farrell, a revelation in spite of his being in the business for over a decade. It was a given that he's a good actor (just look at Tigerland, Phone Booth or Miami Vice), but the comic and dramatic heights he reaches here, with a deeply sad yet endearingly entertaining performance (for which he won a deserved Golden Globe), show that he's still got a lot to give, and it's an impressive lot, judging from this film.Bottom line: In Bruges is brutal, filled with expletives, visually irresistible, boasts terrific acting and comes with a fascinating religious subtext. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but any lover of the gangster genre ought to check out an opus so postmodern that it actually has a conversation where one character asks two people to put their guns down and one of the shooters replies: \"Don't be stupid. This is the shootout.\".",

            "content": "\"In Bruges\" is a rather unusual genre mix with many funny moments but also a couple of lengths and a more or less convincing story line. The movie mixes many comedy elements with romantic bits and pieces, a suspenseful background story, some cultural elements and a little bit of action.Sometimes, this mix gets a little bit odd. At some points, this movie is more like a tourist guide through Bruges and therefor a weird kind of documentary rather than a film with a coherent development.But the true problem lies elsewhere. The characters are so diversified that they simply aren't authentic anymore in my humble opinion. The funny guy in love suddenly is the calm and suicidal victim. The pitiless and very emotional boss suddenly becomes the consequent killer that discusses about the morality of life and death. The old and very rational killer is suddenly let by strong emotions and risks his whole existence. The sadly inevitable love story of this flick is also overused and not authentic at all.Next to these complex and strange characters, there are many stereotypical persons that appear in this movie that might make you laugh at first sight but that get quite redundant after a while, for example the dwarf or the gunrunner. This contrast is what makes this movie quite entertaining and surprising on one side but also rather odd and torn apart on the negative side. I can understand people that would rate this movie under five points and people that would give it a top rating, the whole thing heavily depends on your personal taste. If you're open-minded and just want to live a strange odyssey, the chances are good that you might at least appreciate this somehow experimental film but if you're looking for something coherent, gripping and more traditional in terms of suspense or comedy flick, you should watch a detailed trailer before you get your hands on a copy of this.The strongest point of this feature is definitely the dirty humour. I know many people that actually adore Bruges. I have been there and must admit that even though I'm pretty much interested in arts and history, this town is pretty boring and almost appeared as a sleepy ghost town to me filled with tourists and their guides and a couple of old people. That's why I can really laugh about the stereotypical descriptions of that city and the extreme discussions about its strong and weak points. These discussions and the slapstick elements in many unpredictable situations were my favourite parts in the film.I disliked the character development, basically the whole plot and the lack of true suspense after all. There were only episodes, bits and pieces of the movie that I appreciated while there were also many unnecessary lengths. Sometimes, I was extremely bored, then suddenly extremely addicted to this movie. In the end, this feature was worth to be watched and gets some credit for its experimental originality. This is something different from anything I have seen before. It's not always different in good terms but it was refreshing but also exhausting to discover something that unusual. I would though watch it again as this flick has the potential to become a cult movie and might also grow on me.",

That said...I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie. There were several reasons I didn't like it. It's a \"feel bad\" movie. You might come out of it wanting to go home and have a bit of a cry about how nothing really made you feel like justice had been done, or your brain had been pleasured.For a start, you'd better be prepared to hear one of the two main protagonists, Ray (Colin Farrell), whinge and whine about how he just HATES Bruges, every 5 minutes or so in the movie. This grated on me. A lot. Ray's character irritated me in just about every way imaginable. He is rude, arrogant, ignorant, and gets a kick out of hitting, killing, and insulting people (particularly midgets). For this, the storyline rewards him with the love of a beautiful Belgian girl. This felt very unjust, and just plain irritated me for the whole movie. I kept hoping Ray was going to die.You'd also better not be easily offended. When people say this movie has lots of black humour, they're not lying. Few taboos are left unbroken, short perhaps of paedophilia. Drugs, sex, violence, racism, insults, you name it, it's in there. I'm not easily offended, nor am I politically correct, but the casual overuse of these somewhat nasty tones for frequent black humour also grated on me. It made me feel bad.In conclusion, you MAY want to see this movie. It may surprise you at times, but probably not in a good way. It will not make you feel happy, and you'll probably be quite satisfied that those who die in the movie, die. They're all quite nasty people.",

            "content": "Thank God for awards seasons or else low profile yet note-worthy films like \"In Bruges\" would never have made my list of movies to watch. I first read about it as one of the Top 10 films of 2008 in about.com, together with all five eventual Oscar Best Picture nominees. Then in the Golden Globes, both lead actors Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson netted nominations for Best Actor in a Comedy. Colin Farrell won his first Globe here. From then on, I knew I had to watch this.You may wonder why I put \"Drama\" as the Genre above, instead of Comedy like the Golden Globes did. Well, it is simply because I did not think this was a comedy AT ALL! The plot follows two hit men sent to the medieval town of Bruges in Belgium to hide out after a messy assignment. The main conflicts and resolution of the story are hardly a laughing matter. Very serious issues of guilt and death are tackled here, with some very violent scenes.Certainly, there are some really funny episodes and witty lines of dialogue interspersed within that main storyline. But for me, these ironic scenes and words do not a comedy make, even if that were the intention of the writer and director Martin McDonagh. Of course, this, I would not really know.The interaction of Farrell and Gleeson was flawless. They both deserved to be nominated, yet the victory of one over the other is debatable. Farrell played the younger guy Ray who carries with him the weight of a tragic miscalculation. Gleeson is his jaded senior Ken who has already learned to find the good in bad situations. Ralph Fiennes adds to the mix with a startling performance as their malevolent boss Harry, who has a weird misplaced sense of honor.More interesting color is added to the film by the various flawed characters the two meet in Bruges. Despite the number of these people in the sidelines, each one plays an important role in the story and film never loses its focus. I have to mention here the very pretty love interest Chloe (Clemence Poesy) and the midget actor Jimmy (Jordan Prentice) for putting in some memorable quality screen time and dialogue.Although excellent, this may not be a film for everyone. The violent scenes can be quite bloody. There are several lines that may offend midgets, blacks and Belgians, but I guess that is where most of the black humor lay. In addition, I appreciated the fact that I watched a copy with good subtitles since the Irish brogue can get difficult to understand. And, like Ken, I do like the look, history and ambiance of Bruges, and I would like to visit that place sometime in the future.",

A while went and I forgot about it, but then it suddenly movie popped up again, so of course I went to see it.Not really sure what to expect other than Colin Farell, and old guy and Ralph Fiennes interacting in the bizarre location of Bruges, Belgium, the movie was a delightful surprise. There is a good dose of humour, dark and somewhat lighter, and there's more humanity than in all of Hollywood's summer blockbusters combined.Superficially a slow actioner, In Bruges is a morality play, which shows the new-comer director's background in the theater. The interaction between the characters, the amazing twists and turns of the story and the great acting between the three lead men(Brendan Gleeson a surprise to me, his Harry Potter role did not impress but how could it have?) is the main thing to expect from this movie, with a clever and exciting climactic ending to top it off.If you liked Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, or Layer Cake, or any other subtle off-beat dark comedy, then this is definitely for you. Beware of blood and violence at some parts, and heavy themes at others. This is not a movie to take lightly, but give it a chance, it's worth it.",

The midget is an angry racist, the girl is a coke dealing petty thief, and of course her bf is a 'lollipop man' who likes holding people up as well.

A meta deconstruction of the crime genre? A character-based drama laced with plenty of humor? Martin McDonagh doesn't want to limit himself to one of those things, making \"In Bruges\" if nothing else a film certainly worth seeing, and something that promises a future for him as a film writer (he is already a well- established and acclaimed playwright responsible for the superb Leenane trilogy and the closer in tone to \"In Bruge\" Aran Islands trilogy, yet to be completed). While there is nothing bad about McDonagh's direction it's pretty standard modern TV- level stuff, there's the typical amateur trick of having the camera moving nonstop even when people are just talking (although McDonagh makes the wise decision not to do this whenever our lead romantic pair are on-screen, suggesting that he at least had a reason for doing that when the criminals were conversing, even though it's still an unwelcome distraction and a cheap ploy to keep impatient viewers interested). The film never rises above the level of a television series visually, in spite of some neat outdoor scenes where the cinematography becomes notably better than it is throughout the rest of the movie (where, again, it's pretty standard TV-level stuff). I would have loved to see this script handled by a more mature, experienced, and better director than McDonagh, although he could improve later in his career for sure.The screenplay is not surprisingly a far more consistent and solid affair. Not everything works and there's a little too much reliance on catchphrases and character quirks which are supposed to make you laugh just by inclusion ('in f-ckin' Bruges' was funny, oh, the first ten times, but it gets old), as well as too many 'look how clever this is' meta touches ('are you stupid? This is the shootout!'). Still, the movie is genuinely funny a lot of the time, and has a surprising amount of depth with the two main characters, particularly Colin Farrell's character Ray (and Farrell is great here, which helps. He's done this sort of thing before, but nothing has given him as much to chew on, and he's surprisingly good at the more contemplative stuff). The far-fetched ending, which fits with the tone of the film and the established idea that being in Bruges is like being in a fairytale, is still a costly mistake along with everything leading up to it, and Ralph Fiennes is coasting on his 'evil routine' here, with, again, some meta comedic touches. Still, considering the ambition of the script, to make something more out of a genre which has been extremely lightweight for a long time, it's overall quite successful. \"In Bruges\" is not McDonagh's best work as a writer, but hopefully it will open doors for him in the industry and allow more of his dark comedy, often featuring some real intelligence and solid character writing, to be seen by a wider audience. \"In Bruges\" is fresh and involving enough, neither as bad (and certainly not as 'tired') as its detractors claim it is, and probably not quite as good as its fans would tell you. Worthwhile viewing.",

It seems like British films are increasingly getting better or I should say more abstract than Hollywood films. I'm not convinced that an American studio would make a film like this. This film has some sharp, witty dialog and it proves to be effective, especially during the bantering of Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson.Martin McDonagh's film is about two hit men who are sent to Bruges to cool things off after a failed hit attempt. But things go awry when the crime boss comes to town to settle things.The acting is very good. I think Colin Farrell is underrated but this film shows he has the makings to be a bona-fide star. His sharp turns and the way he gives his dialog is very memorable. He and Gleeson have absolutely one hundred percent chemistry with each other. Ralph Fiennes makes a great baddie as we know because of his role as Voldemort in the Harry Potter films. But, he's not entirely bad and I love to see that in a bad guy.Overall, this is a dark comedy that has a little bit of everything. It has thrilling moments, some action, comedy, a little bit of romance, and some blood. It also can be classified as a satire and a witty one too. It has a very memorable screenplay and is one of the best of 2008. I knew this would be a good film and I'm glad I was not disappointed. I rate this film 10/10.",

            "content": "In Bruges (2008)A quiet film about a couple of hit men hiding in Bruges, one of them loving it (played by Brendan Gleeson) and the other (Colin Farrell) bored and unappreciative. They run into trouble in several ways, mainly learning that they are not there to hide out after all, but this only turns into a kind of shoot 'em up climax that isn't what the movie's arc really intends. A couple of side characters have some effect on events, mainly a drug running love interest (Clemence Poesy) who is meant to be searing and different but comes off a bit stilted, and a dwarf in a movie being filmed there (Jordan Prentice) who is charming and a little incidental after all.What really works best is the screenplay. The writing is sharp, and the idea, offbeat within a large and well-worked genre, develops with some nice turns. Oddly, the back and forth humor between these hit men doesn't quite gel despite their good dialog, and I think it's just bad casting or bad directing, because Gleeson and Farrell sure are trying to be ironic and wry and a bit doltish. Maybe they try too hard. Or maybe it really is the direction, under Martin McDonagh, who did also help with the writing. This is McDonagh's first full fledged film (he made an earlier prescient short, \"Six Shooter,\" also starring Gleeson). The complexity of the plot isn't overwhelming, but the threads seems to coexist rather than interweave. It gets especially single-minded (and heavy handed) when the master hit-man arrives, played beautifully by Ralph Fiennes. The violence becomes a series of tricks and spectacular effects, and it's entertaining but never quite gripping or enchanting or whatever it is this strange series of events is aiming for.Bruges, which plays its own role in the film, is gorgeous, even for a hit-man, and the film was filmed there for good reason. But expect only a slight diversion here, one bubbling with possibility but falling flat on the tongue.",

It's in Belgium.It's where mismatched hit men Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) are sent by Harry the Boss (Ralph Fiennes) to lay low after a hit, to await his phone call for their next step.Like a Guy Ritchie version of Laurel and Hardy, Ken embraces the touristy \u00e9lan of the picturesque Bruges (pronounced \"Broozh\"), while Ray turns his collar up against the cold and bitches about waiting around with nothing to do.A telegram arrives from Harry, which uses the f-word as noun, verb, adverb, adjective, qualifier and preposition. Which lets us see into the tender soul of the man. Ralph Fiennes as uber-cockney Harry the Boss, is a cross between the ferocity of Daniel Day Lewis in GANGS OF NEW YORK, the rarified unculture of Phil Daniels in QUADROPHENIA and the unmitigated rape-clown cuntery of Ben Kingsley in SEXY BEAST. Though Fiennes was also ferocious in SCHINDLER'S LIST, his character there was not tempered with any humor - here, Harry's pure evil hits you like a rubber chicken to the temple. An evil rubber chicken.While Ray is on the town making time with some tasty Euro blondness in the form of Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy, and befriending a dwarf (Jordan Prentice) with a penchant for tall hookers, and generally getting into another fine mess with his A-type personality, Harry phones Ken with the next hit: Ken has to whack Ray.Ken refuses. So Harry must travel to the fairytale city to get the job done himself. As this journey towards doom progresses, we see into the crazy, twisted principles of all these men - and they are not unlike the best in all of us, with the worst tacked on to allow them to do their jobs.While trying to shoot down Ray, Harry is blocked by the pregnant hotel owner, whom he does not simply kill, instead, asking her to move aside courteously, telling her, \"I'm not going to go through you and the baby - I'm a nice person!\" Harry then makes a deal with Ray that he won't shoot at him until he runs outside. They both them agree on which direction to run.At the height of its darkness, there is shocking levity - IN BRUGES is actually laugh-out-loud funny. And brutally sad: Ken meets a disturbing end in sticking to his principles and trying to save Ray from Harry's vengeance.IN BRUGES is such a seamless, effortless shock to the system, you'd never realize this was only writer-director Martin McDonagh's second directorial effort; with its lightning dialog, intertwining plot and symbolically heavy themes.On their touristy travels, Ken and Ray encounter Hieronymous Bosch's The Last Judgment, something they can both agree is evocative and disturbing. Bosch symbolism appears throughout the film, with Ray's dwarf friend and a Mardi Gras street fair playing a pivotal role in the film's surprising, gut-wrenching finale.Carter Burwell has such a knack for music score that spanks the nerves at just that right crossroads of pathos and humor; evidenced so brilliantly in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, now here, in this same type of crucible where darkness and levity collide.Take a holiday from the Hollywood humdrum.

            "content": "In Bruges is one of those comedies that thinks it is far more witty and clever than it actually is. It's a shame, because it has an interesting premise with a lot of potential, but ultimately that potential amounts to nothing more than cussing and midget jokes.The film follows two hit men, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) who are ordered by their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), to hide away in the remote Belgian town of Bruges after a botched hit in London. They are supposed to stay until Harry gives them a call saying it's OK to leave. Ken seizes the opportunity to explore and sightsee while Ray, who takes an instant disliking to Bruges, prefers to spend his time at the pub. While there, the duo have many strange encounters in Bruges, including ones with a midget actor, a skinhead robber, Dutch prostitutes, and involving loads of drugs, all which lead up to a matter of life-or-death situation involving Ray, Ken and Harry.In Bruges is a strange combination of a drama and a comedy, and it really fails in both genres. The movie is primarily a comedic one. Although there are a few jokes that were mildly funny, most of them fall flat. The problem is that In Bruges presents itself as \"sophisticated\" and tries to come off as clever, character-based comedy, yet half the jokes are incredibly low brow. For instance, there are repetitive jokes involving a midget. Even if the joke had been remotely funny in the first place (which it wasn't), it's repeated far too many times before the movie ends. Most of the jokes are mean-spirited and un-politically correct. Don't get me wrong, I normally wouldn't have a problem with that. However, here there is nothing funny. Ray ridicules overweight people, he karate chops the midget, he knocks out a couple in a restaurant, swears like a sailor and (once again with the midget) engages in a discussion about whether or not there will be a race war in the future. None of this is funny. It's cruel-spirited for the sake of it. The director must know that simply being mean-spirited isn't funny. There's nothing clever or witty about it. It's the same humor we've seen done before, in countless idiotic, low brow comedies, presented as a Sundance-approved, highbrow comedy.As well, it would've helped if the lead role was played by someone other than Colin Farrell. I like Farrell; he's a good actor. He is not a comedic actor though. He's just not funny. It's as simple as that. His performance here is good, but he's not funny enough for a movie like this. His character gets most of the better lines in the film and they are all wasted. Ralph Fiennes fairs much better comically, yet is relegated to the last 30 minutes of the film.The rest of the movie is a mess, as it strives to be a thought-provoking drama, as well as an action film towards the end. There are long periods of the movie devoid of jokes, which would be fine if anything were happening. Unfortunately, for the first hour of the film, nothing much happens. Ray and Ken stumble around Bruges doing random things. It's boring and dull. There are a few emotional moments here and there, and although they are well done, they don't fit in with the rest of the movie, which is often crude and crass. The last 20 minutes has some good action, violence and shoot-outs, but which once again, really has no place in this film. The ending switches gears from this and attempts to be profound. It feels out of place. \"Hot Fuzz\", which came out almost a year ago and had a similar premise, stuck primarily to the comedy genre and succeeded. In Bruges tries to blend together comedy and drama, trying to be profound, rude, funny and thrilling. It's too much and the film would've worked better if it had focused more on one of these areas.All in all, I can't say I recommend In Bruges. It's a jumbled mess of a film that thinks much too highly of itself. The only thing worse than being stuck in Bruges would be having to watch this film again.",

The constant crude language, especially from Farrell's character, was more irritating than humorous and didn't feel natural at all, and neither did the character's constant whinging.The second half of 'In Bruges' is a lot better than the dull and directionless first half, in which the two characters do little more than wonder around the city complaining about anything and everything. At least we get some action in the second half, though it only partly recovers what it a disappointing spectacle. 'In Bruges' isn't bad once it finally gets going and the humour will probably appeal to some people, but I was disappointed.",

            "content": "It's extremely difficult to combine comedy and drama with any degree of success, and this would be IB's main drawback, even though the balance isn't bad as far as comedy-dramas go. We're supposed to get emotionally involved in various deaths here, and yet there are overly goofy scenes, too: the silliest being the one with the brave and stubborn pregnant hotel owner forcing Fiennes and Farrell to arrange how they'll organize the shoot-out; the resulting dialogue between the two belongs in an Eddie Murphy spoof, not this.Another problem is the director's somewhat unrealistic depiction of gangsters - and not just any ordinary criminals but cold-blooded killers. In an all-out comedy this would be forgiven, but when Gleeson shows genuine and deep interest in Belgian history, art, and architecture I have to wonder if McDonagh ever met any criminals, let alone spent some time with them. At least Farrell is portrayed as a typical gangster moron. I've also had trouble believing all these high morals and principles which apparently guide the lives of hardened gangsters. Gleeson, as far as we can tell, doesn't even know Farrell that well, and yet this hired hit-man risks life and limb to protect a SUICIDAL Farrell. There is absolutely no realism in this at all. (Apparently, it isn't just Hollywood films that glorify sociopaths.) Gleeson even becomes a martyr of sorts, which is simply daft. (Entertaining, but daft.) Fiennes even commits suicide as if he were some fanatical, ultra-disciplined 15th-century Japanese warrior. Again, this is not a full-fledged comedy, so I can't really buy into much of this...IB has many surprise twists. Its strongest point, apart from the acting of the lead male trio, is the unpredictability. Admittedly, plenty of the plot is guided by Guy-Ritchie-Esquire coincidences such as the main characters CONSTANTLY bumping into each other by accident, but because this is a semi-comedy this can be overlooked. The big finale would have been impossible without these chance encounters.A bit disturbing was McDonagh's non-latent anti-Americanism. Are the British still peeved off about losing that war over 200 years ago? Are they using the current wave of anti-U.S. sentiment to channel these age-old frustrations? McDonagh might be able to answer that. The midget character says at one point that he foresees a war between the whites and the blacks (as if he were listening to a Carnivore album), but I do have to wonder if we might not end up with a Unites States vs. Europe (& friends) war at some point. The way this pathetic, hysterical, and mostly envy-based anti-American propaganda is going at the moment - being very much pushed further and further into the extreme by the Leftist European media and movies such as this - there's a chance we might actually have that conflict a couple of decades from now. I guess we all know who'd come out the winner in that one...I had to vomit when Farrell described Clemense Poesy as \"beautiful\" upon seeing her the first time. \"Are they trying to sell us yet another mediocre-looking nepotistic female offspring as a ravishing hottie?\" I immediately thought. I checked her background, and yep, sure enough: her Daddy was a theater director. That's the sort of \"small thing\" that opens doors, I reckon... (E-mail me if you want to see my rather large Hollywood Nepotism file.) Bruges offers some very nice scenery, IB has a fairly interesting story, and an effective soundtrack. The Continental cast wasn't that good.",

            "content": "In Bruges feels like a pitch for a bizarre, darkly comedic and British version of The Departed. Unfortunately, it's not particularly successful. The best parts of it are its effective comedic moments - McDonagh's wit is evident throughout the script, and keeps enjoyable scenes that would otherwise be dull and pointless. I did feel that the comedy was more a series of individual funny moments than consistently being amusing throughout, and its elements outside of comedy were disappointing on the whole. The acting is pretty good, but the plot felt more like absurdist commentary than actual substance. While their basic character traits are obvious from the start, we don't get a deeper understanding of why they are hitmen or much nuance in their relationship. The movie centered on how terrible Bruges is, but I didn't think Mcdonagh actually gave us a sense of the city (it certainly didn't come alive or show me anything, beyond what the main characters claim about it and seeing some tourists), which is a serious flaw for a movie that focuses so much on the setting. The first two acts were lacking in energy or things happening, and the third had a fun performance from Fiennes (especially the scene when he called his wife an inanimate object and apologized, I loved that) but veered completely into the absurd and provided no closure or satisfaction. Yes, it comes full circle as Harry shoots him and in the process accidentally a kid, and he kills himself as he said he would, but that was not making any point or tying up any theme and instead just showing repetition with a flipped perspective for humor and absurdism. The scene in the hotel where they gamify the death felt most silly to me and confirmed my distaste for the film overall. The characters all die in pointless and somewhat self- inflicted ways, so maybe McDonagh is trying to make a nihilistic point wrapped in a big joke about Bruges, but I was certainly hoping for more than that and didn't find it.",

It does not pack any laugh out loud kind of jokes, but the one that leaves a smile on you with it's subtlety and darkness and a nod of appreciation for it's wit. A hit goes bad as a kid gets killed by accident and the two guys Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) responsible for it are asked to go to Bruges, Belgium to get away from the heat. Takes a little while to get used to Colin Farrell's histrionics as it starts and it gets better as it goes. Gleeson does full justice to a terrific role. Bruges, the town itself is a character and justifies the title of the movie. Last and not the least, Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy has the best smile going around and she is mostly used as a pretty doll. It packs sharp and dark satirical dialogue that is full of wit and fun and there are many sequences which makes full use of it, be it the ones involving the midget or how they go on in the climax about honor. Though there is nothing to enlighten you here (which one shouldn't be expecting out of any movie), it is a thoroughly enjoyable film with fantastic writing and performances.",

The high point by far was the Ralph Fiennes character but he doesn't show up till the movie's half over. At some of the more preposterous action situations, I had to keep reminding myself this was a comedy, or was it? I wasn't really sure, which is probably why this film didn't work for me.

That one happens to be in one of my top 5 favourite movies, so I thought I'd see something else from Martin McDonagh, since the guy seems to know what he's doing. He's an excellent writer, and it can be seen in In Bruges as well. McDonagh is phenomenal at writing dialogue. It's natural yet colourful, and while it might not be the most politically correct, it works, and no one is trying to convince that the characters of this movie would be extremely good people. Still the moral code of the characters is interesting. They are hit men, criminals, yet killing an innocent little boy is clearly wrong, and all of them seem to agree on that. The view of some of them might just be harder than others'.The music affects this movie a lot. In the beginning the dialogue sounds more like a comedy, but the music makes the whole thing feel like a weird European drama. The copy I rented just had the genre \"comedy\" listed in the back, nothing else, and the beginning gave me a lot of mixed feelings about that, since the beginning seems rather serious - apart from the dialogue. Other than that, the music mostly amplified the feeling of the movie at every point, the beginning just stands out if you're not prepared.But is this film really a comedy? Well, if it is, it certainly isn't the typical simple joke kind of funny. It's extremely dark funny. I was actually surprised at what kind of stuff I found myself chuckling at. this shows how wide the comedy genre actually is, since it includes typical comedies such as 21 Jump Street, not too funny but cheerful movies like The Grand Budapest Hotel and then really dark comedies like In Bruges and Death to Smoochy.In Bruged wasn't what I expected, considering the quite crappy description behind the DVD cover.

The funny moments are set up by earlier comments, and the ridiculous moments almost seem plausible thanks to the consistent alt-reality tone of the film and the great work of Collin Farrell and Ralf Fiennes to support this.

Martin McDonagh should not be allowed to make cinema-movies, and he should stick to short ones. Bad acting, bad dialog, bad story, bad choice of music, silly humor, badly performed slapstick. All the characters seem out of place, even a minor character like the usher in the church tower or the landlady in the hotel.It starts off in a hotel hide-out where two hire-killers have a casual conversation, when one of them strikes a subject the other does not wish to have mentioned, his killing of a child. The way this is brought up is a give-away to the bad acting throughout the movie, and it continues to be bad and it never stops. I was even horrified at the slap-stick moment with the fat American tourist-character. Why and how did the director decide to put in such a scene at all? The acting-out in the restaurant with the Canadian tourist? If this was supposed to be funny, then, apart from the terrible performance by Colin Farrell, where am I supposed to start and stop laughing? I can continue but I will not.You think while watching that Brendan Gleeson will at some point make up for the others complete failure to be plausible, but no.

Not only do they never make any mistakes, they speak the language so brilliantly that they can hold their own in witty conversations with native speakers, firing from a sparkling repartee that includes puns on English words that I assume wouldn't work in their own language. How about making a movie for a change in which Belgians, Germans, Italians, etc. speak English the way they really do, i.e. BADLY? Of course, no explanation is ever given why they speak English so well. Usually one of the native-speaker characters just makes a stupid surprised face and says something like \"Wow, your English is really good\", and that's that.

Wonderfully impossible to classify, it ranks right up there with the best of the Coen Brothers' blackly funny crime romps like FARGO, BLOOD SIMPLE and THE BIG LEBOWSKI, yet swirls in the best parts of Guy Ritchie's \"geezer\" films as well, with just a dash of existential angst for flavor. Mature, sanguine Ray (HARRY POTTER'S Brendan Gleeson) and his hot-headed yet soft-hearted prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ken (a fantastic Colin Farrell) have been ordered by their boss to spend a few days cooling their heels in the picturesque, Medieval city of Bruges in Belgium, after an \"assignment\" they were taking care of backfires in a completely horrific way. Oh, did I happen to mention that the two buddies are hit men, and that it's Ken's actions that fouled up their latest \"job\"?The two men's polar opposite reactions to this quaint European city tell so much about the characters, and both actors take every opportunity they've been given and run with it. Gleeson, who's done everything from horror (28 DAYS LATER), to comedy (THE SNAPPER) to a combination of both (LAKE PLACID) shines here as the seasoned vet, and Farrell, who's had a real tough time picking projects that make the most of his considerable talent, has never been better. Against this postcard-ready backdrop, like a rumpled, modern-day answer to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Ray and Ken ponder the ironic finality of death, the perplexing puzzle of life and what their part in it really is, and how anyone could (or could not) spend their lives living in \"f***ing Bruges\". While they wait to hear from Harry, their boss (the excellent Ralph Fiennes, who doesn't show up until halfway in, but blows us away when he does), they while away the time sight-seeing and sampling the local beer. A movie shoot taking place in the town square figures prominently, as the movie pokes fun at itself with wry and refreshing self-awareness. A beautiful local girl named Chloe (Clemence Poesy) and a dwarf named Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), both connected in their own way to the movie-within-the-movie, figure prominently in the events that occur later that affect both men in a way that both shatters and surprises.Irish playwright Martin McDonagh wears both writer and director hats here for the first time, and both fit him like a glove. The dialogue is very realistic, with just enough whimsy to delight the audience and define the characters without being too clever or precious about it. And the dark, bitter ending offsets the movie's earlier sweetness just right...sort of like really good Belgian chocolate, like the kind I'm sure you can get...IN BRUGES.

This one seems to cover all the bases; drama, romance, comedy, thrills; it's got the lot to varying degrees. The first time I saw it, it was the comedy that stood out; this time I was more struck by the drama of it. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please take a tour of Bruges while I write the next paragraph).Two hit men, Ray and Ken have been sent to lie low in Bruges (Belgium, for those that don't know where it is) by their boss, Harry, after a bungled hit. They check into their hotel only to find, to their dismay, that they will be sharing a room. This does not go down well, but it's near Christmas and everywhere is fully booked. The two men are complete opposites, Ken is quite cultured and is happy to go sightseeing in the medieval city. Ray, on the other hand, is much younger and would be happier spending his time in a bar. Ken insists they do some culture and Ray acts like a bored teenager. That is until he discovers a film crew who have a dwarf in the cast, he is fascinated with Jimmy. There he also meets the mysterious Chloe, who he invites out on a date. That evening Harry calls and tells Ken the real purpose for their visit. I will leave my summary here so as not to enrage the spoiler police too much.I think the Bruges tourist board will be very happy with this film; the medieval architecture comes across beautifully. The cinematography is great and the setting adds real atmosphere. Great performances all round, particularly from; Colin Farrell as Ray, Brendan Gleeson as Ken and Ralph Fiennes as Harry, all were excellent. Honourable mentions also go to; Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy as Chloe and Jordan Prentice as Jimmy, both were very good.As I said at the beginning, there is a lot of comedy in this film, it's mainly in the things Ray says and does. Few films make me laugh out loud, but this one did in more than a couple of places. The drama comes mainly in the final third and I found it didn't quite have the impact it might have done. I guess the comedy reduced the force of the dramatic conclusion, although by then the comedy is very, very dark. The ending, I felt, was a little bit of a let-down, I expected something much bigger. But over all, a very enjoyable film with some laughs, excellent cinematography and some great performances\u0085 Recommended.My score: 8.1/10",

The plot is pretty simple: two Irish hit men hide out in Bruges after a job. It would be a shame to give away any more plot spoilers, because it's such a fun ride. This is my type of humour, and the film is amazing in that one moment it has you laughing your head off, then less than 10 seconds later you are struck silent by the emotional depth or poignancy of a single line. Case in point: the scene in the children's playground. First-time director Martin McDonagh masterfully steers this film around the beautiful city of Bruges, a setting cleverly juxtaposed with the action. Farrell hasn't been in such good form for ages, and he and Gleeson have great acting chemistry together. Fiennes is also great as the ruthless crime boss who is also a man of principle. While the ending is maybe just a little too cute, this is still wonderful film-making.",

The chemistry between the leads are good as it makes it somewhat interesting, but overall In Bruges suffers and feels all over the place.A plot hole near the end occurs when (a guy) gets shot in the carotid artery. He still has enough blood and energy left to climb up a bunch of steps and jump out of a window 250 feet high. After he lands on his head, squishing on the ground like a tomato, he still can talk and give instructions before he says, \"I think I'm going to die now.\" On the positive side, it is filmed on location in Bruges, which is the most well-preserved medieval city in all of Belgium. The sites are beautiful but I wasn't blown away by the cinematography. Perhaps a second watch could renew my thoughts.",

Ken goes around sightseeing, but Ray hates the place and wants to get out of there as soon as possible. Ray is still haunted by what happened at the last hit (I won't give away what happened, because it might be a spoiler) and is pretty depressed. But it all changes after Ken receives a phone call from his boss...As I said before, the \"life of a hit-man\" genre has been done many times. \"Pulp Fiction\", \"You Kill Me\", movies like that. I somewhat enjoyed \"You Kill Me\", but \"In Bruges\" is a definite step up.Ray and Ken are two interesting characters that are fleshed out well for the movie. They really are two good characters that you end up caring about by the end of the film.The dialog is great, and the black humor is very funny at parts. Some viewers might not \"get\" the humor, but they can just go back to watching recycled crap like \"First Sunday\" and \"Meet the Spartans\". I thought it was really funny.But the tone isn't always humorous, as soon the story turns even darker. The plot is interesting, and there's many unexpected twists along the way. It's a good balance between humor and drama, and the movie plays both perfectly.It's a shame movies like \"Fool's Gold\" get nationwide release and lots of publicity, but a gem like \"In Bruges\" gets forgotten. If you want a great comedy/drama, I definitely recommend \"In Bruges\", but if you want a full-on action-packed thriller, this really isn't what you're wanting.\"In Bruges\" has an engrossing plot, great character development and is overall just a GOOD movie.

I particularly liked the bit about the guy not letting Brendan G's character into the tower because he was short 0.10. I lived in Belgium for 2 years and this is absolutely what they would do - most uptight people I've ever encountered in my life.

Mind you, I'm not the one that did the stamping.)Brugge is one of the most spectacularly beautiful cities I've ever been to and this film does it justice with it's cinematography and storyline.

            "content": "Playwright Martin McDonagh makes an assured feature filmmaking debut with this witty and generally amusing combination of dark comedy, sobering drama, crime picture, and travelogue. The Bruges of the title is a Belgian city with a real storybook quality and which is a magnet for the tourist trade. Hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) have been sent there on orders from their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) after a job has been botched and a young boy accidentally killed. They're instructed to take in the sights - which Ken is more than happy to do - while awaiting further orders. But Ray is grumpy and bored and thinks that spending time in Bruges is like spending time in Purgatory. Audiences accustomed to loud and fast action films may possibly find this to be just as dull as Ray finds Bruges, but some may also consider this to be a rather interesting breath of fresh air. It's very dependent on character and situation, and working from McDonaghs' script, the three principal actors do excellent jobs creating well rounded individuals who may be in a morbid line of work but who each have their own moral code. Among the assorted episodes of the story, Ray romances a free spirited local named Chloe (Clemence Poesy), makes the acquaintance of a dwarf named Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), gets briefly menaced by Chloes' associate Eirik (Jeremie Renier), roughs up a loud mouthed Canadian guy (!) portrayed by Zeljko Ivanek, and learns the truth about why he and Ken were sent to Bruges in the first place. McDonaghs' dialogue is sometimes surprising and often quite funny; he gives the material an impressively un-P.C. flair. There are spurts of bloody violence here and there, but what the writer / director often sets out to do is actually subvert the conventions of typical crime gone wrong flicks, even coming up with a way to avoid the kind of shootout one might normally see in this sort of thing. Beautiful photography and scenery are of course a credit to the film; the city does become a character in its own right. The music by Carter Burwell is superb at setting the mood. The three leads are terrific, with Fiennes showing a winning aptitude for comedy, and Farrell and Gleeson definitely managing to win our sympathies. They help to make this nicely offbeat film worth seeking out for movie lovers who get tired of more formulaic fare. Recommended. Seven out of 10.",

A naive, childish, conscience-smitten killer with a short temper and a disposition to violence. Even though he was childish and naive, he still was skilled at flirting, and decently witty. An impossible to play character. Collin Farrel made the best out of it.My other problem has been the story. The story isn't too bad, but I found, it had too many coincidences. But, if you don't really pay attention, and if you don't have to analyze everything to death (as I tend to do), you will probably not notice how empty the story is, simply because it is told quite well. If you are a fan of cool gangster movies, like Tarentino movies, this might be for you. It's a great movie, but it's not as witty as a Tarentino movie.

While writer/director Martin McDonagh didn't deliver a full on classic, \"In Bruges\" is bound to become connected to that beautiful fairy tale-town for quite a while.While cast, script, direction and score are all very pleasing, it's the ending where McDonagh takes some wrong turns. Suddenly the plot becomes implausible, characters motivations are unbelievable and mindless chase sequences take over. It's not enough to ruin the movie, but it keeps \"In Bruges\" from becoming a genuine masterpiece. Having said that, McDonagh's film is still this year's first really memorable and original sleeper.

There's a tendency for people to compare this to funny films, but I associate it more with dreary, antihero movies.

It's in my retiring assassin holy trinity with The Matador and Grosse Point Blank, films I re-watch often to restore my dwindling faith in humanity. The awful, main characters in those films at least come to terms with their past and try to be good, which is more than can be said about most people.A bit of an aside, but if anyone's in the mood for a story somewhat like this that's not funny at all, I recently enjoyed Killing Them Softly.

The supporting cast are also very good, and the balance of humour and tragedy is satisfying.

            "content": "In Bruges was a movie that took it's time to really sink its teeth into me; it began as a slow, chilled-out meander around Bruges (the Belgian town in which the movie is set) that was interspersed with a bit of witty back-and-forth from the two main protagonists (a couple of Irish hitmen preparing to deal with the fallout after a job gone wrong). Whilst the setting of Bruges was interesting in and of itself, I wasn't used to a movie focusing on so little for so long, however, by the time that the stakes were ratcheted up in the second half of the movie I noticed that I had connected with the characters on a level that surprised me. Of course, this was largely down to the excellent cast, the two main characters Ray (played by Colin Farrell) and Ken (played by Brendan Gleeson) have good chemistry and make their flawed characters endearing and relatable. Some credit should also be given to the writers, the cast were given great lines to work with. Admittedly, I found the comedic tone a little strange (especially the weird midget jokes) but it works when it counts and the movie successfully uses humour to explore the inner demons of the hitmen without trivialising their emotions. A more conventional movie would opt out of taking the opportunity to poke fun of its protagonist's emotional turmoil but that's what makes the movie so refreshing; it strikes a balance between humour and thoughtfulness and gets it (mostly) right, adding a breath of fresh air to an already pretty unique movie. I say mostly as the plot gets more and more ridiculous as it goes on, events start of quite tame but soon Bruges opens up as it's unconvincing locals introduce themselves and devolve into unconvincing plot devices, it was good for a few good laughs but felt very lazy and pulled me out of the movie.Saying that, I still enjoyed the film, the cast did a good job of holding the movie up as the plot began to thin near the climax. Overall, the entire 'feel' of In Bruges is very... unconventional and while it is lacking in areas, it's setting, characters and humour are still a welcome step back from typical Hollywood blockbusters.",

On BBC, when I saw the discussion of this new movie \u0096 In Bruges, I found it interesting. I saw the trailers, and that too appealed me \u0096 as is based on an interesting premise. Two hit men \u0096 elderly Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and young Ray (Collin Farrell) \u0096 are ordered to hide in Bruges by their Boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes), because Ray along with a priest, by mistake killed a young boy \u0096 and other gangs are behind them to seek revenge. The only way the thing can be resolved is to kill Ray. Harry asks Ken to kill Ray, who is suicidally depressed. Ken wants to give Ray another chance. Harry gets angry and comes to Bruges. The final show-down results in lots of gun-shots, blood and death of most of the protagonist.This is a dark comedy thriller movie. Writer-Director Martin McDonagh, who had won an Oscar for a short film \u0096 Six Shooter in 2004, comes back with this wonderful movie. He has this uncanny style of narrative- where he infuses dark comedy and racism slurs \u0096 with penache. And the style is felt in every frame of this movie. Even in the darkest and grimmest scene \u0096 Martin manages to keep audience gay \u0096 with the dialogue and style. The writing / story / screenplay are the kings, and Martin takes out brilliant performances from his perfecting casting.Brendan as Key, masterly enacts this role of loyal hit-man and a compassionate friend. Collin Farrel is just outstanding in his role of this innocent, eccentric, dry humored & silly guy \u0096 who is also a cold blooded murderer, with a conscious. Ralph Fiennes \u0096 since Shakespeare in Love, has grown in stature and maturity in his characterization of roles.The musical score is Carter Burwell and cinematography of Bruges by Eigil Bryld are excellent.There are also other characters in the film, who are real to the groove and have given top class performances.Though comparable with Tarantino dark humor and style, I think Martin has his own genre of telling the story. I hope he continues giving us such lovely and enjoyable gems.Those audience, who do not like talkative movies or movies that show blood in cold shots \u0096 stay away from it. Others, go and enjoy this wonderful flick.Just a trivia, I went to see this movie with my work colleague Claudia Misch, and met other two colleagues - Lena and Guido. All four sat together and enjoyed seeing this movie.(Stars 7.25 out of 10)",

Ray, the young hit-man, is going crazy and can't wait to get back to the 'real world'. But they can't movie until they get a call from their boss, the mysterious Harry.This simple premise provides Martin McDonagh the room to create a blend of comedy and drama involving a drug-taking dwarf, obnoxious turists, a neo-Nazi and his girlfriend who rob turists, prostitutes, Bosch imagery and the beautiful city of Bruges. Through all the dark humor emerges a captivating movie about the importance of principles, the ability to change, sacrifice, regret and responsibility. Quite a tall order for a hit-man movie, but McDonagh pulls it off with delicacy and excitement.I don't remember a dull moment in the movie, one that didn't have something to hold the viewer's attention, whether it be the witty dialogue, the slapstick humor, or just the shots of Bruges.Much of the film's quality comes from its Oscar-nominated screenplay. But the three main characters each contributed a good deal to the wonder. Colin Farrell reveals some talent for humor and even drama, when need be. Ralph Fiennes continues to reward viewers with his intense performances. But the real star, the actor who should have won the Oscar for best supporting role last year but wasn't even nominated, was Brendan Gleeson. I haven't seen him in such a complex and promising role since The General. And it's obvious the role excited him because he gave one of his best performances ever, playing a middle-aged hit-man fed up with death trying to do some good for people at last, even if it costs him life.I gave this movie the pass when it came out, and much regret it has caused me after watching it on DVD.

His previous foray into film was the short, \"Six Shooter\" which, come to think of it, would be an ideal addition when \"In Bruges\" is released on DVD. \"In Bruges\" is a superior English gangster film, similar, but not an echo of those two other great English gangster films, \"The Long Good Friday\" and \"Sexy Beast\" Indeed, the Harry Waters character played with venomous realism by Ralph Fiennes is strikingly similar to the Don Logan character (played with even more toxicity by Ben Kingsley), in \"Sexy Beast\" But there is where any resemblance ends. Whereas the \"The Long Good Friday\" was about power and how easily it can slip through one's fingers, and \"Sexy Beast\" was about a retired criminal being persuaded to carry out one last job, \"In Bruges\" is about the aftermath of a 'hit.' Ray and Ken (Farrell and Gleeson respectively), play two hit men. The film opens with postcard scenes of the old city of Bruges in Belgium, while a voice over explains why these two men find themselves in this ancient city. Ken is the more pragmatic of the two. He is quite content to do a spot of 'sightseeing.'while awaiting further instructions. Ray on the other hand, thinks Bruges is a dump. Ray just wants to get back to the city he was born in, Dublin. But, as the film progresses, it's gradually revealed why both men have to hang around, till they receive these 'further instructions.' When the instructions finally comes, is not what we expect. Both Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell, are terrific, especially Farrell as Ray. The supporting cast is equally good \u0096 Jordan Prentice as \"Jimmy, Zeljko Ivanek as the 'Canadian\", and Eric Godon as 'Yuri\" There were a few instances in the film I found somewhat confusing \u0096 but to list them would be both superfluous, unnecessary, and would spoil other film goers enjoyment. \"In Bruges\" is a rollicking yarn, expertly crafted, with great dialogue and many an unexpected plot twist.

Written and directed by a terrific playwright - the film takes its time with the two main leads - hit men hiding out in Bruges after a \"job\" goes badly. Instead of one dimensional killers - the film shows them to be three dimensional with fears and guilt and hope and decency and love - just like anybody. Gleeson is a wonderful character actor and gives a tremendous performance here - Farrell is also a pleasant surprise - when he is usually put into the leading man roles I find him rather boring but he's powerful here as the naive, jump first =think later criminal. And Ralph Fiennes is a delight as the short tempered crime boss. I can see how this film wouldn't be for everyone - but for a crime comedy, it is very well done.",

It's a generally entertaining, twist-and-turn-laden time that has some tangible consequences and proper payoffs for pretty much everything it sets up, including a complete central character arc. Ultimately, though, this tight thriller is let down by the occasionally forced, sometimes (purposefully) inappropriate humour and its overall detrimental 'edginess'. 7/10",

            "content": "I have to agree with most of the main points in the positive reviews of this film: The script is great, Brendan Gleason, Colin Farrell, Ralph Feinnes and the Flemish actors are excellent, and the setting is used well. The Burghers of Bruges can expect a spike in the numbers of large, overweight, English-speaking American tourists, thanks to this film. But the thumbs-down reviewers also make good points: Colin Farrell mugs a lot; the arc of the story is predictable once the boss (Fiennes) places his call to Ken (Gleason); the climax at the tower is hard to believe; The bullet-riddled ending is equally hard to believe, and reminiscent of the ending of The Departed (equally unconvincing). The film is full of quotes and paraphrases from past films: a medieval square in Bruges' Altstaat at night comes straight out of The Third Man; One character deliberately shoots another in the thigh, reminiscent of Brendan Gleason's signature work, The General; The final scene is a paraphrase of the final scene of the Coen brothers' Blood Simple.There's a point that jumped out at me that hasn't been raised yet-there are two or three gags at the expense of Americans in the film. That wouldn't really be objectionable but for the fact that some of the gags are conflated with racism. I can't object to jokes at our expense ( I am an American), since there's a germ of truth in every one of them. The racism, however, is gratuitous. We don't need this movie to tell us it's a problem. Speaking-again, as an American, racism-in-America cropped up enough times in this film to draw my attention away from the story itself. After the first two or three mentions, I was sitting there waiting for the next anti-American racist gag.So, on the whole I scored the film 9 for production values, and 4 for..what?, Rudeness?

Terribly quiet usually, I gather, at least until two Irish hit-men come to town when things, as they say really kick off.The two gunmen are Brendan Gleason, older, wiser and certainly more culturally-minded and Colin Farrell, younger and brasher, but haunted by the recent memory of his first kill for their borderline-psychopath boss Ralph Fiennes which went drastically wrong and saw him accidentally kill a young boy in the church where he was only meant to kill the priest (would love to have known why).So Fiennes Harry shunts his two employees to the quaint historic Belgian town of Bruges, they think to cool off between jobs until Gleason receives a call from Fiennes which reveals his next shocking target for murder. That plan doesn't quite work out however, requiring Fiennes to cross the Channel himself to do the job in-person but again in this upside-down-and-round-about of a movie, things go spectacularly wrong, resulting in a bloody climax taking in all three shooters.With humour as black as the proverbial cat down a cellar at midnight, cleverly interconnected plotting reminiscent of \"Pulp Fiction\" and sparkling performances by the well-cast Gleason, Firth and particularly Fiennes, not forgetting Bruges itself - it's really not that bad a place, Colin - this is one tour I'm sure glad I took in.",

Colin Farrel plays the tortured soul of a hit man trying to come to terms with a hit gone bad and hating being in Bruges. Brendan Gleeson plays the other hit man who loves Bruges and wants to tour the town. The banter and dialog between the two of them and the town folks had me riveted and laughing for 2 hours. Then half way through Ralph Fiennes pops up in the movie. Ralph Fiennes! The twists and turns this movie makes blew me away. 9/10 (I only did the 9 because I guessed part of the ending 15 minutes before it happened)",

Farrell is dealing with some of his own personal demons. Much of the first half of the movie is talking heads, but due to the clever writing and comedic moments (often cynical and not-PC), the movie never gets stale. Both lead actors \u0096 Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson \u0096 are the superb and they make the perfect odd couple. It is nice to see Colin Farrell playing a role other than the cool, slick guy.

One man loves Bruges, the other finds it tedious.This is maybe the first third of the movie, which is sometimes amusing but doesn't give you much to hold onto. Then a flurry of things happen and an elaborate, ingenious story kicks in. And that part involves terrible people being shockingly full of scruples.The film is very well acted and generally amusing with some dark and occasionally suspenseful moments, yet I was never fully drawn in. The ingenuity of the story and moral code of the protagonists felt like dramatic devices rather than something that comes from real life experience. A false clever plot and unlikely characters is not inherently unworkable, and I think the problem is less the script than that McDonagh can't quite figure out how to flesh that script with human complexity (something he successfully did in \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\")I enjoyed this well enough, but I wouldn't say it's something you should seek out.",

            "content": "Bruges is a fairytale. It's also in Belgium. We are repeatedly reminded of both these facts throughout the movie In Bruges, a dark comedy that isn't afraid to push the envelope on topics ranging from hit men and religion to midgets (no, dwarfs!), racism and tourist etiquette. This movie is not for the queasy or the easily offended as the violence is grisly and the jokes dance in the glory that is un-Politically Correctness.However, don't get me wrong, there is a lot that is easy to like about In Bruges. First, the scenery is gorgeous and the picturesque, quiet town serves as a delightful backdrop and foil to the story, which is at times pleasantly crude. After watching this movie, many feel a strong desire to visit Bruges and even I, a tourist more like Ray in taste than Ken, admit that there is a strange, almost magical appeal to the town. Indeed, often, it truly does feel like a fairytale place, especially when contrasted to the violence and pitch-black humor that fills much of the film.Secondly, the cast is absolutely flawless. As Ray, Colin Farrell brings an odd sort of charisma that immediately endears his character to the hearts of the viewers. Ray could easily have been overly rude and obnoxious, but instead, it is almost impossible not to like him and care about what happens to him. In this movie, Colin Farrell has perfect comedic timing and expressions that are, alternately, hilarious and touching and he proves that he can indeed act, something which many - including me - have known for a long time, and reminds the world why he reached A-list status at the ripe age of 25. As Ken, Ray's perfect foil, Brendan Gleeson brings a more subtle brilliance to the screen, lending his character a sort of quiet dignity that is rare in hit men, even those in the movies. In addition to their pitch-perfect performances, what really makes the friendship between Ray and Ken work is the undeniable chemistry between the actors. Also, it must be said that even though he appears in less than half of the movie, Ralph Fiennes gives a memorable performance and is, in turns, hilarious and menacing. The supporting cast is worth noting and, especially Jordan Prentice and Clemence Posey, does an excellent job of, well, supporting the main actors.The next most noteworthy aspect of In Bruges is the nearly flawless direction and writing by Martin McDonagh. This is McDonagh's first feature film (he is most known for his theater work and for winning the Oscar for the short film Six Shooter) and it is a better debut than almost anyone could ask for. There is barely a line of the dialogue that is unquotable and perhaps even more remarkable is the way McDonagh seamlessly blends all the elements of In Bruges. The action, comedy, romance and drama work together in perfect balance, giving the movie a unique and unforgettable feel. Also, while it is undeniably hilarious, it is the emotion that really makes In Bruges stand out, as well as the subtle message of redemption and friendship.",

Gleeson's performance is stupendous. A large brooding man with a soft interior acts as the perfect foil for Farrel's almost manic character. The script is superbly crafted and the timing of these two actors would put many a stand up comedian to shame.I admire the director for selecting Bruges for the backdrop. How many more 'cockney gangsta' films must we see that are shot in London? He has broken the mould.I have to admit I have no liking for Ralph Fiennes. How could anybody like a pratt that insists on being called Rafe and not Ralph? Conceit or what? Having said that his character performance is brilliant.

And I say this because I felt that the film was not at all sympathetic to this beautiful city, one of the most iconic cities in Flanders, and an old and important commercial trade port with which Portugal had privileged commercial relations in the Middle Ages. It is a magnificent and very well-preserved city, which the film insults a lot.The script is simple: two professional assassins flee from England and hide in Bruges, according to their boss's orders. However, what happens next is that each of them will live those days in their own way, interacting with the city in an individual and personal way, while waiting for the next instructions.The film could not be more provocative and incorrect: the actors insult the city, they insult the Americans, they insult each other. Dialogues laden with profanity and insults are aggressive and politically incorrect. The scenes involving the dwarf, and the jokes around him, are very especially infamous. However, the film proved to be engaging and capable of entertaining, in addition to having an interesting dose of black humor and profoundly intelligent cynicism, hidden under the high dose of aggression. The worst was, indeed, the ending, which sounds forced and unconvincing.There are hidden and barely visible qualities in this film, which the excellent work of the cast was able to exploit, bringing to life hateful characters, but elegantly constructed and complex. Colin Farrell shows all of his talent and was really extraordinary in his role. Brendan Gleeson is not an actor that I particularly like, and I think he always opted for somewhat rude characters, but he was excellent at bringing a very humane, honorable killer to life and establishes an excellent collaboration with Farrell. Ralph Fiennes is not the type of actor you would expect to see in such a controversial film, but he did very well and seems to have made the film for the pleasure of doing so. To some extent, the city of Bruges turns out to be a character in the film, with whom everyone is relating, in a relationship with ups and downs, moments of fascination and contempt.The film is directed by Martin McDonagh. He proved to be a skilled director, and guided his group of actors and the technical team well. At a technical level, the director offers us a great cinematography, which makes the most of the magnificent landscapes and buildings of Bruges. All scenarios were very good, in full agreement with the theme and the environment. The action scenes are good, and the effects have been well accomplished.",

While there's an effort to portray him with some remnant of sympathy, his guilt seems to wear a bit thin. This a beautifully well shot movie, with much of the foreign flavor captured on film along with a lovely musical score.

Overall, this is an intensely strong and moving film if one can except the characters, their circumstances. Perhaps, in some ways, Colin Farrell reflects a little bit of reality of all of us, the good and the dirty parts.

The story is brilliant, the acting is genuine and the script is hilarious. Enjoy! I hate to go on and on about how good this film is but apparently you must write 10 lines of text, so that's the reason why I'm elaborating on my (original) first paragraph......the best thing about this film for me was definitely Ralph Fienes - his comedic timing is top notch. Warning: This film is violent.The films dialogue is quick, sharp, and very very witty. Colin Farrel is superb - his crying is really heartfelt as is his understandable grieve over a major plot device that occurs early on the film. Although this film is brilliant, I have only given it 4* as oppose to 5* as I felt the film became a little drawn out towards the end. Plus, I would have preferred a more conclusive ending that the one that was presented to the audience. Despite this the film is still great and one I would certainly recommend any person(s) reading this review to check out.",

However, I won't be overrating it like everyone else, because it's far from perfect.The characters flip flop from being overly-serious to unbelievably comedic even in the most tense moment, so any sense of reality keeps getting lost. You're seeing lighthearted humor, then suddenly and pointlessly a whole lot of people die, and the movie ends with no satisfactory conclusion, eventhough it was perfectly capable of delivering it, considering how unrealistic it is, and how characters change to fit a tone all the time.With that in mind, I was hoping for something that wrapped things up in a reasonably good way. But it definitely didn't. It didn't make a good point, it didn't really make much sense sometimes, and it really didn't go anywhere ultimately. I could've predicted what would happen, but I was hoping to be wrong and things would turn out better, but - nope.So while this is a must watch movie, don't believe everything you read, it's far from the perfect dark comedy. It's too confused. The comedy is minimal, the drama is cranked up to 11, especially in the second half. Everything is too convenient, yet even with that in mind, the movie doesn't wrap up in a meaningful or satisfactory way, feeling like a wasted potential.",

Also, there is drug use and sex between unmarried adults.I believe there is a misconception about some reviews I've seen of this movie. This isn't a movie about two hit men. The character played by Colin Farrell is only an attempted-hit-man. My feeling was he was playing a person who did have a violent past, but he was not a psychopath like any professional hit-man would have to be. He likely thought that as a hit-man he would only be killing bad people, but his first \"hit\" goes terribly wrong and this movie is about the guilt he feels from that. If you've ever made a mistake in your life with terrible consequences, you'll be able to relate to his character. Farrell does a great job in this movie, and nobody does \"brooding\" like he can.There is tremendous drama in the movie, but it is still a comedy. Most of the comedy comes from Farrell, but Ray Fienes is also hilarious as the boss who IS a psychopath.Another movie out this year dealing with hit men is No Country for Old Men. Personally, I think this movie is better.",

            "content": "In many ways, In Bruges is something of a little gem. It is marketed as a 'dark comedy' and it is, indeed very funny if you like dry wit and irony and enjoy seeing the world through the eyes of two Dublin men who have rather inexplicably been ordered to leave London and lie low in an obscure Flemish town. That these two men happen to be killers is initially neither here nor there. They could \u2014 or, at least, Brendan Gleeson, as the older and more mature hit-man could \u2014 be just like any two tourists you might meet seeing the sights of a beautiful medieval town. Colin Farrell, the second, younger hit-man, is not at all enamoured of Bruges and sightseeing, and his lack of sophistication is typified when he memorably describes history as just a load of stuff that has happened. Where in Bruges is not something of a little gem is when it is reluctantly forced to abandon the Irish whimsy \u2014 one of the central conceits of a hit-man taking time off to relax and enjoy a spot of culture is nothing if not whimsical \u2014 and begins to plod down the more familiar paths of film-making convention. Thus the various whimsical strands of the story all come together in a rather neat finale, which is, unfortunately too neat to be satisfying. The writer/director Michael McDonagh can't be blamed for that, and as this is only his second feature \u2014 and his first full-length feature \u2014 his handling of the techniques of film-making is outstanding. So far he has written plays for the stage, and in many ways In Bruges is still a play which has been transferred to the big screen, and that is not meant in a derogatory way. The dialogue is naturalistic and, at times, exquisite. But in a sense In Bruges is still a play in that McDonagh wants to deal with rather big themes: conscience, guilt, a sense of honour, loyalty and revenge, and what might have worked well on stage finally doesn't work quite as well on the screen. Although oddly both the Gleeson and Farrell characters are rather likable despite the fact that they have killed without mercy for money, by the end of the film they don't quite ring as true as they did when we first meet them. Similarly, despite Ralph Fiennes's character being established as a sadistic crime boss without heart or feeling, his final honourable act is also wholly unconvincing. So where does that leave us? Well, because in so many way In Bruges is the excellent side of good, the reservations I make are rather ungenerous. My point is that because so much of the film is very good, it sets itself such high standards that when, in just a few respects, it doesn't quite meet those standards, this apparent 'failure' stands out all the more. Let me be clear: In Bruges is streets ahead of many other films which masquerade as 'comedy' or 'thriller' or 'drama'. In hindsight there are one or two niggles such as the implausibility of the Farrell character being discovered and arrested on a train leaving Bruges, the way that various characters conveniently bump into each other, and, it has to be said, the implausibility of some of the characters' motivation. But at the end of the day these are minor points. In Bruges stands alone and has an identity all of its own. I do, however, suspect that whether or not you enjoy In Bruges will largely depend on what kind of films you otherwise enjoy. Yes, there is a chase at the end, and, yes, it all ends in bloody, murderous violence, but these elements to not define the film, if you are the kind of moron who values so much of the dishonest, quick-cut, super-slick, in-yer-face mush which keeps the cinema cash tills ringing, you would undoubtedly feel your attention and interest flag long before the guns are fired. If, on the other hand, you have the wit and taste to watch a story unfold (however implausible that story might finally be) and enjoy the kind of Irish dry humour which is not in-yer-face, your will enjoy In Bruges very much.",

The script was very inclusive and gave viewers aspects of dark comedy as well as straight comedy. All of this was mixed into a pot of social awareness, love story and satire. The beautifully brutal action sequences were perfectly distributed between the dry and scoreless dialogue. I believe In Bruges is one of the finest of 2008, I absolutely loved this film.",

            "content": "In order to see \"In Bruges\" in my neck of the woods, one would have to be specifically looking for it. It is a film that has been put out in limited release immediately after Oscar Picks have been announced. In other words, the studios aren't giving it much of a shot. So when I hear people refer to this film as \"overrated,\" I scratch my head with a bemused gaze. What were you looking for? What did you think you were about to see? My expectations were exceeded by no small margin. The genre of the bantering hit men has no doubt been played out again and again, but \"In Bruges\" seemed to put life back into that concept. Others feel that this film doesn't know what kind of film it wants to be, but I argue that this \"weakness\" is actually the films biggest triumph. The audience reaches a comfort zone of seeing Colin Farrells's character giddy with the prospect of seeing a film crew \"filming midgets,\" only to witness the death of a young boy within minutes. Bruges itself becomes a character, and I felt as though I could comfortably navigate myself through the town (where I have never been) after seeing this film.The basics can be summed up quickly: Two hit men are sent to hide out in Bruges, Belgium after executing a hit in London. Farrell hates the town, while Brendan Gleeson (who is admittedly un-hitmanish)loves the simplicity of his sightseeing. Simple, right? However, within that simple structure lies intricacies that show the dichotomy between the two characters to the point where it is tough to decide who you sympathize more with. Colin Farrell seems to be caught in a state of arrested development; a pouting- yet humorous- eight year-old, who just so happens to be a novice hit-man. Gleeson reminds one of the history professor who has just retired and is seeing the sights, though he just so happens to be an experienced hit-man. The pleasure is in their exchanges; the little boy and the artful old man who have both found ways to rationalize their occupations to themselves, and are stuck together in Bruges.Not enough? The absurdities of the situation are amplified by ideas that would have came off well on Mr. Show: A hit-man who wants to talk his mark out of suicide, a racist midget who ironically condemns others for their physical appearances, and the most damage I've ever seen come from shooting blanks. I don't mean to offset the fact that there is a serious side as well. Death is very real here, and humor does not make life cheap. Farrell is honestly suicidal and the image of the dead boy haunts the characters, as well as the audience. But the most important thing is that this film works. I did laugh (and I'm not a saccharine individual) and I did care about the characters.To think that a film is high on itself does not move me in either direction, mainly because I've never really figured out what it means. What should a film be? Modest? What should this film have done? Cut scenes that one individual might not find as funny as another one? I enjoyed this film beyond all expectations, and if this film is \"not smart\" or \"Too high on itself\" then I guess I will accept a regression to being thought of as one of the dumb ones.",

            "content": "Imagine Christmas in a medieval European town, complete with cathedrals, graceful swans gently gliding along on a river \u2013 \"a fairyland\" \u2013 as one character describes the setting for In Bruges, a film starring Colin Farrell, Bredan Gleeson, and Joseph Fiennes. Yet before we get too comfortable with the view, don't forget we're talking about a Colin Farrell movie here. The fairyland setting begins to ring false almost from the moment our two mismatched characters, Ken and Ray, stumble into Bruges, a quaint little town in Belgium. Ken and Ray have been abruptly ordered by their boss, Harry, to lay low in Bruges, following a routine hit gone very wrong for two weeks. As the boys settle into their hotel, sharing a room instead of being in separate rooms, even we get the hint that nothing will be going quite the way either of them wants. I must say that Colin Farrell's raw-ready portrayal of a tightly wound, would-be hit man, gives me renewed faith in his talents and his current career choices. (Apparently, so did the Golden Globes 2009!) As a man running from his boss, his past misdeeds, and his failed life, Farrell's performance commands us to feel more deeply for Ray than he may actually feel for himself. Awash in overwhelming guilt and remorse for an accident cloaked within a heinous crime, Ray careens through his involuntary vacation of high-brow culture and low-lifes for which his partner and friend, Ray must woefully shoulder. Ray, played by Brenden Gleeson, serves as a steady counter-point to his strung-out partner. Gleeson is a quiet marvel of studied self-control. His Ray is at once genial and half-mocking, only to reveal a kindred ranting soul, seething at the injustices of his world, which forces him to make unpleasant choices that he can't neatly rationalize and would rather not face at all. A deft supporting cast and subtle directing blend to lift this sharp little Indie film to a three-reeler for me. The only weakness for In Bruges is the screenplay, which at time wants to bludgeon us with the sin vs. redemption theme overandoverandover again. The triteness of Harry's final act almost ruins Ray's bittersweet hope for his future for us.",

            "review_title": "A movie about Hit-men, purgation, and the contemporary western civilization !",
            "content": "Every once in a blue moon, we get a genre movie with meaning. And it's even rarer to have it in equilibrium; namely where the genre doesn't exceed the meaning, or vice versa. (In Bruges) is one of those movies. Nevertheless, the balance was partly, just partly, missed.The best about this movie was how it managed to be multidimensional. Outwardly, it's crime / black comedy. It has not \"many of\" but nearly \"all\" the right stuff: unique characters, with several antics. Hot ping pong dialogue. Engaging European backgrounds. Touchy, even if short, music. Sharp-witted pace. And all perfect performances; surprisingly (Colin Farrell) uncovers how creatively comedic he can be! It's impossible to pinpoint one downside in this cast's work. So, it provides entertainment, in its own dark taste.Then, inwardly, it's thought-provoking with philosophical dimension. The haunting guilt is cleverly portrayed. I loved the matter of \"whether jail or death was my fate, I would welcome any of them\", all for ending the compunction, and achieving the purgation. And although death is all over the story, it emphasizes the importance of life and love, because with them maybe we may win penance, second chance, and some happiness.Notice well the names of the characters. They can be read metaphorically. For instance, Ray is a hit-man who did wrong yet has a \"beam\" of conscience. Ken, meaning \"perceive\" or \"view\", suits the character as more experienced than his fellow Ray. The punisher is named Harry; which means \"attack\" or \"oblige\". And finally there is a hope in the future, through the pregnant hotel owner; whose name is Marry, maybe as a reference to the Virgin Mary, who'll give birth to a new Christ, to guide and forgive the sinners.Not only this, the movie has some sort of deep and wicked social / political point of view. It shows a western world of decadence. The Irish, the American, the Belgium people are presented as killers, drug addicts, drug dealers, gun dealers, prostitutes, thieves, racist, depressed or suicidal lost souls. The survivors of all that are the priest, and the little boy. However, they're not completely survivors, because they were killed earlier. So here we are, facing a community of human filth, that murdered its spiritual side (the priest), along with its innocence (the little boy), devoting itself to finish itself later, unless there is a desire to purge (Bruges and purge are similar words, aren't they?!). You may consider it another *Noir* world, but aside from meditative reading for the characters, you can't miss the unmistakable irony between the tranquil solemn antiquities (the old civilization), and the boisterous destructive leads (today's civilization), as the grandfathers built the great high towers, and the grandsons just fall over them!Cut to the missing balance issue; and I mean nothing but the movie's last 10 minutes. After the moment of (Ralph Fiennes) getting out of the tower, with his gun, it's all downhill from there. Look how logic takes a dive and sinks: How the man, who always sticks to his principles, betrays those principles stupidly? He said earlier that he won't shoot his target in front of 3000 Belgium citizens. Now he's with a gun, running after his target, shooting him non-stop, all over Bruges's streets, in front of 4000 Belgium citizens!!! Obviously, it was a desire that scriptwriter / director (Martin McDonagh) had of filming a crazy action sequence a la Hollywood. Or maybe, the movie needed that to be sold, since shootouts look good in any trailer of a movie, especially this \"no action, all talk\" movie!The one-eyed thief, who was half-blinded by (Farrell), runs into (Fiennes), who arrived to kill the same (Farrell), in the gun dealer's home accidentally, and in the same night that thief sees (Fiennes) getting into the tower accidentally, then sees (Farrell) near the same place, also accidentally (?) That was simply forced! Then, the midget wears as a little boy, stands right beside (Farrell) while he's being killed, takes a bullet in his head so his features may not be clear, so Mr. I-stick-to-my-principles shoots himself for killing a kid--all of that was tooooo forced to say the least! It surely weakened the solid movie, making its end no solid at all.Various bothering points : a line said by (Farrell)'s character, while his anger in the restaurant; \"He pauses, even though he should just hit the \"...\", and he repeats: Yes, I am talking to you. What's \"...\" unbelievable?!!\" which was unbelievably intellectual for that character to say, fitting more the mentality of an author, or an actor, or an author who wanted to express his own character through an actor! Add to that, naturally, the lasting waterfall of the F words, the blasphemy, and some obnoxious violence; these were points to hate, more than to bother, to tell you the truth!(In Bruges) is a genre movie that goes beyond the entertainment of its genre. But exaggerating the portion of entertainment, at the end, harmed it. Hence, it ends up as a movie about hit-men, purgation, and the contemporary western civilization, however with chaotic made-up ending. At any case, Hurray for that \"script\". If you watch many movies, you have to appreciate it, since it is not frequent to run into something like it, very.",

The story is good but what makes the film better is the acting and occasional use of humor.PROS: I have always liked Black comedies. This film does not contain that much humor as is present in different films of this genre, but it manages to induce laughter sometimes owing to the acting of Colin Farrell. The story moves slowly and you might feel bored in the starting. The ambiance of the film is cold and silent. After the first half, you will feel happy that you started this film. Another good thing is that there are not too many characters so the details of the story are limited. Acting by all is top notch and Colin farrell definitely deserved an award for this. The ending was superb.MESSAGE: \"You have to stick to your principles.\" VERDICT: \"A recommended watch.\"",

It's such a pity they so seldom happen. \"Eraserhead\", \"Duel\" and \"The Night of the Hunter\" evoke the pleasure of something so completely different that it is easy to see why so much art house cinema is such a crashing bore. Don't get me wrong. I will always regard the work of Angelopoulos, Bergman and Satyajit Ray as absolutely supreme but there are so many lesser artists with so very little to say that one thirsts for entertainment that is not just mediocre time-passing but stimulates through courting the wholly unexpected. I discovered a wonderful example the other week and have to confess to being drawn to it a half dozen times since, so much so that I find myself beginning to quote lines in the same way that I do from \"The Third Man\", \"Love and Death\" and \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\". \"In Bruges\" is a stunner. I won't begin to outline the plot as this has been done so many times elsewhere, rather will I just say that I adore the characters of the two Irish hit men and can only admire the way that the director has made a star of a city in as integral a way as any since Carol Reed's Vienna. To cap it all I love the dramatic irony of a scene towards the end involving size and coincidence that it would be wrong to give away, but which clarifies so perfectly much that is chaotic on a first viewing, resulting in a black comedy of extreme intelligence as well as one of enormous entertainment value.",

The comedy is sharply witty and well-timed, the action fast-paced and fiery, the romance heartfelt but not heavy. Colin Farrell, whose eyebrows migrate around his forehead like a pair of pitch black caterpillars on acid, works a good range of emotions out of his fairly simple leading role and cleanly manages to get us rooting for him by the time the closing scenes roll around.

            "content": "This is an interesting movie and I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would. It is extremely bloody, especially towards the end, so although it has its moments of black humour, no one should be under any illusion that this is a light weight comedy. It's not. Trailers I saw in the theatre last year (I finally watched the film on DVD at home) seemed to project In Bruges as some kind of British farce, and like other reviewers here, I find the actuality of the movie different to, but better than, the trailers had suggested. I'm not sure what prompts movie publicists to misrepresent movies, because In Bruges is good enough to stand on its own merit as a black comedy drama. Suggesting it's some kind of light comedy just brings in unsuspecting viewers who will be upset at the blood.Written and directed by Martin McDonagh the action is set in the unlikely locale of Bruges, a beautiful medieval town and UNESCO World Heritage Site in the north west of Belgium. Part of the irony of course, is that this is a movie about hit men, set in a place of astonishing beauty and in a nation widely believed (whether justly or unjustly is not for me to say) to be one of the most boring on earth. Better known for fine lace and beer, Bruges itself is one of the movie's stars and its architecture provides the backdrop to the violent action. This sets it apart from run of the mill hit men movies where we normally see people being wasted in deserted warehouses and on bleak streets. Here they expire before stunning ancient monuments on pretty cobbled streets or fall to their deaths from popular tourist haunts.Ray (Colin Farrell) plays an Irish hit man who has accidentally killed a child. The actual target was a priest, but while assassinating the priest a bullet went straight through him and into the child that Ray hadn't seen. Boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes) packs him off to Bruges to wait while the situation cools down, in the care of Ken (Brendan Gleeson), the moral centre of the film. Ken is very taken with the culture and beauty of Bruges and treats the interlude as an unexpected and rather welcome vacation. Ray, a fish out of water, is unimpressed with the culture around him and initially whines that he is bored. He hooks up with a local woman Chloe and passes the time drinking. But we gradually see him disintegrate psychologically as the enormity of his crime sinks in. He killed a child. Can he redeem himself from such a crime in any meaningful way? The denouement comes after Ken discovers that Harry's plans for him go well beyond just being Ray's minder.The whole cast is excellent. This is probably the best work I've ever seen Colin Farrell do, I've never been a fan of his before. Ralph Fiennes gets his teeth into being a baddie and pulls off a passably good Cockney accent. Reviewing this movie prompted me to look at Fiennes profile on IMDb, and the range of characters he can play is just enormous. This is an actor who can make Voldemort real in the Harry Potter films, who played a gay butler in Bernard and Doris and a repressed lord in period costume in the Duchess, and I recall his as the stand out performance from The Constant Gardener some years back.And speaking of Harry Potter, In Bruges is something of a cast reunion. Brendan Gleeson, excellent as Ken, is one of those actors with a resume which appears to require extra bandwidth. Gleeson played Mad-Eye Moody in Harry Potter and it was also interesting to see Cl\u00e9mence Poesy again. Poesy plays Chloe \u0096 Ray's love interest - and I last recall her from a Harry Potter film too! She is perfect as small time crook and drug dealer Chloe who may or may not eventually help Ray redeem himself.A very politically incorrect movie. If the very idea of redemption from murder offends then just don't watch it. Personally I found the writing, acting and setting refreshingly original.",

The actors all do a great job, the pacing of the film is superb and the soundtrack captures the tone and setting excellently - I honestly can't recall the last time I commented positively on a soundtrack!However, the ending is both predictable and illogical - given the inconsistencies in damage - which really led me to reducing a stellar 8-star film to a 7.

Or is it the overall mood of the movie? How come some fast phased action movies are so boring and some slow phased dramas are truly interesting? I guess there is no single answer. But 'In Bruges' makes me rethink these things.'In Bruges' is about 2 hit men (Ray and Ken) who go in to hiding and waiting for the next big job in Belgium at the tourist city of Bruges. The plot unfolds the emotional difficulties which they have to tackle whilst conquering the differences between themselves in order to be prepared for the upcoming job. And a certain regret which starts to drawback Ray from everything. While Ken calls Bruges a paradise Ray find the city to be boring and uneventful (Shithall in his own words) until he met with some local beauty. (I won't be telling the rest of the story spoiling the thriller part so don't push me) 'In Bruges' in many ways remind me of 'The American'. Of course The American was made recently and In Bruges was earlier so I think the recent movie must have had a mild inspiration there. Especially the story line including professional hit men and the wonderful sets in the small cities of Europe gives me some similarities. 'In Bruges' show some breath taking mid evil architecture quite impressively while giving several background info on them as well.The most entertaining part of the whole movie is the story. Yes there are crime and twists but more than that there are feelings, pain and emotion which drives it strong. When it comes to performance Colin Farrell (Ray) just melts his character right in to the viewer's hearts. Don't think you will ever get the feeling to forgive an assassin like you would want it to be for Ray.Overall the movie is quite slow. For the first 40 minutes there is nothing much at all other than the two guys roaming the city and talking about their differences. But that nicely creates a base for the next half of the movie which has more drama and action. Sometimes there is sudden unexpected gore which you may not get used to it until the last scene.Overall 'In Bruges' is a gem in between the monotonous vastly scattered pebbles.Read more review of mine at www.flickshout.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Martin Mcdoanagh is a perfect example of how to write bad people who are good.\nRay is not a good person he is rude, vulgar, miserable and to top it off a hitman. However, as the film goes on it pulls us in and shows what a broken a thoughtful man Ray really is.\nPerformance wise this movie is incredibly strong Colin Farrel and Brendan Gleeson are perfect as a comedic duo they play off of each other wonderfully and the banter between the two feels genuine. Also to accompany that is the more serious talks between the two. Ray's confessions to Ken are truly sad and have a lot of weight to them. Ray's relationship with Chloe also has those nice relaxing sit down moments which help to evolve these characters and create a bond between them as they slowly fall in love. These moments carry this story from what could be a generic buddy comedy film to a deep character drama with a comedic kick.\nThe star of the show to me is Ralph Fiennes' character-Harry. He is an angry, short tempered man with rules and his motives as the antagonist are completely understandable from start to finish. He is a man who sticks to his principles right to the end and you have to respect him for that. He is not just a cold blooded killer( all the time).\nAnother great feature of this film is the minor characters and their quirks. The  dwarf Jimmy, Yuri and his talk of alcoves, and the pregnant hotel owner. Each of these characters helps make the world feel big and add some extra life to this film.\nCinematography wise this is very well shot, each shot helps convey the sad melancholic tone of the film. The use of cold blues and static wide shots, set the tone perfectly. The camera here is used very well to convey emotion throughout the entire film.Overall In Bruges is a well told simple plot with fantastic performances throughout and is not bogged down by it's depressing topics of death and guilt. Each character feels real which is a credit to the writing, and the film looks and sounds fantastic. With a very powerful and open ending I highly recommend In Bruges.",

It follows two Irish hitmen hiding in Bruges at the orders of their boss because of a hit gone wrong.Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are the hitmen working for Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes). In his first hit, Ray, who is not overly bright and has trouble focusing, accidentally kills a young boy in addition to the intended target. However, their well-defined moral standards do not allow them to kill children.As they await further orders from Harry, Ray and Ken stay in a small hotel run by a very pregnant Marie (Thekla Reuten). They begin to explore Bruges, which Ken likes and Ray hates. Ken appreciates historical buildings and art museums. Ray is bored until he discovers a movie being filmed that includes a dwarf, Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), and a beautiful support staff woman named Chlo\u00eb (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy).As the movie unfolds, Ray becomes increasingly depressed about what he has done, and Harry determines that Ray must pay for his mistake. Some improbable things occur, but this is a comedy more than a drama. That means the viewer needn't demand reality from the script.\"In Bruges\" reminds me of a Coen brothers movie with its quirky storyline that drags you along despite your rolling eyes.

It seemed as if the film was searching for an identity that it never really found, was it a comedy, drama, gangster picture, or what? I was was never sure. The scenery is interesting and of course plays a role in the film. I did enjoy some of the comic dialogue and moments in the story, but in the end it did not make it a worthwhile trip to the theater. I would have been happier seeing it on cable and not spending $7.00. My suggestion, wait until you can see it on cable and save your money.",

Being a fool, i ended up judging the film by it's cover and deciding not to dedicate precious time to viewing it. A combination of incidents including the Christmas holidays and having nothing better to do, resulted in me giving the \"shithole\" of Bruges a try.What i found is quite hard to describe. Comedy? perhaps, i hope i'm not too rude to say that this film was too good to be categorized as a comedy. Drama? that might be it, but then again...no. Anyways, the film takes place in Bruges. \"Where the **** is Bruges? It's in Belgium.\" Two hit-man are sent there after completing a mission, and are being asked to wait for further instructions.Beautiful, Beautiful cinematography of Christmas time in a small town known mostly for it's well preserved medieval and Gothic character. A most captivating Original Soundtrack composed by Carter Burwell. Brilliant script writing, including a great, great dialogue as well as a impressive direction debut, both by Martin McDonagh. Adding to that a cast led by Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes along with magnificent smaller roles by more unpopular faces portraying a dwarf, a female lover, a Russian gun supplier, an historical tower manager and a local policeman. And there you have your Must-See!I'll end by referring to what turned this film from just being good to being great, to me at least, and this is the ending. In my eyes, the ending is a homage, or perhaps a pastiche to a painting of Hell and Judgment Day we are acquainted with in a museum along the film. This ending, these images, they will stay with you well after the credits are gone. It takes a little something for a film to make me watch it twice. 'In Bruges' has this little something...enjoy!",

            "content": "Bruges. It's in Belgium. And after a job gone wrong two Irish hit-men, Ken and Ray, are sent there to hide out. Their boss loves the place, calling it a fairytale town. Ken becomes a happy tourist, embracing the chance to explore the best-preserved Medieval city in Belgium. Ray is not happy. He wants out of Bruges from the moment he gets there. Touring a Medieval city is not his thing. And it also becomes very quickly obvious that Ray is tormented by something. The film is very smart in waiting to reveal exactly what it is that is weighing so heavily on Ray's mind. When all is revealed a new spin is put on things. The story, which to that point had seemed to be an odd couple comedy, takes an emotional turn. But the film never stops giving you plenty to laugh at. And when Ken and Ray's boss reveals exactly why he sent them to Bruges the film turns again, giving us some action, drama and real suspense. But still laughs too. Always laughs. The film has serious elements but at heart it's always a comedy. A very dark comedy. And a very good one.Much of the credit for the film's success has to go to the actors portraying Ken and Ray. Brendan Gleeson is perfect as Ken, the older and wiser of the pair. And Colin Farrell is excellent as young hothead Ray. Farrell is hilarious in Ray's biting exchanges with Ken about the merits, or lack thereof, of Bruges. But Farrell also nails the serious, emotional side of the character. Gleeson and Farrell really do make for the perfect screen pairing. It helps that they have a great script to work with, writer/director Martin McDonagh providing them with plenty of hilarious dialogue all along the way. The starring pair are also ably supported by some other performers. Ken and Ray's boss is not revealed until well into the picture and when he arrives things really kick up a notch. This guy is explosive and, in his own unique way, hilarious. There's a woman involved, she's about the only thing in Bruges which Ray finds appealing. Oh, there's also a cocaine-snorting racist dwarf with an affinity for hookers.In this film the city of Bruges itself is just as important a character as any of the people. What a lovely city, and director McDonagh shows it off beautifully. It may not be Ray's thing but chances are you'll want to visit the place after seeing the film. And you'll probably want to see the film another time or two as well. It's a dark comedy which gives you plenty of laughs but it has a great deal of heart as well. And some good action too. It's wonderfully scripted, performed perfectly by a great cast and it looks spectacular. Well done by all involved.",

Why beautiful, old, scenic Bruges, where nothing much happens, and when it does happen, it happens very slowly? Ah... Well there is a reason, which is crucial to the plot, and I am definitely not going to go into it here.It's hard to know how to describe \"In Bruges\". Maybe it would be best to describe it as an existential comedy? I don't know. All I will say is that, if Samuel Beckett or Harold Pinter had been commissioned to write an action movie/buddy-buddy comedy, they might have come up with something like \"In Bruges\". There are definite echoes of \"Waiting For Godot\" and \"The Dumb Waiter\" in the dialogue, the situations and the characters.Simply put, \"In Bruges\" is just a gloriously funny and so-black-light-bends-into-it comedy. A brilliant confection of poetry, cynicism, innocence and slapstick. Great turns from Brendan Gleeson as the older, philosophical hit man Ken and Ralph Fiennes as barking mad Essex dog Harry, possibly the most unstable British gangster seen on screen since Ben Kingsley in \"Sexy Beast\". Maybe surprisingly, for some, Colin Farrell shows what a fine performance he can produce when cast in right part. His young killer, Ray, is a mixture of willfulness, innocence, childishness and regret. You feel for him. Really you do.\"In Bruges\" will not be a box office smash. It is probably too lyrical and introspective for huge success, and also it has hardly been promoted, but I have no doubt that it will find it's audience as a cult movie on DVD and on late night Indie movie channel screenings.It's a great film.

The script can seem a little cheesy at first, but once it gets flowing it's very natural and very well written, and performed seamlessly.Colin is excellent, probably his best role I would say! The only slight negative is that 'Arry, Ralph Fiennes' character, is rather too similar to Don Logan, Ben Kingsley's character in Sexy Beast. However, this isn't a bad thing as both characters work well, it's just a shame I couldn't stop myself comparing them.My wife and I really enjoyed, it's very, very funny throughout, with moments of real subtle, dry comedy genius, plus moments of in your face humour.

            "content": "The first thing you realise about In Bruges is that it's a very good tourist advertisement for the city. It's almost too easy for the set designer; lavish old churches amongst medieval architecture, cobblestone streets, gorgeous canals, a dainty market square. Beneath the beautiful setting is a dark and twisted comedy that manages to say quite a lot. Irish playwright Martin McDonagh's dialogue is at times reminiscent of Pulp Fiction's, being snappy, cynical, often irrelevant. But it's very important in establishing the relationship between two hit men in Ray and Ken.Farrell gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as the younger of the pair. The opening narration tells us of his cardinal sin in murder, but it's much later that we find out that he also accidentally killed an innocent young boy in the process, and that it was his first contracted kill. Farrell manages to portray these without ever explicitly telling the audience. His performance is one of great range and character; on the surface he is bored, impatient, brutally dismissive, honest (that American did have a heart attack at the top of the tower), and cynical. But there's also moments of innocence and wonder and childhood that he exhibits which makes it more clear the gravity of his situation and sin. At heart Ray is not a bad man, simply one on the wrong path. Ken (Brendon Gleeson) is the only one who recognises this. There's not too much in common with the pair; snappy exchanges showcase the very apparent difference between the two's idea of a good holiday and just a waste of time. McDonagh manages to give a visually breathtaking and interesting tour of Bruges all while establishing the relationship and the plot. They discuss heaven, hell and purgatory at the art museum, a thin veil for the hit men's pondering of morality, and clash when Ray refuses to go up and see the view at the bell tower while Ken pays his 5 Euro. Each scene of the tightly knitted screenplay is crucial to the climax of the film, every last detail significant. There's a running motif between the criminals of the film in the pair and their boss, Harry. Ralph Fiennes plays a calm but unbalanced mob boss, unflinching in his duty but all the same possessing a moral compass like the other two. McDonagh expresses this with humorous dialogue which is driven purely by character. Both Harry and Ray are impulsively violent when need be but in sight of the pregnant Marie, their softer personalities come out. It's a clever and almost exasperating scene which wouldn't normally be in a film, as they time the start of their action sequence in unison. There is clearly a line that even these men won't cross. Ken reaches this with the realisation of Ray's impeding suicide, despite initially agreeing to kill him as a result of his debt to Harry. It's a wonderfully ironic twist which again is driven by wonderful acting and dialogue: \"I'm not allowed to and you are? How's that fair?\" All three characters possess an underlying complexity beyond just the simply criminal life of killing people. Ken doesn't even commit any murders in the entire film; in fact only killing himself in an attempt to save Ray. His life debt, trust and integrity to Harry is undone when he realises that the reasonably untainted Ray has the capacity to be something better. No more prominent an example of the code that they possess is Harry's suicide at the end which hammers down the main thematic virtue. The sort of innocence and purity that is symbolically represented in the boy and seen in glimpses of Ray must remain clean of bloodstain and ruin. Harry kills himself when realising what he's done; ironically the victim is the very opposite of the ideal, a drug addicted dwarf who hires prostitutes. The significant act is in Ray, who frantically tries to correct this act and spare Harry even as he is dying by his hand. Ray's characters progression is complex, foreshadowed and consequential. Even whining endlessly at the beginning at being stuck in Bruges for two weeks, he shows no real purpose, desire or destination. His ambitions are simple and sensual in nature: chasing after a beautiful women and stealing drugs. This aimless perspective is marred by the sincerity of the guilt at the back of his mind, showcased sparingly but in raw and genuine moments of emotional regret by Farrell, like when he breaks down at the playground. In the ambulance he finally decides on a goal: to find the mother of the boy and accept her punishment. It's the first time in the entire film we see resolve to live and it's the culmination of the hints of moral goodness that we know Ray is possible of. The ending is purposefully ambiguous on whether he does manage to reach that goal, much better than the one in the original screenplay which has him contemplating suicide once again only to hesitate when Chloe rings him. For Ray, the fairytale city of Bruges is a complete nightmare. It's a 2 week purgatory which constantly eats away at his conscience and reminds him of his guilt. One way or another, he must escape. In Bruges manages to deftly balance the light-hearted humorous side of the situation and of the characters with the subtext of self-hatred, anguish and cardinal sin. It's a thematically complex character study filled with stark juxtapositions of the poignant and the absurd. Most will find it as charming as the fairytale city that it is set in.",

In Bruges is a lot more sedentary. There's no Hollywood gloss in this film, and younger viewers may find it a little slow paced. But the script is funny, the cinematography is wonderful, and ALL the characters are interesting. I loved it when Yuri who thought that \"nooks and crannies\" was a more suitable English word than \"alcoves\". The performances were all as what you can expect from such fine actors as Ralph Fiennes, but I felt that Colin Farrell made the film with the main character Ray. Surely this is an Oscar winning performance and it heightens my belief that anything that Film-4 put their name to is a stamp of excellence.

The script by writer/director Martin McDonagh is very funny in a politically incorrect way. McDonagh also directs well, getting good performances from Brendan Gleeson, Ralph Fiennes and especially Colin Farrell. This is probably his best performance yet. The rest of the cast are all good too, with a special mention to Jordan Prentice, who plays Jimmy the dwarf in the movie. His character takes a bit of a kicking via comments in the script, but he holds his own with the other actors in the movie.As I stated the movie is very funny, but it's not a comedy. Instead, it's more of a character piece, with every character well thought out in the movie, and most get their own little moments. However when Harry (Fiennes) shows up, it sets up the dramatic climax with a burst of action, which again McDonagh handles well. The climax of the movie is a little downbeat, but yet seems right for the movie.The city of Bruges takes takes a bit of beating in the script, but it looks a wonderful city, and gives some scenes a dream-like quality.

The only way this movie is entertaining is if you don't care about the plot and like midget jokes, but even then, the movie keeps throwing on a more serious tone that contrasts pretty terribly with the whole premise of the film and the comedic sections.

            "content": "In Bruges stars Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Ralph Finnes and is directed by Martin McDonagh. The story revolves around two hit men who hide out in a little town in Belgium called Bruges. And one of them loves the town, while the other one hates and despises it. This movie connects with me as will everyone else. I can't tell you how many times I've been across the world and have been bored out of mind because this is the oldest church or the history of this piece of art. Some places around the world have interested me as well as the history, but after a while it becomes excruciating and boring. And that's what this movie does so well. In Bruges captures these two characters that we can relate to these two people. We've all been that one person who is fascinated by history and the other one who finds this place dull and mundane. Before Martin McDonagh directed Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and Seven Psychopaths this was his first movie he directed. And what he gives us is one of my favorite dark comedies since Pulp Fiction. It's so brilliantly written with subtle references to Martin's own version of what heaven and hell looks like, but for the rest of the movie it's far from subtle. He's not afraid to write what's on his mind unlike some script writers who are hesitant because they'll offend someone. Martin gives us his own version of a dark comedy and doesn't try to copy anything from Guy Ritchie or Quentin Tarantino. This movie does a brilliant job of balancing comedy and drama, but even during those drama moments the movie still finds humor. Each of the three main characters bring their own style of humor to the table as they come up with their own version of heaven and hell. Overall this is one of my favorite dark comedies that is definitely worth watching if you're a fan of dark humor.",

I tend to think of those kind of films which just\u0085appear. Out of nowhere, you hear about a movie. The promotional material looks rather impressive. The film looks like it belongs to a genre you're interested in. You allow yourself a glimpse of the basic plot (no more, lest the experience is spoilt) and it sounds like something that, in the right hands, could be inflated into a compelling piece of cinema. In Bruges is a tick in each of those boxes. As of writing, I'd definitely consider it one of the best films I've seen all year, if not the best outright.\"What makes you say that?\" you may ask. I guess the simple answer is this \u0096 everything. Yes, I know, very simple \u0096 but everything in this movie just falls right into place and the result is a finely polished caper flick. If I had to pinpoint the film's strongest individual part, I'd say it was the script. Writer-director McDonagh is also a renowned playwright, and the same quality translates to the film's story. In Bruges has a very play-like feel to it, largely due to its heavy reliance on character development. As the two leads, Gleeson and Farrell are nothing short of brilliant. They are capable of taking several different \"duo\" clich\u00e9s and twisting them into something that feels surprisingly fresh, and even when they're not paired together, they maintain strong presences on-screen. Gleeson is perfect as the amiable Ken, but Farrell truly shines as Ray, who balances cockiness with insecurity deftly. Even though I haven't seen much of Farrell's other work, I honestly think he turned in a potential career-best act here.The supporting cast is also treated very well. Even the smallest supporting characters are a source of great comedy or great drama, whatever may be needed. Whenever they reappear in the story, it never feels forced but fits in perfectly. Out of all of them, Jordan Prentice steals the show as an embittered American dwarf who's in Bruges to make an art-house film. The only real weakness I could find with the cast was Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy as drug-dealer/love interest Chl\u00f6e, who isn't necessarily bad, but isn't really given anything spectacular to work with.The film rolls along at a great pace. There is the very occasional scene that doesn't feel like it goes anywhere, but the rest of it manages to be great. The balance between comedy (largely as a result of Ray's none-too-pleasant altercations with locals and non-locals alike) and drama is excellent. The film has countless laugh-out-loud moments, yet it also has some genuinely shocking twists in it. It manages to remain compelling all throughout its running time. Another aspect I feel really gives the film a distinct feel is the location of Bruges itself. You've got to love those films where the location virtually becomes a character in the story, and Bruges (memorably described by Ralph Fiennes's Harry as a \"beautiful f***ing fairy tale town\") certainly comes into its own as such a \"character\". The locales are brilliant, none so much as the Bell Tower, which is easily the most memorable building featured in the film.To conclude, I loved In Bruges. Plain and simple. It's a hundred-odd minutes worth of entertainment, both comedic and tragic. What few flaws this film has are made up for by its many strengths. It may be a little strong in the violence/language department, but if that doesn't bother you, you should enjoy this, easily one of the best films I've watched in a while.",

            "content": "After loving The Banshees of Inisherin, I felt compelled to revisit In Bruges. Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are hitmen... in Bruges. They've come from their last hit in London and are waiting on a call from the boss. They're chalk and cheese. Ken is a culture vulture, embracing the city. I'm with Ken. Ray isn't, he's the essence of a miserable teenager. Pissing of Canadian tourists and sulking. It's a comedy, but there's tragedy at its core. Inevitable I guess when there's profit based murder going on. They're supposed to be lying low, but Ray is the excitable type. He's also got a lot on his mind. Things he regrets doing and now with time on his hands, he's chance to reflect... and he's struggling. Until he meets Chloe (Cl\u00e9mence Pos\u00e9y). She shares his dark humour, even after he nailed two annoying Canadian tourists on their first date. While Ray is out finally enjoying Bruges. Ken takes a call from their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes), which has to be one of the most wince inducing calls in cinema and that's before Harry delivers news of Ken's next hit. Bruges is a beautiful city and the camera makes the most of it. It's a lovely setting for what becomes an increasingly bonkers and difficult story. Ken finds himself in an unenviable position, but this is far from a simple story. It unfolds delightfully and despite having seen this before, it's no less enjoyable. I'm a bit indifferent about Farrell. He does well here... but not as well as Gleeson and Fiennes, who are both magnificent. Martin McDonagh's roll call is pretty damn impressive. I'm not sure I could pick a favourite. Three Billboards, Banshees, Psychopaths. In Bruges though, I think may still just take the top spot.",

The acting was excellent throughout, as well as the chemistry between Colin Farrell and Brendon Gleeson. The humour was wonderful and made me laugh out loud several times with pure glee, such as being blanked by an American dwarf and calling him a little c*nt.It was such a breath of fresh air and I would gladly give this film a 10, but reserve that score for those truly wonderful movies that stand the test of time. I pinched myself when I watched it for the first time, just wishing I could watch it afresh all over again, but sadly knowing the experience could never repeat. On second viewing I appreciated the film just as much, but a very small spark was missing, meaning that it isn't quite 10/10 material because, although wonderful, isn't quite brilliant and won't get better over the years.I was really entertained by this treat of a film that I enjoyed SO much.",

            "content": "This was Martin Mcdonagh's first full fledged movie as a director, but nowhere in the movie, you will find the \"novice\" touch. In Bruges is of the crime comedy/satire genre, which Tarantino, Guy Ritchie etc have excelled in. The story is about two British Hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) who after successfully completing a job in London are sent to Bruges, Belgium by their boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes) until the matter as well as the Hit men cool down. Bruges is a tourist destination of sorts for history lovers because it is a well preserved medieval town. But like many European towns, it is very dull and slow for a young fun loving person which Ray is. He hates the place and curses it to the core, wanting to leave it a.s.a.p. On the other hand, Ken loves the feel of the place and considers it a fairytale town and intends to live there until their boss calls. They meet some people there namely a dwarf/midget American actor, a local drug dealer girl etc who make their life in the place interesting. After a while, Ken gets to know from his boss the exact reason why they are in Bruges and the movie takes a different turn altogether. The plot is very engaging and the dialogues very witty and filled with satire. You never get bored during the course of the movie. The movie has many references to Americans, Canadians, Belgians, Englishmen, Vietnamese, Blacks and even Pakistanis with a tone of racism. But it is not 'On The Face' racist comments like in American History X. It is well capsuled in the garb of satire.I have watched very few Colin Farrell movies and this surely was his best performance. He has many shades to his character. He is fun loving, aggressive, sometimes even filled with guilt because of his 'small boy killing' mistake in his first assignment. Brendan Gleeson plays a matured role and his conversations with both Farrell and Fiennes are engrossing. Ralph Fiennes ruled the screen in his short but effective role. A special mention to the Bruges local drug dealer girl and Farrell's love interest in the movie. She had one of the best smiles I have seen. A great watch and I recommend it.Rating : 8/10",

            "review_title": "A Near Masterpiece",
            "content": "When I first viewed this film I had remembered the cover of the DVD which my brother owned, and I thought it would be a simple B-grade action film. I am so glad I was wrong because In Bruges is a true gem which delves into the motifs of guilt and hell/purgatory.With the two main characters we have opposite sides of the personality - this has been said by McDonagh himself. There was a side of him which loved to sight-see (Ken) and the side that just wanted to have fun (Ray). From this we get a very cultured hit man as well as a moody young man itching to get the most out of life (drinking, meeting women, exploring).While I love Ray for his internal struggles, he is somewhat of a hard man to like; he is brutally honest, asks people whether they would kill themselves because of certain traits, and he calls people gay or retarded. But something has happened before the start of the story that makes him question his morality in the middle of the film and whether or not he should be punished for it.This film seems somewhat influenced by Tarantino - at least for the dialogue aspect. It is not plot-based; it touches on pop culture references and includes lingo that make the characters seem more realistic or interesting than just characters. However, the problem is that it seems to try too hard at this.However, there are a good amount of funny conversations or situations in which the characters find themselves. Think Tarantino's dialogue meets an even darker humor, like the humor of the Coen brothers.One plausibility factor I cannot stand, however, is that one character simply refuses to die. To avoid spoilers, I will just say he/she lives way longer than they should have, but this needs to happen to help the plot very late in the film.The thing I love so much about this film is the ending monologue given by Ray (Colin Farrell's character), and the ambiguity behind what has happened to the character and whether this story should be considered a dark fantasy or a horrible reality. It is very enjoyable, and the themes are amazing, but this film falls just short of perfect.Added 5/18/15: Who am I kidding, I LOVE this movie and highly recommend it! 10/10",

A few more story twists later and I was engaged, and before I knew it the film had finished. There are quite a few problems with In Bruges but despite all of them I actually I did enjoy it. It's humor is often times dark (which a lot of folks don't get/like in general) some of the scenes are contrived, and there's quite a bit of killing for a film that is in large part a comedy. So if you're the type of person open to all of those elements in the same film, see it, if you're not one of those folks then stay away.",

Or if it was about gangsters hiding out in a continental city one would expect it to be Amsterdam. But no, it's Bruges. The plot may seem relatively simple but there are a lot of deeper meanings in the film in the imagery of Bosch paintings and references to religious relics. Bruges is a city well worth visiting which I have been to a couple of times before but for me the city will never be the same again after seeing this film. The film is an 18 certificate and one can see why. Kids who may want to see it because it features four moonlighters from the Harry Potter films should not be allowed to. There is a lot of swearing in it and the scenes where people get shot are quite grisly. There is also one scene which is not for people who suffer from vertigo.

Because that's how I felt after I saw it.Story about two Irish hit men (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell) who were sent to hide in Bruges by their boss (Ralph Fiennes) is dark comedy with brilliant screenplay. Dialogue is just fantastic, it's incredible how you can be pulled to screen watching dialogue about midget war or touristic attraction of Bruges. But don't be fooled - behind, on first sight, irrelevant conversations and witty dialogues lie existentialistic questions about life and death and everything between. Why theater? Well, through this brilliant dialogue (base of every good play), in Bruges as stage, develops relationship between four main characters - nihilist Ray (Collin Farrell), experienced Ken (Brendan Gleeson), energetic Harry (Ralph Fiennes) and Bruges itself. Besides this there are great supporting characters - hotel owner Marie (Thekla Reuten), midget Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), Ray's girlfriend Chloe (Clemence Poesi) and many others. Acting is excellent with actors fitting roles perfectly. Very nice surprise is Collin Farrell who has proved he can carry film as leading actor.With European touch of Martin McDonagh \"In Bruges\" became one of the best films I saw this year, if not the best. What needs to be mentioned again is outstanding script.So, was the play good? Brilliant.I even think Shakespeare would like it.",

Martin McDonagh's film is apparently a first for him, and on the strength of this work he should be schmoozed or lashed into making a lot more. This story of two hit men in the doghouse, holed up in Bruges for two weeks, is as dark a comedy as I've seen in some time, but it works on every level. This beautifully shot film is a wonderful advert for Bruges, Belgium's touristic jewel in the crown, and is accompanied by an excellent score. Brendan Gleason, Colin Farrell and Ralph Fiennes (in a very different kind of role from his usual) are all excellent. Gleason's character is a world-weary, almost fatherly figure, who gives the impression that he's ended up being a hit-man almost by accident. Farrell's character is by turns boorish and childish, yet charming and likable at the same time. The language is frequently crude, but fitting to the characters portrayed here. The story has an inevitability about it, and so there may not be too many surprises for the viewer, but it hardly seems to matter.

            "content": "About 2 years ago, i watched and commented on a belgian film, called Moscow, Belgium (Aanrijding in Moscou). It came to me out of the blue, at a film festival, and it pleased me so much in how different it was as a film experience. Somehow, it was a film detached from conventions, relatively away from the genre rules of that type of film, at least Hollywood rules. But it had the appeal of the audiences, and had it been spoken in English or Spanish, and it certainly might have had a different impact. Unpretentiousness was how i named my comment. No i watch this film, and it produces a similar effect. And it takes place in Belgium as well. And because this one is spoken in English, and has well known faces, it falls in the sweet spot that i thought Moscow might have fit in. I wonder if Belgium, as a place, has anything to do with that.Now this is quite a different film. It has a very tight strong writing, as controlled as the environment where the whole film takes place. It all takes place within that environment, and the first really interesting thing is how, with one (important) exception, all the important plot points that happen along the story are mapped into the places of the city that we'd been introduced early, when the hit men were simply sightseeing. The tower, the hotel, the film set. We get to the city with the characters, and we see it through their eyes. The fundamental plot point that is told to us through flashbacks is what allows for the story to derive into the other world of the noir genre where the film ends. The killing of the child is what we learn. What that fact does is to trigger all the events that make the characters meet what they are supposed to meet. So, the great thing here is how the film derives from genre to genre. From the laws of comedy (f***ing Brugges) to the point of hard men hunt. The dramatic shift is subtle and really rare to watch, and it magnifies the power of the ending.The crucial element that allows this is, of course, the film within, the film being shot in Brugges. It intersects the narrative several times throughout the film, and we even have actors from that film (the midget) interacting with our main actors. The midget aspect is very talked about. We pass through the set, Farrell even meets the girl on it, and we are told the film has something to do with Bosch. And of course, at the end, the larger film, the one we're watching moves literally to the set of the inner film, at the time when we no longer live in the comedy world, and the two remaining characters meet their fate in a totally different dramatic world, on the set of the inner film, taking the midget with them.This is remarkable writing which, nevertheless, is only allowed by a solid direction which allows the actors to freely express, under a controlled environment.My opinion: 4/5",

It contains hilarious comedy, dark, emotional moments and graphic violence, yet none ever feels out of place. All these elements are balanced with skill.The hitmen portryed by Colin Farrel and Brendan Gleason are developed subtly as the story progresses. Ralph Fiennes also delivers a fiercely profane, hilariously entertaining performance as their uncompromising boss. The setting of 'Bruges' is used by McDonagh with precision, introducing its aspects subtly throughout the script with later payoffs, such as the tower and canal. By the time the climactic action takes place, we already know the town of 'Bruges' and its basic geography as well as the characters.Similarly to McDonagh's other films, he does not shy away from extremities in the script. Characters say things which you would not usually hear in a film, making them feel more realistic, and also hilarious, although definitely not to everyone.

            "content": "Black comedy is a difficult thing to do. Very often a balance between hilarity and depth cannot be struck to the point that the amount of comedy is negligible. \"In Bruges\", a story of murder, guilt, suicide and violent gun hands, faces this problem more than most. It is, therefore, a delight that this film is one of the funniest for years as well as being wonderfully dark, twisted and deep.The first thing to say is that this won't be for everyone. It is uncompromisingly violent, it, quite literally, doesn't pull any punches and it is filled to the brim with foul language. But, if you're not put off by any of this sort of thing, then this is highly recommended.It is vaguely reminiscent of \"Withnail and I\". It has three main characters who are all leading a fairly insane existence and who all find themselves in a place that they are alien to. It is also one of the most fantastically sweary films since \"Withnail\" but this is no rip-off. This is one of the most fearlessly fresh films for some years and this is largely thanks to Martin McDonagh.The script is magnificent. It may not provide much pay-off for its philosophising and it does at the end descend into a bloody shootout that is slightly over-cooked, but it is interesting in what it explores and extremely entertaining. It is the bizarre and brilliant humour that is the cornerstone of McDonagh's work. This is a comedy that pulls together witty, surrealist, observational, gross out and subtle, as well as distinctly unsubtle, visual comic techniques, with a heavy dose of character based gags to boot. The result is an onslaught of humour that is irresistible. McDonagh also brings an attractive and striking look to the film with an impressive visual style that promises much for his future work not just as a writer but also as a director.He is also blessed with a fine cast. Brendan Gleeson's quiet, restrained and likable performance is the standout, but a wonderful surprise is that the oft-ridiculed Colin Farrell almost steals the show with a brilliantly subtle and vulnerable turn. The pair work superbly whenever they're on screen together and they are handed a great deal of support. Po\u00e9sy, as the love interest, is very good, as is Jordan Prentice playing the sardonic but flawed \"dwarf\" (to use the film's terminology). Ralph Fiennes obviously enjoys himself hugely here, given free-reign in a part that demands over-acting of the very highest calibre to display the insanity and menace of the character.The film ends in a marvellous moment of ambiguity having touched on many themes. Prejudice, life and death, guilt, forgiveness, justice, deontological ethics and the sanctity of life, are all there and McDonagh leaves it up to the audience to think about them. It all adds up to a great time at the cinema. Funny, thoughtful, entertaining, this blackest of black comedies is the genre nearing its very best.",

            "content": "Well, this film had some great actors and a wonderful setting. It also pointed towards some redemption. But alas, the director/producer/script writer decided to appease the American type audience by 1. using some extremely graphic and violent shots of people being murdered, again and again; 2. attempting to make murder and murderous types humorous; 3. and the list goes on. Its a bit of a combination of \"The Third Man\" with \"Pulp Fiction\", but without the cynicism of the former or the dance sequence of the latter. In other words, it had no redeeming qualities. Since there's only about three murders in Europe in a year, the chances of this happening are slim to ill. I know it is cool to have hit men be intelligent and sympathetic, but in real life such thugs are slimy psychopaths with the moral interests of a snail. The film also threw in a midget, and killed him off too just to make one last point, which was that the whole film was a contrived piece of garbage. It could have been good if they had eliminated Bruges, murder, hit men, etc., but hen, that would have forced the film makers to provide some depth, realism, and humanity. They should all be lined up themselves in retaliation for brutalizing the audience with this.",

            "content": "Where to start with this film? In Bruges is a strange little film, combining, as it does, comedy and violence. There is much to like about this film, but a lot more dislike. Colin Farrell is excellent as the guilt ridden hit-man Ray. Much of the dialogue with his partner Ken, played by Brendan Gleeson, is smart and funny and the premise of two hit men stranded in random place has potential. I particularly liked the economy of Ray's opening voice-over that sets the scene for the film. On reflection the things I like about this film are the things that the writer / director Martin McDonagh may have brought from his theatrical background. What I disliked about this film (SPOILER COMING) is what McDonagh does with the film's story that grows ever more preposterous and unbelievable as the movie goes on. What really starts to grate is the reliance on coincidence to drive the narrative and how the director simply brings characters together without explanation. A case in point would be Chloey's psycho boyfriend being present in a scene where Yuri, the (Russian?) gun dealer sells Harry a gun. What is the boyfriend doing here? And low and behold as the movie drifts towards its climax he appears again, quite randomly, to assist Harry in tracking down Ken with the line that goes something like, \"he went that a way!\" It is desperate stuff and totally unbelievable. And there are many more moments like this. Towards the end they meet Jimmy the dwarf walking to work on a film set already in costume. Jimmy is playing a school boy and so him being in costume allows another totally absurd plot twist to develop. As a film maker McDonagh should know that actors don't walk to work and they certainly don't turn up already in costume. And finally McDonagh's use of cinematic violence is particularly infuriating and rather than recommend Tarantino to McDonagh, to show how it should be done, I would tell him to see Funny Games instead. The violence that McDonagh uses to get a laugh and tell the story is movie violence. It is violence without consequence and pain, the sort that Hollywood has been peddling since day one. But then again perhaps I should have seen it coming....a movie about hit men? Thats bound to lead to gun dealer called Yuri living in a big eccentric house and a beautiful drug dealer /stick up artist living in a gorgeous apartment. Where people pick up and point guns without checking to see if they are loaded - or where you can buy a gun without actually handing over the money. This is the world of movie violence where a woman being punched in the face raises a laugh and where a hit mans first job is to kill a priest. It is totally stupid and, more unforgivably, quite boring. Mr McDonagh, Hollywood awaits.",

On the comic side, there are maybe a few clever bits but most of it is stuff from the same old bag of gags, with a few homophobic lines thrown in for good measure. It fares slightly better with the drama, although Farrell (who I can't stand looking at... those freak eyebrows and tiny mouth... it's amazing I like THE NEW WORLD as much as I do) doesn't really go through a transformation so much as he keeps shifting back and forth between dickhead and swell guy. We're asked to accept Gleeson as the sage, soulful elder hit-man but even though I liked his performance, the character feels manufactured. Also the ending is possibly the lamest example of dramatic irony I've ever seen. You could almost hear McDonagh quietly and smugly chuckling to himself as he thought of it. The cinematography and score are pretty good, and I really did enjoy Gleeson, but otherwise I didn't dig this very much.",

The trailer for the film is misleading, as it makes it look like one of those fun sassy Guy Ritchie style movies about a couple of quirky hit men hiding out well\u0085 In Bruges. The dialogue is Tarantino-esquire sharp and very funny. But the trailer gives no hints whatsoever to the darkness of the material lurking in \"the alcoves\" of this film. The violence is intense, and disturbing\u0085 both thematically and visually. This is NOT a light comedy for kids. I would hesitate about letting teenagers see it as well. I know a lot of people have been desensitized to violence, and I have too to a large degree. Tarantino does violence like a kid playing with plastic army toys in the backyard. You know he's just splashing fake blood all over everything so you never really invest all that much weight to it. But the violence in In Bruges is realistic and visceral in a way that seems much too dark, intense and serious for the comedy it introduces itself as. The characters take the violence and associated guilt and consequences seriously as well. I can't tell if the director intended for the drama to be as serious as the comedy is funny\u0085 or if the actors he brought together on screen are simply way too talented and played it too straight. Then again, the darkness of the demon is much too serious to play it any other way.Farrell plays the guilt-ridden Ray to Macbeth perfection, craving distraction in the form of drink, drugs and women to avoid facing his freshly minted demons, and twitching with discomfort at his exile in the calm, sleepy bucolic Bruges, a place tailor made for quiet reflection. He is literally squirming with frustration, boredom and remorse like a 10 year old kid in church. His rapport with Brendon Gleeson is delightful, easy and funny, a patient older brother/younger brother dynamic. Gleeson's Ken finds an inspired serenity to the city, and his reflection on Ray's plight brings forth a strong conviction of compassion for the younger man. The dichotomy that plays between their characters as Bruges presents itself as one man's heaven and another man's hell is genuine and interesting. As a comedy the film is sassy and delightfully fun. As a drama, the film is dark and unexpectedly movingly dramatic. But combining both of these tones into one film left me feeling a bit confused as to how to feel. What Ray did was bad. Real bad. It was hard to abandon myself to the sassy silliness of the comedy, given the darkness of the dirty deeds. I felt guilty laughing at the jokes, and regardless of how charming Farrell is, I still felt conflicted about sympathizing with Ray. Movie goers with a thicker skin will enjoy it tremendously. I find myself wondering why the guys who can make this truly hip, fresh, funny stuff can't leave out all the blood and demons for once and just let me kick back and enjoy.",

            "content": "As usual, a great script is the basis for this great film. The story turns on a series of highly improbable circumstances (which I won't mention to not spoil the enjoyment), but the script has managed to flesh out the characters sufficiently well that we even come to expect them, or at least regard them as normal in context. The camera work is excellent, with long, static shots of the cityscape, and with zooms reserved mostly for people shots, so we unconsciously accept how Bruges and its Medieval architecture becomes a powerful player in the story, and the protagonists' life and death decisions and actions (this is a crime and morality play, so I can safely reveal that there is a certain level of violence) seem almost arbitrary and meaningless compared to the permanence and therefore emotional force of the constructed landscape against which the action takes place. In fact, the script acknowledges this several times, since the protagonists in several crucial moments actually stop shooting each other to allow themselves to change locales that they think are more appropriate (the tower on the main square is the most importance example, though at least one scene involves Bruges' famous canals). Other normally important actions \u2013 there's a great scene with one criminal, a dwarf and two prostitutes in a nondescript hotel room \u2013 are interrupted or are inconclusive. It's as if meaningful action can only take place against the backdrop of the city's public places. David Lean's films, especially Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, also tended to transform the environment from simple backdrop into an active protagonist. In Bruges does it in a much more subtle yet strangely effective manner, which is perhaps as it should be since the life and death situations in which the protagonists find themselves are all the result of venal, morally disgusting and illegal activities. The city, unbeknown to them, works its magic (despite that Ray one of the killers on the lam describes it as a \"shithole\") and brings each of them to their just desserts, hell or redemption, or perhaps both. All in all, an extremely well-crafted film that makes believable the improbable and underscores the futility of individual human action (cities are the symbol of the entire community par excellence). I haven't mentioned the actors, but Colin Farell's excesses for once are used to good effect, and Ralph Fiennes and Brendan Gleason are excellent as usual, and the excellent and underplayed script allows the secondary actors to shine as well. All in all, a great little movie. Life and Death in L.A. makes sense, in America, but here, life and death have strangely little effect or impact, since the location makes it such that life or death are almost predestined and thus meaningless as individual destinies.",

Very much out of place amidst the Gothic architecture, canals, and cobbled streets, the two hit men fill their days living the lives of tourists. Ray, still haunted by the bloodshed in London, hates the place, while Ken, even as he keeps a fatherly eye on Ray's often profanely funny exploits, finds his mind and soul being expanded by the beauty and serenity of the city. But, the longer they stay waiting for Harry's call, the more surreal their experience becomes, as they find themselves in weird encounters with locals, tourists, violent medieval art, a dwarf American actor shooting a European art film, Dutch prostitutes, and a potential romance for Ray in the form of Chlo\u00eb, who may have some dark secrets of her own.

As this is an European movie we knew something would happen and it wouldn't have a happy ending where you get saluted in the end, but this makes the movie all the more real.It has brilliant humor and i hope the Americans can take it, (seen a few on here who cant tho) as its not how Europeans see them, its just the huge generalization that goes on about Americans as there are generalizations about ppl from any country. Its not much to cry about i feel. Every time i see something being said about Sweden or Swedish ppl in movies good or bad i just think its rather funny. The profanity and blood, yes its some of that, but if you cant take that you should stick to watching Lindsay Lohan or Matthew Mccouaughey movies.Many has made Tarrantino parallels to this movie and to be honest it didn't strike me at all when i watched the movie,sure Tarrantino has made good dialouges in certain movies but these days he seems to squeeze in so much talking that its just chit chat. You can easily go to the bathroom when nature calls or get snacks during his dialouges without missing anything and in this movie you simply cant.Loved this one from the start to the end. At times it was super funny, espc that time in the park when Gleason was gonna finish of Farrell at the same time it was intriguing and full of excitement.I truly hope this movie gets its recognition, cause it deserves that.

Angeles.i did not come here to kill 20 black 10-year-olds in a fu... drive-by.i want a normal gun for a normal person\" as about how normal his character is remains open for interpretation))).from the very first scene i noticed that the soundtrack contributes greatly towards an excellent mood defining aspect. while somehow too \"standard\" for its score choices in this feature's genre, it is very efficient in creating an intense \"calm\" mood in general, required for rational thinking, based and in accordance with what the visual shows to the viewer.",

            "content": "The Good: Farrell and Gleeson have excellent chemistry, which is a good thing, since a lot of the movie hinges upon their characters. In Bruges is about two hitmen, and it's got plenty of violence and gore, but mostly at the end. This is a relatively slow, contemplative, but still entertaining (even if it takes a while to get going).A lot of this has to do with the dialog, which - like many a late 2000s Tarantino inspired crime film - is quirky and funny. Similar to Tarantino, there's a colourful cast of characters from pregnant hotel owner Marie, to cantankerous American dwarf Jimmy, there's quite a few fun and interesting characters that give Bruges a lot of personality. Speaking of which, as much as Bruges is made fun of in this movie, the city is absolutely gorgeous and honestly, I think this movie works as an inadvertent travel advertisement.The final 30 minutes of this film are really, really good. Ralph Fiennes kind of steals the show and he's such an interesting and compelling antagonist that he injects life into the plot just when you thought it was spinning its wheels. As frustrating as the film can be at times, I think by the end, it all comes together.The Bad: This movie suffers from a chronic issue that many 2000s films did and that's \"chronic edginess.\" This movie LOVES to be sardonic, edgy, and a bit over the top with its dialog and I can totally see this being off putting for a lot of people. Sort of like Bullet Train, the movie is obsessed with being cool and quirky, and while it works for the most part, there are moments where I rolled my eyes.This is especially true anytime McDonagh has \"race\" as the centre of the joke. He's weird with race. Let's be honest. He doesn't know how to approach the topic tactfully, yet insists on doing it in almost every film he's made. It comes off as unfunny and frankly, a little bit uncomfortable.As I said before, I also feel like the film slows down a bit towards the middle and I wish it was a bit shorter.The Ugly: In Bruges is a surprisingly good time capsule movie; it has that good ol' fashioned War on Terror inspired anti-Americanism, lots of offensive jokes that probably wouldn't fly today, and the quirk factor turned up to 11.

The characters are driven, surrounded by the dream city of Bruges, through psychological conflicts both funny and desperate.However, IN BRUGES is an excellent example of how an original and brilliant narrative can be undermined by over-performance of an actor.Absolutely flawless interpretation of Ralph Fiennes in the role of Harry. Fiennes is a rare actor with stunning versatility, able to transform in both aberrant Amon Goeth (Schindler's List) as the innocent Justin Quayle (The Constant Gardener). Harry is no exception: Fiennes embodies with incredible easiness the surgical brutality of the character, capturing his private moral principles with naturally. This adds a fundamental coherence to the outcome of the film (anagnorisis +peripeteia), without which, no doubt, all the work would collapse.The exact opposite can be said about Colin Farrell performance. A desperate attempt to add a childish innocence to the character overrides his likelihood. In other words, an exaggerated performance, inconsistent with the sobriety of Fiennes and Brendan Gleeson (probably a view shared solely by this writing, considering the Golden Globes received by that performance).I believe that the work of Farrell, data venia, weighed in the assessment, belittling, by contrast, an excellent narrative.",

            "content": "Beautiful scenes of Bruges & an above average performance by Farrell can not save this clunker. For starters every line in this movie sounds like it was written for maximum irony or humor. There isn't a single line that sounds like something someone in such a scenario would actually say. Secondly, every plot development is predictable & completely implausible. If it's true that Bruges has no police & that no one in Bruges ever calls the police when crimes are committed, it would seem to be reasonable to conclude that Bruges would be the hub of criminal activity in Europe. But it's not, & people's behavior in this movie is just completely implausible, from beginning to end. The director so obviously drags out the final scene, with what is probably supposed to increase tension for the viewer, but it's really just tiresome. How many times does he have to shoot the Farrel character & not do it? How many times does the Farrel character have to get away but just stand there to what for him to catch up? It has all the subtlety of a film student's final project. Finally, Ralph Fiennes can't act & he's particularly atrocious in this thing. I'm surprised by all the praise heaped on this, rather derivative \"hip\" gangster flick, but then again the quality here on IMDb really has taken a nosedive over the past decade. If flashy, hip gangsta films are your thing then maybe you'll enjoy this, but if you really want to laugh \"lock stock & 2 smoking barrels\" has many more laughs & feels more natural than this thing (in spite of its more implausible scenarios).",

It's an old Medieval tourist town that is seemingly unimpressive to the common person at first glance.Bruges serves as a sort of purgatory for the two protagonists of the film. They are informed to 'lay low' in Bruges and to wait for a call from their employer. The two main characters spend their time exploring the town to pass time. They don't anticipate the danger is right around the corner, their employer being extremely disappointed in their last job.This small town in the middle of nowhere turns into a battlefield, some gladiators battling for honor - some for survival.Lots of laughs, but don't let the comedic aspect overshadow the dark and real subject matter that looms over the two characters.

Yes, there is violence and yes, the film is not for the over sensititive - but anyone who knows McDonagh from work such as The Lieutenant of Inishmore would know what to expect.

The cinematography is fantastic, widely superior than your conventional comedy film. The shots from Bruges are just incredible and breath taking. Stunning as well is the music, composed by Carter Buwell. Fine tracks which fits well into the film's atmosphere.The plot is also very peculiar. It has some dramatic and silly moments, and i must say that it don't has a perfect balance between the extremes, and it suddenly may go from suicide sequences to a discussion about a war between black dwarfs and white dwarfs. It's crazy. This probably was the intention of the author, mixing Greek tragedy with the extremely silly and comic situations. It's weird, and it worked. Absolutely worked.And as said previously, In Bruges is a very smart film. The plot has a very deep content and explores in a fine way, subjects as the religiosity and will to live. Will to live in fact, is what moves this film. It's possible to see the irony in the events this film presents, such as the fact that when Farrel's character wants to die, he is completely safe, but when he finally is dying, he starts to will his life. This irony in fact, is what makes this film so great in my opinion. Forget all the idiocy of the characters, the tragedy aspects and the fact that it is a well made film technically. This film is great because of the irony. The irony of the life. Fantastic. And of course, Colin did pretty well his here In Bruges, and deservedly won the golden globe for his effort. The entire cast did well, including the racist dwarf.A must watch film, 9.5/10",

            "content": "In my opinion, Martin McDonagh's directorial debut can easily be classified as a resounding success. From the opening sequence, straight to the (almost too far-fetched) ending, IN BRUGES is full of energy and intrigue. The screenplay is quite brilliant, especially for the first 80-85 minutes or so, mixing elements of comedy, drama, and thriller in a quite enjoyable Motion Picture. The last 10-15 minutes, however, arguably seem rushed, as if McDonagh had almost felt as if he had written himself into the proverbial corner. Some of the events that occur here seem a bit too improbable (at least two such events come to mind) and out-of-touch with the deliberate pacing of the rest of the film. Nonetheless, the Academy saw it fit to nominate his work for Best Original Screenplay, and I personally applaud the nomination, despite the aforementioned flaws.I have always been a fan of Colin Farrell for his performances of unorthodox roles/characters, and this has to be one of his best portrayals in years. Brendan Gleeson is also fantastic as his more level-headed companion, and the synergy between the lead characters is quite awesome. Ralph Fiennes reprises another villainous role, and does so quite superbly. In all, the casting was excellent, as the characters manage to enhance the already brilliant screenplay. Moreover, the cinematography and score are very good, with the scenic shots of Bruges enhancing the overall atmosphere of the film.IN BRUGES is full of memorable scenes and lines, undoubtedly accentuated by the Irish tongues of Farrell and Gleeson. Worthy of multiple viewings. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 200 at 183. Highly recommended.",

Another reason I have seen this movie is because it was run in an independent theater where I often go and see non English movies and I do so partly because my origins are in Europe but also because I have great difficulty to hear and foreign movies are usually subtitled. Now we're getting there, this movie is entirely in English but what English! Irish sputtered a the speed of a machine gun! So I really missed many gems from a clever dialog that got much response from the audience. The language was very strong and this certainly did not impressed my wife. Of course the language I'm referring too is the one that even deaf people will hear! I know this language is a real part of a certain world, so if you don't approve or belong to this world you may have some difficulty in enjoying this movie. Despite these difficulties I have thoroughly enjoyed In Bruges. The beginning, I imagine, intended slowness creates a contrast for fast action.following The comic events are just delightful, but behind all this there is a strong display of contrasting characters. If I was to complain about hearing difficulties , I probably would feel like a blind person complaining about image quality, however I hope in the future those with such impairment will have text facility to enjoy full dialog. With such big screens one would think there would be enough room below for a black strip to include white text.

            "content": "I think what impressed me most about this movie is something the actors all say in the one bonus feature of the DVD: it captures and expresses the humanity of the characters no matter what they may be or do. Somehow even in the worst of behavior they are still very real, very human, very complex, flawed and noble simultaneously. I really like this film. I liked the premise: two shady guys from the 20th Century on the lam in a perfectly preserved Medieval city whose sureness of architectural line and composition stands in stark contrast to their uncertainty and fear and collective guilt. The stately orderly beauty of the buildings which sit on the cobble stone streets or border the canal with its swans which wends its way through the heart of the city of Bruges and passes under its many small arched bridges create a sense of composure and timelessness. A sense of time frozen as in a Master painting . . . The setting of Bruges as calm backdrop to these frenzied visitors is quite purposeful for the writer/director to allow the mood of incongruity to add to the dark humor. One doesn't really see the trappings of modernity at all. Cars and trucks are almost nonexistent, and even though the boats have motors you don't hear them. It could well be the 14th Century. What we hear instead is the noise of the invading people whose orderliness is fairly nonexistent. The background is still, the people in motion, an emphasis of the tension within the characters. I believe that nothing here is brand new but cleverly adapted by Martin McDonagh from certain works. While not a cut and paste of other offerings, it borrows heavily from works that are cited either directly or indirectly and most notably the 1970 British film \"Performance,\" which featured a criminal on the lam hiding in a very strange old mansion inhabited by people living a lifestyle very different than the one he knew. Part of the allure of that film was that strange juxtaposition of personae who seemed from other worlds. The other work that \"In Bruges\" borrows from is Roeg's classic \"Don't Look Now\" which featured a child/dwarf and the canaled streets and empty facades of the ancient buildings of Venice. Where that movie had a creepiness, this one transposes humor and a dark lightness. Where Roeg used the ambiance of Venice to create an insecurity for characters and audience, the lovely tranquility of Bruges serves to calm the viewer, even though the on screen characters are running at emotional redline. It is also worth noting that the citizens of Bruges are portrayed mostly as in neutral, non-involved. Even when things get out of hand, they maintain a calm very much at odds with the adrenalized British/Irish protagonists. It is most clever how McDonagh takes us into a movie within a movie while paying homage to the fantasied works of Heironymus Bosch. He suggests that there may a quantity of insanity in the film industry with its fictional depiction of reality, and that no one is immune from being part of that distorted sanity who is participating in any way with cinema, whether as makers, actors, or spectators. His replication through costuming of Bosch figures into the film within film also suggests that every work of art only issues from the mind of a creator, fiction given form.What is well done is McDonagh's use of language. His script sparkles and breathes strongly. None of the lines delivered by any of the characters fail to delight. He pokes fun at language through his characters' use of certain words and phrases, such as \"alcove\" to mean \"nooks and crannies.\" A great deal of the likability of this movie for me comes from the script, and I might say that I acted pre-emptively and put on the captioning when I realized that the characters were speaking British English which is far different than American English. It helped to see, and hear what they were saying the better to not miss the nuances of a well done script.Cast is very good. Most impressive was Brendan Gleeson, who has a truly wonderful camera presence here. Fiennes is very very good as gang leader Harry Water, (another nod to Roeg's criminal boss in \"Performance,\" Harry Flowers), while Farrell does an admirable job all the way through. Farrell obviously enjoyed himself on this one. There were a couple of times when his facial contortions went places I don't think Farrell knew where they were. Great fun.Rest of cast did what they had to do, and did it well. Lighting, mood, sound were all supportive and well placed. Overall, a very nice dark comedy, and one well worth recommending to others. Given the beauty of the background scenery, I wish I had seen this in a theater, not on DVD at home. Still beautiful on the small screen. A bit bloody though, not for the squeamish or young children. Grade 9 stars.",

In Bruges has to be one of the funniest films of the last years. I didn't laugh until I cried but I did laugh constantly which means the film is very consistent and never looses direction. I've seen some discussion in regards to the humor being either typically British or Irish but honestly, I couldn't care less, it works and that's what matters. Colin Farell plays the role of the young hit-man Ray while Brendan Gleeson is the optimistic and mature Ken. This comedic duo seems an odd match but it works marvelously. Colin Farrel is exceptional as Ray, showing a different side as an actor, he reaches comic heights that I never thought it could. Gleeson was satisfying but definitely out-shined by Farell. And there's Ralph Fiennes who plays the creepy but hilarious Harry, an English thug. The screenplay is full of irony and wit and the beautiful city of Bruges(Belgium) serves as a background for all the crazy action. In Bruges is definitely worth seeing.7.5/10",

Martin McDonagh's whip-sharp hit-man comedy is one of the most rewarding films I've ever invested time in. The film unites Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes - three of the most talented and under-appreciated actors the UK has working today - and produces amazing work from all three. In Bruges does a fantastic job balancing the drama with the comedic, remembering to be sombre but never forgetting to lighten the mood. The jokes are sharp and blunt, delivered flawlessly by the trio of lead men (and also by the lovely Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy, an underrated treat in herself). PC police will find plenty to complain about here, but as Brendan Gleeson would tell them....well he says it better.Gleeson and Farell share chemistry and barbed wordplay with the skill that Pulp Fiction wowed us with back in 1994. I was invested in these characters and in their story, and most importantly, I laughed long and hard throughout the entire movie. An underrated gem, and what a pleasure it was to discover.",

            "content": "In Bruges balances black comedy on a razor wire. It's the kind of movie that makes you sit up and take notice. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are hit men hiding out in Bruges (it's in Belgium) while awaiting on further instruction. Gleeson, the more experienced hit man, wants to take in the sights. Farrell, the novice hit man, just wants to get drunk. Gleeson is at home in Bruges while Farrell is bored out of his wits. Luckily, they stumble upon a movie set that is shooting and meet some eccentrics. They meet the sets drug dealer and a dwarf (Jordan Prentice, who's wonderful) being used for a fantasy sequence. That distraction takes Farrell's mind of his torment. You see he just completed his first job as a hit man and botched it. He made the hit but a child got killed in the process. This is just eating Farrell up inside. In the meantime, the boss calls and Gleeson gets the call, he has to kill Farrell. The boss makes it clear that its unacceptable that a child got killed accidental or not. In a very funny, tense scene, Gleeson is sneaking up on Farrell sitting on a park bench getting ready to kill him only as he gets closer find out Farrell is about to kill himself. So Gleeson stops him from offing himself and sends him on a train so that he wouldn't be found. Gleeson calls the boss tells him that he wasn't going to do it and that he just sent him on a train to god knows where. The boss (played by Ralph Fiennes, who does much with his little screen time) decides to take things in his own hands and go to Bruges himself. All of this builds to a suspenseful and frantic conclusion . You just might find In Bruges well worth a return visit.",

This departure from those roles had me grinning from ear to ear as I watched.Colin Farrell, though, was truly magnificent. He played his role to the hilt. His childish affectations and facial expressions were such a treat.

One would think that only those with their noses out of joint would bother writing negative comments, but to have the overwhelming reaction positive shows how engaging this film is. To have Colin Farrell as the star would normally stop me from sitting in front of the telly to watch him for 90 minutes but he provides a sympathetic, nuanced performance without going over the top which would have been understandable given the storyline. Gleeson is given ample screen time to show why he's one of Ireland's great thespians. I was first introduced to him in the film 'I Went Down;' although I can't for the life of me remember that film apart from the nonsensical reason given for the title, I do remember Gleeson's performance as a revelation that single-handedly raised an otherwise non-descript film. And Fiennes once again shows no matter the genre, he'll step up and nail it. His accent is spot-on; I thought for a minute they'd hired Michael Caine to phone in a cameo when I first heard his voice. The plot itself is nothing to get worked up over, and the various turns used to stretch out the film are a bit laboured but, with the sublime humour and great dialogue, it doesn't matter. And what a setting! My main issue was the ending where it rather fell apart for me in terms of believability, but it is truly minor compared to everything that makes up this movie.

            "content": "\"A great day this has turned out to be. I'm suicidal, me mate tries to kill me, me gun gets nicked and we're still in f-ing Bruges!!!!\"Colin Farrell plays Ray, a young Irish hit man who botched his first job and ended up shooting an innocent young boy. He and his partner, the older, more seasoned Ken (Brendan Gleeson), are packed out of London by their overbearing crime boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes, almost unrecognizable with cockney accent and perpetual sneer) to the quiet Belgian tourist town of Bruges. They are to stay in Bruges until they receive further orders from Harry. They are urged to enjoy their time in the city, which Harry remembers from his childhood as being \"like a f-ing fairy tale or something.\"This hilarious, moody, very violent film by writer-director Martin McDonagh is incredibly difficult to characterize. Is it a comedy? An action/heist flick? A downer drama? Hard to say. Whatever it is, it blends elements of all these genres brilliantly, features excellent comic performances by the three leads, and even while you're cracking up, you may find yourself pondering larger questions of death, morality, and purpose-why we are where we are, both physically and spiritually.This is a unique, and uniquely enjoyable film that, with humor, examines the conscience and the part it plays in our lives, our deaths, and, perhaps most poignantly, whatever comes in between. A word of warning: you must have a fairly high toleration for disturbing violence and extremely thick Irish accents.",

            "content": "Having bagged the Oscar for best short film four years back with his dark humoured thriller Six Shooter, London born director Martin McDonagh steps up to the big screen with this: In Bruges; an incisive and bloody fierce laugh-out-loud revamp of his 27 minute short debut. Starring an inform Collin Farrell, In Bruges is set...well...in Bruges: a tucked-away Belgian town that's both easy-on-the-eye and peaceful. Until now. Hired Irish hit men Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) have been sent to the small medieval town following a botched job where they're to keep their heads low and wait for word from Harry (Ralph Fiennes). But why Belgium? And why the hell Bruges?While waiting for Harry's instructions, Ray and Ken encounter more than their fair share of problems and misfits, prostitutes and elephants, Canadians, thieves, gunmen, xenophobes and racist midgets. Their overseas waiting game soon becomes one laden with toe-curling hilarity yet mystery, anguish and philosophy as the two hired guns share a few home truths regarding the nature of their so-called profession, the blood of Christ, the beauty of Bruge, lollipop men who know kung-fu and the unfolding events of recent times that have led them to this shat- hole.When Ray's not p*ssed, he's p*ssed off. With every one and everything. He's a bearded, doughy, chauvinistic paddy who rarely passes up a chance to make a harsh yet hilarious example of society's minorities while keeping his middle finger held high and firm in the face of political correctness. \"I believe that the balance shall tip in the favour of culture, like a big fat fcuking retarded fcuking a black girl on a see- saw with a midget on the other fcuking end.\"Lamping two Yanks in the name of the Vietnamese and John Lennon won't sit too pretty with many neither, nor will the four or five dozen uses of the dreaded c-word. But the sheer vigour, acid-tongued brilliance of McDonagh's dialogue is channelled so effectively through Farrell that it not only makes for a genuinely believable and, somehow, likable character, but also the Irishman's best performance in years. The role of Ray fits him like a glove and will go a long way to re-establishing his faded reputation in eyes of many. Gleeson is also superb. Chipping in with a solid, father-like supporting role, the experienced screen vet' gives a performance of a dead beat bloke in whom regret, honour and an estranged sense of decency suffer a series of head on collisions. Then there's Ralph Fiennes; the intense and steely-eyed method actor who's pure and utter dynamite as the scornful, dirty Harry. His turn ushers in the bloody final third of McDonagh's medieval morality-play.His multi-layered plot remains unwavering and steady throughout featuring just enough well placed hooks to keep audiences interested. The sheer weight and wit of McDonagh's smartly scripted dialogue is what gives Bruges its muscle, though. Rarely does it cease to entertain or amuse, shock or transgress. It's both rare in style and scandalous in content. You know full-well you shouldn't conform to the shallowness of the humour. You know you shouldn't laugh. But you do anyway. Violent, vicious, bloody funny, brilliantly executed and surprisingly touching: In Bruges is as fine a film you're likely to see this side of Pulp Fiction. It's a merciless, pin-sharp feature from the big screen d\u00e9butant with a big heart that barks like a p*ssed paddy on st. Patrick's day and bites like a Reservoir Dog set loose in Bruges.",

            "content": "Centered in the small and unappealing town of Bruges in Belgium, this very British based production achieves Hollywood perfection. Redefining the ability to cross cut two differing genres, In Bruges is a comical yet tense work that stands superior to any past production piece regardless of its genre, in which a deep feeling of envy should be felt.Employing a narrative that does not stretch any further than being simple yet engaging, it is a story that features both deep sorrow and realistic humour. As two hit men Ray and Ken exile to Bruges after a hit goes terribly wrong, it focuses on the morals and trauma surrounding the pairs past killings as they engage with the historical beauty of Bruges and the alternate lifestyle it offers. The director Martin McDonagh is vigilante not to glorify the pairs criminal career in any way, which is essential to the realistic factor the film employs, as there is a deep focus on the aftermath and trauma of both their failures and lack of mercy for their victims. The plot from early on is fairly engaging, but it is the truly unsuspecting plot twist that engages the viewer further into the the tension that begins to climatically build from that point. Regardless of the change of attitudes and tipping balance of genre focus that switches between comedy to drama at various points, the comical and emotion provoking actions that the characters commit provide a narrative that is not only unique but surprisingly enjoyable.With a strong focus on a shrewd use of comedy throughout, \"In Bruges\" provides the viewers with an extensive collection of memorable scenes due to the many comical moments and factors that account for the films comedy based success. Being dominated by a fairly broad range of foul mouthed arguments often ending in violence, the more significant comedy factor is present within the difference in ideology and interests between Ray and Ken. With the pairs similarities stretching no further than their corrupt career path, the pair often resemble the powerless father and brat like child relationship in the early aspects of the plot. Yet it is the lack of belonging the pair experience in the somewhat unideal town of Bruges that provide the most credible element of amusement throughout, as two Irish hit men in a small Belgium town is unsurprisingly unideal, as their actions from early on indicate.Incorporating a fairly small yet diverse range of characters, the casting follows other aspects of the films success in being impeccable. With Colin Farrell heading the cast as the guilt stricken hit-man Ray, his performance of a far from stable individual with a lack of enthusiasm for his partners historical interests or Bruges itself is of the highest caliber. Farrell's revival of his often disregarded Irish accent is highly approved of, as it certainly emphasizes the comedy within his dialogue and is obviously an essential factor for the characters portrayal. Brendan Gleeson shares not only the strong Irish accent employed by Farrell, but equals the high standard of his performance. Gleeson's portrayal of the culture loving hit-man Ken tends to be so genuine that his characters career choice tends to seem hard to believe, which is far from a criticism considering his characters purpose is to blend in with the law abiding citizens of Bruges. Ralph Fiennes on the other hand is a far more clouded character for the most part as Ken and Ray's boss Harry. Displaying the ruthlessness not present within the exiled pair of hit men, Fiennes' performances as yet another villain is just as flawless in comparison to his contributions in past productions and his casting colleagues in this one.Where as the visual factors of \"In Bruges\" are immaculate, its relevant soundtrack deserves the same credit. With a primarily piano based soundtrack it is not only suitable for the location of the film, but also adds to the sense of foreboding which ensures the comical factor disappears in the more serious sequences of the films narrative. Without this imperial soundtrack the impressive balance between drama and comedy would certainly be lost.Undoubtedly \"In Bruges\" is one of the most unsuspecting film successes of the 21st century. With a narrative that is easy to follow and thus more engaging, a likable cast of characters and flawless performances by the cast themselves, \"In Bruges\" genuinely is a must see film and shouldn't be overshadowed by its lack of popularity on the big screen.",

Was it supposed to be farce? Perhaps a gentle comedy? Maybe a thriller with comedy overtones? Perhaps a black comedy? Who knows? At times we felt we were watching an episode of the British TV sitcom \"Father Ted\", but without the fun.As I have already stated, it was a great story, but it needed two primary changes: A script-editor with a ruthless approach to dialogue and a director with a true sense of what the film should have been.Finally, a thought: imagine what a wondrous film this would have been with the Coen Brothers at the helm.",

I was at my buddies house and we're doing a movie day we had already watched \"Funny Games\" and \"Diary of the Dead\" but I really didn't think when we put this in it would be as great as it was.Colin Farrell who I've been a fan of since \"Hart's War\" shows that he is a great actor in this movie. In the first maybe half of the movie it's a very dark comedic movie that I thoroughly enjoy but when it finally gets to the serious plot points it doesn't disappoint. Brendan Gleeson along with Colin Farrell make a great duo. With Gleeson's love of old buildings and tourism and Farrell's pouting and only wanting to go get drunk at the local pub.With all the quick side stories and adventures I won't waste my time trying to explain some of them and it would also decrease from the pleasure of finding out for yourself. Movies like this are rare nowadays it seems, a movie with slapstick comedy, bloody violence, and soul.Let's not forget Ralph Fiennes role, you almost want to say he went over the top but he doesn't it's almost pitch perfect for the role, I smiled whenever he was on screen, I've said before that previews are ruining movies lately by giving away to much plot but even if you think that's true with this one, trust me your wrong there is so much more to the movie then what's shown in the preview.So in conclusion I've tried to not give away any of the plot because this is one of the movies that you should know almost nothing about going in and let the movie take you for a enjoyable ride. Trust me when the credits start rolling you'll be glad you spend your time watching this one.",

Colin Farrel puts in his worst performance to date: indicating, forcing, and making faces to get his motivations across. Obviously the director is influenced by the Tarantino school of film-making, but sadly he missed the class on thematic points and the protagonist's journey, focusing on the flashy, outrageous, and cartoon-like aspects of recess. The writer/director claims he got the idea when he, himself, visited Bruges-- he found the city so \"Gothic and beautiful,\" but then how bored he was after only two days, and how he started to want to \"find a girl and get drunk,\" etc. Isn't that inspiring? To think that someone's boredom can become the main plot line of a movie. The oft repeated central question of the movie seems to be \"Why are we in Bruges?\" Why indeed? Very thought-provoking...",

However, the acting is exceptional and it is filled with both humor and sober thoughts on life, death and guilt. Colin Farrell has undoubtedly offered up his finest performance in film. Farrell has been decent in other films but this role was filled with humor and vulnerability. The acting during a conversation at breakfast with Brendan Gleeson in the hotel is priceless; so, too, Farrell's attempt to get a date with the lovely and wonderfully attractive Clemence Poesy. Gleeson himself is excellent as well as a brief but very poignant role by Ralph Fiennes. The Golden Globe nominations of Gleeson and Farrell for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy were well deserved. In my view, Farrell should get a Best Actor nomination for the Academy; it is not a winning role. But, it is phenomenal acting. I doubt he'll get a nomination given the Academy's melodrama fetish. However, I will guarantee that Farrell's role is better than two or three of the roles. Farrell takes small scenes with good dialog and makes it exceptional. The various views of Bruges are very nice; the movie captures very well life in a mid-sized European town. The main square the hotel and its breakfast area all are captured quite well. The screenplay is equal to Farrell's acting. There are great statements about life and choices one makes - as well as great humor. To be able to explore both with equal aplomb in a film is quite an achievement. The screenplay for this movie is also quite deserving of an Oscar nomination. The one slight negative I would have is that I might have changed around a couple of scenes near the end, but that's always the writer's prerogative. Finally, the language is pretty rough at times. However, this seems essential for a legitimate portrayal of the characters. Unless you can only handle mindless action films (don't get me wrong - those have their place!) or fast action dramas - you should enjoy this movie.",

Colin Farrell's performance as Ray the disgruntled hit-man is so wickedly hilarious you couldn't stop laughing at his witty one liners and all that crass, rude jokes. His buddy is co-assassin Ken, excellently portrayed by Brendan Gleeson whose deep reserve for Colin's Ray takes on a whole new level when he jumps out of a bell tower to save his best mate's life. That's what I call \"brothers-fo-life\" On the other hand, there's the villain boss Harry, whose demeaning stature and ruthless persona perfectly fits the actor who plays him: the demeaning and ruthless Ralph Fiennes.'In Bruges' is one of those films that's so good you probably haven't even seen it yet.",

            "content": "Personally, I found 2008 to be a very underwhelming year for film-making. Three of my favourite directors came up short (Chris Nolan with The Dark Knight, the Coens with Burn After Reading and Guy Ritchie with RockNRolla) and a lot of the currently popular 'superhero' pictures just weren't cutting it. Every new movie I saw seemed to be lacking in witty scripting, and most had disappointing endings.Fortunately, somebody recommended I watch In Bruges. And what a bloody good decision that turned out to be.This film has attracted a lot of flak. It seems to polarise critics. People who look on the surface just see a couple of hit-man types who swear all the time and are throughly unpleasant individuals, not at all likable. These critics perhaps missed two of the most important aspects of the picture: it's a dark, black comedy in the vein of American Psycho, and it is incredibly subtle in places. So subtle that it really needs a couple of viewings to appreciate the minimalistic approach of the scriptwriting and direction.What I like most about the experience - and it really is an experience - is the deliberately grey morality demonstrated by everyone in the film. How nice people can be rude and indecent, and how those supposed to be evil can actually be incredibly tender and caring even if they might be confused about expressing it. Colin Farrell finally comes into his own here, demonstrating an incredible emotional range. He goes from childlike impatience to arrogant and presumptuous to heartbroken and desolate. It would be a tough job for any lead, but I was with him all the way. Veteran actor Brendan Gleeson has some formidable chops to add as well, with the camaraderie and gradual friendship/mentorship he gives to Ray being one of the focal points and a definite highlight. Everyone in this makes their screen time count, whether it's minutes or mere seconds.It's an odd story, not completely original but certainly off-kilter. The swearing is necessary, as it is in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. That Martin McDonagh both writes and directs allows him to flesh out his script with more emotion, because as mentioned it's quite minimal and all the better for it. It relies on strong delivery and use of body language and facial expression. I honestly think you have to see it three or four times to truly appreciate the effect.Bruges is captured beautifully on film. Without drawing too much attention to the backdrop, it is clear that the location is an intriguing juxtaposition to the moral dilemmas faced by our two protagonists. It speaks volumes about the young gun, Ray, that he finds nothing comforting or calming in the serenity of his hiding place. Ken, the wise and weary companion, finds peace of mind and a moral clarity it is obvious he had ignored for years.If you can get your head around the violence (it's used sparingly but is, I felt, genuinely shocking and horrific) and the strong, blunt language, you might find not just the best picture of 2008 by some distance, but also the sort of drama you want to revisit time and again.If you haven't yet, go and watch In Bruges. It's fine work to be sure, to be sure.",

The use of Brugge as purgatory, is encapsulated in the scene where Ray and Ken meditate upon The Last Judgement, by Bosch. The theme that nice men can do bad things recurs. A nod (an homage is too strong) to \"Don't Look Now\", and another nod to \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\", as Harry, in silhouette, pistol whips the attendant of the Brugge Belfry. Ken's own redemption, attempting to redeem Ray shows that it's never too late to change the path you have chosen. Harry, also a bad man, remains an honourable man- \"You've got to stick to your principles\"; \"I'm sorry I called you an inanimate object\". The ultimate revelation that the midget's role is central, and is not a picaresque conceit, is masterly. The brilliant dialogue, and the haunting score, especially, Der Leiermann, illustrate that Carter Burwell really understood the film, and endow the film with a congruence that is all too rare.The flaw? That self referential bit when Harry tells Marie that \"this is the shoot out\". It jars, but it's like grit in an oyster, emphasising the overall brilliance of this film.",

I am going for my birthday in April and can not wait. I got started in trying to get a sequel made as feel a story can be told. Have got back that no time soon does Martin McDonagh have plans for a sequel. But I saw a video of Colin Farrell saying {Joe Meets Colin Farrell To Talk The Lobster Harry Potter And A Sequel To In Bruges}. I hear Colin Farrell asked about who he could play and he says Ray In Bruges film. When asked about a sequel he says oh Brendan not ready. In my mind meaning as Brendan Gleeeson has been writing something else that he might be interested in writing a sequel. Martin McDonagh holds the writes if a film is done again. But I am sure as he knows Colin and Brendan well that just be what Colin Farrell meant in his comments. To show your interest please look at this you tube video. Any way I think Colin Farrell is the best performance he has ever given. And Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes are superb. Also ever one in the film give a really good performance.

Not little on budget(even if it happens to be true many times), but a movie that is restrained in scale, that has but a few characters and a simple premise; a movie that expects nothing of itself but to be what it is. In one word: SIMPLICITY!If you read Tolstoy, you soon realize that in his writing the biggest remarks on human nature are expressed in the most beautifully simplified verse. It holds true to all arts that, through simplicity and showing nothing more than a detail, you get a more accurate display of life.\"In Bruges\" is such a gem. Perfect as it is. Shot in the beautiful city of Bruges, to which we are introduced by some of the most beautiful(and some times hilarious) footage I have ever seen-one where a dog looks from the window to the street like an old lady burns into the memory fast. The acting, as it always happens in such small movies, is what carries the film. Great acting all around with the grand prize going to Colin Farell who seems to be on top form after giving up alcohol.

She also deals drugs to a movie cast and crew, who are filming in Bruges.We don't know why the hit men (well, actually, the hit man - Farrell was the hit man, Gleeson was the person who recruited him) were hired to do the job, or why the hit was commissioned, but this was not important anyway. Ralph Fiennes plays the guy who called for the hit.oh - there's also the hostess of the hotel (or was it a b & b) where Farrell and Gleason are staying in Bruges. She's pregnant.I'm not going to say too much more, because to do so would give away too much of the plot.The acting was fine. Gleeson especially shines. Ralph Fiennes is properly menacing.

I say regrettable, because they were so foolishly overlooked, and so easily fixable, that I can never imagine why they were allowed to remain in the finished product. One could have been omitted altogether, the other re shot very simply. The first is the lunatic scene with the so called overweight American tourists, this was like a bad moment in Screwballs or Dumb and Dumber, and should never have happened at all, given that it did happen, it would not have harmed the story in any way to have committed it to the canvas bag or to the cutting room floor. The second regrettable scene was in the restaurant, when, for some reason best known to the director, the direction takes on an amateur theatrical or painting by numbers technique. She exits to go to the ladies room, he blows smoke and an arrogant diner complains, he snaps it and calls the diner by inviting him to repeat his complaint, this leads to an over injection of testosterone on both sides, they stand, punches are thrown, and the hero decks the diner, his date then swings a bottle and he decks her, the table breaks away, as many a card table did in the old westerns, and both decked characters remain decked, she returns from ladies room (right on cue)just in time to clock the situation; to this point, nobody has stopped eating, the waiters are all out the back having a smoke, and the restaurant manager has gone for a Pee, or is taking a shower in the next building, because nobody attempts to stop the fight, or even pay it the slightest attention. In order to avoid any further collapse in the suspension of disbelief, the director cuts to \"exterior night two\" and the couple out in the street walking away from the restaurant. The time that would have been saved by cutting the Fat Tourist scene, could well have been used to support the utterly unbelievable restaurant scene.Such a shame, because the film is a beauty, and the combined efforts of all concerned in this production, have provided the world with a work of nearly true greatness.Regards, Dracher",

In Bruges is a dark and very bloody comedy in which the city of Bruges adds its own somewhat bizarre background. Bruges is not of our everyday world just as the events in the film are surely not daily experiences.Ray is a novice hit man who on his very first job, accidentally kills a young boy. Ray is sent to Bruges with an older hit man, Ken by their boss, Harry. The reason given to Ray by Harry is so he can basically get his head together after his horrifying mistake. The real reason is that Ray has been sent to Bruges to be murdered by Ken. At the beginning, Ken only suspects this assignment until he is contacted by Harry.The older, wiser, more sophisticated Ken is overwhelmed by the history, art, and beauty of Bruges whereas the young and crude Ray hates being stuck in this little city so far removed from modern times. As their visit continues, Ken endeavors to interest Ray in the sights and knowledge available, but Ray, who is wracked with guild over murdering a young boy, only wants to drown his remorse with drink, drugs and the companionship of a newfound local girl.Eventually, Ken receives the phone call he has been dreading in the back of his mind. Harry orders that Ray be murdered because, \"You can't kill a kid and live.\" All of this leads to an extremely bloody ending, but along the way, the audience is treated to a string of bizarre characters and even more bizarre events that are filled with delightful dark, dark element of comedy.Along with the tight darkly humorous script, the superior acting - especially the acting of the three male leads - is what gives In Bruges its eight stars.Brendan Gleeson plays Ken and his beautifully understated depiction of a man worn down by his own sins who just wants to survive is a sight to see. It would seem impossible to feel any sympathy for a man who murders for his profession, but Gleeson gives us such a man.Colin Farrell at thirty-two is ten years too young for the part of Ray, but his considerable acting talent enables you to forgive those extra years. He makes you believe he is Ray, a young man from the wrong side of the tracks who has accidentally committed an unpardonable sin and is suffering in his soul.Ralph Fiennes may be a little over the top as Harry, the boss, but he certainly pulls it off. Keep in mind that these are unreal people in an unreal environment, so a little overacting can certainly be forgiven.These three stars of the film are supported by a group of premier actors in series of extremely unusual roles.As for the DVD, the extra features are a real treat. Not only is there a very good \"making of\" video, there is a beautiful tour of Bruges. The delight of the extras, however, is a short video based upon the considerable foul language in the film which would make a sailor blush. This f**king little video is fun, fun.Yes, In Bruges is dark and bloody. If you shy away from such fare, avoid this film, but if you can plant your tongue firmly in your cheek and sit back to enjoy a flight of sinister fancy, give this film a viewing.",

I'm sure I'll come back to these films again and again. In Bruges though is the most compelling and most polished of the three with the four main players in the film, director and leading actors almost showing off they're mastery of their art if not quiet reaching film perfection, for me its film entertainment perfection...

            "content": "When I first saw the previews for In Bruges, I didn't really expect much. But wow, it really surprised me. I wasn't only entertained, but it actually was a really good film. This is Martin McDonagh first feature film after winning an Oscar for Best Live Action Short, a few years back.In Bruges is labeled as a \"Dark Comedy\" type of film. However, it is more dark, than comedic. (Which is a good thing) I expected something more of a regular comedy that tried to take itself top seriously by adding the crime aspects to it. It's actually more of a crime/drama type with a lot of added humor/comedic situations and it works quite well.It's shot entirely in Bruges, Belgium. The backdrop scenes are beautiful. It shows the classic, older style of architecture of Western Europe. Amazing cinematography. Cool, dark colors, set up the tone and style of the film.You know the plot, two hit men reside in Bruges after a botched job. They wait for a call from their boss to hear what to do next. Seems simple, right? Well it is, That's what I like about it. It's simple, but to the point. The writing is what carries the film. It makes everything interesting. Tremendous, witty dialogue throughout the film, which also receives recognition with an Oscar nomination.I was pleasantly surprised with Colin Farrell. He really gives a great performance and fits extremely well in to role. Earns a lot more respect with this performance. As a hit man, he is surprisingly sympathetic. Brendon Gleeson is also solid in his role. He is a tough guy with a streak of humanity. They seem to work together well. Ralph Fienees also appears in a supporting role. He shows his evil sides, but is quite funny as well. There is a variety of different, quirky characters ranging from the two hit-man, an extremely overweight family, a local love interest, to a midget in a film production. Overrall, solid performances all around.I appreciated the \"dark comedy\" and with the moral complexity of the characters' inner struggles. They're hit men, but they are oddly interesting and seem much more like us than we may think. It makes for a very satisfying film, one that is much more than just entertainment. It's an interesting film, that deserves to be looked into some time.",

It certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I had a great time with virtually all aspects of 'In Bruges'The chemistry between Brendan Gleeson (Ken) and Colin Farrell's (Ray) characters really makes this an enjoyable watch. Their banter back and forth is humorous, albeit very dark throughout. But this comes from the fantastic script, written by director Martin McDonagh. It's a very well put together dark comedy that isn't afraid to say what it says, which I admire, especially in today's society.Performances were consistent from all. Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes are both classy experienced actors, as is Colin Farrell, but Farrell's performance was my particular favourite. You never know what he's going to do next, his persona is mysterious and hilarious, and his acting makes for great viewing.A really underrated film. It's of course not a perfect one, but there's a lot to enjoy here, superbly done.",

Good films are made at the presence of a human's mind or soul; masterpieces are made in integral presence of mind & soul. In Bruges is a film of the last kind. all of the characters in it - main or marginal - are memorable by their functions in the course of narration & as the story spreads ahead, roles of them which seemed at first marginal to the story, suddenly come miraculously up, fit as a part of a foreseen destiny.Just two main traits in the film that makes it an unforgettable piece of creation by human's mind & soul are:1-some mythological characters with nonnegotiable principles which they are fighting & dying for; alongside of a few earthly characters which living under the shadow of the first group's dominance. 2-a tinge of comedy - some sense of sitcom - mixed in overwhelming taste of tragedy. (Polytonal texture)Everything seems like an occult or symbolic story of undying creatures that have been sent on earth to teach some things transcendental to the humankind. It's a hypnotizing magical masterpiece.

I caught myself wondering if I should turn it off and do something better with my time instead. My wife commented on how bored she was.Fortunately for us, we bore through that terrible first half-hour and were subsequently rewarded with a movie that became increasingly enjoyable, fresh and... dare I say it... poignant, as it moved along. This is, for the most part, down to an amazing performance by Brendan Gleeson. Collin Farrel is good here, and Ralph Fiennes is great as usual; but it's Gleeson who steals every scene.

The 2008 film's story about Irish hit men (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrel) brought to mind Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) in 1994's \"Pulp Fiction.\" But I thought \"Bruge\" a darker movie. It seems more tragic, and the humor more subtle, than \"Pulp Fiction.\" Still, the more I think of it, the more I can see similarities. For example, in both films lesser criminals make the mistake of crossing paths with them. \"In Bruge\" has encounters with incidental \"color\" characters who show up again later in ways more significant to the plot.From other reviews I now guess the hit men are supposed to be part of a criminal gang; however, my initial impression from their skill, discipline and ethics (accidentally killing innocents is a violation of their code) was that they were an IRA cell.I thought the movie dragged a bit in the beginning, but then picked up steam.",

            "content": "I love a good black comedy \u0096 Miles Davis struck-match black. When I say 'black comedy', no, I'm not talking about Barbershop, or any other rubbish with Ice Cube in it, I'm talking about comedy that combines the morbid and grotesque in order to convey the absurdity and cruelty of life. So when I finally finished watching an advanced copy of 'In Bruges', the first thing I did was run out onto the street and scream \"Halle-bloody-lujah!\" to the sky\u0085 well, figuratively. Finally a decent film! Here I was thinking that I was going to die without having watched at least two good films this year.Few cultures do black comedy better than the English/Irish.Writer/Director Martin McDonagh's first full-length feature film, In Bruges, tells the story of two contract killers who are forced to hole up in Bruges, Belgium after a recent hit in London goes south. Waiting on further instruction from their employer, the mysterious Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes), Ken (Brendan Gleeson) the older, seasoned professional and Ray (Colin Farrell) the younger, inexperienced rookie begin to realize how different their perspectives of life, death and redemption truly are.Let me say straight off the bat that In Bruges won't be everyone's cup of tea, but if you love dark British crime films like Lock Stock, chances are you will enjoy this offering from McDonagh. In Bruges can only be described is a multilayered breath of fresh air: it's violent, it's crass, it's absurd, it's touching, and it's as funny as hell.In Bruges revolves around two men with a unique sense of moral flexibility. Dumped onto a train and sent to Bruges in order to wait it out until the heat dies down from their last job \u0096 they have two weeks to wait for a phone call from their boss. So how do a couple of hired guns kill time in one of Europe's most intact medieval cities? They go sightseeing of course. The film instantly drops us into the interesting dynamic between the two lead characters Ken and Ray: Ken wants to get out and experience the culture and atmosphere of the city, while Ray is the complete opposite, content to stay in his hotel room and wallow in self-pity \u0096 that is until he meets a young woman on the set of a local film. As the story unfolds, we learn more about the botched hit in London, and as a result, we learn more about what motivates our two leads. Throw a drugged-up midget into the mix and our two hit men are set for an intriguing, if slightly predictable climax.I couldn't fault a great deal in terms of the acting or characters. At first I found it a little difficult to picture Brendan Gleeson as the seasoned contract killer, but any objections quickly faded-away as the story picked-up. Likewise with Colin Farrell's character \u0096 he did come across as a bit of a sniveling girl, not exactly Farrell's strong suit from an acting standpoint, but I soon forgot all about that the instant I became immersed in the story. Once it became evident that McDonagh opted-out of going with characters that resembled two-dimensional cardboard cut-outs from your typical Hollywood action film, the experience washed-over me in a satisfying wave. I went with the story\u0085 I went on the journey... and I loved it.Why the hell can't Hollywood make these sorts of films: interesting characters, an engaging story, touching moments, and some wicked black humor? There I was, less than twenty minutes into the film and cackling my head off at Farrell's character insulting a group of rather rotund American tourists. Then it suddenly hit me like a bullet to the forehead, I can't remember laughing this hard or this much at any of the films I've reviewed recently. Combined. Get Smart and Hancock maybe resulted in one or two genuine laughs, but I was only twenty minutes into In Bruges and I already had a massive smile on my face. The laughs didn't stop there, trust me.Don't be worried if the name Martin McDonagh doesn't ring a bell, I hadn't heard of the guy before going into this film either. Having done a little research on the man since, it appears that McDonagh is quite an accomplished playwright-cum-filmmaker who has won more Olivier Awards for his plays than I've had hot meals. I suspect that the director's theatre experience is an integral part as to why In Bruges is such a great film \u0096 there's a sense of intimacy and polish to In Bruges that is such an important part of playwriting. Overall I really enjoyed In Bruges \u0096 an absolute breath of fresh air compared to the dreck that comes out of Hollywood these days. If God did exist, and if I actually believed in a god, I'd have to thank him for the dark wit of our European friends in the UK and Ireland. I only had two small criticisms of In Bruges. The first: without giving anything way, I must admit that the last fifteen minutes of the film were pretty predictable \u0096 but for me, I still loved every second of it. The second criticism: it almost felt like I was watching a Belgian Tourist Commission advertisement for Bruges - I'd almost swear that the director was getting a kick-back from the local government to bestow the virtues of Bruges and its incredible history... only to have that notion torn-away every time Collin Farrell's character mentioned how much of a hole Bruges was. Ultimately, neither of those minor niggles detracted from the film as a whole \u0096 if you love English black humor then In Bruges is absolutely worth the trip to the cinema or video store.Edited excerpt from: www.youseenthat.com",

            "content": "I kind of want to visit Bruges now. It does look like a lovely town and not as small as I imagined as it has over 100 thousand residents. The action that took in Bruges was interesting, surprising to some extent, and most of all - entertaining. I had some high expectations and they were mostly met. To quote Harry, \"You've got to stick to your principles\" and so here I am, writing another review for the movie of the week, chosen by the community of r/Letterboxd.I'd like to start with giving big praise to the score. Whether it's a soft piano tune that brings up the beauty of the medieval scene or an intense sequence that involves a lot of woodwinds and electric guitars during a shootout and the chase, Carter Burwell did a masterful job coordinating it all. I took notice of it ever since the prologue and I imagine that this might be one of the underlying reasons why a lot of people have such fond experiences when watching the movie. The score here is like a good spice that makes your taste receptors tingle even more while simultaneously sticking in the back of your tongue, giving you that lingering feeling even after you've done eating.Speaking of the comedy, or, to be more specific, tragicomedy and dark comedy, in this movie, I'd say it's alright. It wasn't the kind of comedy I tend to enjoy at some points though most of the jokes did land with me or at least made me chuckle a bit. Though, there were a plethora of those that made me roll my eyes too. Overall, combining that with the British banter and an exceptional performance the actors provided, I'd rate it towards the more positive spectrum in the ratings. I don't know why but before watching the movie, I expected this to be dark in the way Heathers (1988) was, just replacing teens with spies and Americans with the brits. In some ways, it's exactly what this movie was but some determinants lead Heathers to be a more enjoyable movie for me. My hypothesis so far is that crime and comedy just don't mix well for my taste in a similar way horror and comedy don't mesh (also for my taste).Lastly, the plot. It's good. Very good, I might add. And what made me really good is simple bits of foreshadowing. And there was a lot of that. Some small things that you wouldn't even expect to be significant ended up foreshadowing the key plot points of the movie. Even as early on as visiting the tower in the main square, where Ken makes a finger-gun motion towards Ray. These simple hints, that don't even look like hints at first, make the late stages of the movie really exciting, despite the ending being tragic in a twisted way. The moment when we see what Harry did to \"the little boy\", I knew exactly what was going to happen and that quote that I provided during the beginning of this review - I can still hear it in his voice as it resonates there from time to time.There was a lot more happening here that I either liked, sometimes felt conflicted about and, on rare occasions, despised and I would like to spread out a discuss a lot of topics but I felt that those three key elements say the most about this movie. Even if I didn't enjoy some elements here, I really enjoyed the music, the plot, and, to some extent, the comedy but that was mostly due to the wit of the actors and the way they delivered it. I kind of feel like the teacher who never gives the highest marks and says \"There's nothing as perfection and nobody will get perfect marks here\". Though this movie is perfect in a way. I wouldn't call this my favorite movie of all time, not even close to that, but it did leave an impression on me and when there's something to remember, something that lingers even a day after watching a movie, I'd say that movie perfectly succeeded in being a quality media of entertainment.",

The dialogue, although delivered sincerely enough by Farrell, Gleeson, and especially Fiennes, seems forced, and I could not stop myself from realizing that I was listening to a script. Likewise, the screenwriter, McDonagh (who also directed), is under the delusion that dropping the f-bomb often will take care of things such as making the dialogue \"hip\" and \"funny.\"There are throw-away moments of true charm here, though: Harry (Fiennes)'s love of \"fairytale\" Bruges, the random Robert Powell comparison, a completely unbelievable yet somewhat refreshing \"shoot-out\" where a normally victimized female stock-character (a proprietress) refuses to budge from her place between the shooters, and, above and beyond all, the true sense of brotherly concern Ken (Gleeson) has for Ray (Farrell). But once it gets caught up in the unfunny \"alcoves\" and \"racist dwarfs\" and a female character desperate to be shocking yet merely sweet and pretty and, ultimately, useless, the picture sinks.In time, McDonagh may write a better script, one that does not feel like a student's first attempt to impress his professor, and us.",

We have Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes who was the best of them all. He appeared the least but did a hell of a job. But, that doesn't mean the others failed, all of them made this movie good. And this is one of the reasons I enjoyed it. 2)The place. The title says it. In Bruges. I don't know if that is where the movie is really shot, but still it is a beautiful small town and we get a chance to see it in more than one scene. 3)The story and the twist. Colin's character(Ray) is a hit-man and comes in Bruges with Brendan's character(Ken), because he accidentally killed a little boy. What they don't know, is that Ralph's character(Harry) sent them there, so that Ray could have nice time before Ken killed him. But, of course that is not so simple. In the end, Harry has to come and do the job himself and he ends up having the same faith as Ray, expect he didn't kill a little boy, but a dwarf and he doesn't realize that.The things that didn't make this movie awesome: 1)It was quite slow,quiet and at moments boring. The only action we see is in the last 10 minutes. But, if you like interesting dialog, it should be OK. 2)When I searched it here at IMDb, they tagged it as a comedy first. It definitely isn't. It has very,very little humor if you know to recognize it because the characters aren't even trying to be funny, and funnily enough, that's the funny. 3)Almost all the three main characters die.I didn't like that. I usually connect with the characters and I don't want them to die, but sometimes I accept a tragic end if it will make the movie great. And maybe it does for this one. Any way, if you don't mind if the lead actors die, then you should enjoy it.",

Directed by Martin McDonagh and set almost entirely in the beautiful Belgian canal city of Bruges, this is one where it's hard to tell whether it's a violent comedy, or a spoof on violence, or a comical violence film about two hard-boiled Irish hit men on the lam in Belgium. Our hero, handsome Irish charmer Colin Farrell, sporting a heavy growth of five-o'clock shadow throughout and constantly lamenting the fact that he accidentally killed a little boy, is not above punching out a lady in a restaurant or karate chopping a poor midget who gets on his nerves -other than that he's quite lovable. Ralph Fiennes (the onetime \"English Patient\"), comes in for possibly the most brutal role he's ever played as the obsessed vengeful father of the departed lad, and Irish actor Brendan Gleeson (a veteran of the Harry Potter films) is also quite charming as the avuncular partner in crime of young Farrell. Guns galore and drugs like cocaine and LSD are taken for granted in this colorful criminal saga, and the city of Bruge itself is shown in its full glory, day and night. The music, incidentally, is extremely subtle with a quiet piano playing soothingly in the background of some of the most violent scenes. Very good music in its own right, and compliments to composer Carter Burwell, who does the music for all Coen Brothers flicks among others. Winding up with a breathtaking chase through the cobblestone streets of Bruges at night and a shootout on the canal, \"In Bruges\" literally leaves you gasping for breath and needing a drink... and realizing that, whatever it was about, you just had one helluva romp and laughed a lot. The perfect bookend for a modest film festival in a major east-European capital.",

            "content": "In Bruges is Martin McDonagh's first feature film after his Oscar winning short film Six Shooter. In Bruges stars Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farell as two hit men Ray and Ken, being told to hideout in Bruges and await further instructions from their boss Harry, played by Ralph Fiennes, in London. The film has all of Martin McDonagh's traits and style, e.g Lots of cursing, lots of blood and violence and lots of black comedy. His style isn't for everyone and his comedy is defiantly not for everyone, however if he is for you you'll think he's the best in the world. But, aside from whether he's your cup of tea or not, you have to appreciate the storyline, the acting and most defiantly the script. In Bruges is one of the best films to release in the last few years and defiantly 2008. It is an undeniable little gem that I'm sure people have missed. But since I've seen it, I've been hooked on what he's done previously and what he will do in the future. He's a brilliant writer and a great director and you can tell he works well with the actors as Colin Farell was brilliant in it.Great film. 8/10",

The directing and cinematography was great, they make Bruiges seem so beautiful and exotic. The writing is superb, some scenes are really funny, bu there's also a lot of suspense and great dialog.

            "content": "From the off, this had the look and feel of a cult movie. Being neither an out-and-out comedy nor an action thriller, I personally feel that this movie was mis-marketed - however, at least the PR machine made me want to watch it in the first place and I'm glad I did. Feeling like a cross between \"Father Ted\" and \"The Bourne Identity\", this is a beautifully shot film full of humour and pathos in equal measures. It's also the first film I can recall seeing where Colin Farrell isn't a huge disappointment.\"In Bruges\" introduces us to two Irish hit men - child-like Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) who are ordered to lay low in Bruges (in Belgium) for two weeks after a job in London while awaiting further instructions from their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes). Ken enjoys his time while Ray can't wait to get out until he meets Chlo\u00eb (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy), who is working on a film with dwarf actor Jimmy (Jordan Prentice). But after botching a job and finding himself the target, both Ray and Ken struggle to deal with the consequences of their actions...There will be few who would argue that \"In Bruges\" is anything original as it is rather reminiscent of a Guy Ritchie gangster flick as the characters and plot tangle with each other in unexpected ways. The balance of humour and drama also matches Ritchie's output though due to heavy Irish accents, you sometimes struggle to hear all of the fabulously witty dialogue. But \"In Bruges\" does offer some crucial differences, the biggest being Farrell who produces the goods in a way I never expected he could. He and Gleeson exchange some brilliant dialogue as they come to terms with past mistakes and choices. Fiennes is also very good as the urbane killer with a family life and a potty mouth. The other surprise is Bruges itself, looking every inch like the medieval dreamscape it feels like in the movie and provides not only a rich backdrop but also another character interacting with the actors.However, the plot itself is pretty standard gangster fare (albeit, set in Belgium) and there are still questions left at the end of the film. But these don't distract you from what is an extremely good, low-budget movie that offers big dollops of laughs, action and soul-searching amid a picturesque Gothic town in Belgium. No doubt about it, this is a difficult movie to pigeonhole and I know some people who'll watch this expecting something different and going home disappointed. Probably the film closest to this in feel and style is the equally cult \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\" and that didn't do too well at the box office either. But if you're in the mood for something different but still entertaining then this could be exactly what you're looking for. Give it a go but leave your expectations at the door. Then book a flight to Belguim...",

            "content": "It seems odd to start with a film's score, but the impact that Carter Burwell's work has on this film should not go unnoticed. His scoring creates a mood throughout that, to paraphrase from the film, puts the film somewhere between reality and a dream, much of the time - it's that good. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant, and is reminiscent of Kingsley in \"Sexy Beast\" - brutally principled, and seemingly, perpetually angry. Brendan Gleeson also contributes a strong performance. I was prepared to not like Farrell, but in reality, he strikes a good balance between lackadaisical thuggery and poignant vulnerability...I tried to think of who might've done better in the role, actors like Ewan McGregor, for instance, but actually, I couldn't think of any (Ewan included). The movie itself strikes that same balance that Farrell's character does. The relatively few scenes of violence are bloody, blunt, and realistic. There are some very funny moments, and humor drifts throughout. In pubs and plazas, Bruges is charmingly Old World - the film is as appealing to the eye as the score is to the ear. Matters of awful gravity, like the killing of children and violence against women, somehow don't drag the film down to an unenjoyable depth. The film stirs thoughts of situational ethics, and that there, compelling the viewer to consider what one believes, makes it a worthy watch. The preciousness and corrigibility of youth, and the sacred status of the expecting mother, juxtaposed with mercenary violence - well done.",

            "review_title": "The best Belgian film ever",
            "content": "It doesn't happen too often that international productions are filmed in Belgium. That's why it was big news in Belgium when Martin McDonagh came to Bruges to shoot his film over here. A film with a title like this, couldn't be filmed anywhere but in Belgium, you can argue. Right, but the film could as well have been called 'In Prague', 'In Sevilla', 'In Florence' or 'In Talinn' if you want. Only, Martin McDonagh sincerely seemed to be mesmerized by the city which we like to call the Venice of the North. Bruges is beautiful, fairytale-like and on a certain level the city really looks like an open-air-museum, though the mayor of Bruges and his band try very hard to make Bruges a modern, contemporary city and succeed to have it be more. So, it's human for foreigners in the first place to be mesmerized by Bruges. And indeed, it is possible that Martin McDonagh loved the city that much that he really wanted his film to be made over there. In that case, Bruges is very lucky. But whether Bruges did everything to get this production to their city or it was the director or the producer who decided to film in Bruges, it makes no difference, the result is great. It's a story about two hit men arriving in Bruges. As a viewer the only information we get at first is that something went wrong with their last job. So their boss gave them the order to travel to Bruges, and keep low for a while, try to be unnoticed and enjoy the great views. The oldest of the two seems to be the smarter one. He enjoys to do some sightseeing and loves the old buildings, the museums and the great paintings by Flemish masters. He is brilliantly played by Brendan Gleeson. You believe he can be a tough guy, who is capable of murdering someone, but on the other hand he's very soft, sweet and nice, gentle and a joy to be around. One likes to listen to him when he talks, and you can't dream of a better companion to find hanging around in a bar Bruges and to have a couple of beers with. His partner is the wild one, he is played by Colin Farrell, the actor who seemed to have forgotten for a couple of years that he was an actor. Hollywood wanted him to be a star instead. An image that didn't him. He is an actor indeed, and he proves it here. A brilliant one. He's a comedian even. I didn't know he was capable of giving such a performance. Really astonishing. The rest of the cast is also great. But of course everything stands or falls with Bruges and the performances of the two leading actors. As a Flemish Belgian it is a pity we don't get to see one Flemish actor in the film, while Bruges is in Flanders and the only Belgians in the film are played by Dutch, French and Walloon actors, who -- mind you \u0096 are all great. I couldn't think of a negative word on this film. It's the best comedy I've seen in a long time. I laughed my head off. Not once, but also the second time I went to see the film. Bruges is so lucky that this film is made over here. Although McDonagh and his cast make fun of the city and of boring Belgium all the time, it's the greatest publicity Bruges and Belgium could dream of. The film shows how beautiful some corners of our country are, and how great it is to live over here. I was proud to be Belgian before seeing this film, I am even more so after seeing it. And I will see it again and again. It's so funny when something you love is made fun of. We know it's good, so everyone can laugh. Also great are the constant laughs at the expense of the fat American tourists. Easy laughs, I know, but funny nevertheless.",

In Bruges starring Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes is a well played dark comedy for those who relish the poetic use of obscenities. It is a filth-laden film that unapologetically abuses every word your mom wishes wasn't in the dictionary. When watching this movie you are quick to realize that the over use of foul language is simply one aspect of the comedy that writer/director Martin McDonagh uses as a niche to carve out his piece of the film world. For me, this was just the tip of all the fun In Bruges has to offer.Winner of an Academy Award in 2006 for his short film Six Shooter (also starring Gleeson), celebrated British playwright McDonagh's first feature length film is hopefully a glimpse into a bright future of film-making. For In Bruges, much like Six Shooter, McDonagh uses his writing talents to tell a comical story through a dark and twisted sense of humor. In addition, with a shock of ultra violence within a not too violent film, it is sure to make all fans of foul words and blood scream for joy.It is difficult to offer a comparison for In Bruges, such as if you like that one, you'll like this one sort of thing. I would however put it in the same genre as Tarantino films, Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels, Boondock Saints, and Very Bad Things. This whole genre of modern day melodramas are films that use a bit of extreme violence with extreme language all perpetuated by extremely bad decisions. Then, to top it all off we the audience are meant to view these things as a comedy. I love it! The story of In Bruges is of two hit men (Farrell and Gleeson) that are sent to the city of Bruges in Belgium to sit tight and await new orders from their boss (played by Fiennes). Bruges is a simple historic little town, and no place for the likes of these two. A skewed view of a code of honor places the two hit men in a violent battle with their employer, and when the past catches up with them the mayhem ensues.Again, this film isn't for everyone. A person near and dear to me said it best: \"some people just can't see past the #@%&\". If you're lucky enough to qualify as being not one of these people, then run out and get your copy of In Bruges today, and #@%&ing enjoy it!",

In this case, In Bruges, stands apart because of Bruges, which is in Belgium.This is a story of two hit men, with very different personalities, who are sent away to Bruges after a botched job. Bruges, a historically and architecturally interesting city, but which is also rather boring.The writing was good (could have been much better with a few minor adjustments) and the acting of Ferrell, Gleeson, and Fienes was enjoyable. The cinematography of Bruges was top notch. This film was a dark comedy, and was funny, but not THAT funny. The ideology that drove the plot...namely hit men shouldn't kill children, was to me, not that intense of motive for people who chose to be assassins. You would think that at least one of the 3 assassins in the film would not subscribe to that ideology.I was a little put off by the anti-American theme that reared its ugly head throughout the film and by the racist comments by the drug-induced midget. The little person's wild commentary could have focused on something else besides a war between white and black people. Besides, it didn't seem to fit this character's personality at all either, regardless of whether he was on drugs or not. I also found it odd that the only Americans in the film were either overweight or a midget, hence of strange physical proportions. This unfortunate anti-American current made me enjoy the film slightly less than I would have and brought down my rating a tad. A film that at best, could achieve an 8 of 10 stars, I give it 7 of 10 stars due to the anti-American themes. Plus, the story line is simply not believable enough to warrant any higher of a score. With that said, I recommend the film. Ferrell and Gleeson at their best and great cinematography make this film worthwhile.",

This is not movie which is build on action, it's slowly paced movie which is main component an atmosphere. Atmosphere is what movie giving a special feeling connected with really great music with piano. On my opinion it deserve an Oscar for music theme. This is story of man who is persecuted by the demons of his past, by the committed crime for which complains deeply, because he meet the woman of his life he suddenly begin to be aware of his sins.

            "content": "I highly recommend this film for any Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie films, but really to any lover of film. There is a reason film's like this aren't big Hollywood block buster hits, because it is a highly original, dialogue driven film that will go places you couldn't foresee happening. This is a hilarious dark comedy (which may be a little to dark for some, especially one scene in particular about mid way through), but I really consider it more of a crime drama than a comedy. The best way to watch this film is to watch it without seeing any trailers or reading any reviews that contain spoilers so you can get the best experience when you watch it. The premise seems simple, two hit men hiding out after a recent job, but trust me when I say it is much more complex than that. If you enjoy this film I highly recommend watching Martin Mcdonagh's second feature, Seven Psychopaths. Also, I haven't seen many Short's but his first and only short \"Six Shooter\"(Which Won an Academy Award) I have seen many times, its only about 30minutes in length and features a simple premise as well, but it is a powerful 30 minutes and you can watch the entire thing for free on youtube ( just search \"Six Shooter Martin Mcdonagh\").",

The main protagonists wait for judgement for their past sins in the town. One character overtly expresses his desire for repentance, the other's sins are more deeply hidden. The point is emphasised by overtly referencing Bosch's Last Judgement.The consistently witty dialogue is gallows humour and the pair are each made to suffer graphically for their sins. The younger character is left with the possibility of redemption the elder perhaps resigned to a transfer to hell although his descent is through a frosty air earlier equated to a fairy tale.The resolution is perhaps a too trite symmetry with Bosch's painting brought to life as a film set.Other than this over emphasis (perhaps necessary for a mainstream audience) this is a well scripted, tightly directed film with marvellous performances.I hadn't laughed out loud watching a film for a long time.",

            "review_title": "In a Nutshell Masterpiece: In Bruges (8.5/10)",
            "content": "In Bruges...\"You've got to stick to your principles\"Defining the genre of Dark Comedy, In Bruges presents a cinematic course of continuously entertaining dialogues in a classic clash of humour and drama. A story of two hit men, \"Ray\" (Collin Farrell) and \"Ken\" (Brendan Gleeson), sent on time off in Bruges, Belgium by their boss \"Harry\" (Ralph Fiennes) after a tough job. During the few days they spend in the little gloomy town, circumstances lead them to show more of their characters and their thoughts on different matters of life.As you watch In Bruges you can't help getting pulled right into the plot and what it presents from dramatic reality. The key to that is none other than the actual setting of the movie. Think about this; the most preserved medieval town in Belgium, old buildings and little canals, and two Irishmen trying to make something of it. It all makes the place itself very interesting to the viewer even while Collin Farrell keeps going at it as being a s*** hole. Bruges may not make it to the top the viewers' favourite cities list but what makes it very fit for this film is its dull atmosphere and cloudy layout where morning scenes are as dark and gloomy as night ones; an essential element for shooting a black comedy.Evidently the strongest, most significant factor that makes In Bruges an anything but ordinary kind of film is its Oscar nominated screenplay. A rich flow of dialogues and random conversations, so irrelevant and so inappropriate sometimes that it daringly shows the awkward reality of different life situations usually acted out differently in the movies. This appears clearly in what I consider one of the most enjoyable phone conversations ever acted on the big screen; it's Harry (Fiennes) vs. Ken (Gleeson) talking about Bruges and how Ray (Farrell) feels about it. Even the excessive swearing and the use of the F word 126 times throughout the film help darken the dialogues and perfecting them for one of the most inspirational black comedies in the history of the genre.But there's always something special about any movie that's written and directed by the same person. When you take a closer look at In Bruges, you figure that Martin McDonagh has shown pure brilliance in directing his very own tight script. Having created the story himself, his presentation constantly gives a hint of pure originality in every scene. The dramatic depth of In Bruges is only deepened even more by what I believe to be the perfect cast; it's one of those rare movies where you think the writer thought of the actor even before the character itself was written. Farrell, Gleeson and Fiennes, each an acting phenomenon on his own, fill in their roles in a quite convincing manner; good enough to earn Collin Farrell a Golden Globe in 2008.In a nutshell, In Bruges is one deep sophisticated yet simple story, full of morals and symbols. It is funny, it is dark and it is fully entertaining. The piano score, the medieval city and the awkward conversations, all make it quite the ride, the kind of ride you don't miss.",

            "content": "I saw this movie having read good reviews and heard good things about it so initially I was a bit wary of it and didn't want to build it up too much. It was one of those films that I wasn't really too keen on seeing...but my only regret now is that i should have seen it sooner.The film is different to what the trailers make out especially the first two thirds but it is swiftly made up for in the final third. The script is brilliant and full kudos must go to the writer and director for bringing such a brilliant piece of art to the big screen, because art is what it is. From the characters to the city of Bruges itself and references to the whole film being set in some kind of purgatory.(Spoilers to follow) There is one scene where the characters brilliantly played by Brendan Gleeson & Colin Farrell are looking at a picture in an art gallery regarding that strange place in between Heaven & Hell, this picture completely sums up one of the main themes in the piece and is excellently portrayed as a foggy reality at the end of the movie in the back streets of Bruges.The story seems relatively simple; 2 hit men hiding out in Belgium awaiting a phone call from their boss (played fantastically well by Ralph Fiennes) just try to get through 2 weeks in the city. Brendan Gleeson's character wants to make the most of it and go sightseeing and Colin's Character is just so bored, all he wants to do is get drunk.It is the first half of the film that makes it really stand out for me, not saying that the second half is bad, because it's not, Ralph Fiennes owns the second half of the film with such forceful acting and brilliant dialogue that it completely changes the scope of the movie. The first half is so well written and so brilliantly funny. I wasn't laughing at first but after a little bit of getting to know the characters it became virtually hilarious at some points.Brendan Gleeson is one of the most underrated actors we have in the UK and I think that this is one of his best performance aside from maybe 'Gangs of New York' and I will always remember the look he had on his face after he'd taken a gram of cocaine, absolutely hilarious! the comedy is very well done and I implore you not to smirk throughout this film.Saying that there is some dark subject matter that is not to everyone's taste and it does get pretty violent toward the end but it is predominantly a film about hit men so you have to expect that. Some people won't necessarily like the ending but I thought it was very apt and made the film a perfect singular entity.In summary of the film, the acting is top notch with all three main performers outdoing themselves, the film is brilliantly conceived and directed. The mix of pure comedy & violence has a perfect equilibrium and it has some very memorable characters throughout.So if you wanna see a film involving hit men, scams, prostitutes, fat Americans, midgets, a hot pregnant woman & endless bizarre characters all superbly interweaved into an outstanding film with comedy & violence then I totally recommend this movie. An unexpected & oustanding experience. 9/10",

I rank this one right up there with films like fight club, lost in translation, and No country for old men. which i hold in high regard. On a final note does any1 else think that Bredan Gleeson should get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor? I do i was very impressed with his acting in this move. I felt that it was much better than it was in gangs of new york and way better than in the fifth harry potter film. Id like some other opinions on this so let me know.Aside from the acting I also enjoyed what i saw as an increase in realism when compared to other (American) films. Not realism in the sense that i thought the character Ken should have survived that amount of blood loss and a fall of somewhere around twelve stories, , let alone be able to mutter words and have them make sense. But the realism in that they did not curb anything for sake of getting a lower age rating. They said what they wanted too, and used an uncommon amount of blood when compared to many other films. Especially the last time Ken is shot and when he hits the pavement from the tower. Lastly did any1 else think that the costumes and scenery for the movie that was being filmed at the end was supposed to be a reference back to the painting that Ray and Ken discussed in the museum? Let me know your thought on the matter.",

I was not much of a fan of Farrel, and i have to admit this movie changed my whole perception of him,i can see him now like a true actor.The movie itself it's packed with a lot of dark humor,also with action and drama.

Being Farrel and Gleeson two irish hit mens working in London, and after a job went bad and told to hide in Bruges. Po\u00e9sy playing a local custom and builds a relationship with Farrel's character.

The first half is rather slow that you start wondering what the fuss is all about but the last twenty-something minutes is a really rewarding finish to this quite thought-provoking film. Colin Farrell plays a hit-man who is bothered by guilt because of the serious fuckup he commits on his first assignment. He is sent to Bruges together with a colleague to initially lie low for a while. As the plot unfolds and the real reason why they are in Bruges is uncovered, the story thickens as the audience begins to sympathize with the unusual leads. This film presents the much debated upon idea that no one is either purely good or just downright evil. It proves in very unlikely ways that even criminals have hearts and even the worst kind of people can be honorable. It is a very simple story that is worth a viewing and I guarantee that it won't leave your head even long after the credits are over.http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews",

The architecture and art is just great.In Bruges is a simple story-telling of a defect assassin who is not only placed on vacation. One who does not like art will not enjoy any sight- seeing. Well, it's portrayed on Ray's expression when Ken decides to visit places.Excellent film that you should watch if you have not!..Story encircles around Irish contract assassins Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are sent to Belgium city (of) in Bruges and told to wait for further instructions from their foulmouthed employer Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes).While Ken takes a stroll to visit historical and medieval buildings, with Ray feeling guilt-stricken over an accidental murder of a child.One night, while observing a film shoot with the dwarf actor Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), Ray stalked and made love with Chlo\u00eb (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy), a local drug dealer and a production assistant.Ken received a call from Harry and the order was to assassinate Ray but he is reluctant to do so until he saw Ray tried to put a bullet to his own head.

            "content": "When you think of a dark comedy you generally associate it with dark humor. However, in the case of In Bruges, it is the story and themes that are dark with the humor used as levity, unlike others which use it simply to get a laugh out of their film, the comedy in In Bruges serves a purpose.In terms of acting this movie is top-notch with all actors at the top of their game, namely Colin Farrell as Ray, Brandon Gleeson as Ken, and Ralph Fiennes as Harry. Every actor absolutely nails their roles and give truly convincing performances. On top of that, every character is multi-layered and interesting in their own unique way, Ray could've just been a mentally unstable whiny guy who didn't want to be in Bruges, but he was also a guilt-ridden suicide case who doesn't know if life is truly worth living anymore. Ken could've been just another old mentor figure, but he was also a conflicted man being forced to decide between what is right and wrong. Harry could've been just an easily- enraged menacing villain, but he was also an incredibly honor-driven man and a clearly loving father (to a certain extent). Even the side characters all add their own unique likability to the film. Huge props to this film for knowing how to create truly interesting and likable characters.Now that that's out of the way, let's get to what truly makes this film great: the themes explored in the dialogue. Despite technically being a comedy, like The Truman Show, this film is so much more than just something to laugh at. Themes explored include guilt, depression, suicide, death, morality, and even the meaning of life. This movie somehow manages to seamlessly blend all of these themes into it's narrative using the oldest trick in the book when it comes to exploring themes: dialogue. This movie has amazing dialogue between it's characters and truly makes them feel like real people by having them swear, use slang, and occasionally joke while discussing the themes mentioned above. A round of applause for Martin McDonagh, who wrote and directed the film and truly breathed life into his work.So to summarize, In Bruges is an absolutely incredible movie with interesting themes, fantastic performances, and very good direction. It's refreshing to see such a well made comedy which knows that humor alone is not what makes a movie great. Despite it's somewhat underrated status I consider this film to be a must-watch for anyone and everyone.The End",

I felt the need to write something because when I found out that this was the only long film of McDonagh, I felt rather disappointed. I was entranced by the sophistication of the film. I'm a filmaholic who watches at least one film everyday. What was so extraordinary with In Bruges that allured me so much? Was it the music? The city of Bruges? The characters? Or the humor which does not use cheap jokes? I really could not answer that question to myself, although I am a 4. year psychology student. I also feel a need to say something about Colin Farrell. I have seen some of his previous films. In all of them he tries to draw a male charisma like many pert Hollywood actors do. But in this film he becomes a real human being with all his weaknesses. Now, I started to respect him as a successful and modest actor. I hope McDonagh is reading these comments; because I really want many more films from him. I will be following you McDonagh! Of course, there will be some people who do not like your work, but if you continue to shoot your films in your original way you will have your fans like me.

The movie itself is a journey through both the city as well as the depth of human guilt and depravity. It includes romance and action, humor and tragedy.It definitely has its faults. The sequencing of gun fights near the end seemed to be built around what was convenient for the plot, not what would actually make any sense.

I loved in Bruges. I thought there really was nothing wrong with it. How the dark elements were incorporated into the film, as well as the mesmerizingly haunting soundtrack that just weaved into everything nice and well. Colin Farrell did surprisingly well, with his native Irish tongue it was all set up for him to nail the role. Brendan Gleeson does well in his role too. Ralph Fiennes does a stellar job, being cast as the boss Harry Waters, classically and stylishly encompassing the character. Blatantly or so, he is extremely comparable to Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast. The magnificence of the Belgian surroundings coupled with the soundtrack is what really brings this movie along. The screenplay is also equally matched if not better. I would recommend In Bruges to all who've seen one too many of the usual stuff. In the days of Transformers and 2012 and CGI, this is refreshingly engaging to those who appreciate the art of a good movie.",

            "content": "After the Oscar success of Six Shooter, and a great reputation as a play write, much was expected of Martin McDonagh's first feature film. He duly delivers with In Bruges, a fantastic film with commercial appeal that renews faith in British film.The story is simple, and on the surface may draw groans from people sick to death of British cinema's never-ending obsession with gangster films: two Irish criminals must lay low in Bruges for two weeks while the 'heat' from a bungled hit in London passes. As they wait on a phone call from their boss, one of the men is keen to explore this new town, making the most of his time there, while the other despairs at being in a place he compares to purgatory, failing to see the point in going round looking at buildings. All he wants to do is drink Belgian beer and wait it out. Meanwhile, in London, their boss (cockney gangster a la Don Logan) begins to reveal the real reason for sending them to this town...First of all, the location is master stroke. A picturesque town in Europe that not many will have heard of before, as the poster points out, below the title in brackets it says: (it's in Belgium). This is the first of many jokes delivered with aplomb. As for the acting and characters, at first i wasn't sure i was going to like Colin Farrel's character. He seemed ignorant, annoying and a little OTT, but he quickly grew on me, especially when his interest is finally sparked not by the prospect of sightseeing but instead by a midget on a film set. As more is revealed about his character, the more i liked him. As for Brendan Gleeson, who was also in Six Shooter, he is a very good actor, versatile and intelligent, he has a face that draws you in and keeps you comfortable. Ralph Fiennes as Harry, the boss with a clear code of ethics and conduct, is blatantly doing an impression of Don Logan from Sexy Beast, but he does a good job and by the end we find this is not only amusing but appropriate to the plot line. The other performance worthy of noting is that of Elizabeth Berrington, who plays the beautiful Dutch love interest for Colin Farrel. Her accent is convincing and her character is cheekily likable.The script is brilliant, full of jokes, satire and poignant moments. The story fizzes along and on reflection not a second of screen time seemed wasted. The plot ties everything in by the end, but refuses to end sympathetically. The final twenty minutes or so do become very dark, and those familiar with Six Shooter may not be surprised by this, or McDonagh's ability to retain the humour and believability despite the nasty things that occur. This is best demonstrated by the self-effacing humour as the film knowingly sends up previous gangster films whilst never really feeling too familiar.All in all, i went to see this expecting it to be good, and was happy to find it is better than that. The audience in the screening i attended also thoroughly enjoyed it, laughing all the way through and passing positive comments afterwards. I can't wait for Martin McDonagh's next film, it seems we Brits have another star director in the making.",

            "content": "Many critics' reviews of In Bruges have given somewhat faint praise to the film for freshening up a bit the dying genre of the glib gangster flick. But this does an incredible disservice to such an insightful and thought-provoking and big film as In Bruges. And it is a very big film, the biggest I've seen in years - a film of big ideas, and by contrast a film just as adept at meditations on the innumerable small details of real life. Its a film as big as life, and not bound by any easy comparison to any single identifiable film genre. Its even bigger than real life, delving effortlessly past the smug external demeanor of a young hoodlum and into the dreams and nightmares of his tortured soul. This is simply Colin Farrell's greatest role that I am personally aware of. Previously I thought he was just some sort of brooding poser, not to mention poofter (is that the Brit term?) - some sort of marketing-generated icon for the gays and gals, complete with scruffy fashion and face growth and cute accent. But after this role his sins are forgiven and he is redeemed, like his character is in Bruges. He immediately gets Sean Connery stature in my book. (Brendan Gleason is terrific as well.)But as to a reexamination of the gangster ethos in general, here is something quite remarkable. The film makes us to truly understand how that world is inherently a world of authority, no different than any other government. And the men that occupy that world kill other men only because they deserve to be killed, at least in the estimation of the authorities of that world who are to be obeyed. However, things like killing children and suicide are morally unconscionable to them just like they are to most people. And the men of that world are in fact real people, that need to be redeemed and are in fact redeemable - not in some simplistic revival meeting kind of way, but via a path as complex as circuitous as the world they have voluntarily chosen to inhabit, but a path that is ultimately compelling and believable. (In the process though, some of them with the strictest moral codes do not find salvation.) This is in such marked contrast to previous films like the Godfather, in which the Catholic Church for example is just an elaborate prop and backdrop exploited by proud and callous men to bolster a false appearance of stability and respectability. (Consider Michael Corleone staring stone-faced through his infant son's christening while having all his enemies whacked.) In Bruges truly humanizes gangsters in a way that has simply never been accomplished before in any other film. Is this Romanticism or Realism. It feels like the latter.But what is remarkable is how that emotional realism is achieved in the context of a vivid psychological and cinematic dreamscape of Bruges, a place that is nevertheless quite real, a cloistered world existing in a modern one - oh well I could pile on some more metaphors, but its late. Great flick though. Really great. A lot greater than many brain-dead critics in the external reviews above give it credit for. So many great scenes - Farrell gazing out from the train as he leaves Bruges, at a dismal marsh-strewn landscape with overcast skies, a landscape reflecting the state of his own soul; the young boy accidentally killed while waiting for the priest, still clutching his hand-printed list of sins to confess: \"1) Being moody; 2)Being bad at maths; 3)Being too sad;\" And yet throughout the film the unforced humor that emerges time after time in spite of all this. Its a film of vast range and ambition, its such an inexplicable disservice to compare it to a self-conscious genre flick like Pulp Fiction. (Not to say Pulp Fiction is bad.) Maybe this film is better watched alone than in a drunken crowd at Sundance, I don't know. Four out of four stars.",

            "content": "Every budding film maker seems to cut his feature teeth on a hit man movie. In fact, I've always thought hit man movies should be in their own genre. Instead, they fall into the action/adventure category.In Bruges (pronounced like the sled, luge) is it's own kind of hit man movie. It breaks new ground in much the same way Pulp Fiction and The Professional did. But while Pulp Fiction is about cartoon characters who love to act 'cool' and hear themselves talk (can you tell I'm not a Tarantino fan?), and The Professional relies on the Lolita effect and blatant sentimentality for it's characterization (it still worked for me), In Bruges is filled with real humanity and real drama. It takes very, very few cheap shots, and those it does take seem to be the film maker winking at classic cinematic conventions.This doesn't mean the story is completely free of plot devices and such. There are McGuffins and other devices in all hit man movies. In Pulp Fiction it was the briefcase, in The Professional, the plant, to name just two. I won't give away the device in In Bruges but you'll know it immediately when you see it.The two main characters, played by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, the hit men, are not meant to be likable, but we empathize with them because of each one's emotional struggle. I like this about the movie. Bad characters doing bad things, and yet we feel for them because of what they're going through. However, not all the characters have the same emotional wallop. The two female characters aren't as deep, and one of them, Chloe, isn't the least bit likable to this viewer. Also, the character Harry, played by Ralph Fiennes, suffers slightly from a lack of screen time.I guessed the final resolution about five minutes before it arrived, and you'll probably see it coming, too. That's OK. You don't have to be entirely surprised by this movie to appreciate it.Lastly, I'm glad the writer/director edited out the scenes on the disk labeled \"deleted scenes.\" The movie was much better leaving the audience to fill in the blanks on the individual back stories.",

As the title says In Bruges, the story is set in a medium-sized Belgium town with a very rich historical background, an earthly paradise for tourists of a more \"cultural\" type. Just one of the last places on earth where you would put a story that involves professional hit men.\"Bruges dangerous\" doesn't seem to make any sense, but there are enough elements thrown in that make this concept work so well, you almost wish to go there someday for yourself. But let's face it, off-screen Bruges itself must really be kind of boring if you are not a \"cultural\" fan, that's why it is apt to throw in American dwarfs, movie scenes, prostitutes, drug dealers, some of the crudest humor you can think of, etc, all that to go with those Gothic churches and make the story more exciting to follow.But what also makes it appealing is that our two protagonists, especially Farrel with his bleak feelings, almost couldn't blend better with the cold, dark and depressive atmosphere of the town. But like most good comedies this film also builds it's story on certain contrasts. And the main contrasts that seems to exists is this notion of hit men that have a sort of a conscience, which is what it's all about. And I have to say that at times this idea does seem a little unbelievable, but without it the bleakness and guilt would disappear, the atmosphere wouldn't have it's effect and the story would have to be mostly rewritten.Yet this is clearly not a motion picture for everyone, since the R rating is very much in place. It isn't always a plus, because there seems to be just a scene or two that is almost ridiculously violent and that mildly spoils the otherwise very, very thoughtful story.",

I wasn't terribly impressed with Martin McDonough's Oscar-winning short film Revolver, but, based on the buzz, I figured In Bruges was worth a look. I was very mistaken in my assumptions. This is an absolutely fantastic movie. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are both phenomenal, and Ralph Fiennes, though he only appears halfway through the film, is perfect as a hard-edged crime boss with a short fuse. Colin Farrell tends to catch a lot of guff for his performances, but I have always found him to be a very talented actor. He may not always choose the best roles, but in everything that I've seen him in he has engaged me as a viewer. Here, his work is superb. He nails everything about the character of Ray, and is utterly believable as a hit-man wrestling with his demons. Clemence Poesy is good as well, and obviously very beautiful and enigmatic, though her character wasn't as fully fleshed out as I would have liked. Bruges makes a gorgeous backdrop for the action of the film, and having recently returned from Belgium myself (not Bruges, however, though now I wish I'd gone there), the charm of the country and the overwhelming sense of history is captured perfectly. The fairytale town is not only beautiful, but its atmosphere and the palpable sense of medieval ideals are essential to the central ideas of the story. And what a story it is. In my opinion, the script is the strength of this film. Thematically, emotionally, and narratively, this script is firing on all cylinders. McDonough does a fantastic job of connecting the characters not only through their actions, but through the dramatic tension inherent in maintaining proximity with people whom you may not really like. The relationship that evolves between Ray and Ken is brilliant, and the secondary characters fill in the gaps admirably. The sense of sacrifice and redemption is handled very well, and at no point do the actions taken by the characters feel forced or unrealistic. Nor do their interactions with one another feel overly expository. Everything is very even-handed, and McDonough has crafted one hell of a well-balanced. The trailers lead one to believe that this is a sort of noir/comedy. It is, in a sense, and there are many funny parts, but there are some very serious themes presented here. Hell, guilt, redemption, and sacrifice are the themes that drive the story, and Martin McDounough's ability to inject humor into very serious subject matter is part of what makes this film so successful. Overall, a great movie, and an exceptionally original piece of film-making.",

He is what happens when potential and opportunity do NOT cross paths. We are given no real background on any of the characters, only this slice of their lives,but sophistication isn't required here. We see the essence of wastrelism in Ray. The inevitable Greek tragedy of Ken, Ken who should (and does!) know better. In Harry we see the kind of principled villainy that is wierdly common i.e. the bank robber who would never steal a car or say, the rapist who would never stiff a waitress for a tip. Ken and Ray, a fine pair of Irishmen, work for a good fellow named Harry. Ken is the greater tragedy of this comi-tragic and even occasionally sublime duo. This movie speaks of basic humanity in some pretty base humans. There are lines even drunken little people should not cross. Even medieval tower docents can go too far. Elephants do not belong in towers and pompous Canadians do get their beaks bent occasionally. Hookers it turns out may be found in brothels. How bizarre but strangely real this film is. Unfortunately, as seems to be the case in reality, the innocent victims are incidental because the guilty ones are so much more interesting. The real question asked by great film is \"who are we?\" This Movie asks us again from a fresh perspective.Colin Farrell finally cast well! Fine acting throughout. 9.5 out of ten for pacing. A modern masterwork; Near poetic. Let's see what our new film maker does next. His own will be a hard act to follow.",

            "content": "In Bruges is an impressive feature length debut by playwright Martin McDonagh. Its spot-on pace sparkles with intelligent dialogue and black humour. Within minutes, I felt I knew the principal characters, Irish hit men Ken and Ray (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell), for years, and felt drawn in like an invisible third protagonist to join them on their Leffe-fuelled strolls along the Gothic canals.The titular city functions more than a mere cinematographic backdrop. It evolves with the plot, becoming more otherworldly and menacing as the pitch of impending doom heightens, reaching its crescendo in the final scene as Ray stumbles into the living canvas of Bosch's Last Judgement.It appears obligatory for smart movies these days to reference cult cinema, and In Bruges does contain several such nods, including a recurring homage to Nic Roeg's Don't Look Now, itself referenced in the dialogue. This is does not unduly distract, merely reinforces McDonagh's anchorage in the fabric of unnerving European cinema.Many will principally remember this movie for its laugh-out-loud surrealism, such as the ketamine-stoned, racist dwarf. Yet beneath the buoyant dialogue and memorable set pieces lies a convincing morality tale. The choices and questions effortlessly posed here are no less serious than those in more self-conscious and ponderous recent redemption tales. I actually found myself pausing the movie at one point to ask myself what I would do in a situation.With Tarrantino firing blanks these days, I for one would be delighted to see McDonagh establish himself as the modern champion of smart, edgy cinema.",

Colin Farrell's acting was way too forced and over-the-top for me, he seemed like he had to try way to hard, I found it distracting.

I hardly re-watch any movies this is one of the few I do rewatch every other year. It has everything you could ask for: humour, love, thought, action and nice visuals.In Bruges takes the dust of the gangster-genre by putting in more of a connection to the viewer. We get to see shootouts, drugs and prostitutes, punches being thrown around, etc. yes, but what we also get are relateable character, which actions and motives are quite relateable. It has a quite enjoyable sense of humour that is never misplaced, which i imagine is very difficult in such a violent and emotional movie. The leadroles all do an amazing job and help a lot to understand what the characters are feeling.The love-story isnt that deep and rich, but absolutely makes sense in the movie. It is believable and you do want to see it flourish, so it absolutely serves its purpose in the plot.The location is amazing, the words \"fairytale town\" are used several times and that pretty much describes it pretty well. The way it is shot and the time of the year (christmas) add a romantic, but also cold and lonely touch to it (lonely because bruges is \"a shithole\"). The fairy tale theme is woven not only into the visuals, but also some parts of the story can remind you of a fairy tale.Soundtrack is another aspect I love about this movie, just like the plot, the location and the character Ray, it adds to the feeling of this sad, yet beautiful tale.To top it off, we get some stuff to ponder over. Atonement is a big deal here. Where is the line between good and evil, what should you do if you did something horrible and so on. All this is blended together so well, that it has been one of my favorite movies for about 7 years now and Im planning on watching it again some time.",

            "content": "I started watching this with my usual scepticism: \"Probably yet another Brit Gangster movie attempting to tread where much better has gpne before\" I thought. Well, not in such words, but that sums up my expectation.I soon realised how far from the case this is. The movie is quite original. The characters are compelling. The script is of that quality you do not notice because it seems totally natural. The acting from the trio of leads is of course excellent but also from the unfamiliar supporting cast. The originality really hit with the contrast between the almost \"Carry On\" characters and the realisation of what they do and one of them has done. Not depicted flippantly, as in the typical crimeland flick, but with cold honesty.This dissonance between comical absurdity and moral darkness is shocking and disorientating. It is the main force in the story. It isn't a flash in the pan either, but is developed cunningly as the ethical maze of arguments, actions, intentions and jumbled consequences unfolds.Truly, this is a movie that is both comical and yet philosophically profound within the ambit of complete realism. Just one scene on its own poses a question most of us will never before have considered: can a mans moral debts be paid by the taking of his life without that being by his own hand? If that puzzles you, just watch the movie.Of course, no movie is perfect. One thing that slightly diminishes the freshness of the movie is that Fiennes character tends to remind one of that played by Ben Kingsley in \"Sexy Beast\". In fact, his manner of speech seems almost identical. Nonetheless, it works in context and, as with other aspects of the movie, produces both comedy and profundity. I think the appearance of movie extras echoing the visions of Bosch could have been bolder. One characters ultimate leap was the one thing a bit far-fetched, not because he would not have attempted it but in that it worked out as intended. On the other hand, the way the loose change used in that scene was \"primed\" in our thoughts earlier was maybe the best example of this technique I've ever noticed.I was staggered to discover that this was the directors first full piece.",

Most interestingly, In Bruges appears common and accessible at times, but when everything seems predictable, we are thrown a curve-ball that gives the movie a certain edge and an ever present blanket of dark comedy that permeates all characters, most especially Ray, played by Colin F. Bruges, a medieval city in Belgium, is presented to us as a blend of old and new. Its locals and its buildings set the background, while the characters upfront stand out like sore thumbs within a \"fairy tale\" place as it is often described. Hidden within the comedy is a very dramatic script that deals with feelings of regret, suicide, murder and love but that never seems burdensome or hard to watch. Especially important to the development of the story is the character of Brendan Gleeson who has come to Bruges not knowing it will be a crucial moment in his life, a setting that will allow him to reevaluate his values and make decisions that go against all that he has done in the past. Ken seeks for redemption, even when he knows he is already condemned and we see the interesting transformation on the screen. Despite its crafty mix of comedy and drama, In Bruges falls short as it delivers an ending that over-relies in unnecessary action and unsubstantial dialogue. It is the typical case of a story that needs to end but does not know how. There is no better example of this that the final scene and the predictable cyclical ending we are given.",

The structure was fine and the whole movie was rushed or stretched, the writer managed to blend the action and drama together to create a film just right in length and tone. Onto characters, throughout the 1st and 2nd act of the movie we see the bond between our two main characters build and by the third we see them fallout and a situation follows, that i won't spoil. Onto directing, the scenes where we just got to look at Bruges was just perfect, every angle just matched up with the scene, i really felt the connection to the movie, In Bruges deserves praise for its efforts.

Holed up in a the shitty little town of Bruges after a hit goes wrong you can see that the character of Ray is too large for such a small town. Brendan Gleeson brings us one of the best characters I've seen him play in a long time as Ken the professional hit-man acting more along the lines of a father figure to Ray. In Bruges is one of the freshest pieces of British cinema i've witnessed since Sexy Beast and we all know the two main reasons that film was fantastic but in this the angry English hit-man/gangster type role is left to the ever great Ralph Fiennes playing Harry, who's psychotic and ruthless persona sets up for a fantastic villain. Kudos to Farrell, Gleeson and Fiennes for bringing us such an a brilliant piece of film and to the director for making one of the best British flicks of 2008.",

Indeed, already begin interpreting the duo Ray (Colin Farrell) / Ken (Brendan Gleeson) works well and both players have very good chemistry, as is also too rare. And what is cast, the supporting actors are all so well written and not allow for accounts (such as Jimmy (Jordan Prentice) who has a key role in the denouement of the plot), in fact each character is here to advance the story, no one is left behind at the plot or set listed regarding dialogs tasty (Ralph Fiennes and his foul language is an important effect on this) The relationship between Ray and Ken, to return to the duo gave me the impression of a father / son. And it is felt more gradually as the plot or advance, Ken knew very well \"evil\" that eats Ray wants this trip to change his ideas to start and then eventually the cure of that evil in his own risk, as a father to his son. A city of fairy tale to include Ralph Fiennes in a moment of the film with this story of impossible love between Ray and Chloe, with her hero (Ken) loan has defied any danger to nothing happens to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (Ray), and this gallery of colorful characters have said that this city was ideal because it is indeed a modern fairy tale that we are witnessing.

Their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), instructs them to travel to Bruges and await further instructions while hiding out in the medieval town, since Ray has made a terrible, life-changing mistake on the job. \"In Bruges\" is listed virtually everywhere as \"comedy\", but a slightly-more-than-superficial viewer might have something to say about that. In fact, the film is actually a complex fresco of slapstick comedy, intense mob drama, Gothic phantasmagoria and, to top it all off, grotesque extravaganza. What makes this film so unique and superb is an (apparently) unlikely combination of genres in one unfathomable, original, hilarious and outrageous script, wrongfully devoid of an Oscar. Most of the time you forget that Ken and Ray are Irish mobsters rather accidental tourists and Farrell plus Gleeson plus Fiennes equals comedic virtuosity. Colin Farrell graces us with the best performance of his entire career, full of immeasurable depth and versatility, while Brendan Gleeson watches over him with paternal warmth and veteran excellence. Ralph Fiennes rounds out the main cast as a foul-mouthed, shamefully funny and overly memorable mob-boss, thus proving his exquisite range as an actor. There is one member of the cast who is not mentioned as such, but nevertheless acquires fundamental importance: that is, of course, the town of Bruges, exuding its ancient history from every inch of the screen and wrapped in Eigil Bryld's marvellous cinematography, which gives it an aura of mysticism and mystery seldom achieved in films. Carter Burwell's full-bodied and profound score underlines the dramatic aspects of the story, which crawl almost unnoticed during the first part of the film only to explode with violent and bloody vigour in the second one and culminate into a suspenseful finale. Overall, this subtle operation is not a dish for the weak-hearted or the intellectually obtuse, as it conjures up an emotional journey which requires full involvement, suspension of disbelief and, most importantly, intellectual openness, a trait rarely found in contemporary audiences.",

Ray, Ken, and Harry all acknowledge that the death of the child was wrong, but the question preoccupying the film is how to atone for the sin -- Ray and Harry are Old Testament, eye for an eye guys; Ken is a New Testament scion, he believes in penance and potential for renewal.Harry and Chloe are the gods of the story. Chloe in that she sells drugs to the film stars and then to the real stars, her influence permeating both worlds, providing the bridge between the two. Harry is the disembodied voice commanding and directing until Ken defies him and he takes corporeal form in the third act. It's a n episodic film, mainly in respect to Harry's plot line, which reinforces the fact that these souls are on a journey.The miniature (pun intended) film within the film is a great self-referential touch -- Tom DiCillo would be especially proud.

I implore you to watch this and then watch Seven Psychopaths as they are both masterclasses on how to write an engaging plot with great character development.The plot then centres around two assassins, Ray and Ken, who go to Bruges after a hit goes wrong. There they take in the sights and await further instructions. All hell breaks when Ken is asked to kill Ray. I will not ruin anything else for you dear reader I will just say that things develop quite well and the pacing is solid. Some of the best scenes in this film are just of Ray and Ken talking to each other and the banter they have. Colin Farrell is excellent in this film and plays Ray really well. There are scenes where he goes from joking with Ken straight into crying about bad things he has done. These scenes show off the talent he has as an actor and really gets you invested in Ray and the tortured soul he is. I always say a mark of a good actor is if he can cry convincingly and Farrell does this really well. Another great performance is Brenden Gleeson who plays Ken really well. His character is as tortured as Ray and it really shows in the performance Gleeson gives. He is more the serious type in this film whereas Ray definitely is the comic relief. That is not to say he has no funny lines, everyone in this film does, but you can tell he is the straight man. Ralph Finnes as Harry is brilliant and his character, being the main antagonist, moves the plot a long at a reasonable pace. He has great lines like the first scene he is in the \"you're an inanimate fu**ing object!!\" scene which is to me one of the funniest and best put downs i've seen in a film. It's is delivered so well be Finnes that the scene really gets you invested in his character from the start and you realise that he is a well-meaning bad guy. The actual cinematography of the film is great and gives you a real sense of Bruges as a place and setting. In fact the way it is shot gives the impression that Bruges is not just a place but an actual character in the movies as well. It gives a tone of old European cities so well in fact that I might have a holiday there in the future. In a time when most Hollywood films have a boring tone it is refreshing to see good tone and cinematography. The music in this film is not very prevalent but it really doesn't have to be. What makes this film good is the dialog and look of the film, not the music which is only in the background and not at all the main focus of any scene in the film. The music is only there to enhance certain scenes and that is all we need it to do. The jokes are fu*king hilarious and clever in this film, honestly there are scenes in this film that had me crying with laughter. The American tourist joke with the stairs is genius and a great bit of social commentary on fat annoying American tourists and their stereotypical mannerisms whilst abroad. The best thing is that while these funny scenes and jokes are very entertaining they do not distract from any characters development. The jokes enhance the characters, for example Ray is a funny character with some great comedic lines but it doesn't take away from the fact that he has done wrong in his life and you as the audience feel his repentance at all the bad things he has done. This film is just brilliant and well worth a watch it goes without saying. However the main thing that I found a problem with, and it is a little problem, is the lack of effort the supporting cast gives. The midget was not a very well rounded character and Chloe was not very inspiring as the \"lead female\" character. In fact the pregnant woman who owns the hotel was better, acting wise, than her.I think this film is brilliant with a great cast, for the most part, and a great story that is told in a clearly presented way. The plot and characters make it so much more emotional that it becomes more than a comedy film. I can't say enough good words about the script and I really do look forward to 2018s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri which is the next film Martin McDonagh has written. I would advise you to watch any film he has done as you will be entertained.",

I saw this the day it was released in Ireland in a less than half full screen in the middle of the day and everyone of us was laughing away together in a shared experience of what will no doubt be a classic, Irish roller-coaster ride of a film.(Christ, I even wanted to go to Bruges by the end of it..)",

We begin to recognize the structural tropes and anticipate the twists and turns before they make an appearance on screen. Vigorous attempts of movie makers fall flat before our indifferent eyes. It has been my problem for a while now. And then this movie, In Bruges, came along with its simple premise and, after a long time, I was immersed in a movie experience. The plot is simple enough. Two contract killers complete a hit job assigned to them and, obeying the orders from their boss, come to the Dutch town called Bruges, apparently to lay low for a while. Younger one Ray (Collin Farrell) seems like he has not yet hardened enough to fit comfortably into the mold of his job. Older one Ken (Brendan Gleeson) has already come to terms with the demands of his profession. He treats Ray like his kid brother and is very indulgent towards Ray's constant complaints and bickering over their having to spend time in this ancient and dull Bruges. This irritableness of Ray is later established to have a deeper source for a reason. He has a guilt upon his conscience too heavy for his professional experience\u2013that of accidentally killing a boy during a botched hit job. This guilt drives his thoughts towards death. But what he doesn't know yet is that that is the very fate for the fulfillment of which he was sent to Burges. Even Ken doesn't realize it until an order to kill Ray comes to him from the boss. What Kevin does, and the later consequences, consist the rest of the story. This movie is a marvel of storytelling. It reminds us again what little details are enough to make a compelling story. It creates its own world the rules of which barely correspond with the real or even cinematic worlds that we are accustomed to. Every image and event are premeditated and accounted for. And the setting of Bruges is interwoven so skillfully within the screenplay that it becomes an active character itself. I stumbled upon this movie without realizing that the director is the same person who later went on to made Seven Psychopaths, another movie that I loved very much. I've observed many people comparing Martin McDonagh with Tarantino, but I think this director is going his own way and doing his own thing. He is added to my list of directors whose IMDb accounts I keep checking to see if they are making anything new.",

            "content": "The three main characters in this film speak in torrents of obscenities, well known words for sexual intercourse and contempt and female genitalia and contempt. In real life, I think badly of people who talk this way and try to stay away from them. In the movie that Martin McDonagh wrote and directed, however, the repetitious obscenities take on an almost magical quality as they reveal layers within the characters who speak them. The effect is like that in some of Michael McClure's poems in which common words are continually repeated. The result is not to build metaphors or similes but to develop weight by simple presence.At first, the beautiful old Belgian city of Bruges seems an entirely wrong place for the two Irish gangsters who are sent to it after one of them botches the killing of a priest by shooting and killing a child as well. Ken and Ray, both hired killers, are sent by Harry, their gangster boss. Harry has pleasant childhood memories of Burges and his subordinates speculate that he thinks it's a good place for them to cool out. Ken, an experienced assassin, likes Bruges and is ready to be a serious European tourist. Ray, young and petulant, can't say \"Bruges\" without a preliminary obscenity and says he hates being there.As the men tour the city's well-preserved medieval structures, they visit the Groeninge Museum and view two paintings that capture even Ray's attention. One is Hieronymus Bosch's Last Judgment with its many images of torment. The lower portion of the middle panel of the triptych is what is shown in the film, representing Judgment Day. It is full of nude human figures, many of them pierced by swords and arrows. A large knife emerges from a plant held by an ape in the panel's lower right-hand corner. The other, more realistic, painting is of the Judgment of Cambyses by Gerard David. It is a portion of an 15th century Netherlandish diptych that depicts Sisammes, an ancient Greek judge mentioned by Herodotus, being flayed alive as punishment for allowing money to influence his judgments. Several men are cutting Sisammes's skin from his body. His teeth are clenched but he is not screaming. His torturers calmly go about their business and are viewed indifferently by a group of well-outfitted aristocrats.The paintings are more than background to the film's action; they are physical representations of the turmoil within Ken's and Ray's souls, similar to the torments in Dante's Inferno. Ultimately, McDonagh is a Catholic moralist, though it is easy to miss this aspect of his work as it is so often overshadowed by his eccentric mixture of cleverness and repulsive violence.Ken continues to visit old buildings and museums and Ray has adventures appropriate to his station in criminal life. He exchanges insults with a dwarf, arranges a liaison with a beautiful local woman drug dealer, and blinds a Russian in one eye with a blank bullet. Then Ken gets a call from Harry ordering him to kill Ray. It seems that Harry doesn't approve of Ray's having murdered a kid. Ken doesn't like it but he's a company man who follows his boss's orders. When he approaches Ray from the back with a drawn gun, he sees that Ray's about to shoot himself. Ken can't help himself from stopping Ray. He calls Harry. Harry cusses him out and takes a train to Burges. Thus begins a bloodbath that's probably the least interesting part of the film. Except for Ray, all of the major characters and some secondary ones end up dead, as in Hamlet on steroids.The extreme violence of McDonagh's film has consequences, like the violence in Before the Devil Knows You're Dead and unlike the violence in The Departed. Still, the unreality of much of it and the total absence of any law enforcement response take suspension of disbelief further than many viewers may be willing to go. And the film has a stagy quality, both in the way in which characters appear at just the right moment for a bloody denouement and in McDonagh's inability to abandon the proscenium arch. Fundamentally though, I don't always like McDonagh's work but I can't deny its power.",

The relationship between Ray (Farrel) and Ken (Gleeson) is illustrated excellent in the movie. The characters are real and you can feel with them. To create characters in movies isn't easy, but this is one of the most important elements, that make a film, a 'film'. And this is made successful in this picture, which let's hope more from Martin McDonagh as a film director.The tension in the beginning of the film is very important. It gives the viewer the chance to discover the two hit men. But when you get to know, that Ken's mission is to kill Ray the real tension begins. And at this point, in an old town like Bruges, which is like a fairy tale: the fairy tale begins. I recommend this picture to everyone. One of the big films of the last years. You'll be not bored and you'll enjoy this piece of thrilling storytelling.",

            "content": "Isn't anyone else getting tired of movies that seek to psychoanalyze hit men? From Leon to Collateral, what makes cinema's hired assassins tick has provided mileage for many a screenwriter. The more we are secluded from violence and crime, the more our fictional fascination with hit men and gangsters as agents of retribution and honour has perversely increased. In Bruges, I think, belongs to this trend, allegorizing its ethical concerns through Hieronymus Bosch's famous 15th Century triptych The Last Judgement: a demented vision of damnation which, in the movie's final scenes, spills out onto the screen in the form of a surreal backstreet carnival.The problem with these studies is that film-makers are chasing their own shadow: because cinema created the amoral hit-man, his character has no real-world location, and no portrayal of him will ever be fully convincing.Martin McDonagh's script, for better or worse, barely dips its feet into this psychological subject matter, and Farrell's turpitude is only suggested by his despicable acts of violence. Those aside, he and Gleeson seem like thoroughly likable blokes and serve well as foils to one another. Had the film been an out-an-out comedy, their routine would have worked admirably, but time and time again it oscillates toward a half-baked moral agenda - which only serves to disrupt the tone of the movie. This is yet another film showing how the combination of gangland gore and comedy - perfected in Guy Richie's early work - is so difficult to pull of satisfyingly.In Bruges is, consequently, an odd film that leaves an uneven impression. By no means without laugh-out-loud moments of gallows humour, it retains that penchant for self-deprecation and the absurd characteristic of British comedy. Bruges itself is naturally gorgeous. But nothing ever really rings true; the various themes of the story are not adequately developed, and the script barely scratches the surface of its dysfunctional characters, essentially a gallery of grotesques. It is perhaps fitting that the audience is left in a sort of interpretative limbo - Bosch would certainly have approved.",

Who would want to film a movie in our little city? Martin McDonagh, it seemed. We were all so very excited. It was very rare for a Flemish city to be picked as a location for a blockbuster movie.My work was in the hart of the city so I passed the set almost every day and I even did some extra work on it. By then we had also heard that Colin Farrel, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes would be in it and we were all thrilled to welcome them. Girls from local schools were saying they got Colin's phone number, girls who said they had a drink with Colin and he tried to seduce them, saying they'd met Brendan and Ralph in the street... it was everyday talk. I didn't believe much of it until I met them myself. They were just about to film the outside scene at the Belfry tower, and as I passed I just waved and... Brendan and Ralph waved back. Me and my stupid head went to them and asked \"How's filming' going?\" and to my utter amazement they just answered politely \"Very well thanks, although it is rather cold\".I recently saw the full version of the film and it is great to see how good it was. They really did a great job on making Bruges look enchanting, but in fact it always does. I think that they didn't have a lot of work to 'make' it beautiful. It already is. The script was great and the casting sublime. If you haven't seen it yet, go out to the cinema or buy the DVD. You won't regret.

The trailers would have you believe it's a madcap jape, when in reality it's dark as hell but shot through with a brilliantly judged jet-black humor that makes it a pretty unique watch. It's not often a film this sombre will have you rolling in the aisles, and it's a tricky thing to do right, but \"In Bruges\" nails it seemingly effortlessly.It also looks beautiful, what with the location being pretty damn gorgeous and Colin Farrell (despite popular opinion) is a great actor when he's given a decent script to flex his muscles with. If there's any justice people will cotton on to this and forget \"SWAT\" ever existed.It only starts to dip ever so slightly with the appearance of Ralph Fiennes, but that's just because you're having such a good time watching Colin Farrell drink, snort and insult his way around Bruges that you almost forget there's a plot, so when it appears it feels almost intrusive.That feeling doesn't last long though, such is the film's deft balancing of tone, meaning that even once the laughs give way to the more serious stuff, you're invested sufficiently in the characters that the finale packs a hell of a punch, rounding off a brilliant experience and one of the best films you're likely to see this year.",

The plot twists and turns as crazily but purposefully as the streets of the medieval city in which it is set. The acting is spot on throughout--the actors clearly enjoying the jokes--and in several scenes the writer/director manages to draw breathtakingly exquisite comedy from the most apparently serious conversations. If you're going to kill a man in an alcove, you want to know you're using the right word, after all. This is actually one of the best movies ever made, and represents a signal achievement. Odd that it didn't get more recognition than it did, but its subject matter and strange humor may have just been too taut to allow comparisons with 2001 or The Godfather. It's not quite as good as the former (though almost), and a lot better than the latter. Puts Citizen Kane in the shade, which is like spending three hours, well, in Bruges.",

He's technically quite correct as a director, although there are some worrying choices in that department too, like the rather too long sightseeing sequences of Bruges that sometimes feel like you're watching a travel documentary instead of a movie.And the dialogues, oh boy. They are trying so hard to be funny, smart and witty, a la Tarantino, but they fail miserably. Some of the stuff, like the \"midget\" discussing whose side he'd be on if a war between dwarfs was to start (sorry, I can't remember the silly, unfunny details) are downright embarrassing, and so are other bits during the whole movie. The story-telling is not exactly brilliant either.Brendan Gleeson is quite good, Farrell is annoying as hell, and Fiennes overdoes it a bit too much.Not worth your time or your money. Avoid!",

            "content": "Hit men Ray and Ken have been told to lay low and await orders in Bruges, a city in Belgium, after a job gone wrong. While Ken is happy to relax and sightsee, Ray could not be unhappier. Of course, aside from the fact that Ray does not care for the cultural offerings of their surroundings, he is also dealing with past wrongdoings that play heavily on his conscience.While this may sound like the makings of a dour story (not that there's anything wrong with dour stories; I love them), I do not think any film has made me sad and then laugh in immediate succession without devolving into parody. This movie may be the only one that has, and does so more than once. Indeed, I sometimes laughed whilst I was sad, and rather than the integrity of the scene being ruined, I was confounded; should I be laughing or crying? I say \"without devolving into parody\" because some films unintentionally make light of the more downbeat moments, thus detracting from them. In Bruges does not fall into this trap. Yes, the film can be classified as a black comedy and yes, much of the (often very dark) humour is amongst the funniest I've come across in my time watching films. However, the more serious portions of the film, which mostly deal with Ray's struggle with his guilt, are truly sincere and heartfelt.Colin Farrell gives a truly great performance. He makes it easy to sympathise with Ray; you really feel sorry for him. It seems to me that Farrell generally is not given the respect he deserves as an actor. This maybe more a reflection of the roles he chooses rather than his ability. If you don't like Colin Farrell, watch In Bruges and maybe you'll change your mind.Brendan Gleeson, as always, is excellent as the older Ken. Ken may be a hit-man but it's hard to believe due to his warm, amiable and gentle nature. At the same time, Gleeson also manages to bring a certain gravity to the role; notwithstanding his trade, Ken could very well be a role model for a young man, at least in terms of his mannerisms. Ken is like a father figure to Ray; he genuinely cares for Ray's wellbeing.The foul-mouthed character of Harry- Ray's and Ken's boss- is played by, well, I won't say; if you do not know already, it's better to find out when you watch the film. Perhaps you'll be surprised. Even though we only hear Harry over the phone for the first half or more of the film, he exudes a strong presence.None of the main characters (I refer to Ray, Ken and Harry) are truly despicable; yes, they've committed evil deeds and are deeply flawed, however, they all have their principles (many of them actually honourable) and stick to them. This instils respect in one's heart for the characters, if not unreserved love (but how can you not love Ken?).The film also looks very good. The night-time scenes in particular stand out, especially the ones with fog. You might say \"it's like a\u0085 fairy-tale or something\".Last but not least is the dark and pensive score by Carter Burwell, which exemplifies the themes of guilt and redemption and really underscores Ray's anguish. Burwell is fast becoming one of my favourite composers.In Bruges is a dark film imbued with much humour, pathos and humanity. It succeeds because of its characters. It is one of my favourite films, and I hope you feel the same after watching it.",

The chemistry between Gleeson and Farrell was remarkable, and the introduction of Fiennes into the affair is downright brilliant. Acting wise, Gleeson gave the best performance of his career, while Fiennes unleashed his inner beast out (reminded me of Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast). Of course, the film is somewhat risqu\u00e9, but ultimately it just works out so well. It's shame that not too many people saw it, because this movie's potential is just so amazing. Alas, these little gems are overlooked by the critics, but in the heart of the fans, the movie's brilliance takes center stage.

His dialog and facial expressions provide much of the comedy in this film.The setting - Bruges, Belgium - makes for quaint and romantic scenery somewhat at odds with the brutish storyline which only adds to the quirk. Brendan Gleeson is classic as always, fueling the comedic fires even when they burn black.This film exceeded all my expectations and is definitely up there with Guy Ritchie films like Snatch. Like those films though, you might need subtitles even if you're an English speaker given those thick Irish accents.",

You really get a feeling how Bruge is as a small town with personality. But the thing that makes this movie is the characters. The 2 main hit men and the way they interact with each other is so believable, although very strange. You should definitely see this at the cinema!A must see!",

This combination is so unique that at first it even feels wrong! And some time after that it still feels weird... But it's a good weird.Colin Farell is absolutely amazing here. He's character is potrayed in such convincing way. His weirdness, his emotions, trauma he's going through, his mixed feelings about pretty much everything at this point. Then Clemence Poesy matches his weirdness really well and with Brendan Gleeson as the calm one, responsible one, who tries to enjoy his time in Bruges, it all feels complete. Unfortunately, I don't feel like Ralph Fiennes' character was needed here... Still he gave us an absolutely great scene on the top of the tower. It loved every second of it.Even though I wasn't so convinced all the time throughout this movie, it will definitely stay woth me for much longer than most of the popular ones nowadays.",

            "content": "Massive spoilers ahead. If you haven't seen it, STOP READING. Instead, go buy the film right now. Considering the average score and my rating, you know it can't be bad.In Bruges is an amazing film on so many levels. Basically, it's about two Irish hit men, Ray and Ken, working in London. They f#\u00a4k up a job BIG TIME and they are forced to hide out in Bruges by their boss, Harry. So far, nothing groundbreaking. It seems like a standard action comedy flick. But it's only so much more than that. I'd say it's a comedy drama because of all the funny moments and amazingly witty dialog and the subject of the movie, which is dead serious. That's the perfect blend in my opinion - you get humor and seriousness, but those two opposites enhance each other when confronted. The funny bits are even funnier, and the serious bits really get under your skin. What I love most about this film are the characters. And it's interesting that there is no real bad guy. Technically, Harry would be the bad guy, but you can also argue for his point of view. Ray - the main character. He's young, inexperienced and a very direct person. He says what's on his mind, no matter the consequences. He killed a little boy, and he's having a very hard time coping with that, on the verge of suicide. But in the end, he rediscovers the joy of life and decides that he doesn't want to die. We know he didn't mean to kill the boy, and we see his remorse, but still... he is a hit-man, he is a bad man - you can't deny that, but you like him, so you don't want him to die. Ken - Ray's mentor, so to speak. The older, wiser hit-man. He's much more cultivated and easy going and a very mild person in general, which seems odd for his line of work and that only makes him more interesting. He wants to give Ray a second chance because he believes that Ray can change and that he will redeem himself if he quits this line of work and saves the next little boy.Harry - the boss, perhaps the most interesting character of them all. I can't see him as a bad person. He's a fair man who sticks to his principles and actually cares about other people, which is clearly showed near the end where he's asking he pregnant hotel owner to step aside because being a nice person, he doesn't want to put her in harms way. Have you ever seen a hit-man do that before? I think it's amazing. He believes that you can't expect to kill a little boy and get away it. That makes sense. It's a terrible crime which you should be punished for. I really love the ambiguity of the characters and the depth they add to the film. It's hard to decide whose side you're on.Oh I could go on for ages about this. In Bruges is funny, heart breaking, violent, exciting, serious, clever, beautiful, and most important of all - it's deep. It really makes you think. It's rare to see a fun film with so much depth. I mean, has hit men ever been more human? This really is European film at its best!",

But that was all before I actually got the urge to watch this dare I say it \"masterpiece\".

This is the kind of film whose scenes have a way of sticking with you and in a way you keep remembering parts of the movie on daily bases. I was very very surprised, in a good way of course, by this movie. Its incredible to see how much can be done without sky-high budget, explosions, and Hollywood-y environment.

But I will sure as hell try.The first time I saw this movie, I was delighted. 8 out of 10! Entertaining, strong and funny. I was delighted at the originality, but still, there's not so much of it that the movie becomes only watchable for the specially interested. I am not that type of person after all. It got the basics down (and down hard) for what makes a good movie: A good intriguing introduction, a \"problem\" that needs solving(comes perhaps a bit late), characters you like and can sympathize with, a steady build-up/drama curve until the end, very welcoming visual display, camera work, a powerful finish, and magnificent music all the way. But this alone doesn't make it reach the very top. There are a few other movies that delivers that too. Somehow I liked it more than I was aware of at first, and so I had to watch it again (and again, and again).What puts this movie over the top for me, I think, is the incredibly entertaining, humorous, and mind puzzling dialogue that will make you think \"that would be so cool to actually say to someone in real life!\" or the kind of opposite \"what a horrible thing to say to someone\". The dialogue script for this movie is brilliant, and it invites emotions on so many levels. It took me several viewings to appreciate it at the level I do now (but please don't be scared off, this is still a kick as movie regardless of how many times you watch it! It's probably just me that's a bit slow).Along with the dialogue, the characters performing them is what makes this movie re-watchable - a trait not many movies have today in my opinion. They will bring up those emotions and that intrigue (and sell it to you), over and over again. And if that isn't good enough, did I mention magnificent music and imagery? Did I say humor? I believe it to more, but I can't put my finger on it. You cannot make a mistake by putting this on, and I am betting my entire integrity as someone with a often way too critical mind towards movies never having given out a 10 before, that this deserves so much more praise than it has gotten (and it has gotten quite a bit). I have my suspicions that the simple plot description of the movie makes people think they are gonna watch an action shooter, and the simple minded gets disappointed, which could explain the \"only\" 7,9 rating. So know this, while it has minor elements of action in it, this is not an action movie. It's a masterpiece of characters and drama/emotions, acting, integrity, humor and f**king inanimate objects, and if you have not seen it, you got yourself a gem to discover. This has been the go-to movie for me when I ask friends \"hey, have you seen this one?\", because it has against all odds escaped the radar of the major crowd. I leave you with this: I have not yet showed it to anyone who didn't directly thank me afterwards.",

It follows a pair of hit men named Ken and Ray who are hiding out in the Belgian town of Bruges after Ray accidentally murders a child during one of his jobs. I found this film pretty entertaining throughout, it had clever, witty dialogue which conveyed both characters very well. The characters themselves are very convincing and both very 3 dimensional, the relationship between them both is presented very well as it shows their closeness and shows their emotion despite having a seemingly emotionless job. I thought the dialogue and acting was extremely credible to Farrell as he perfectly conveys Ray's fragile state of mind and presents his character differently to how you'd expect. The story itself was pretty basic but well written and perhaps the only part of the film that let it down was the ending, which I was not fully satisfied with. I feel like it was a little unconvincing and unrealistic with there being a shootout in the middle of a film set and no one seems to take any action and prefers to carry on with their business! I think this was a bit of a silly sequence and although the fate of the characters was relatively appropriate, I still feel it wasn't authentic enough. This film was set in a beautiful location and when it isn't making you laugh or wince, it instils emotion into the viewer with its stunning soundtrack and appropriate cinematography. The cinematography was very revealing for the characters and shows off the setting of the film extremely well. It also intensifies the dialogue and importance of scenes. The editing of the narrative was quite clever and I liked how we found out what Ray had done after he sees two children walking with their parents. It was an appropriate link and therefore a good time to reveal Ray's actions.",

Emotionally high scenes are performed beautifully, and subtle conversations executed perfectly. Farrell certainly deserves credit for his cynical teen like attitude during sight seeing, whilst Gleeson takes on a fatherly figure.The writing and dialogue is rich, with frequent use of swearing and clever dark comedy. In Bruges has a vast variety of scenes, such as shoot-outs, drug use, and conversations of the afterlife. My Favorite Three scenes or actions are as followed: Farrell punching a woman after being threatened with a bottle. Farrell karate chopping a cocaine abusing midget. Farrell firing blanks into the face of a skin headed puff.In Bruges has many elements, romance, violence, comedy and action.It is a great film due mainly to the writing and of course, the acting.

However, Ray might not agree with that since he keeps describing this place as a xx hole, and that's how the story begins\u0085 Two professional killers in Bruges, with no one to kill and no mission to accomplish, which gives the most desperate condition you can imagine for a professional killer. The scenario is full of black humor that makes the story almost like a fairy tale, while there is obvious no happy ending of the story. The most ironic thing is their over reacted behavior toward the accidental killing of the little girl considering the jobs they do is about killing all the time. Somehow, it becomes unbearable when it comes to the little girl, for what? Maybe it's their remaining conscience or the so-called self-esteem. This is just weird to see such sentimental professional killers, but funny parts like Ken saved Ray from suicide the time he was supposed to kill him clearly described that all of them are not traditional killers, but with merciful heart.Colin Farrell's best achievement in acting, the lovely accent, incurably sentimental and great sense of humor made this extremely bizarre character, yet adorable! How strange that a professional killer appears so charming and compassionate, and even stranger is that we all buy it after he actually finished his first assassination. As to Brendan Gleeson, all the jokes and funny stuff wouldn't be so convincing if it's not for him, and the jumping scene, especially the jumping scene, is when he stands out in the movie and makes unforgettable impressions to the audiences. Last but not least, Ralf Fiennes plays his role like he always did, struggling between friendship and morality, not to mention his unshakable dignity for being a professional killer. There is just too much fun to watch all the chemistry and jokes they have made.The most touching scene is no doubt the time when Ken jumped off the tower to warn Ray about his danger, which made the most serious chapter of the story and leaves no debate about the reality. In other words, it just states that this is not joking for god's sake!",

I think the genre is clear, it's black comedy. There are so many scenes when you actually expect the dialogue to develop differently (or actually the plot itself) and it's just so naturally funny. This is a movie that has to be watched in the original language, because the Irish comments and sense of humour is in itself hilarious. I would say except for the last 15 minutes, when I thought it was all going a bit over the top (which is why I give 9 out of 10), this is a very inventive, original way of storytelling, an intriguing plot, with character development, beautiful shots of Bruges and the sense of humour is just very deep, very fine, superb!",

            "content": "I remember getting really angry at an article in either Total Film or Empire that featured a list of films that were supposedly Quentin Tarantino ripoffs. As you can probably guess, In Bruges was on said list. Being of the opinion that In Bruges is better than any Tarantino movie (and significantly better than any one that isn't Inglorious Basterds) this really annoyed me. The list seemed to be based on the idea that if a movie features swearing, violence and a lot of dialogue then it must be a Tarantino-wannabe. That's stupid for a number of reasons, the main one of which being that swearing, violence and dialogue-heavy scripts were not invented by a guy whose first film came out in 1992. Another reason is that whilst Tarantino's films often seem so desperate to adhere to the boundaries they've set themselves, they often suffer as a result. Without these boundaries, In Bruges is a very different, and much better movie.Obviously it's funny. That doesn't need to be said. Look at literally any review of this movie and people will tell you how hilarious and quotable this movie is. I think one of the things that's most impressive though is how ballsy it is when it comes to rooting the characters in real emotion. Every character in the movie spends at least 95% of it's runtime being super depressed. In addition to this, half the scenes end on a depressing silence, rather than a witty punchline. The combination of these two elements, along with the obvious choices of music and setting, add up to a film that is evidently trying, and succeeding, to make the audience do more than laugh. It's an incredibly courageous move on the part of Martin McDonagh, a man who I'd name as the greatest writer living today. The trailers advertise In Bruges as some kind of wacky gangster comedy, but in fact it's something much more raw and deep than that, delving into much more complex themes than any other comedy I've seen.But that's not all. This is my second favourite movie of all-time so obviously I'm going to be enamoured with pretty much every frame of it. From the perfectly-maudlin intro to the script letting the jokes come naturally instead of forcing contrived situations down the viewers throat. In fact, another thing, I love the way that there's not a single bit of fat on the script. By this I mean that every single scene is intrinsic to a full understanding of the final scenes of the film, both in terms of understanding the plot and to a greater extent reading the thematic elements of the movie. Credit goes to the editors for this more than McDonagh, as the DVD shows around 30 minutes of deleted/extended scenes. I feel like In Bruges is a pretty much perfect movie, in that it's genuinely funny, smart, deep, imaginative, well-acted, and so many more things that I've forgotten to mention. So yeah, screw anyone who would even consider this to be in any way Tarantino-inspired.",

There were times when I was still laughing about a scene, when something more serious or moving happened to stop me dead in my tracks, and vice versa. But this didn't make it feel bitty as with poor editing, but quite a roller-coaster due to a sublime knack for timing. The dialogue was sharp, witty and at times poignant. Some of the conversations were just downright hilarious. Others so 'real', you knew you were listening to the work of a talented, perceptive writer. The acting was first rate throughout. Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell were outstanding (CF's performance should have his critics eating their words), yet I think the standard of the smaller roles really helped to take this film beyond a vehicle for the leads. Special mention to the hotel owner 'Natalie' (Elizabeth Berrington).The characterisation was spellbinding too. Just watch and see how subtly you're made to empathise with quite 'unsavoury' characters i.e., the skinhead 'puff' mugger, and how the leads, although so intellectually opposite, compliment each other and draw you in with their honesty, and even their morality.Even beautiful, dull Bruges, as a setting, is perfect.For me, it's one of those films that doesn't simply wash over you and rinse off. You absorb it, and are therefore touched by it. Brilliant!",

            "content": "I never actually knew who Martin McDonagh (The famous Irish playwright) was before I watched this movie,and i wondered more as i watched specially that the movie is well crafted on all aspects ( acting, directing, writing, camera motion),it seemed it belonged to someone experienced as its so original and on a high level of creativeness.Probably not so many films, were made in the city of \"Bruges\", one of the most beautiful cities I've ever seen in a movie, the idea of choosing \"Bruges\" a city that's unknown for a lot of people is brilliant itself, as \"Bruges\" is the main character, its also so beautiful, calm, and mysterious.The story of the movie revolves around \"Ray\" and \"Ken\", two hit men, who hide in \"Bruges\" after an almost successful job! \"Ray\" on his first job does something horrible, makes him feel guilty, which leads him think of death, what's after life.. heaven, hell and purgatory.. he wonders if these things really exist, and discusses that with \"Ken\".\"Ken\" is in some sort of a dilemma, when the boss \"Harry\" asks him to kill \"Ray\" because of what he has done. \"Ken\" has a strong relationship with \"Harry\", and on the other hand he believes that \"Ray\" deserves a second chance and might become a better person. Also, \"Harry\" the boss killed the guy who murdered Ken's wife, the wife that \"Ken\" truly loved.The whole idea of the strong bonds between the characters, no matter how are they vicious murderers, might not be so original, but the originality here lies in the amount of sacrifice, and the strong beliefs each of them carry, it also highlights how beliefs and values could be crucial at times, and the paradox in how those murderers can die for the sake of values and beliefsThe Movie discusses through the characters, how the decisions people take can affect their lives, and the way things get complicated because of what they believe in, \"Ken\" believes that \"Ray\" deserves a second chance, while \"Harry\" thinks that he should be killed for what he's done. The main character here which is \"Bruges\", declares an end for this struggle, having them all killed(we're left to wonder if Ray is actually dead or not) Martin McDonagh's theatrical sense, covered the movie gently with sardonicism , showing every race with significant trait or behavior; The Americans through out the movie are shown as kind of a funny stupid characters(the fat family & the dwarf), the Irish characters themselves are so arrogant, the people of Belgium were so strict and cold, the Jewish character \"Yuri\" is shown with the \"dumb dumb\" bullets & the \"Uzi\".The camera had the same sense too displaying \"Bruges\" with all of its mystery and darkness as they walked in the streets also ; *The shot were the dwarf was talking about the war between the blacks and the whites the camera shows us the 2 prostitutes which one of them was African and the other was a European blond, and the two of them doing drugs next to each other! *The other scene in which a dog looks in contempt to \"Rey\" because of what he has done.*\"Rey\" running while bleeding to the location of the dream sequence , meeting people with freaky masks, as an indication of him going to hell.The dialogue is also remarkable we discover a lot of how these two people view life, \"McDonagh\" made the dialogue so simple and yet deep, so spontaneous and funny as the characters are talking it was well employed to serve the movie, McDonagh never drifted in long or useless chitchat no matter how tempting it was to do that. Each character had its highly significant style of talking even secondary characters which reminds us of Quentin's style in dialogues. In an interview McDonagh said that it had some influence from Tarantino's style, but he said that he decided to take it somewhere deeper.You can't talk about all of this and neglect the awesome soundtrack by Carter Burwell, the movie might have been a little less brilliant if it wasn't for Burwell's music. Throughout the film we find the music describing feelings of guilt, sadness,fear and the intimidating beauty of the city of \"Bruges\". Burwell was there and ready for the shift, when the scenes got more fast and were full of action in the chase scene between \"Ray\" and \"Harry\".Mcdonagh is a great movie director, who for some reason his work in theater seems to be smoother than film making, although he said he always wanted to become a movie director, we need to see more of his works the coming years or i'll go crazy! The Movie is simply captivating the same way the city of \"Bruges\" is in-reality and in the movie that non of the characters came out of there and so did I!",

This film represents inner struggle within the main character as well as principles for all the characters and it all stems from the one action of killing a little boy. It culminates in a twisting, heroic, and tragic ending that is both sad but still satisfying and unique. This movie has so much depth within the characters and there actions but not in a way that makes it confusing or abstract for the viewer. Rather in a way that makes for an action filled and emotional ending to a sad, funny, and emotionally and visually enthralling piece of cinema.

In Bruges contains such dark, 'un-PC' humour, and is quite brutal at times, but this just adds to the charm of the movie. Although, it is safe to say, you will be shocked at some point watching this, regardless of how thick-skinned you are. I am actually surprised they were allowed to release this, but so happy they did. My only fault with this movie is the ending (I won't ruin it) as it was rather cruel, and some of the scenes involving gunshots are especially revealing and callous. The setting is beautiful, and the diverse mixture of characters (the man in the ticket booth, the fat Americans and the skinhead ex-boyfriend to name a few) make this a magnificent experience. I would say that this film is not for everyone. I, and everyone I know, loved it, but if you are easily offended, or squirm at the sight of blood, then stay away!",

He made the character interesting and believable. Brendan Gleeson wouldn't seem like an obvious choice to pair him up with but as they bounce Witticisms off each other the comedy is very funny. Ralp Fiennes cold icy character added another enjoyable dimension to the film.The dialog was excellent from start to finish.

I'm a wannabe filmmaker myself, and it makes me happy to see a new director come along and make a good movie! Oh yeah, you won an Oscar for Best Short film back in '04, didn't you? I haven't seen your short, but that's an awesome achievement. Maybe you can win another Oscar someday. Although, maybe winning an Oscar isn't the greatest achievement for some people, but I think it's a nice honor. After all, your film \"In Bruges\" made it on IMDb's Top 250! Now that is something to really be proud of! And I certainly will keep the film in my DVD collection for a long time!Bravo!The movie is suspenseful, it's emotional, it's intriguing, it's a little funny, it's memorable, and it's watchable. Not only all that, but it's nicely well-told and it has some depth, though not perfect. Well done, Martin McDonagh! I hope that you will have a successful career, just don't lose your touch by all means!8/10",

It isn't. Period. Pulp Fiction is regarded so highly because it was so unique and interesting for the time. This movie isn't trying to be Pulp Fiction. It doesn't stretch and grasp at the absurd the way a movie like Boondock Saints, which in the grand scheme loses points for trying so hard.This movie is full of laughs, violence that is surprising and makes you uncomfortable about what you just saw, and an ending comparable to a Shakespearean tragedy.Some of it is a little predictable but that predictability is offset by the few times when the film does manage to shock you.

Yes, it's difficult to pick a favorite from each genre even, let alone mix and match genre's an pick an ultimate winner from the whole pile.But I did say \"if a gun were put to my head\".. and a gun could be put to my head.. anytime, anywhere, sitting on a park bench in a children's playground even?Of all the movies I've seen (and I've seen lots in 50 plus years), this is the leanest. No fleshing out, no padding, every frame has a purpose, every word uttered has a meaning. I've viewed quite a few of my favorite movies more than once, and on repeated viewings there's always a scene or a line of dialogue I notice which could have been better, or omitted even. But not here, and I've seen this movie A LOT!I've read a review where the reviewer accuses the movie of being homophobic? RUBBISH! This movie treats everyone equally...Everyone get's hammered. Irish, English, Belgian, Dutch, American, Canadian, Homosexuals, Prostitutes, Hit-men, Midgets....EVERYONE! And if you treat everyone equally how can you be accused of being biased?Gleeson is perfection as always (could he be otherwise?), ditto Fiennes, but the one who pulled out all the stops and was brilliant throughout was Colin Farrell. I simply didn't think he had a performance as good as this in him... I was wrong.When I saw this movie initially, I thought to myself \"Martin McDonagh, you're in deep s**t\". I mean, how can he follow that up? Whatever comes next is bound to be inferior. And I was proved right.He should have just packed his bags, found a cave somewhere and became a hermit, because following In Bruges was going to prove impossible. Funnily enough, his brother had the same problem, following on from the excellent (but not in this league!) \"The Guard\" with that horrific mess that was \"Calvary\". So why is that? That \"2nd album\" syndrome? I have a theory... it's time. On the first film, they have loads of time.. time to write, rewrite, check and re-check, add bits, throw out bits over months, maybe years, until it's perfect (in their eyes at least). But then it comes out, and... and another idea has to be found, and a script, and the studio is putting pressure on, so corners are cut, and scripts aren't redrafted as they needed to be, and ..... and that's my theory anyway.But that's beside the point. This film is a cinematic masterpiece. If you haven't seen it...you just gotta! (unless you happen to be a gay, midget hit-man from Belgium of Irish/American and English/Canadian parentage.. then there's a chance you may be offended)",

            "content": "In Bruges is a truly wonderful film set in Belgium (... in Bruges), starring Colin Farrell, Ralph Fiennes, and one of the greatest performances from the past 5 years in cinema, from Brendan Gleeson. The plot in brief is two Irish assassins are sent to a hide out after a mission gone awry, with little or no idea of their objectives out in Belgium. After some 'sight-seeing', their boss gets in contact, and the whole dynamic of the film is shaken. As emotions of hate, self-loathing, and prevailing love and compassion become apparent, the film spirals into a grandiose 'Tarantino' esque encounter.The action takes awhile to come in, meaningfully fitted into the narrative, and unlike so many other modern day pictures, never needs to be excused for.There's plenty of gripping, intense, and highly emotional scenes, at it's apex felt in one of the most poignant moments of the past decade in film, involving Brendan Gleeson and a perfectly chosen track from the Dubliners. Whether it's the soundtrack or cast, this film has Celtic blood coursing through it's veins, and no matter how alien the surroundings are, this iconic scene couldn't have been more pertinent with regard to the over-arching theme. I may just have had a tear in my eye.And whether it's midgets in dream-like art house productions in the cobbled streets of Bruges, or fat snooty elephants, or 'Americans', walking up a narrow staircase, the dark humour is great, and will certainly satisfy those in hunger of satire amongst the morbidity bursting at the seams of the piece.For anyone who has seen Sexy Beast, Fiennes is the Ben Kingsley equivalent, the rabid mob boss with a blood-lust, but not without a conscience. This film is too clever to deal in the absolutes, 'Good vs Evil', of traditional Hollywood; the moral compass wavers throughout, and becomes a confrontation based on outlooks over complex subjects like retribution and punishment, grounded where no one is of the divine.The cinematography is breathtaking, and the whole plot feels very Shakespearean, as a modestly sized ensemble of characters are weaved into the film, always with a purpose.And perhaps most of all, i finally 'got' Colin Farrell.",

            "content": "In Bruges is a 2008 film directed and written by Oscar winner Martin McDonagh, and I don't know why this man has only directed 2 feature films. The movie follows two hit-man that are sent to Bruges by their boss to wait for further instructions after a hit gone wrong. Colin Farell plays 'Ray', a young and obnoxious hit-man who wants nothing more than to leave Bruges and never come back. Brendan Gleeson plays 'Ken', Ray's more older, experienced partner, who wants to take in the beauty of the city while they are there. Both of the characters play off of each other in a hilarious way, and it adds to the black comedy of the movie. Ralph Finnes especially shines, even though he does not show up until 75% into the film. That's my brief rundown, now for spoiler time!WARNING: \"DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IN BRUGES\" spoilers below I especially enjoyed the third act of the film, and thought it was a fantastic climax. The ending showed death, redemption, sacrifice, humor, and most importantly dreams. It wasn't until a second watch that I started to notice the theme of dreams recurring in the film. The character Chloe said that the movie that was being shot with the midgets was a dream sequence, and when Harry asked ken on the phone what Ray thought of Bruges, Ken said Ray called it dream-like, and the finale of the film takes place in this dream sequence movie set. I am probably reading too much into this, but maybe was Rays test to redeem himself and he succeeded, sending him to heaven at the end of the film, and the dream messages were telling us that the entire film is a dream, and it is only god testing Ray or something. (Keep in mind this is coming from and atheist) I think this is a cool theory to think of, even though it is probably all a stupid coincidence.This movie has probably one of the best screenplays of recent times. the dialog between the main two characters can be hilarious, dramatic, and even sad when it needs to be. The writer and director, Martin McDonagh has a great way of grabbing the audience, and not letting go, his great work on this film allows the audience to feel completely immersed in the film. Don't even take my word for it, Roger Ebert gave it 4 stars, and called it a fantastic character study. The movie is on Netflix instant, and VOD. If you're looking for a funny, thrilling sad, heartwarming good time definitely check out In Bruges.",

There was certainly a lot of scenes I will not forget anytime soon. Colin portrayed the naivety of his character quite convincingly and made an usually unlikable person quite fun to watch.

            "content": "This was an enjoyable film; funny, well acted and entertaining. I thought Colin Farrel delivered his best performance in a long time, but perhaps this is because he was playing himself in real life! Fiennes was solid but not spectacular, though the cold, menacing look from his eyes is fantastically creepy. It is prob. for this reason he makes such a great villain in the Harry Potter series. For me though, Brendan Gleeson stole the show - very convincing and believable performance as the Gangster with a heart of Gold. Great juxtaposition for a Character and Gleeson excellently pulls it off.Great writing/funny lines from Writer/Director Martin M. I think there are many of us who could identify with the bored tourist in Europe who is dragged kicking and screaming to yet another cultural exhibit. I worried the film may have suffered somewhat of an identity crisis, trying to be a comedy and drama at the same time. I think the film ultimately succeeds, but there were times where I felt the narrative and energy waned.This was particularly the case with Midget/Dwarf scenes; sure a few wise cracks about Midgets (Done many times before, and I must admit this falls into the category of bottom barrel comedy) and the pace of the film would not have suffered. What distracted me and I felt entirely irrelevant to the film was listening to the racist, drunken banter spoken by the Dwarf. This scene was awkward and seemed thrown in.I recognize one intent of the scene was to show how Farrel, tormented by past actions, turns down what would typically be a great hedonistic evening for his character. However, I critique the dialog and creative choices made for the Dwarf. Why attempt to be esoteric for the sake of being esoteric? It failed. This was a very weak point of the film; it distracted the audience. Strange given that MM was formerly a playwright.Nonetheless, this film gets a 7/10 for me. No doubt there could have been more thought in making the supporting characters dynamic and interesting.",

He had a role just like he had in Woody Allen's \"Cassandra's dream\": a man who regrets what he did and is therefore depressed. I believe he succeeded in playing this role in both movies. Bruges was the right choice as city. I couldn't decide if the city was more attractive or Farrell. The beautiful homes and buildings, peaceful roads and magnificent canals of this historical city affected me. Storyline was very good: two hit men come to Bruges to lie low after botched job.

This Academy nominated movie which gave 'Milk' a run for the money in the Original Screenplay category is an enticing experience of life and death struggle with British patented dark comic proportions and a hidden emotional roller-coaster in all. The dialogue between Ken and Ray is downright outrageous and mind blowing. Ray (Colin Farell) hates Bruges (Brugge in Belgium) even before he steps his foot out of the train while Ken (Brendan Gleeson) absolutely loves it. Ray ventures out feeling bored, we meet an assort of characters in the form of locals Eerik and Yuri, Canadian, American tourists, violent medieval art pieces, canals with boats, an American Dwarf actor, Dutch prostitutes and Chloe (Clemence Poesy), a girl who sells drugs on film sets. She gives him a respite from his dark haunting past, which eventually comes chasing him down, in the form of Harry (Ralph Fiennes), a boss of his and Ken's, when the latter not only failed to kill Ray, but also prevented him from committing suicide.

One hit-man, Ray (Farrell), is more for the party places and having a good time which means he isn't enjoying his time in Bruges. The other, Ken (Gleeson), really enjoys Bruges, and urges Ray to follow their bosses orders and lay low until they're told otherwise. But the story doesn't exactly kick into gear until Harry (Fiennes) comes to town. And explaining why he kicks it into gear would be giving too much away.So if you know me, you know that I'm not the biggest Colin Farrell fan. He hasn't impressed me, until now. He was very surprising. At first, I thought he was doing his typical Farrell thing, where he looks completely out of place regardless of where he is. But after 20 seconds, I really thought he did his job well. Not only did I enjoy his performance, but I am now looking forward to his performance in 'Seven Psychopaths'. As for the other leads in this movie, Gleeson and Fiennes, they both killed it for me. This makes me want to see 'The Guard' just for Gleeson's performance. And Fiennes, as always, just knocks every single line out of the park. Even in the simplest of dialogue, he made it seem so much more real. The man can act.And the one thing I had heard more than anything, was how surprisingly funny it is. And it kind of was, I mean I wasn't nearly peeing my pants or anything, but it was funny at times. But that totally blinded me for what I found even more surprising: the drama. These characters, Ray especially, were really deep and you could even sympathize with him. I found myself nearly cheering for the characters. There were also a surprising amount of moments where it was borderline sad. That was one thing I wasn't expecting from this kind of film, which means that when it pulled it off, it takes it up a couple of pegs. And yes, as you can see from the headline, I wasn't \"in love\" with this movie for the first 30-45. That's the time where it's just Gleeson and Farrell sight-seeing. There was some witty dialogue, but I thought that it would kick it into gear a little faster. I know it had to set up both its characters and story lines, but I can't help but complain that it was too slow in the early going of the movie. There were even some things that had nothing to do with the story at all. Farrell's love interest, despite being extremely hot, had no real point of being there. There was also the weird 2 minute spark between Gleeson and the co-owner of the hotel. But before you think that I didn't enjoy this movie, allow to talk about the last hour or so. I can't talk specifics because that would give too much away for a film that really relies on being able to take the story anywhere. But to give you a taste, this is where Fiennes finally appears (despite being mentioned and hearing his voice, he doesn't appear until the latter part). And as I said before, Fiennes really does knock it out of the park, which helps the second half of the film immensely. The intensity is pumped up, the real conflict isn't actually apparent until pretty late in the movie. But it all works and the film delivers one of the greatest third acts I've ever seen in a movie. Knowing that Martin McDonagh was playwrite before this big screen debut makes sense now, because there were parts where I thought, Man this feels like a play. But in conclusion, 'In Bruges' is a promising good time with a surprising amount of heartfelt moments. You won't be disappointed with this debut. {B+}",

She was a moot point in the movie and could've been played without any words being spoken at all and still would have come across the same way. The dwarf didn't go too gimmicky like movies usually portray them. However, the other characters were preformed beautifully. The writing was excellent sometimes almost tipping into cheesy. However, the acting brought it back from tipping over. It starts off a little too slow but slowly rolls into a more interesting film. The only flaw in the movie is that the rhythm feels more like a mini series more so than a movie.",

In a way it is comparable to say Pulp Fiction but the reason Pulp Fiction is sometimes funny is because of the absurdity of its violence, In Bruges combines hard hitting and sometimes heart wrenching violence with light-hearted humor. This is something not completely new but definitely something that has not explored widely. Colin Farrell does a terrific job in the film. I haven't seen in act so well since Tigerland in 2000. He plays a naive man named Ray lamented by the torment of a past mistake, who finds himself stuck in place which is perhaps worse than the Hell he has left behind, Bruges, a storybook town in Belgium. Brendan Gleeson as Ken takes a break from period piece movies and provides a conservative contrast to Farrell's stark Ray. Then there is Harry, a crime boss played to perfection by Ralph Fiennes who in my opinion should earn an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal. In the end In Bruges is mortality tale and a morality tale wrapped up in an often time hilarious and sometime brutal movie which serves to remind us all that good film-making comes first a foremost from a good script.",

The \"timeout\" pushes both to reflect on their lives and their work.Quick Take: Director Martin McDonagh does a remarkable job squeezing the most out of the location and the characters and manages to successfully craft a movie about assassins that focuses not on the action but on the people. All the actors, from the three male leads down to the supporting cast give spot-on performances that are just the right amount of dour, the right amount of sarcastic, and dark, and funny. This isn't an action movie, really. There is no twist, no whodunnit, no car chase sequence, no massive explosions. As such, it could come out dry to certain types of audiences. But it certainly shouldn't be missed by those with an open mind looking for a quality treat.Watch: If you like characters, one liners, sarcastic remarks, dark humor, off-beat, un-politically correct references. If you can live with it being stripped of adrenaline action scenes, you'll be rewarded with the fine performances of the actors and the director.Don't Watch: If the above-stated type of humor does not suit you and you are easily offended by certain kinds of remarks. I wouldn't recommend this to people like my mom who have short attention spans and have no appreciation for dialogue.

Very quick, and without writing a spoiler for you, you understand that the heroes of the movie are murderers. Brutal murderers. And then starts the stupidity of the movie, which is, and this is something i really hate, the fact that for some reason, you're suppose to like those murderers, and follow them through the movie as if they were saints. The director doesn't waste any known trick in the book to make sure that those murderers would seem likable, sensitive, funny, and even charming, and that the audience would fall in love with them, laugh with them, and cry for them. Why? Don't ask me, but let me tell you this: If only they were the brutal, unlikable, unfunny, and not at all the charming murderers that they really are, this movie would have probably worked. But as it is, it's no more than a bloody fake. Fake, fake, fake. Only in one scene they act, if only for a moment, as the real murderers that they are, and that's probably the best scene in the movie. I wonder... Who said that you have to fall in love with the heroes, any kind of heroes, in a movie, rather than excepting them for what they really are and having to deal with them in an honest way? Probably a fool. Other than that, this film is all about who is going to shoot who, when will someone shoot someone else, and how will one shoot the other, or in other words, a totally faked stupidity.

Martin Mcdonough seamlessly transitions from heavy subjects like child murder, and suicide, to goofs and gags and fat Americans. Several scenes are simultaneously heartbreaking and hilarious. There is also a masterful handling of reincorporation that is quite reminiscent of Hot Fuzz. There were several scenes in this movie that seemed to just be one-off jokes, but eventually affected the plot and characters in profound ways later on. The characters were all very distinct and fleshed out, and it's been a long time since I genuinely cared about fictional people so much. The plot is absolutely one hundred percent pitch perfect. It is meticulously balanced on the scale of unpredictability and poetic beauty. On the far left of this scale lies something like Game of Thrones, where main characters are killed left and right with no satisfying conclusion to their arch. On the far right is Star Wars, where the story is neat and satisfying, but anyone who has seen a movie in their life knows exactly what will happen ten minutes in. In Bruges is somehow far left and far right at the same time. The plot twists and turns in unexpected ways, and it doesn't stop until the very end. Yet, in the midst of this untidy anarchistic plot, a clear lesson and meaning still arises.",

It's rare that a film can come along and affect you in a way that makes you laugh and makes you really connect with the struggles of the lead characters. This is exactly what In Bruges does, and it does it with such an unpretentious and dramatic flair. You really connect with each character and see why Colin Farell is perfect in his role, as the man child Ray, his tempo, comedic timing and childishness never overshadow his true feelings and he brings a lot of heart into it. Brendan Gleeson is mesmerizing as he plays an old hit-man facing a very hard decision and you really see him go back and forth. Ralph Fiennes almost steals the show as the foul mouthed, cold but with a human side mob boss. The supporting artists are even cast well, from the dwarf Jimmy, to the hotel owner Marie, to the arms dealer Yuri, they each play their parts believably and at the same time hilariously. However the star here is the screenplay, what effortlessly balances some of the juvenile humor and the hard hitting questions the movie arises. One of my favorite movies.",

What captured my interest the most though, and really the ultimate reason why I've been able to rewatch this Film over and over the years is thanks to a uniquely captured interplay found inside the story. A propelling force created by and between the films lovable antihero character creations. I saw something that's hard to describe. It's really something I think you can just feel as your laugh continuously catches you off guard throughout. There's a lot of great humor in honesty and I think the actors captured the essence intended by the writing. They nailed it. It almost feels like improvisation. It reaches an organic level bordering on legendary.They've captured something here. The unexpected candidacy resulted in comedy that caught me off guard in all the right ways. The assassin with a conscience, an empathetic chord striking and interest attracting element that will hook you in and keep you coming back for more. The writing I found here is the benchmark renting, then leasing, now owning space in the back of my mind. There I think it will remain as a constant personal aspiration of my own. Ever even coming close to writing like this as an end result, much less post production, would be something I could really consider a true accomplishment. A great dark comedy great if not the greatest. One of my favorite movies of all time based upon shear creativity. Do I think it's under rated.

Photography is great, the shots (mostly at night) of the city really set the mood from the very first scene as is the music.\nProbably one of the very best movie in the very tricky genre of Dark comedy as some dialogues can be truly hilarious even though the set up is dark, almost desperate at time.\nA must see although it might not be for everyone.\nBest movie from McDonnagh so far in my opinion, yes even better than Three Bilboards.. even though I loved it.

Add in Ralph Fiennes cursing in a way that would make a sailor blush, the love interest Chloe, her idiot ex, the gun dealer overly obsessed with dark corners ;), and the on-again-off-again friendship with a \"little person\", you have an intriguing and thoroughly entertaining movie, smartly written dialogue, and it is well worth your time. I still get choked up while the Irish dirge is playing during the bell tower scene.",

And this movie gives you a heck of a lot to make it your favourite.Martin McDonagh is a man who carved out a successful career for himself in theatre, about a decade ago I think. And by the end of the movie it's pretty clear that it's written by a playwright. Every scene had fantastic dialogue. Within this dialogue the characters are built up for funny characters to real people in a real situation. And every scene has a purpose in the film as a whole, each scene contributing to the ending, overall plot line, character, and overall tone simultaneously.This is why this film is fantastic- it seems to do everything at the same time, and not a single line is wasted. It all leads up to this perfect ending, to this brilliant climax that leaves you deliciously satisfied. Even the score and backdrop photography were fantastic, the score giving this slightly haunting and disenchanted feel, and the photography complementing it perfectly.All in all, there's a reason why it's got 8.1, although it perhaps deserves a rating just a little higher.",

            "content": "When 'In Bruges' was first released, I originally didn't pay much attention to it, dismissing it (in a very stereotypical and naive fashion) as an under-the-radar box-office flop. How wrong I was.The film begins by gradually introducing the film's setting and characters; Ray, here played by Colin Farrell, initially has very little idea where or what Bruges is, or what its culture and traditions entail. Therefore this helps the audience to identify with his character, in that he is struggling to understand his current situation and how to act. Ken (Brendan Gleeson) seems to take the role of mentor at first, however as the film progresses so does his relationship with Ray, finally arriving at a point where they have a mutual friendship.To me this film seemed to be more of an action film sprinkled with dark and comic humour, rather than a comedy film with action fitted in; the second half of the film seems to reflect the former. The tone of the film shifts entirely, transforming what was once a rather light-hearted exploration of the city and the characters, into a dark, relentlessly-paced endgame.The acting from both Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson is spot-on, not only settling into their characters well but humanising them; Farrell plays the role of lovable rogue Ray who's busy wrestling with his conscience, whilst Gleeson portrays a middle-aged, world-weary hit-man who'd rather hand in his gun in favour of sightseeing and Belgian culture. A star turn from Ralph Fiennes also, as a truly intimidating Harry Waters.Overall, a very well-written and superbly handled piece of film-making, proving once more that quality movies do not have to include bucket-loads of CGI effects and over-the-top shootouts and car chases to impress.",

The pacing is sublime, throughout the whole runtime you are being led on by the story that feels like eating a well baked pie from your grandmother. Cinematography is very pleasing, its subtle, yet loud, its right in all of the right ways; the cinematography heavily uses the scenery of Bruges and the characters to create a unique story. The acting on the other hand from Colin Farrell, as well as Brendan Gleeson is extremely addicting, even though the majority of the film is focused on the both of them. Not even to mention the writing is pretty decent with some fun banter that kept the story going and brought humor fourth.I think movies like this need to be paid more attention to for upcoming film-makers, between the dialogue, cinematography, writing, pacing, there is so much that can be taken notice of.

A subtle, soft piano score follows throughout the film while the suspense scenes offer great orchestration. I must agree with many that although Gleeson shines with warmth and Farrell proves himself worthy of acting, Fiennes steals the show as the incredibly rude, witty and deadly antagonist.

The idea of hit men with ethics could have become tiring pretty quickly, but the director makes it work for the whole movie.My only grip is the incredible violence in the last five minutes. The story line probably required the killing that occurs but why did it have to be incredibly graphic? I have no idea why directors feel the need to spray blood all over the screen in a final climax.

It was such a surprise that the comedy is dark , very dark, and not what we use to see these days , what it lacks is a good argument.A little more reflecting the euro life would've been a bonus, we don't have the chance of seeing much socialist Europe with an overvalued currency , excellent health care system and that.

Firstly this film is a brilliant study of the interaction between two very different characters, superbly played by Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell (Brendan Gleeson's Ken is by far the better character). Two characters who are united by only one thing - they are killers, even being Irish doesn't bring them closer to each other. However, as the plot develops they do bond and become almost like a comfortable married couple. This forms the most and best part of the film.Now for the negative - Ralph Fiennes!! I couldn't believe how such a superb actor could have got his character so wrong. He was wooden, the acting was false and the character was so unbelievable. I heard the voice on the phone and thought that was awful - but when I saw who it was I was shocked. Instead of being a believable tough gangland boss, he came over as a poor parody of brick top in Snatch.Overall excellent, acting well two out of three ain't bad!!",

A story about a young man who kills people for money and is drowning in remorse after accidentally killing a little boy. His partner, always by his side, and both of them in the beautiful city of Bruges to hide after his awful act. It could go somewhere, right? It didn't. Positive aspects: I genuinely liked the way it was filmed, it almost had this \"french\" ambiance to it. I don't know how to explain it. It feels like those artsy films with a deep and sad ending. Kind of like 500 days of summer. I was even able to enjoy the humour poorly mixed between the awful way the plot developed. And again, the city is absolutely beautiful and both me and my boyfriend are now obsessed with traveling there.Negative aspects: Right when the \"bad guy\" travels to Bruges, it goes completely nuts. The film just stops being realistic. Seriously, Ken is shot, once in the foot, once in the neck, jumps off a tower, doesn't die, and is still able to tell Ray that the bad guy is coming for him. Also, no one hears any shot, specially that one when Harry is on that small boat and the guy who's piloting the boat doesn't even react to it. And don't get me started on the ending.

Martin McDonagh, the writer and director, interestingly enough did not start off his screenplay with the plot of two hit-men hiding out after a \"rookie\" messes up royally. McDonagh started off with the idea to film something, anything in Bruges; discovering that although it may be beautiful to go to which Ken's character portrays (and certainly after watching this movie for the seventh time tonight, I definitely want to) or it may be the most boring place on Earth, as Ray's character portrays. Colin Farrell was absolutely phenomenal in this movie, and certainly his best film. He himself confessed that it was the best script he has ever read. He portrayed his character so well, that even though on paper he is a hit-man who accidentally kills a little six year old boy, you grow to love and sympathize for. All of the characters in this film were perfect for their roles, and I loved all of them (minus the \"dim-dims\" guy). This is definitely not your typical gangster movie, and truthfully the first time I watched this I didn't even necessarily view them as gangsters. It shows that even the most inhumane of jobs can contain some of the most innocent and confused people. And, there is something about the ending which I fall in love with every time I watch it. It is an ending that is not at all happy but again shows some hope and honor in the world. From a dark comedy to a grim end, this movie is unique, hilarious, and very very well done.",

The bells in that tower are irreplaceable antiques. Also, the steps to the tower are too narrow to allow well-padded people, like one of the lead actors, to be able to climb them easily.

Read quite a few reviews complaining about soundtrack not in sync with the story line, but for me that was mesmerizing, What can be better than the 'On Raglan Road' by 'The Dubliners' for that particular scene - \"DO NOT WANT TO PUT SPOILERS HERE\", But that scene stole the show. Colin Farrell - His best performance so far, Quirky yet emotional. Brendan Gleeson - Brilliant would be an understatement for his portrayal of Ken. Ralph Fiennes - I now cannot imagine anyone as Harry but him. The Message he leaves with the Motel Owner \"Receptionist\" was hilariously accusing.STARS of the movie.Story - Have never seen any movie with such a story this for me has raised the bar for defining good movies , completely off shelf, fresh, though its a movie on hit men it will make you feel sympathetic towards all characters in the movie though they have Grey shades.Bruges - The film is extensively shot in Bruges, a medieval city beautifully shot, excellent cinematography. I just fell in love with this place, And now Bruges is on my dream list of places to visit.Dialogues - Quick, quirky, funny and yet speaks a lot about integrity and humanity. Harry's role stands out, 'You got to stick with your principles'Soundtrack - Excellent tracks through out the movie absolutely fitting scores matching the beautiful city, and again On Raglan Road with that particular scene gives me goose bumps. Its a must watch movie. A complete fresh way of looking at things. Though it has a serious story line the way it has been written makes it funny yet emotional, quirky yet soothing, Cruel yet sympathetic. DO NOT MISS THIS...Also like to share this poem On Raglan Road by Patrick Kavanagh Sung by The Dubliners...On Raglan Road on an autumn day I met her first and knew That her dark hair would weave a snare that I might one day rue; I saw the danger, yet I walked along the enchanted way, And I said, let grief be a fallen leaf at the dawning of the day. On Grafton Street in November we tripped lightly along the ledge Of the deep ravine where can be seen the worth of passion's pledge, The Queen of Hearts still making tarts and I not making hay - O I loved too much and by such and such is happiness thrown away. I gave her gifts of the mind I gave her the secret sign that's known To the artists who have known the true gods of sound and stone And word and tint. I did not stint for I gave her poems to say. With her own name there and her own dark hair like clouds over fields of May On a quiet street where old ghosts meet I see her walking now Away from me so hurriedly my reason must allow That I had wooed not as I should a creature made of clay - When the angel woos the clay he'd lose his wings at the dawn of day.Heaven \"In Bruges\"",

            "content": "In Bruges is without a doubt one of, if not my favourite comedy film. McDonagh's masterful crafting of a film that is so hilarious, yet explores such dark themes makes this a very enjoyable watch.The plot centres around two hitmen sheltering in the Belgian town of Bruges after a job gone wrong. Over the course of the film, they must get to grips with life in Bruges and all it has to offer, whilst awaiting instructions from their boss.The plot is driven by the exceptional performances delivered by Colin Firth and Brendan Gleeson. The clash of personalities between the two, in particular their views on their 'holiday' in Bruges, makes for hilarious viewing. The threatening presence of Ralph Fiennes as their boss in the background adds a (comedic) menace to their situation. It is the stellar acting from these three, as well as great performances from the supporting cast, such as Clemence Poesy, that make this such a good film.The humour is not for everyone. It is far from politically correct and is very encompassing in who it could offend. But it is the way it is presented, and the characters who deliver it, that makes the film so unique. The tragic, almost pathetic situation the two hitmen are faced with, as they reflect on their lives, represents this best. It brings up numerous deeper issues, the value of life and death, guilt, principles.This is a film that very much fits into the category of serious comedy. It makes you really think about life, whilst laughing yourself half to death. The cinematography, tone and music all play their part in making Bruges what it is. A humorous look at some of the lowest depths a person can reach and the decisions they make whilst there.",

Also Colin Farrell could well of survived so you could cut back from 1994 time to 2014 time. This time Ray could be working for another gangster and this time he has got to go back to Bruges to kill someone else.

            "review_title": "the irony! oh gosh the irony was what made it!",
            "content": "So I watched In Bruges last night. From the very opening of the film, Colin Farrell's voice over informs us he's a hit-man. Now, this bit of information didn't turn me off the story, but a part of me wondered just how much more this film could offer to the many hit-man parodies.Well, after viewing the entire film, I'm not sure if In Bruges added anything expediential new to the hit-man genre, but I'll be damned if it wasn't smart, funny, incredibly witty with its irony, and just all around great! In Bruges's goal isn't to add a brand new take on hit-man movies (at parts it plays on some of the same strategies as Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), but it still has its very original voice and execution. I think what made this film stand out so much for me was it's brilliance in irony! The screenwriter, Martin McDonagh (and director) knew exactly what he wanted to do, and more important, knew what the audience thought he was going to do\u0097therefore, twisting the story into many unpredictable moments. And further, he was able to build up these amazingly funny and oddly morally-compelling situations for his characters. Like when watching the Ocean 11/12/13 movies, where you know the cast is pretty much just having one big party while filming; In Bruges's story makes it seem like McDonagh had his own little writing-party\u0097deciding never to restrict himself when challenging his characters' morals (and always doing so in very amusing fashions) and constantly trying to make us guess \"where to next?\" I would love to go deeper into many ironic scenes, but I'm afraid that would make the film less rewarding for those who haven't seen it (and if you have seen it, I'm sure you already know what I'm talking about).Aside from all the compliments I want to keep giving this film, I do have one beef. It's one of those beefs that you let slide because the movie as a whole is just so well done, however, I feel I should bring it up briefly\u0097perhaps somebody can clear it up for me. The only issue I had had to do with Brendan Gleeson's character, Ken. It's never really explained just why Ken gets so attached to Ray (Colin Farrell). We know the governing reason of why he feels sorry for him (and we know why Ray hates himself); however, within the actions of the film we find out that while Ray is very new to the hit-man occupation, Ken has been in the business for awhile now. Because this is the case, I feel like Ken would have had to encounter moral dilemmas like the main one in this film before. Yet, he reacts very differently during this moral-dilemma, but I never understood why this time was so different. What was it that he saw in Ray that was so moving? Surely, he's seen reactions like Ray's before within this kind of profession.Nevertheless, my small complaint is nothing to dwell on, strictly because everything else is so well executed and fun. Each actor gives a pitch-perfect performance; owning their moments when needing to and bowing down to their partners when needing too. (And Fiennes scene when smashing the phone had me on the floor\u0085sorry, I just really wanted to give that scene a shot out)",

Twin Peaks but weirder.\nLet me recall upon my humble role. In the end there was a scene on the plaza with a kind of weird characters from a Jeroen Bosch scene. Who is from Holland, but thats is only a detail.This was way beyond the Game of Thrones Era when small peopLe became popular. Even as my role was called Apron Man, it had nothing to do with the Marvel Legacy. Spiderman and other cweirdos, fasten your seatbelts and eat my shorts... you never know when I ll do my come back.Anyways, I understand why you have cut the scene out.

I can't recall any movie that is this much literary, while also being a Tarantino-like \"homage to B action movies\".It's about two hit men, but they hardly seem to be inclined to any killing, and actually they hardly kill anyone during the entire movie. They are quite nice persons, with empathy, remorse, even some romantic sentiments - yes, the whole story is quite absurd, but endlessly entertaining. The actual plot hardly matters, every scene is worthy by itself, if only for the unsurpassable acting (C. Farrell, R. Fiennes, etc.). Not incidentally, the cinematography is also close to perfection.I gave it \"only\" 9/10 because there are some little clich\u00e9s here and there, but it is a slight disappointment only in comparison to this otherwise very unique movie.If you have seen and enjoyed this movie, see also McDonagh's earlier short movie, \"Six Shooter\" (2005) (strange but fun), and definitely see his second feature movie, \"Seven Psychopaths\" (2012), which is quite similar to \"In Bruges\" in nature.",

Nothing that is introduced is irrelevant to the whole story - including the dwarf and the film set.

The fulcrum around which the whole movie revolves - the death of a young boy during a hit, is introduced subtly. And then the acting is equally superb. Everyone excels.

Yet the locals seem to have a french accent... except for Marie and the ticket man (they're both Flemish actors) Yuri is a Waloon actor (Walonie is the other part of Belgium, where people speak french), Erik is from Brussels (also speaks French) and Chlo\u00e9 \u00eds from France...",

This movie entertains and places you in another anxious context that will surprise you. I believe this was not just well directed entertainment but well written as well. I'd go action, comedy and crime... Sometimes talent such as Colin Farrell rises to new levels because of his fellow cast. I think this is what went on In Bruges.

So when I saw the movie I got a little annoyed.Because I always want to give movies a chance to watch, I watched the whole movie. As a result a had a terrible night. I felt very dumb, because I didn't understand it. Was it meant funny? Was it a cultural sort of movie for the intellectual? I didn't get it at all. The whole story-line was so boring to me. There wasn't some tension or reason to feel excited too. I also think directors have their own ways to entertain via film. There are so many sorts of entertainment, but I can't nail this one. It's not just that I want to burn it down, but I don't think it's funny, or entertaining, or a good written story.In the end the the subject got me thinking about a bigger perspective: Is this a cultural thing? Do I have to see the movie twice to get the point? Or am I infected to much with the Hollywood- poison that my expectations couldn't see this coming?At last, I won't say the acting was bad, because I think it wasn't. I think Farrell and Fiennes are great actors. That's not the case. But this movie a comedy? Seriously? This review is full of questions*(? *). So finally I'm going to ask: I know you're not about to explain jokes, but somebody will? For me?",

Some others a depressive and harmless as a kitty person.I can't stop watching every face he shows, every dialogue he gives, and action he performs.Indeed, he must have a 10-stars performance award.Brendan Gleeson has always played wise,experienced men.He showed fascinated and interested by the culture and architecture of Bruges throughout the movie and tried to influence his partner as well. Seen as a sad and sometimes boring person by him.Ralph Fiennes really looked irritated(not to mention pis... off) in this one, and he is really suitable for that part.To sum up, I highly recommend this movie If you want to have a great time of fun and a hilarious experience.",

'You've got to stick to your principles'.2. Importance of being frank and honest about yourselves: No hypocrisy. No-one lies about their profession, even the prostitute. The dwarf rejects Ken's compliment about his 'girlfriend'.3. How two people in the same profession can be so different: Ken and Ray are interested in completely different things.Ken in tourism and Ray in midgets.4. How biases can affect your life negatively: Ray was so biased against the city even before visiting that he couldn't enjoy the sights. Similarly the American tourists were so biased against ken (because rob had called them elephants) that they didn't heed to his advice not to visit the bell-tower and the guy had a heart-attack.5. Importance of not imposing one's beliefs on others: Scene in church between Ken and Ray where ken is super-excited about the church's artifact but Ray just says 'Do i have to (see it)?'.6. Actions have consequences: Ray has to get off the train for beating the Canadian.7. People like the bell-tower attendant are everywhere e.g. in government organizations.

Great direction, brilliant cinematography and some amazing work from the lead actors make the movie a delight to watch, something you're not gonna regret after you are done with it.The movie uncovers as a slow touristic dedication to the canal-based city of Bruges, unraveling it's medieval architecture, old buildings and sort of sombre milieu and gently turns out into a dark thriller, something you would never expect from it. The chemistry between Farrell and Gleeson gives comic color to the first half from which the movie grows to become even more shadier with the advent of Ralph Fiennes who is funny in his own evil way.Contrary to what a lot of people say, I really liked the ending. It was definitely unexpected and probably a cleaner way to end a dark comedy like this one. I would suggest this to all kinds of audience.

Pretty amazing considering is was Irish/English playwright Martin McDonagh's first feature film. I'm not sure how he got such a great cast for this - having been relatively unknown in American Cinema until this point but Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell have incredible chemistry on camera. This being juxtaposed to the seldom sympathetic Ralph Fiennes.Although always risky to intertwine humor with such a heavy story, McDonagh spun a perfectly cerebral dark comedy revolving around a pair of hit men sent to Bruges after a hit gone badly. Although the film is quirky and subtly hilarious at times the strength of the film lies in the organic dialogue and powerful philosophical/psychological struggle of Colin Farrell's character. As he questions his value, his goodness, and the purpose all the while in Bruges.",

Along the way to facing questions such as why pregnant mothers and children deserve special protection that life-stained adults do not, you'll wade through drunken, drug-induced attempts to dampen the meaninglessness of life, together with attempts to connect in romance and pleasure, and even some admirable bravery. I thought the story was just too indulgent in terms of violence that it's legitimacy and storyline was somewhat undermined. Still, it does deliver a wake up call to those who are tempted to float, dreamlike through life without grounding themselves in First Things that genuinely are seeds of true meaningful, fulfilling life.",

The priest is obviously familiar with Harry. One can only wonder if that priest had molested young Harry, now intent on vengeance. The young boy accidentally shot, alone at night in a church, is too reminiscent of a situation that could lead to such molestation. Did Harry, now an assassination contractor, turn to crime because of the crisis he suffered as a young boy in church? I got the feeling that the screen writer is critical of the Church. The scene in the church in Bruges that owned a vessel containing some of Jesus's blood seemed critical of such beliefs, even satirical. How could a crusader find the blood of Jesus 1000 years after his death? In fairness, the satire is spread in all directions. Hit men have principles too. A hit-man who kills an innocent child must die. Harry thinks he has killed a child in his process of his vendetta. This \"child\" is actually a dwarf. None the less, Harry must be true to his own values and punishes himself.The film laughs at everyone and everything. It is truly entertaining, so it has it's own morality.",

But the film is also illuminated by Bruges itself, that doesn't directly affect the plot, but does drive the characters' emotions in the plot.

            "content": "A glorious display of guilt, absurdity, and violence.\n\nDirector Martin McDonagh's Irish black comedy In Bruges (2008) is a dark masterpiece about two hitmen sent off to hide out in the middle of nowhere in Europe, in Bruges, Belgium of all places. McDonagh ensures In Bruges feels like a tender slow burn that bursts to life with sudden violence to ensure you're still laughing before shooting you through the heart with his earnest sentiment of comradery and honor among thieves. In Bruges is one of the greatest films I've ever seen.\n\nI love how McDonagh's direction has the insane tone of Trainspotting with a plot that slowly builds into Mean Streets alongside Mikey and Nicky. I also appreciate all the references to Don't Look Now. McDonagh directs quiet reflective scenes that quickly become silly, yet retain the poignant dramatic heart of In Bruges. I honestly think In Bruges is Martin McDonagh's best film, superior to even Seven Psychopaths. It rivals his brother John Michael McDonagh's The Guard or Calvary. In Bruges is written by Martin McDonagh with an absolutely hilarious and wickedly irreverent Irish sense of humor that tears apart all in these vicious men's paths. \n\nEditor Jon Gregory keeps a relaxing pace for a calming vibe while Brendan and Colin are in Bruges. I like how erratic and chaotic the pace fastens up towards the shootout finale. Gregory's sharp cuts are beautiful and perfectly timed for the Irish comedy that makes In Bruges' 108 minutes feel brisk and alive with spirit. Eigil Bryld's cinematography shoots Bruges, Belgium with a solemn quiet beauty for all his wide shots of this apparently ancient medieval city. I love the fast panning shots during the chase sequences, but it's all the pretty medium and close-up shots so carefully framed that gripped me the most during In Bruges. It's a gorgeously shot and moodily lit picture.\n\nIrish actor Colin Farrell is hysterical as Ray the incompetent and irritable hitman. His general disagreeability and inner turmoil is fascinating as Farrell portrays Ray with real heart and total spitefulness. Colin Farrell is pure chaos within In Bruges and he's a blast to watch. \n\nIrish actor Brendan Gleeson is very subtle and understated as assassin Ken Daley. He just wants to enjoy sightseeing around Bruges and Colin Farrell simply won't let him have a pleasant vacation in hiding in Bruges. Gleeson is sublime as he must try to relax, while also coming to terms with being assigned to kill off his close friend. It's a great depiction of morality among the immoral and criminal.\n\nEnglish actor Ralph Fiennes is funny and menacing as the furiously raging mob boss Harry Waters. His swearing and yelling are as hilarious as his sudden violence. Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Ralph Fiennes all could have earned Oscars for In Bruges. Irish actor Ciar\u00e1n Hinds gets a touching cameo as Priest, whom Colin goes to a confessional to over his woes.\n\nFrench actress Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy is breathtaking and endearing as Chlo\u00eb Villette. Her femme fatale is increasingly interesting and dangerous with a strangely alluring warmth to her. She's playful and heartbreaking in equal grace. Dutch actress Thekla Reuten is very beautiful and charming as the nice hotel co-owner Marie. She's very sweet and patient with Gleeson and Farrell. English actress Anna Madeley is very blunt and stunning as the Dutch prostitute Denise. English actress Elizabeth Berrington is quite nice as Ralph Fiennes' concerned wife Denise.\n\nCanadian actor Jordan Prentice is very funny and sympathetic as the little person actor Jimmy with his drug addictions, racist rants, and preference to be called a dwarf. Belgian actor J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier is excellent as the absurd skinhead robber henchman Eirik. I found Belgian character actor Eric Godon super funny as the deadpan gun provider Yuri in Bruges. Lastly, Slovenian actor \u017deljko Ivanek gets a hilarious cameo as the disgruntled Canadian Man.\n\nProduction designer Michael Carlin creates quaint hotel sets in Bruges and helps Belgium look less depressing. Chris Lowe and Tim Browning's art direction is really lovely with shafts of lights shining down on characters during daylight and the darkness of night enshrouding these characters in oppressive shadows. Anna Lynch-Robinson's set decoration gives the hotel room a sparse bit of furniture and the bars and diners a cozy feel. I liked seeing all the antiques in the historical part of Bruges.\n\nComposer Carter Burwell's ominous and ponderous score features dainty piano melodies and thudding percussion that gives In Bruges a poignant dramatic flair and fearsome darkness. He keeps things light for the comedy scenes, but also finds that heartfelt sincerity for the suspenseful dramatic scenes. Sound designers Nigel Heath, James Harrison, Julian Slater, and Oliver Brierley let you hear footsteps echo on cobblestone paths and gunshots ring out in the still of the air. The pristine sound design is clear for voices and bullets alike.\n\nCostume designers Jany Temime and Laurent Guinci provide long overcoats and stylish contemporary Irish and Belgish outfits for McDonagh's excellent ensemble. Sharon Martin gives the guys a gritty look, while Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy looks adorable and glamorous.\n\nIn conclusion, In Bruges is a killer crime thriller and a fiercely funny comedy that's sure to startle with Martin McDonagh's outrageous writing.",

The plot unfolds out of character, which produces surprises as the drama thickens and the characters sketch themselves in. Deliciously playful dialogue overflows from the screen as McDonagh delights in creating some very entertaining banter. He also knows how to pick his cast. Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Ralph Fiennes all deliver some of their best work ever here, playing funny, soulful, and complex criminals. Bruges itself is a character here and it is exquisitely photographed and captured on screen. Everything builds to a moving, darkly comic, and bloody finale that is perfectly satisfying.

Case in point: In Bruges.  Two hitmen (Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson) are exiled to Bruges, Belgium after they are involved in a horribly botched murder.  Further problems arise when their temperamental crime boss (Ralph Fiennes) arrives in town to mete out justice.  It's a film about the perceptions of honor and principle among the dishonorable and unprincipled, but, more than anything else, it's about relationships.  The dialogue is crisp and intelligent.  The characters, despite their shortcomings, are well-developed.  The locale is beautifully filmed. The story constantly evolves and never fails to entertain.  Other than an excess of extreme close-ups, there's not much to dislike in In Bruges.",

Their banter back and forth is humorous, albeit very dark throughout. But this comes from the fantastic script, written by director Martin McDonagh. It's a very well put together dark comedy that isn't afraid to say what it says, which I admire, especially in today's society.\n\nPerformances were consistent from all. Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes are both classy experienced actors, as is Colin Farrell, but Farrell's performance was my particular favourite. You never know what he's going to do next, his persona is mysterious and hilarious, and his acting makes for great viewing.\n\nA really underrated film.

I think this movie has a lot of hilarious little pieces of dialogue that are so funny that make it worthwhile. I also think the movie is so unique and unpredictable at every turn that kept it engaging. The movie's main conflict kicks in after the first act and that was when I really started enjoying the movie. Nonetheless, I thought the two leads do a good job together and the movie has solid writing when it comes to humorous moments. The movie balances different tones fairly well which is something I've noticed is recurring in the films of Martin McDonagh, regardless of how much I like the film overall.",

The movie is not quite original with its premise but the way it executes the story is quite clever and at times unpredictable. It is a rather simplistic dark comedy with an intriguing setup, focused plot and engaging banter. There is a whirlwind of tones constantly in shift as these well-defined characters act out impulsively so but it remains mostly grounded and witty. The cast is fairly game through-out with three outstanding performances. Colin Farrell has never been better as the na\u00efve, child-like Ray. Brenden Gleeson is masterfully gruff yet gentle as Ken and Ralph Fiennes elevates the flick further with the vulgar yet principled foil that is Harry. I can't say that I consistently laughed through-out and the ending, while intentionally bittersweet and ironic, didn't land with me but the film as a whole is a memorable and surprisingly moving journey about forgiveness, a few Irish c--ts and a racist dwarf. - 8/10 (B+)",

But this movie borders the line between comedy and thriller really well with the Mcdonagh style first act is very comedic and then the tone darkens with the story's tension. And though there is some over-subtlety in the script, it doesn't really matter in the end because even without understanding that, you still have a really engaging story with great characters that you care about.

            "content": "This beautifully dark, satirical film is shocking, emotional, and simply hilarious. It follows two assassins, Ray, a brash rookie (Collin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson), a seasoned pro. When Ray botches his first murder, the two men escape from London to Bruges, Belgium. The city, as suggested in the title, is a very important aspect of the film. Director Martin McDonagh's camera lingers on the city and its people. The character's interactions with them only flesh out the city and the type of people who reside there  Bruges is the best preserved medieval city in the country, which plays as a clever juxtaposition to the fast paced, frantic story beats unfolding. It also plays as a sort of purgatory, in which the two assassins must wait for further judgement. McDonagh translates his strengths as a playwright to this film brilliantly. The directing never is too flashy, only cutting when it needs to. However, that does not mean there is no craft on display here. Unlike many other directors, especially young ones, it is commonplace to put the camera constantly in motion, trying to add the most impact to every shot. McDonagh understands that this is not always necessary. Most conversations play out in either two shots or over the shoulders. He understands when to use what shot and how each fits in with the story. Every shot contributes to the characterization and the story taking place, which is rare and refreshing. This simplistic approach to visual storytelling helps shift the focus from the directing to the writing, where McDonagh's theatre background really shines through. The two character's conversations reveal an astonishing amount about themselves and their psychologies. You will never find a more funny take on child murder and suicide than here. That does not mean it is insensitive, which it is not. There is as much empathy as there is humor. McDonagh clearly loves the characters he has created, slowing down, allowing us to understand them, so their actions never seem comprised. Even when they murder or try to commit suicide, you understand their motivations and their goals. This does not mean the film is without faults. For instance, it feels like the third act shifts in tone. Like many before it, the third act forgets to be a comedy to arrive at an emotional payoff. It becomes a generic action movie, and I find myself far less engaged. Also, the music is noticeably lacking. It has a lovely theme that plays throughout. However, its placement is odd. I couldn't quite figure out how it acts as a leitmotif, what ideas it is trying to represent. Other than this, there is very little music in the film, which seems like a missed opportunity. However, it's great philosophical themes and dark humor make up for any trip ups it makes. McDonagh is just beginning, and I personally can't wait for whatever he does next.",

            "content": "I was fortunate to see this before Martin McDonagh's huge success with Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) and I enjoyed it as a well written and acted little black comedy. It's nice to see Colin Farrell's talents be used in service of a good screenplay and Brendan Gleeson employs his usual shtick to elicit laughter. When Ralph Fiennes shows up things got really exciting and seeing him combine Amon Goeth from Schindler's List (1993) and M. Gustave from The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) was delightful. The film doesn't have much more than that to offer but it's an improvement on his short film Six Shooter (2004) and a sign of great things to come.\n\nCriminal partners Ray, Colin Farrell, who is young and inexperienced and who accidentally shot a boy on a previous mission and the hardened but compassionate Ken, Brendan Gleeson, are stationed in the small town of Bruges. Ray absolutely hates the town despite developing a relationship with local drug dealer Chloe, Clemence Poesy, while Ken is rather charmed by the idyllic setting. The two befriend a local dwarf and engage in entertaining hi-jinks as the assassination of Ray by crime boss Harry Waters, Ralph Fiennes, looms. \n\nThe film's screenplay deserved the accolades that it was nominated for because it's really the center of this film. The darkly witty moments in which we discover Chloe's ex-boyfriend may have coordinated an attack on Ray with her help and Harry's murder of a dwarf and subsequent guilt were enjoyable. The interplay between Farrell and Gleeson is joyous as Farrell plays the grumpy man-child and Gleeson plays the giddy older man to perfection. The screenplay adds emotional moments too but unlike in certain comedies, City Slickers (1991) for example, it doesn't feel mawkish or cloying when these shifts are made. I felt something for these characters by the end of the film and that was largely due to the deft, well-handled characterization found in McDonagh's screenplay.\n\nFiennes give the performance that deserves the most attention as he commands the screen with his intimidating presence but also plays on the comedic persona he would go on to strengthen. You understand that he takes his job very seriously and one of the most hilarious moments in the film is derived from him making a fatal decision based on one of his moral rules that ultimately turns out to help our heroes.\n\nThe cinematography should also be noted as the town of Bruges in northern Belgium, which I and I expect most other people where previously unaware of, was captured with stunning vivacity. It felt like a gritty, platonic Before Sunrise (1995) as we mainly focus on the dialogue and character development but come to appreciate the scenery as they familiarize themselves with local landmarks. The town is never made out to be something more than it is but we grow to love it as does Ray and appreciate the quaint little buildings and beautiful light in the afternoon. This can often be underappreciated in a film as people look at the acting or the way in which the film is shot instead of just taking in the experience and I felt that McDonagh paying attention to smaller details such as this enhanced the effect of the film.\n\nIf you want a great dark comedy I would recommend Withnail and I (1987) and To Die For (1995) because they reach heights that this film doesn't even aim for in terms of acrid humor. I laughed enough and was pleasantly surprised by the shock of Fiennes appearing, I knew so little going in, but I wouldn't call it one of my favorites and it probably would not come to mind if I was asked to recommend comedies. Another Farrell film, The Lobster (2015), achieves the balance between comedy, dark drama and romance far better and contains moments of such dread and elicits such uncomfortable laughter that you are constantly on your toes, as you should be. Were In Bruges to contain more of the moments of horror that are so deliciously nasty in Yorgos Lanthimos' work I would have appreciated it even more than I already did but alas it's just a very good black comedy.",

It's an enjoyable ride with two enjoyable characters who we really shouldn't enjoy as much as we do.

Ken's (Gleeson) reserved and contemplative posistion in the film comes to a heartbreaking and shockingly creative climax in the final scenes.

You really get the sense from Tarantino, though, that he at least *likes* the groups whose language he might offend - I don't get that from Martin McDonagh. It really just seems to be three straight white men doing things like asking midgets if they want to kill themselves because they're a midget.\nThe characters are very well fleshed out; good thing, because there's so much dialogue and so few actual characters. This makes the eventual climax legitimately pulse pounding and ultimately (mostly satisfying). Like I said, though, this movie is liable to turn a lot of people off with its misogynistic, racist, bigoted language, but if you're able to look past that, you will find a strong film.",

Bruges is a preserved medieval city in Belgium that's Gothic architecture and art shows the turmoil of heaven and hell on Earth.  Ken and Ray's personal histories are revealed, and we see how and why they ended up where they are.  Bruges' buildings, streets and waterways, and alcoves (don't forget the alcoves), are used effectively, showing us different parts of the town as the story progresses.  The characters travel through different parts of the city as it shifts from exhibition and majestic through architecture to present and modern through the people, both residents and transients.  City sites change as the characters' perceptions shifts from the prosaic to the artfully mythic.  Several characters intersect Ken and Ray's story providing intertwining subplots, including a third act shift, until the entire plot is straightened out in the end.   \nThe sparse comedy is sardonic, acerbic, and dark, which lets the characters be humorously insulting, though that may be an endearing Irish sentiment from an Irish director.

Outstanding performances from everybody involved, particularly Ralph Fiennes who gives his most unconventional (and best) to date are part of the reason this film works as well as it does; but it would be nothing without the truly stunning script by Writer/Director Martin McDonagh that provides for tear-jerks and belly laughs all at once.

He's matched wonderfully by Bendan Gleeson, who genuinely believes in Ray, despite his past, while Ralph Fiennes is hilarious as their short-tempered mob boss.  Behind the camera, writer/director Martin McDonagh crafts a truly original piece and you'll never sure where it's going.  What's remarkable is that the dramatic moments are gut-wrenching (Ray did do a bad thing) while the comedic moments hilarious (an argument over a suicidal man with his supposed assassin over who gets to kill him is brilliant).  Best of all, they fit together in the film perfectly and never feel out of place with each other. McDonagh also makes great use of the the Christmas holiday, as some pretty horrible stuff happens around the time humans should be sharing peace & joy.  Overall, one of the best & most original crime films in recent years, and since it takes place during Christmas, and awesome addition to the holiday film rotation.",

What a brilliantly hilarious film! I was genuinely taken aback at how much I laughed while watching this movie. It is a dark comedy, because there is some serious stuff going on throughout the film, but somehow that just made the humorous lines even funnier. The genius really comes in the way that these dangerous assassins go about life and talk about the serious things that come with their job in such a casual way. It also helps to add poignancy when one of them gets genuinely emotional when he talks about a particular event that happened while on the job. This adds gravitas to that event, so that we know even in their world this is a big deal. Colin Farrell is ridiculously charming and funny in the lead role, which is impressive because his character lacks a filter, so he could be seen as a total jerk. Brendan Gleeson is perfection as the best friend that everyone would love to have. Every moment he's on film I just want to relax and have a drink with him. Added to all this is the amazing Ralph Fiennes who is playing a character that is comedy gold, nearly every other word out of his mouth had me laughing out loud. I recognize that In Bruges has a very particular kind of humor (and some very serious things going on as well) so it won't appeal to all audiences. My recommendation would be to try watching it and if you don't find the first few scenes humorous, then just give up because it's not going to get better for you. I, personally, loved the film and can't wait to watch it again.",

He has to wait there with fellow assassin Brendan Gleesan and he'd much rather be anywhere else. Colin will soon discover that he's about to become a notable member of the community, but not for a reason that he wants. Not at all...\n\nBefore watching this film, I was told it would be a comedy. There were certainly many humorous scenes but this was all about the story. Whether our cast was exploring, contemplating the life of their favorite midget, going on a date or \"doing a job,\" there was always some notable event to speak of. There was never a dull moment as when we weren't laughing, we were either on the edge of our seat or sitting in disbelief. The plot of In Bruges was very old fashioned in some ways which will make it refreshing for a modern audience. They really don't make movies like this anymore.\n\nWas In Bruges everything I wanted it to be? No, but that's actually not a bad thing. In many ways it exceeded my expectations and not just those that I had before the movie started. My first expectations after the opening few scenes were that In Bruges would stick with a cliche irritating odd-couple vibe. I was so wrong and I'm very glad that I was. In Bruges did have a few flaws with some characters and their choices but nothing I can get into in this sort of review. This film had been recommended to me for some time and I'm glad I finally took the plunge. If you're in the mood for comedy, action or a great story, In Bruges will keep you entertained.",

I am so glad I was wrong because In Bruges is a true gem which delves into the motifs of guilt and hell/purgatory.\n\nWith the two main characters we have opposite sides of the personality - this has been said by McDonagh himself. There was a side of him which loved to sight-see (Ken) and the side that just wanted to have fun (Ray). From this we get a very cultured hit man as well as a moody young man itching to get the most out of life (drinking, meeting women, exploring).\n\nWhile I love Ray for his internal struggles, he is somewhat of a hard man to like; he is brutally honest, asks people whether they would kill themselves because of certain traits, and he calls people gay or retarded. But something has happened before the start of the story that makes him question his morality in the middle of the film and whether or not he should be punished for it.\n\nThis film seems somewhat influenced by Tarantino - at least for the dialogue aspect. It is not plot-based; it touches on pop culture references and includes lingo that make the characters seem more realistic or interesting than just characters. However, the problem is that it seems to try too hard at this.\n\nHowever, there are a good amount of funny conversations or situations in which the characters find themselves. Think Tarantino's dialogue meets an even darker humor, like the humor of the Coen brothers.\n\nOne plausibility factor I cannot stand, however, is that one character simply refuses to die. To avoid spoilers, I will just say he/she lives way longer than they should have, but this needs to happen to help the plot very late in the film.\n\nThe thing I love so much about this film is the ending monologue given by Ray (Colin Farrell's character), and the ambiguity behind what has happened to the character and whether this story should be considered a dark fantasy or a horrible reality. It is very enjoyable, and the themes are amazing!",

A-lister mains Colin Farrell Brendan Gleeson do an excellent job delivering their material.  The final third was brilliant, due largely to Ralph Fiennes's flawless performance as Harry, which needless to say steals the attention from our leads.  He just has an intensity in his eyes, and a great grasp of deadpan humor and psychotic nuance, that perfectly fit the complex nature of Harry's character.  Bruges takes on symbolic meaning as a purgatorial setting.  Essential viewing for fans of the Irish arts.",

The absolute greatest quality of this movie is its masterful mixture of dark and deep seriousness with thought-provoking, witty humor. Combining real and sincere meaning with lightheartedness is not easy to pull off, but by centering the plot around some profound ideas, the movie becomes a powerful synthesis of these opposing concepts.\nThe film is also quite poetic and thematic without being pretentious or convoluted. The humor does not distract from the serious aspects of the movie, and it does not merely serve as comic relief. Rather, it cleverly focuses the audience's attention on the main messages of the movie. The plot itself is interesting enough for a great movie. Although it gets just a bit improbable in the end, the story is interesting and smart enough to make up for this slight stretch of reality. \nOverall, the wonderful performances by Gleeson and Farrell, the engrossing story, and witty dark humor made this one of those great movies that left me breathless at the end--both because I was deeply captivated and because I had laughed so much.",

As a result, he and his partner are sent on a vacation to the Belgian city of Bruges by their boss, where a plot to have the hitman knocked off comes into play.\n\nIt's decidedly dark stuff to put comic elements around, but director Martin McDonagh does is so subtly and so tastefully that it never feels off colour. The charismatic cast, led by Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes, certainly help that aspect of the film along quite nicely.\n\nHowever, the film also takes some shocking twists and refuses at any point to fall into any predictable cliches. This movie will keep you watching for it's entire runtime, and is guaranteed to go down as a cult classic.",

He mixes dark humor in dialogue/banter with extreme violence and dramatic irony in a manner that for me surpasses even Tarantino. There are no wasted moments in this film, and the dichotomy between the breathtaking scenery and music with the stark, absurd violence is amazing. Bruges is a purgatory for Farrell's character Ray after he committed an unspeakable, accidental crime, while it is a vacation for his partner Ken. When the boss gives Ken the actual purpose of their visit, it becomes a bloodbath. I can't recommend this film highly enough, Mcdonagh got robbed for the Best Screenplay Oscar. Also check out McDonagh's other work, which includes Academy Award winner short film Six Shooter, and the more light hearted film Seven Psychopaths. He is famous as a playwright, and many of his play scripts are available online as well. Not to mention his brother John Michael McDonagh, who directed the hilarious film The Guard, and the upcoming Calvary.",

This is a dark comedy that you have to focus on because the jokes and lines are not fed to you with a spoon, like so many abysmal modern comedies.

            "content": "Winning Colin Farrell a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, In Bruges sounded like a worthwhile film to see.\n\nIn Bruges is a simple film. Its premise doesn't have too much to do or too many places to go, and so the focus of its importance rests on the skills of its screenplay and the talents of its cast.\nFor a black comedy, I didn't find In Bruges to be all that funny. I felt as if the film was a drama at heart and had a few comedic themes as well as some decent funny moments in the script, but as a whole there sikmply was not enough for me to really consider it to be a comedy as a whole. The balance between crime and black comedy isn't as successful as in director and writer Martin McDonagh's second feature Seven Psychopaths. While In Bruges may be a little bit more focused due to a smaller quantity of characters and features an even greater performance from Colin Farrell, it still doesn't find the same balance between comedy and crime that Seven Psychopaths was able to. I will admit that there were a few times when I laughed, but I hoped to laugh more and found that In Bruges simply wasn't as funny as it could have been.\nAnd also, although this didn't really bother me all that much, In Bruges felt more like a play than a film. I can understand it because Martin McDonagh is a popular Irish playwright, but for In Bruges it doesn't necessarily feel like he went to the distances to actually go into writing something of a different style. Due to maintaining the importance of its script and characters within the simple confines of its few locations, In Bruges doesn't seem to feel too much like a film. It is definitely an entertaining feature, but it didn't feel like it broke the ground of constantly feeling like a play and instead maintained the same feeling from start to finish without many surprises despite a $15 million budget.\nBut remaining within its constraints, Martin McDonagh manages to allow the cinematography to be the best it can and keep the intense mood of situations captured well as it ties into the atmosphere, and it captures the nice sights of the scenery in In Bruges all very well. So his direction is stylish enough, but above all the best thing he contributes to In Bruges is its screenplay. Writing in a fairly simple concept which he takes full advantage of as director, Martin McDonagh creates an impressive screenplay for In Bruges to benefit from due to the fact that it pitches dialogue which feels real and creates strong characters who talk about concept that make their mark as interesting. The screenplay constantly keeps In Bruges interesting and looks into the thoughts and feelings of its characters easily and well enough. Like many of his play scripts, Martin McDonagh manages to put all the focus on In Bruges where it most importantly lies which is in the area of the characters and the interesting things they have to say and discuss to and with each other, and it allows In Bruges to naturally develop into a strong and compelling feature which gives the cast a lot of strong material to work with.\nThe musical score is pretty intense in In Bruges because it keeps the feeling of the scenes consistently rich with intensity. The musical score has a memorable beat to it and helps the atmosphere of the film develop well over the course of its 107 minute running time.\nThe main thing that I found to be entertaining about In Bruges was the performance of Colin Farrell. Despite being an actor that has worked consistently in Hollywood for many years and articulating his voice well enough to disguise the fact that he is Irish, he takes a step back for In Bruges and lets both his natural voice and his best dramatic acting talents flourish. In one of the best performances of his career, Colin Farrell lets out all of the dramatic skills within him for the sake of Martin McDonagh's film, and the result is very effective because the fierce emotional intensity in Colin Farrell's performance makes him a perfect lead. Me manages to tenaciously grip the dramatic and character focused elements of the character Ray and he sinks into the dramatic depth of the lead with natural ease. In Bruges features Colin Farrell's most honest performance in years and it is one not held back by the commercialisation of big budget filmmaking but instead keeps its focus on the small scale material of Martin McDonagh's Academy Award nominated screenplay, and it proves to be just the right kind of material for him to be working with.\nBrendan Gleeson gives an effective supporting performance as well. Although he is known for a lot of performances which require a lot from him as a character actor, In Bruges simply demands his talents as a good actor which he doesn't fail to use. His tense and sharp line delivery in In Bruges becomes the source of an admirable performance and a strong chemistry which he shares with Colin Farrell. Brendan Gleeson consistently gives an effective supporting performance in In Bruges, and it helps the story move along well and develop naturally into being a compelling feature easily.\nRalph Fiennes supporting performance was a good one as well, and he manages to give a certain sophisticated rough edge to the dramatic nature of In Bruges which it serves to benefit from.\n\nSo while In Bruges isn't really as funny as you might hope and features a fairly basic story, it is well written and excellently acted well enough for it to be able to transcend most of the flaws that viewers may find in it, and the final product ends up being an intelligent and thrilling experience with Colin Farrell giving a powerful lead performance.",

The interactions between characters in this movie is one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard.  Even minor encounters with tourists or citizens just make you either die of laughter or cry your eyes out.  Quotable line after quotable line, this movie has so many of those.  Colin Farrell puts on one of his best performances as an actor.  He portrays many different emotions as a troubled man with a shady past, something that is hard to do as an actor.  He can laugh, he can cry, he can fight, he can do it all basically.  As good as Colin was, however, by far the best actor in this movie was by Brendan Gleeson.  His character was so funny, loyal, and so greatly-played that during every line he uttered you were filled with joy, during his comical scenes.  His emotional scenes, however, were a different story.  His comical scenes were great, but his emotional scenes were even better.  I'm not embarrassed to say that this is one of the best performances put on of all time.  The soundtrack is perfect.  Nothing more can be said.  The cinematography is incredible.  There were many beautiful shots of Bruges, Belgium, as well as the characters.  The action was great, as well, perfectly coinciding with the humorous outputs.  A film that everyone should truly see and experience.  It has to be seen to be believed.",

Farrell plays a charismatic assassin, which on the surface seems nothing out of the ordinary, but he retains enough self awareness and wit to poke fun at the secret gunman trope.

I'm pretty sure that the opening dialogue of the film contains more swear words than non-swear words but something in me decided to give it a chance.  The synopsis led me to believe that this was an action film and my false expectation could be the source of my disappointment.  Black comedies are not really my thing and I probably would have passed on this one had I done my research.  Viewing it as a serious film, the language and graphic violence are completely over the top and often unnecessary, but this film is anything but serious.  Even though I approached the film from the wrong perspective, I can still accurately comment on the acting.  Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleason have great chemistry and deliver the script well, but Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy kind of killed the momentum of the film.  Her character (and her performance) were bland, disinteresting, and distracted from the good performances of the other actors.  As far as its Oscar-nominated screenplay, it is difficult to discern where the nomination came from.  The story and twists were clever but the dialogue itself was rather trite.  It wasn't a bad script, but certainly not deserving of an Oscar nomination.  I don't recommend this film if you are not a fan of black comedies but, if it is your cup of tea, perhaps you will spot the genius that is eluding me.",

You're never taken out of the film when you change from dramatic to comedic or vice versa. One reason it works is because of the acting. Colin Farrell delivers one of his best performances I've seen. You really get to care about him and understand him. He delivers the comedic and dramatic very well. You believe his character and motivations. He also has great chemistry with Brendan Gleeson, and that's what drives the film. Most of the film involves them talking, so if they didn't work together, the film wouldn't work. Another thing that helps the film is the directing. The film looks very good. It's shot very well and is pleasing. There is also a very nice tone added by the directing. It's bright and breezy, for the most part. The film is also edited very well. Nothing is cut soon, and no shot lasts too long. This is one talented director. He is also one talented writer. As I said earlier, the comedy and drama are pitch perfect. They intermix so fluidly. The plot is also quite good. It never gets complicated, but is also never childish. The way it is written is fantastic. While \"Seven Psychopaths\" went a little to wink-wink with it's writing, this one feels natural. Things are set up earlier than they happen, but when they are set up, it doesn't feel like something's being set up. Nothing ever felt forced. I was surprised by how well written it was. This was a film I didn't expect to like this much. I expected to like it, but not love it. This isn't a film for you Michael Bay action lovers. This isn't a film here to entertain through action. This is a film here to entertain by great writing and characters. This is a film you must see if you like good writing and performances. I give it an A-",

            "content": "A tone of dark comedy is incredibly difficult to successfully realize on film, or any medium for that matter. Typically involving a nearly alchemical combination of atmosphere, realistic, nuanced characterizations, and ironic (often macabre, or bizarre) dialogue and situations, unsuccessful iterations can end up in the realm of self-parody, or sickening gratuity. That being said In Bruges walks this veritable tight rope with the grace of an English gentlemen (or perhaps a hit-man masquerading as one).\nThis comedy/thriller follows the exploits of two criminals Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) fresh off a job gone wrong as they hide out in Bruges, Belgium awaiting \"the bosses\" call. Ray is a young, hot-headed philistine who can't wait to leave Bruges and return to London. Ken is an aged veteran of the business who at this point in his life seems interested in enjoying the finer things(as much as any career criminal has the ability to). The juxtaposition of hardened criminals and a town of sleepy Medieval tourist attractions creates an interesting fish-out-of-water element that the helps drive the story. In fact, the town of Bruges becomes a character itself as Ray and Ken circle it's landmarks throughout the story, returning to previously visited places at critical moments. In addition, the choice of Bruges as the story's primary location, creates a sense of small-town claustrophobia which adds focus to the proceedings.\n\n            The film benefits from the odd-couple relationship between the two main characters, and their respective views on Belgian culture and culture in general create a quite funny, but wisely underplayed comedic rhythm. The keenly observed nuances, and non-sequiturs in the film's dialogue generate some of the film's funniest moments as subtle behaviors and affectations are placed under a magnifying glass with great comic effect. One would expect writing of this caliber from respected Irish playwright Martin Mcdonagh(his play the Pillowman contains hints of this film's idiosyncratic nature), but unlike some films written and directed by playwrights this feature doesn't suffer from an overly \"stagey\" feel. There are some well-placed visual flourishes throughout, especially during the closing sequence. The action sequences are deftly handled giving the film a sense of reality that allows the both the comedy and drama to have more impact.\n\n            The acting is excellent, with Collin Farrell really showing his range of abilities in a role that requires complete dedication to both the dramatic and comedic moments. It probably helps too that he's speaking in his natural Irish dialect giving him a greater ability to focus on his performance, although with dialogue this sharp it would take a concerted effort on his part to derail the project. The dependably superb Brendan Gleeson lives up to his reputation here, providing a lifeline of empathy throughout a sometimes grim cast of characters. His resolute but human expressions and weighted, burdened performance assist in spurring this film to greater heights, and also greater accessibility. \n            \n            However, Ralph Fiennes in a turn as the short-tempered crime boss definitely steals the show with his appearance. He attacks lines of vicious dialogue with a frenetic glee that is a force to behold. American audiences might be surprised he has more to offer the world than his roles in Schindler's List and Harry Potter. I won't spoil the details of his arc, but suffice it to say that I guess there is honor amongst thieves.  The roles of the supporting characters are also well-acted if perhaps slightly underdeveloped(although we get a stark insight into dwarf racial relations). The women, while definitely not given a significant chunk of screen time, each have more than one dimension to their respective characters, and that's something of an achievement in a film with so much testosterone running through it.\n\n            The plot isn't the most complex thing out there, nor does it try to be, but it never loses it's way in this menagerie of slightly odd characters; and it has more than enough twists and turns to keep the viewer engaged in the main players and their plight. The trailer completely misrepresents this film as a rather generic 90's style action thriller, a marketing decision I'm sure, made in an attempt to reach that untapped goldmine of a market: teenage boys. Those looking for something along those lines might not be disappointed, as there are enough thriller/action elements in it to keep them distracted; but this film has much more going for it than that if open up to it, and let yourself fall into it's loping, absurdist rhythm.",

            "content": "*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN DRIVE SEAL*\n\n\nPlaywright McDonaugh's debut feature, In Bruges, works only up to a point as a crime comedy (however considering up to what point is quite remarkable), featuring a supporting cast ranging from quirky Euro-trash and plain old jolly eccentrics. But as a moral drama, it's almost as top of the pops one could ask for. The trailer didn't make it seem as such, then again it is hard to express the kind of conundrum that the main characters get themselves into while also appealing to a base of fans that love quip-type one liners (i.e. \"You're a bunch of bleeping elephants!\" or \"If I was retarded, or grew up on a farm, Bruges would impress me, but I didn't, so I'm not impressed.\") \n\nWhen In Bruges is at its best- and until its self-consciously symbolic touches in the last five minutes it usually is at its \"Best\" whatever that means- it expresses what I love seeing in films about career criminals: the total inner turmoil of what was done coming back to haunt the person. If it's true that no good deed goes unpunished, the same would probably go for bad deeds in the world of In Bruges, where the atmosphere of the practically medieval city is, the character Ken observes, like \"a fairytale\", and a sharp contrast to the dark side pervading Ken, Ray, and Harry.\n\nThe basic thrust of the plot is that Ray (half wise-ass womanizer and half half-suicidal played by Farrell) did a job back in London, a murder, which went horribly wrong in just one misstep (I won't reveal it here, though I should, except to say that it's one of those cardinal rules career criminals/hit men have to stick to), and so he and the older, less cynical Ken (Gleeson, who seems to be one of the most honest looking types in the character actor world, a spot-on casting choice), are sent to Bruges to receive more instructions. But those instructions, sent by the easily angered Harry (Ralph Fiennes, doing almost a hilarious imitation of Kingskey in Sexy Beast), aren't followed through, and then some manner of chaos ensues.\n\nHere and there McDonaugh takes what appears to be a lackadaisical attitude to the characters in this otherwise tense and uncertain fatalistic situation, as if an odd-matched comic duo are in a place one likes and one only can stand for mocking midgets (scuse me, dwarfs) in movie-making and hitting on the one hot girl in all of Bruges. But it's such a strange form that McDonaugh is working with here, with its mix of tones that it suddenly feels, in the context of the slightly bizarre and chilling circumstances, truthful. It goes without saying the cast helps give the material a boost, and that McDonaugh doesn't throw too many out-of-left-field curve balls with the plot. If he does, it's not of the sort we know we're usually hitting in this kind of crime story loaded with gallows humor and Catholic redemption mini-saga.\n\nIn short, if I were a bloke in Britain or a fella in Dublin, or a dupe in Bruges, as a writer this is the kind of stuff I'd immediately try to go for. It's smart, serious, mature genre work that relies on just enough blood-shed and violence and trauma to haunt its audience proper, and do its duty to supply another batch of wonderfully off-kilter 'comedy' scenes for fans of British gangster flicks. That this is nowhere near as shallow as a Ritchie pic goes without saying.",

Whilst in Bruges, Ray is struggling to deal with the guilt of what happened in London, yet still having enough time to comment on the state of the architecture, the tourists and a particular dwarf.\n\nIn Bruges is an interesting take on the life of a hitman, with much of the film consumed with these two burly guys trolling aimlessly around Bruges. The city becomes a running joke throughout the film, with both men frustrated with the lack of information from back home and being stuck with each other for a prolonged period of time. Colin Farrell is back to something of his best as he portrays a man consumed with paranoia and frustration, giving a highly believable performance. Brendan Gleeson is also on good form as the interplay between the two lead actors creates moments of great comedy.\n\nWhat makes this film more than just great acting performances is the great script. Martin McDonagh produces dialogue worthy of Tarantino in this quick and snappy comedy-drama. He creates comedy that looks so easy with his main characters spending much of the film simply walking around Bruges.\n\nAn hugely entertaining comedy but strongly based in its dialogue.\n\nJ.Henderson\n\n7.5/10.",

The dialogue is superb, brilliantly funny often & gut-wrenchingly poignant & emotional when needed. Colin Farrell puts in a truly remarkable performance opposite yet another brilliant turn from Brendon Gleeson. This film literally has it all, wonderful set-pieces, two fully rounded characters you actually care about, great scenery and a brutal undercurrent of dark comedy.

After a messy hit in London, Ray and Ken are forced to go lay low in Bruges, Belgium, as they nervously wait to hear from their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes). Whilst in Bruges, Ray is struggling to deal with the guilt of what happened in London, yet still having enough time to comment on the state of the architecture, the tourists and a particular dwarf.\n\nIn Bruges is an interesting take on the life of a hitman, with much of the film consumed with these two burly guys trolling aimlessly around Bruges. The city becomes a running joke throughout the film, with both men frustrated with the lack of information from back home and being stuck with each other for a prolonged period of time. Colin Farrell is back to something of his best as he portrays a man consumed with paranoia and frustration, giving a highly believable performance. Brendan Gleeson is also on good form as the interplay between the two lead actors creates moments of great comedy.\n\nWhat makes this film more than just great acting performances is the great script. Martin McDonagh produces dialogue worthy of Tarantino in this quick and snappy comedy-drama. He creates comedy that looks so easy with his main characters spending much of the film simply walking around Bruges.\n\nAn hugely entertaining comedy but strongly based in its dialogue.\n\nJ.Henderson\n\n7.5/10.",

Ok, first off, the one reason I avoided this movie for so long was Mr. Collin Farrell. I don't like him. He's overhyped Meh Street, just off Average Boulevard. Well, those days are over, the guy has talent, it just wasn't fully utilized til now. I think I feel the same way bout him as I do bout Nick Cage. Anyways, about the movie. This is a slow burn crime drama, complete with dark comedy, depression, and tense and emotional scenes. It's also the feature debut for director/writer Martin McDonagh. This guy is gonna go places, fast. Well, maybe not fast, might not see his next movie surface til 2016 haha, he's slow but awesome. Farrell plays opposite Brendan Gleeson. Gleeson needs to start taking more lead roles rather than supporting, cuz he's brilliant. (Most of you know him as Mad Eye Moody from 'arry Potter, but he's also had mini roles in Braveheart, 28 Days Later, Troy, A.I., and Gangs Of New York.) Don't worry, I won't give anything away: two hit men have to hide out in Bruges, Belgium. That's it. O, and their boss is Ralph Fiennes and he plays Harry. Yes, Voldemort is Harry *explodes mind*. Besides this being just plain cool, it's also riddled with a great score and some artsy camerawork. And did I mention it takes place 'in fuggin Bruges!' Hmm, I could've sworn I did. All that being said, it's a flawless, low budget sleeper hit. Now on to McDonagh's new one, 7 Psychopaths!",

            "content": "THIS IS A MASTERPIECE.\r\n\r\nThe two greatest cult films of all time (in my opinion) are The Big Lebowski and this, In Bruges, an incredibly well-acted, ingeniously plotted, and fantastically written film that I cannot fucking recommend enough. It is spellbinding. But I'm on a rant right now, so let's go through this tour de force of film step by step.\r\n\r\nIn Bruges is the story of a hitman named Ray (Colin Farrell) who, while carrying out his first hit, accidentally shoots a little boy in the head. His boss Harry (Ralph Feinnes) sends him to the quaint little fairytale town of Bruges (it's in Belgium) with Ken (Brendan Gleeson), a fellow hitman. This simple and elegant premise lays the groundwork for the best and most realistic dialogue ever put on film, and I mean that literally-- Everyone acts just how you would expect them to in this film.\r\n\r\nFirst we have Ray, played to the fucking HILT by Farrell, whose complex persona totally makes the film. \"I killed a little boy, Ken!\" This one accident makes it clear to him that he really isn't cut out to be a hitman, and he goes into a downward spiral of tourist-punching, cocaine-snorting, and eventually suicidal despair. It's an amazing thing to watch. Farrell's facial expressions are utterly befitting to the character. I still have no idea how he does that thing with his eyebrows. \r\n\r\nThen we have Ken, who is just as complex as Ray, but doesn't happen to have a suicidal pall hanging over him. After arriving in Bruges (SPOILER ALERT), he is told by Harry to kill Ray, and is about to go through with it-- but stops him from killing himself instead. It's whimsical and amazing. Everybody wants Ray dead, including Ray himself, but somehow he is the only one who manages to make it through the film. And by the way, Ken's death is on my list of Most Unexpected Movie Deaths.\r\n\r\nHarry is frightening and consistently pissed off, but that makes him almost a comic relief. Besides coining the unforgettable phrase \"YOU'RE AN INANIMATE FUCKING OBJECT!!!\", he also brings a strange persona to the table. Yes, he's a mob boss (of some kind, it's never specified... and never necessary), but he also appreciates quaint little towns, and believes that anyone who kills a little boy should die. \r\n\r\nIt's tragic, profound, and fucking funny as fuck. A few scenes stand out as the best-scripted: In one, Harry has left a phone message with the woman who runs Ken's hotel, and she delivers it to him. Characteristically, it is filled with Henry's endless swear words. Ken tries to articulate an apology. Here's how it goes:\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry about that message, the man who left it, he's... well... he's a bit of a...\"\r\n\"A cock?\"\r\n\"Yes, he's a bit of a cock.\"\r\n\r\nJust little things like that make this movie cross the line between funny and ingenious. He doesn't want to use anything that could remotely be construed as a swear word around this woman, but she goes ahead and fills in the blanks for him. It's great shit.\r\n\r\nBut then again, you really can't read stuff like this on a screen and get the full depth of it-- you have to fucking see the movie, complete with Oscar-level acting and elaborate production design. Altogether an incredible feat of a film that blends tragedy and comedy to create the greatest black comedy of the 21st century. Prepare to be blown away like a midget in a courtyard (Spoilers! Oops).",

Colin Farrell plays Ray, a hitman new to the job who is sent to the Belgian city of Bruges with his older, more experienced partner, Ken (Brendan Gleeson). Ray wholly dislikes the city, while Ken is rather impressed by it. Soon however, their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), reveals further, more sinister details on why he sent them there and new instructions to be carried out. Tourists (many of which they correctly and incorrectly assume are Americans, medieval buildings, boating canals, and Belgian film crews are the sites the two guns for hire are surrounded by and find themselves immersed in, all to their eventual (if not previous) displease. Coupled with a pleasantly complex soundtrack from Carter Burwell, the long-time music collaborator of the Coen Brothers, and brisk, bloody action, the movie succeeds at being entertaining and wittily off-kilter in dealing with the standard dealings of the genre.",

I can't think of many other movies that can rack up the laughs and put you as close to tears as this one does. \r\n\r\nEverything about In Bruges is great. From the dialog, to the actors, to the directing, there isn't a single thing for me to find and not like. And that's coming from someone who hates Colin Farrel to the core. I can't stand anything about the guy, but his performance in this movie is enough to get a little respect from me. Brendan Gleeson is also fantastic, but the true great actor out of this movie is Ralph Fiennes, who is absolutely hilarious in every possible way. A lot of the best quotes come from him, like the classic \"You're and inanimate (expletive) object!\" or his response to seeing an Uzi on Yuri's table. Just thinking about some of his lines makes me crack up.\r\n\r\nIn what was a pretty decent year in film, 2008 delivered the likes of The Dark Knight, Slumdog Millionaire, Benjamin Button, and Frost/Nixon, but the true highlight of the year was the endlessly clever and masterfully made In Bruges.",

In all of the film's success at being strangely depressing and monotone whilst somehow being funny and scary at the same time it is easily the most original British gangster movie since Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. This is the rare piece of weird, smart and unpredictable filmmaking energy that brings more to the genre it belongs with than the average expectations. The perfect example of that is a Colin Farrell performance that isn't dull and two dimensional but rather brilliant and genuinely interesting. Through every minute of the film his hilariously deadpan fish out of water chemistry with Brendan Gleeson results in a brilliant pair of crime thriller leads. The directing is as creative and sensitive as you might have expected considering McDonagh won an Oscar for his short film \"Six Shooter\" and his keen eye for fleshing out the locations are no exception. Personally I loved the slow pace that he decided to go with, he proves that zany one liners and stupidly electrifying direction don't always have to be part of what makes a fun and entertaining thriller. This is solid filmmaking and one of the most understated films i've seen in a good while. The gloomy depressed tone of the film magnetises perfectly with original and weirdly upbeat black humour so much that I forgot it was a crime drama and not an Edgar Wright-esque dark comedy. In Bruges is indiscreetly violent to fantastic dramatic effect, there's vast amounts of broad and memorable scenes of truly nail biting tension, and not once does the film give out a single hint at where any of it is going. It's somehow an \"of the moment\" film but concurrently grips you throughout it's seemingly short lasting duration. It's still at the top of my list for the biggest surprises of 2008. McDonagh's latest flick Seven Psychopaths will have to be pretty damn flawless to appear superior, at least in my eyes.",

On the phone line is Harry (Ralph Fiennes) who is updating the two on the situation, as he is their employer he keeps them informed for when they can return to England.\rThe film takes a twisted yet hilarious look at what is right in front of you in an unorthodox way, the humour, when you think it is finished, keeps on rolling out the obscene remarks and jokes. The highlights of the film come from the realistic and situational approach. It offers very different insights into certain film scenarios,such as shoot outs and the typical bad guy. The film turns most of these on their head and offers this perhaps generational approach, like how grown up films should perhaps become.\rBrendan Gleeson is quite the calm and relaxed gentle giant of the show, is demeanour counteracts the energetic one of Farrell, whose character continuously spits out his distaste for being in Bruges and how he finds and sees everyrhing in a homosexual manner, the politest way to say it.\rIn terms of the tone, it never settles for second best, when it wants to tell a very funny joke are put across a hilarious situation, it does so without holding and punches, but when it wants to put a message of despair and emotion, it again delivers the goods without fail, showing the capabilities that Martin McDonagh possesses in story-telling but also reaching out to the audience. Many moment this film will indeed make you laugh in hysterics, but the quieter and closer moments will bring back down to reality.\rAn excellent and varied film with a taste for all sorts of genres, giving different nods to previous films and also promoting a witty script and some powerful performances.",

For example in the mediocre 2013 film The Family all of the jokes that I laughed out loud at were reasonably upbeat or dark but not black. This can be found in many other black  (I might start renaming them bleak just for literal accuracy) comedies like Thank You For Smoking, The Men Who Stare At Goats and Fargo.\rIn Bruges is an exception it has a mix of black and upbeat jokes and all of them are hilarious. Whether there about dwarves, elephants, gay beers or cupboards. Every second is hysterical. But every second is also very exciting, somehow I was even interested when Ray and Ken were discussing who's allowed to shoot themselves. Even classics like The Naked Gun and Office Space get a bit slow moving in places, this doesn't.\rThat was a great achievement and surprised me, but the most amazing thing about the writing and direction of In Bruges is that somehow Martin McDonagh makes the viewer care about the characters. Colin Farrell is a child murderer and should be one of the least likable little  in movie history. Yet somehow I was constantly rooting for him in the last 30 minutes and almost cried when he was talking to his dying partner in crime. Ralph Fiennes character Harry is even worse! And I was almost crying for him too! Hell I was almost crying at the death of a cocaine snorting, prostitute client  midget. Never would you expect to find a black comedy about murder and Belgium more emotional than The Green Mile and Marley and Me put together. It totally took me by surprise.\rIn Bruges is definitely one of my favorite movies of the last decade and extremely entertaining, I strongly recommend it as long as you are prepared for the amazing overuse of the word ",

The Story: Two hitmen are sent to Bruges in order to hide out... An expected call from the boss though, results in unexpected orders, for an otherwise expected outcome. It's kind of a character study in that there's a significant amount of time learning what makes these characters tick, the problem is, that (on first viewing at least) there's not much too the characters... Ray feels guilty for his past and spends most of the film trying to figure out if he deserves to live. Ken, mesmerized by the wonderland that is Bruges, finds himself worried about his friend, taking it upon himself to save his partners soul. Conflicted by the moral issues that surround his current situation and job... And than there's Harry. The boss. He's a villain that you know deep down inside you can't hate because he makes a valid point, one must pay for their own actions, accidental or not. He's not evil, though he's not nice either, he's not good but he's not bad, and you're not going to be rooting for him. The Cast: Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Ralph Fiennes... Colin Farrell is Ray, guilt stricken by a hit gone terribly awry. He gives a good performance as he's eternally conflicted, he's not a man, but he feels deeply ashamed of himself for his past actions, so doesn't that mean that he should be forgiven? Or is he hopeless because he's done the unthinkable? Solid performance from start to finish. Brendan Gleeson is Ken, stuck between a rock and a hard place hit his partner or save his soul, giving him a second chance? Arguably the best performance in the film. Ralph Fiennes is Harry, a firm believer that some actions deserve certain consequences no matter what the circumstance. You know he has a heart and you know that on some level he is in fact right, but you're wishing he's wrong the entire time. Great performance, but not his best. Probably the first time that a trailer has truly influenced my score... There's no disagreeing that the trailer is about as misleading as you can possibly get. The trailer has you believing that Guy Ritchie has some competition. It's fast, it's clever, it's stylish, it's funny, and it's full of quirky or offbeat characters... The film itself is slowpaced, sometimes predictable and nowhere near as complex as you're expecting, as the quirky characters often add little to nothing to the story... I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt, I only watched it once expecting a fast paced Snatch type film, really hoping to see another Guy Ritchie on the horizon... The second time around I'm sure it will be immensely better.",

For all the un-PC humor in \"In Bruges\", perhaps the funniest thing about this lively film is the tacit agreement between filmmaker and audience that the dead clergyman be forgotten. We're judging Ray solely on how he reacts to the second body. \"In Bruges\" cons the audience into feeling sorry for a man who had recently shot a man of God in cold blood. If there is such a thing as honor among hitmen, Ray is no hitman(as Ken pointed out), because he has no honor, which precludes his occupation and the occupational hazards that go with it. Ken was wrong about Ray. He withholds a key tidbit of information from Harry(Ralph Fiennes) at the end of \"In Bruges\" which would've brought honor to his mentor(Ken).

Colin Farrell'In Bruges' is a deliberately paced, slow-burning, and at times, uninteresting comedy. Filled with characters that I did not seem to care for, and a plot that made the film feel at least two times longer than it should have. Colin Farrell plays an Irish hitman named Ray, whose order was to originally kill a priest, but he accidentally killed a young boy while during his task.  He, and his mentor, Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are sent to Bruges to wait for their next task and instructions. Ken seems to love the city and plans to go sightseeing, but Ray feels indifferent, and at times, is very cynical about the whole thing. Their employer, Harry (Ralph Fiennes) is furious and wants Ken to kill Ray, after coming to the conclusion that Ray killing a child is unforgivable. The movie, directed by Martin McDonagh, has its fair share of some well-thought out scenes, and is crafted the best that it can. However, I found myself to be uninterested in any of the characters and/or events that occur throughout this film. It got very little laughs from me. Colin Farrell is excellent as the sometimes nervous character, Ray, and he shares some excellent screen-time with his co-star, Brendan Gleeson, but ultimately, these great performances weren't enough to keep me invested. It's a mechanical and manufactured comedy, filled with some uplift, but the run-time drags and things escalate towards the third act, but it was too late for me, as whatever interest I had in the movie, was already gone.

Ray, still haunted by the bloodshed in London, hates the place, while Ken, even as he keeps a fatherly eye on Ray's often profanely funny exploits, finds his mind and soul being expanded by the beauty and serenity of the city. But the longer they stay waiting for Harry's call, the more surreal their experience becomes, as they find themselves in weird encounters with locals, tourists, violent medieval art, a dwarf American actor shooting a European art film, Dutch prostitutes, and a potential romance for Ray in the form of Chloe, who may have some dark secrets of her own.  And when the call from Harry does finally come, Ken and Ray's vacation becomes a life-and-death struggle of darkly comic proportions and surprisingly emotional consequences.
